HEADLINE: U.S. Contests Europe's Ban On Some Food 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration filed suit today at the World Trade Organization to force Europe to lift its ban on genetically modified food, a move that was postponed earlier this year by the debate on Iraq.
 The suit will further heighten trans-Atlantic trade tensions after several recent rulings against the United States in cases brought by Europe at the W.T.O. over United States steel tariffs and tax shelters for overseas corporations. 
 The administration was backed by the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and other senior Republican and Democratic lawmakers who have been promoting the lawsuit for months. American farmers have led the complaints, saying they have invested in the technology needed to raise genetically modified crops only to see one of the biggest markets -- Europe -- closed to their products. 
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said the administration had run out of patience waiting for the European Union to lift what he called a five-year-old moratorium that blocked several hundred million dollars of American exports into Europe. Worse, he said, European attitudes were spreading unfounded fears in the developing world, where the need is greatest for the increased yield of genetically modified crops.
"In developing countries, these crops can spell the difference between life and death," he said. "The human cost of rejecting this new technology is enormous."
Mr. Hastert estimated that American farmers lost $300 million in corn exports each year because of the European policy toward genetically modified food and animal feed.
"There's no question in my mind that the European Union's protectionist, discriminatory trade policies are costing American agriculture and our nation's economy hundreds of millions of dollars each and every year," Mr. Hastert said.
But European officials said today that they were dumbfounded by the suit. They said there was no moratorium on genetically modified food. 
"The U.S. claims that there is a so-called moratorium, but the fact is that the E.U. has authorized G.M. varieties in the past and is currently processing applications," said Pascal Lamy, the top European trade official. "So what is the real U.S. motive in bringing a case?"
In practice, the Europeans did have an informal moratorium on new varieties of genetically modified food from 1998 until last year, when the E.U. instituted a new regulatory system that has approved two applications, with others pending.
At the center of the debate over genetically modified crops, if not the suit filed today, is a growing disagreement between the United States and Europe over what steps are necessary to protect public health and the environment. 
European consumers are far more wary of genetically modified food than are Americans, and many object to what they consider aggressive American promotion of those foods, influenced by agribusiness. 
The European Union is demanding that genetically modified food be labeled as such. They also want to be able to trace the origins of the food's ingredients and are near completion of new legislation to require both.
The United States opposes such labels and tracing mechanisms, saying they are too costly and impractical.
Margot Wallstrom, the European environmental commissioner, said the European legislature would complete its measure to require labeling and methods for tracing food and animal feed that is genetically modified.
"This U.S. move is unhelpful," she said. "It can only make an already difficult debate in Europe more difficult." 
The United States agriculture secretary, Ann M. Veneman, said today that the case was aimed at protecting American farmers and ranchers. 
"With this case," she said, "we are fighting for the interests of American agriculture. This case is about playing by the rules negotiated in good faith. The European Union has failed to comply with its W.T.O. obligations." 
The United States was joined by Argentina, Canada and Egypt. Australia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Uruguay expressed support as third parties without direct commercial interest.
Many of these countries are in negotiations with the United States for a free trade agreement.
Chile is waiting for the administration to sign off on its accord after a delay driven in part by disappointment that it refused to side with the United States on the war with Iraq at the United Nations.
Mr. Zoellick promised European officials last week that trade would bring the allies together after the arguments over Iraq, not further separate them. 
But trade is becoming a divisive issue, especially since the end of the war.
European officials lashed back at the administration today, refusing to be blamed for blocking genetically modified food aid and reminding the United States that it had refused to join 100 other countries and sign the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. That agreement sets out rules for exporters and importers of genetically modified crops to provide the proper information about the food and feed.
Nonprofit groups opposed to the W.T.O.'s influence said the case showed how globalization undermined local and national governments.
"The people eating the food or living in the environment that could be affected must decide domestic policy, not some secretive W.T.O. tribunal of three trade experts," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
But several African farmers and scientists at a news conference here joined Mr. Zoellick and Ms. Veneman in praising the American action. 
"We believe it is better to give a person food to eat today than wait 10 years to be sure it is safe," said Darin Makinde, dean of the school of agriculture at the University of Venda in South Africa.
"Two elephants are fighting -- the United States and Europe -- and it is Africa that is suffering," he said.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE DEFENSE SECRETARY; 
Cheney Tells of Meeting Rumsfeld 35 Years Ago

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
It is part of Washington lore that Donald Rumsfeld gave young Dick Cheney his start in government, hiring him as an assistant in the Nixon administration.
 But Mr. Cheney revealed today that 35 years ago, when Mr. Rumsfeld was still a congressman, he flunked his first interview with the man who would eventually become his mentor, boss and hawkish ally. 
 "It was clear that we hadn't hit it off," the vice president said of his ill-fated 15-minute meeting in Mr. Rumsfeld's Capitol Hill office in 1968. "He thought I was some kind of airhead academic, and I thought he was rather an arrogant young member of Congress."
"Probably we were both right," Mr. Cheney said deadpan, dropping a punch line that brought down the house at an awards lunch here today.
The "airhead academic" and the "arrogant young congressman," now the secretary of defense, met today on neutral turf, with Mr. Cheney presenting his old friend with a public service award from the Hudson Institute, a research and policy organization with conservative leanings.
But the gathering at a downtown Washington hotel also offered a rare public glimpse into the three-decade friendship of two of the superpowers of the Bush administration. Mr. Rumsfeld, who is 70, and Mr. Cheney, who is 62, talk frequently and socialize regularly, but most of their face-to-face dealings are at cabinet meetings behind closed doors.
Today, however, they put on a public version of what one Hudson Institute official called the "Cheney-Rumsfeld routine," a mix of mutual admiration and good-natured needling.
The two men can finish each other's sentences, if necessary, aides say. Over the years, they have found themselves in superior-subordinate roles three times. They have shared some of the same titles: congressman, White House chief of staff (Mr. Cheney took Mr. Rumsfeld's place under President Gerald R. Ford) and, of course, secretary of defense.
But it is rare to get either one of them talking about their history together, at least in public.
 Mr. Cheney said today that he came to Washington in the late 1960's as a Congressional fellow and doctoral candidate working on his dissertation with an eye on returning to a teaching job at the University of Wisconsin.
 But one day, a young Republican lawmaker from Illinois named Rumsfeld spoke to the fellows, and Mr. Cheney said he was impressed. He made an appointment to interview for a job with Mr. Rumsfeld, but the meeting was a disaster.
 "As I recall, what he was looking for was somebody with some practical experience who could help out in a Congressional office," Mr. Cheney said. "He had a requirement for a speechwriter. Now if you know Don Rumsfeld, throughout his career, he's always had a requirement for a speechwriter because he has great difficulty keeping speechwriters."
Undaunted by the setback, Mr. Cheney, then 28, went to work for another Republican, Representative William Steiger of Wisconsin. A few months later, President Nixon nominated Mr. Rumsfeld to head the Office of Economic Opportunity, and Mr. Cheney said he hatched a plan.
 "I sat down one night, unsolicited, and wrote a 12-page memo suggesting to him how he should handle himself in his confirmation hearings, giving him some sterling advice on what he ought to do with the department once he got confirmed," said Mr. Cheney, clearly relishing his retelling.
Mr. Cheney said he never received a reply but was nonetheless invited to serve on Mr. Rumsfeld's transition team after the Senate approved his nomination.
Mr. Cheney said: "Don came in, spoke to the group, left, and shortly after he'd left, his secretary came in and said, 'Is there somebody here named Mr. Cheney?' I held up my hand, and she said, 'Come with me.' Took me back into his office there at O.E.O. behind the conference room, and he was in there all by himself -- second day on the job. And he said, 'You, you're Congressional relations. Now get out of here.' "
"That's how I was hired," Mr. Cheney said to peals of laughter. "That was, of course, just before he developed his suave, smooth, warm, fuzzy personality that we've all grown to love over the years."
Taking his turn on the podium, Mr. Rumsfeld expressed mock indignation at Mr. Cheney's account ("It wasn't like that!"), before waxing eloquent: "A superb executive, a wise counselor, the vice president is a combination of both thinker and doer. I am sure glad I discovered him!"

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Faces the Public, and the Music, With Some Assurance 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
He did not emote, in a Bill Clinton-I-feel-your-pain way. Nor did he spar with questioners, in a Rudolph W. Giuliani-confrontational way.
 Instead, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg went to a community breakfast in Flatbush, Brooklyn, yesterday and did the compassion thing, the connection thing, the outreach thing and the vision thing that pundits and some ordinary New Yorkers have been urging him to do. 
 It was short on theatrics. He arrived late, and took only four questions. But it was a calm, matter-of-fact, businesslike rendition of the world according to Mike Bloomberg, and it went over fairly well. 
"There are no easy answers to complex problems, whether they are fiscal problems or problems in society, or problems in your own personal family lives," Mr. Bloomberg, who has been second-guessed a lot of late, told the crowd. "We all know how to raise other people's children, but we all know that our children are complex."
The mayor, who has been tetchy of late as he has come under fire from different constituencies, kept his cool yesterday when one woman in the audience, Cynthia Dennis, heckled him with a question about the city's plan to reduce garbage collections in July, just in time for the summer's heat to add to the city's stench.
"No. 1, we're going to pick up the trash," the mayor began.
"How often?" pressed Ms. Dennis, 65, who lives in Canarsie.
"Let me finish," the mayor persevered. "Can I finish my sentence? And let me give you an answer that will get me off the hook. As often as is needed and we can afford. The fact of the matter is we've got to decide -- do we want fewer cops on the street, or more frequent pickups? It's those kinds of choices that I was elected to make."
It was a theme he returned to repeatedly at the Brooklyn breakfast, which offered a relatively rare opportunity for Mr. Bloomberg, who has generally shunned the frequent town hall-style meetings of his predecessors, to explain his unpopular proposed budget cuts and tax increases to average New Yorkers and to take a few of their questions.
The breakfast at Vanderveer Park United Methodist Church on Glenwood Road, where roughly three-quarters of the congregants are from the Caribbean, was the mayor's first community meeting since his recent moves drove his approval ratings down in the polls. It was exactly the kind of event his advisers and others have been urging him to do.
About 150 people heard him speak about the dilemmas he has had to face in deciding which services to cut, and which taxes to raise. 
"We have to make the tough choices of, do we tax ourselves or let the streets fall apart?" he said. "I know what the right answer is to that."
The mayor, who tried last year to close several centers for the elderly, pledged to keep the centers open. He spoke of trying to preserve health care, but candidly told a health care advocate, "I'm not sure you should relax."
When Mr. Giuliani was mayor, he held monthly town hall meetings with his commissioners to face city residents. Mayor Bloomberg did a couple of these sessions, then stopped. Instead he holds community breakfasts with selected members of the City Council. But in his 16 months in office, an aide to Mr. Bloomberg said, the mayor has had two town meetings and five breakfasts.
The breakfast's host, Councilman Kendall Stewart, praised Mr. Bloomberg, but his introduction was not the usual buttering-up heard in political speeches. Mr. Stewart said the budget cuts were affecting almost everyone in the district, and he told about a Haitian immigrant with four children whose son is losing his after-school program. He stated bluntly, "Mr. Mayor, our community has never gotten its fair share of the city's economic pie." When it was over, though, Mr. Stewart said he thought the mayor did well.
Hyacinth Mooyoung, 50, a real estate agent who lives in East Flatbush, said she wished the mayor had taken more questions, and had spoken about foreclosures, but she praised him for showing up. "It's a privilege for him to come to a community and take time out from his busy schedule to come and talk to us," she said.
After breakfast the mayor slowly helped Lillie Mae Ferebee, who just turned 100, down the steps of the church, chatting with her about his own mother. Then he headed back to City Hall, where he had a visit planned with Margaret Thatcher, Britain's former prime minister.

HEADLINE: Bush's Support Strong Despite Tax Cut Doubts 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Americans have persistent reservations about the tax cuts that are the centerpiece of President Bush's postwar agenda, but those concerns have not hurt Mr. Bush, who continues to ride a huge wave of support, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 The number of Americans who said they had confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to manage the economy dropped seven points, to 47 percent, in the month the president has been pushing his tax cut plan in speeches in Washington and across the nation. The poll also found that many Americans say that instead of cutting taxes, the nation should use the moneyto cut the deficit or finance a national health care system. 
 There is no evidence, however, that those doubts have damaged Mr. Bush's overall standing. The poll found that 67 percent approved of his job performance, while 70 percent said he had strong qualities of leadership, the trait that the White House has long contended would trump any concerns Americans might have about Mr. Bush's policies. 
Beyond that, Americans now hold a notably more favorable view of the Republican Party than of the Democratic Party, and 53 percent said Republicans had a clear vision of where to lead the country, compared with just 40 percent who said that of Democrats. That finding is reminiscent of what the Times/CBS News poll found last fall, just before Republicans took control of Congress.
By any measure, the Times/CBS News poll, which is the second since the fall of Baghdad and was taken at a time when activity on the presidential campaign trail has been increasing, offered a glimpse of the daunting task the Democrats face at least today, 18 months before Election Day, in trying to win back the White House and Congress.
For all the emphasis that Democrats have placed on questioning Mr. Bush's economic record, Americans were evenly divided over which party was more likely to ensure a strong economy. And in a finding that suggests that Democratic attacks against Mr. Bush have yet to take hold, 67 percent of Americans said they thought that Mr. Bush cared a lot or some "about the needs and problems of people like yourself," though 54 percent said that Mr. Bush's policies favored the rich.
Still, there were a few encouraging signs in the poll for the nine Democratic presidential candidates.
Americans overwhelmingly said the nation's health care system needed fundamental change or a complete overhaul, and they said the Democratic Party was better equipped to do that. 
That finding seems not to have been lost on the Democratic presidential candidates. Yesterday, Howard Dean became the latest to offer a plan for expanding health care coverage, using a speech to counter an ambitious proposal to provide universal health care put forward by Representative Richard A. Gephardt three weeks ago. A third candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, will offer his health care plan in Iowa tomorrow.
Respondents also said that the Democrats would do a better job of creating jobs and improving education. In addition, the number of Americans who named the economy as the chief problem facing the country continued to climb, to 29 percent in this poll, up from 23 percent last month, suggesting the potential potency of the issue that both the White House and Democrats believe could prove pivotal in next year's presidential election. 
The poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Monday. It involved 910 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Whatever enthusiasm Americans have for their president has, so far at least, not extended to what Mr. Bush has identified as his chief domestic goal now that the war is nearly over: slashing taxes. Almost uniformly, the Democratic presidential candidates have called for rejecting either all or most of Mr. Bush's tax cut, describing it as economically damaging and tilted unfairly to the rich, and the findings suggested that this argument could eventually have some resonance.
A plurality of those polled, 41 percent, said they believed that Mr. Bush's tax cut could help the economy. But 48 percent rejected one of Mr. Bush's central arguments for tax cuts, saying the cuts were not very or not at all likely to create jobs. In addition, 58 percent said they did not expect to find any more money in their paychecks as a result of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. And 63 percent of respondents said the tax cuts in 2001 had not helped the economy.
On matters of economic policy, Americans appear to have a different set of priorities from their president's. For example, 81 percent of respondents said that the country should make sure Americans had access to health care, rather than cut taxes. And 58 percent said the priority should be reducing the deficit.
"We need to lower the deficit," said Ed Petrone, 73, an independent voter from Boca Raton, Fla., in a follow-up interview. "Reducing taxes is only a short-term bump in the economy. Lowering the deficit will help us down the road. Reduce the deficit and we can put more money in the economy."
Carroll Smith, 76, an independent voter from Gallipolis, Ohio, said, "If they would balance the budget, the country would be in better shape."
Beyond the economy, with nine months to go before the caucuses in Iowa, most people do not know who is running to unseat Mr. Bush. Nearly two-thirds of voters, regardless of which party they were from, were unable to name a single one of the nine Democrats seeking the party's nomination.
Still, the poll suggested that some of the early contours of the coming election were becoming clear.
Continuing a historical trend that has played to the advantage of the Republican Party, the Times/CBS News poll found that Americans overwhelmingly saw Republicans as better able to make the right decisions on terrorism and to keep the military strong. 
Although some Democratic presidential candidates, notably Senators John Edwards of North Carolina and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, have sought to challenge Mr. Bush's foreign policy credentials by saying that Mr. Bush had not done enough to protect Americans from another terrorist attack, those warnings did not seem to have been embraced by voters.
An overwhelming majority of respondents said Mr. Bush had made progress in developing a plan to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. The number of Americans who named terrorism as the most important problem facing the nation has declined steadily since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The poll, however, was completed before the latest terrorist attacks, in Saudi Arabia. 
Fifty-eight percent of respondents said Republicans would do a better job of protecting the United States against terrorist attacks; just 18 percent said the same thing of Democrats. And 66 percent said Republicans were more likely to make sure the nation's military forces were strong, compared with 19 percent who expressed such confidence in Democrats.
In one sign of the challenge Democrats face if they criticize Mr. Bush's foreign policy credentials, 6 in 10 respondents rejected complaints by Democrats who charged that it was inappropriate for Mr. Bush to have announced the end of fighting in Iraq by landing a plane on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific.
Notwithstanding Mr. Bush's strong standing in the aftermath of the war in Iraq, the poll found continued evidence that the nation remains politically polarized after the disputed election of 2000. A majority of Democrats and half of all independents said they did not consider that Mr. Bush had legitimately won the White House.
"Bush is a court-appointed president," said Jo Carney, 59, an independent voter from East Hampton, N.Y. "He was not elected. Everything was completely mishandled in Florida, and the way the court intervened was really pulling strings."
The poll suggested that Republicans have continued to do a better job in laying out an agenda that is clear to Americans. Democrats have long thought that that would change as attention moved away from Capitol Hill, where Democrats are in the minority and thus do not have a platform, and to the presidential campaign, thus improving the party's standing with the public. 
The speech by Dr. Dean in New York, setting off a debate with Mr. Gephardt on who has the more realistic and efficient plan for providing health care coverage, would seem to be an example of that. For now, though, the poll found that 53 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the Republican Party, compared with 46 percent with a favorable view of Democrats.
"The Republicans have a clear view of what they want and are effective in promoting it," said Wendy Satterford, 50, a Democrat from San Diego. "The Democrats don't have a clear vision. They seem afraid of the electorate and the apparent rising tide of conservatism. They don't seem to be able to speak out even for the middle-of-the-road things."

Conducting the Poll
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Friday through Monday with 910 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would be obtained from all American adults. For smaller subgroups the margin of error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.
Complete results are atnytimes.com/washington.

HEADLINE: Pataki Banks Heavily on Gambling in New Plan to Rescue New York City 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 13 

 BODY:
A day before his promised veto of the State Legislature's budget plan, Gov. George E. Pataki today tried to change the subject, unveiling a new plan for bailing out New York City that avoids raising taxes but counts on money from gambling, leasing a water pipeline and selling off city assets.
 The governor would add as many as 4,500 video lottery terminals to three large Off-Track Betting outlets. He would help the city refinance its lingering 1970's debt, but not transfer the burden to the state. He would have the Metropolitan Transportation Authority buy property it uses, like lots, bus maintenance facilities and property close to access points. 
 But he would not raise, even temporarily, sales taxes or the income tax on the rich. 
The governor's proposal was widely viewed as an attempt to answer critics who have complained that he has not done enough to help save the city from its fiscal crisis. It came as a new poll revealed that his approval rating had slipped to its lowest level in eight years, and that his personal crusade against raising taxes was hurting him with voters, particularly those who describe themselves as Democrats or who live in New York City.
Many elected officials from the city and in the Legislature scoffed at the proposal.
"After listening to the governor's plan for New York City, is there any doubt now that the governor is out of touch with the people he was elected to serve?" said Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly. He said the governor was choosing slot machines over preschool for 4-year-olds, and called the plan a gimmick. "Really, this plan is an insult to working parents throughout New York City," Mr. Silver said.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg issued a statement that was tantamount to a "thanks, but no thanks," diplomatically rejecting the governor's plan in favor of the Legislature's.
"The $2.7 billion agreement with the State Legislature covers both new revenues and restorations, both of which are necessary for the city to close its budget gap," Mr. Bloomberg's statement said.
"We know the governor is trying to find additional help for the city and we are open to all ideas," he said, "some that we may find work and some that for reasons beyond anyone's control, or due to other constraints, may not be available at this time."
The governor called a news conference, as he has done frequently in recent weeks, to announce the assistance package. He also used the opportunity to continue his battle against the tax increases proposed by the Legislature to help the city and state bridge deficits this year -- $3.8 billion in the city and $11.5 billion in the state.
The governor estimated that his plan would give the city $1.7 billion in aid, a figure that legislative leaders and some city officials disputed.
Mr. Pataki said the Legislature's plan for helping the city would drive businesses and jobs to other states and that proposed tax increases would further burden city residents already reeling from rising rent costs and property taxes.
"I truly think there is a better path," Mr. Pataki said. He added: "This is a better way. And it's so clearly a better way that rejects these massive tax increases."
Democrats in the Senate and the Assembly and officials in the Republican administration of Mayor Bloomberg said many parts of the proposal stood little chance of becoming law because of political resistance.
Many lawmakers and city officials said they were also troubled because the governor was silent about whether he would veto a portion of the Legislature's budget proposal that restores $1 billion worth of cuts in education and health care that lawmakers say the city needs.
Some grumbled that the governor was protecting the economically well off in New York from tax increases while putting the temptation of gambling within reach of many poor and desperate people.
"Gambling is the tax on the addicted," said Senator David A. Paterson, of Harlem, who is the leader of the Senate Democrats. "And believe me, that is job-killing and family-killing."
But the governor said that New York City was already dealing with the social fallout from gambling because city residents go to casinos in Atlantic City and Connecticut. He also pointed out that thousands of video lottery terminals were going to be installed at the Aqueduct and Yonkers racetracks.
"But the city doesn't get any direct benefit from any of the revenues that are generated from those facilities," said the governor, who pushed through the legislation that would place the lottery terminals at racetracks. Under his plan, he said, the city would collect $210 million in proceeds in the first fiscal year and $395 million the next fiscal year.
In his plan, the governor would fulfill a request by the city to lease a 20-mile-long aqueduct that runs from the city limit at Yonkers through the Bronx and Queens to Brooklyn to a private investor who could then claim depreciation rights for what would be changed to personal property from real property for tax-law purposes. The city would get a one-time benefit of $100 million, the governor said.
Many, including Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, said the governor's plan amounted to too little, too late. But the governor asserted that there was plenty of time to consider his ideas, negotiate them and pass them before the city's fiscal year begins on July 1.
The governor was not without support. Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said any proposal that avoided tax increases was worth considering.
Mr. Bloomberg also found things to praise in the governor's proposal. While the mayor has characterized gambling as an unsavory and unreliable way of raising revenues, he said he desperately wants some of the reforms the governor supports, such as changing the state's tort laws to limit damages and lessen the city's liability to lawsuits, and repealing the Wicks Law, which requires most public construction projects to use different contractors for different types of work. But those changes are subject to legislative approval and would likely face serious opposition.
Other city officials said the plan was a political ploy that would never fly. What made many of them most angry, however, was the proposal to refinance the last $2.5 billion worth of debt left from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, without transferring the payments to the state, as the Legislature had proposed.
In the governor's plan, the city would pay back the debt on a shorter schedule and at a lower interest rate than the Legislature had agreed to, aides to Mr. Pataki said. The governor said the city would save $1.1 billion over the next two years under his refinancing plan.
The governor released his plan for the city as his aides were poring over the Legislature's budget bills, choosing what he will veto on Wednesday.
Aides said Mr. Pataki would hold a press conference in the afternoon to explain his actions. Then, during commercial breaks in the 6 p.m. television news, he will air a two-minute taped address to explain to New Yorkers why he has vetoed large parts of the spending plan, his spokeswoman, Lisa Dewald Stoll, said. The governor's campaign committee will pay for the air time in all the state's major markets, she said.
So far, according to a new poll, voters are siding with the Legislature. In a one-day statewide survey of 512 registered voters, the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion found that only 37 percent of those who responded thought Mr. Pataki was doing a good or excellent job as governor, his lowest rating in the survey in eight years.
The poll also said that 57 percent disapproved of Mr. Pataki's handling of the budget, 55 percent agreed with the Legislature's approach of raising taxes to maintain services and 56 percent would rather see him sign the budget than veto it.
The telephone poll was conducted Monday evening and has a margin or sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Polls taken on just one night are subject to additional error because of the limited time to reach people.

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Plans to Step Up Gun-Crime Prosecutions 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
Justice Department officials said today that they planned to step up prosecutions of gun crimes as part of a new initiative, even as a private study said prosecutors had "ignored" a vast majority of gun crimes.
 The study, to be released here on Wednesday by Americans for Gun Safety, found that 2 percent of federal gun crimes resulted in prosecutions and that gun traffickers were rarely prosecuted. 
 Justice Department officials disputed some findings in the report. They said the department had made "dramatic increases" in prosecuting gun crimes since Attorney General John Ashcroft made that a top priority when he took office in 2001, with overall prosecutions increasing more than 32 percent as of the latest tally. 
The report was issued as supporters of gun rights push for legislation to protect firearms manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits and Congress is considering whether to extend the nine-year-old ban on assault weapons. The White House favors keeping the prohibition against the possesion and sale of such weapons, a stance that has put him at odds with the National Rifle Association and its allies in Congress. 
Today, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader, said he saw little chance that the House would vote this year to extend the ban. "The votes in the House are not there to reauthorize it," Mr. DeLay said. 
Law enforcement officials and gun control groups are divided on a strategy to combat gun violence, which kills more than 10,000 people a year. 
The Bush administration has focused on two problems, felons who possess guns illegally and people who use firearms in committing crimes. 
The new study, which analyzed information from the Justice Department from 2000 to 2002, found that illegal possession and use during a crime accounted for 85 percent of the more than 25,000 federal firearms cases in that period. 
Gun control groups say by focusing so extensively on street crimes, the department under Mr. Ashcroft and his predecessor, Janet Reno, has largely ignored black market dealers, corrupt shop owners, "straw purchase" distributors and others who are central to the problem of illegal guns. The report cited 20 "rarely enforced" federal gun crimes. 
"There's a huge enforcement gap in areas where the federal government has a unique responsibility to prosecute cases," said Jim Kessler, the policy and research director for Americans for Gun Safety who is a co-author of the study.
It found that although people younger than 18 committed an estimated 93,000 violent crimes, federal prosecutors brought 24 cases for selling firearms to minors. 
Although an estimated 420,000 firearms were reported stolen in that period, prosecutors filed 524 cases related to the possession, transfer or sale of stolen firearms, the report said. An estimated 450,000 would-be buyers were found to have lied about their histories and had their applications rejected, but fewer than 1,600 were prosecuted for lying in their background checks, the report added. 
Justice Department officials said they had concentrated prosecutions on felons and people who used guns in crimes because they represented the most dangerous owners. The officials said Mr. Ashcroft had also sought to step up prosecutions of would-be owners who lied on background checks, and the number of prosecutions for false statements rose 8 percent last year, officials said. 
"We're seeing increases across the board in prosecutions, and we are not neglecting any cases," said Reagan Dunn, who coordinates the antigun crime initiative that Mr. Ashcroft began in 2001.
At a hearing today before the Senate Judiciary Committee, federal and local law enforcement officials said they were pleased with the gun initiative and were planning to expand on the progress of the last two years. 
The department plans to commit $900 million to the initiative over three years and has added more than 600 prosecutors and agents to aid in the effort, officials said.
The United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Paul J. McNulty, told the panel that although it was too early to judge the program, it had already produced "unprecedented coordination" among officials.
But two professors who specialize in gun crime and also appeared before the committee questioned the effectiveness of the program. 
Jens Ludwig, an associate professor of public policy at Georgetown University, said although advocates pointed to a pilot program in Virginia as a model, that program "has not been as successful as is widely believed." Although his comment drew a rebuke from Mr. McNulty, the professor said his own research did not support the idea that a push to remove illegal guns from the street had contributed greatly to a significant drop in firearms murders in the late 1990's in the Richmond, Va., metropolitan region.
Another witness, Alfred Blumstein, an expert on violent crime at Carnegie Mellon University, said he believed that the Justice Department had failed to develop a coordinated approach to gun crime.
"We are still woefully ignorant of the mix of factors contributing to gun violence and how that mix varies across locality," Professor Blumstein said.
Although he was not involved in the study, he said he agreed that prosecutors had not paid enough attention to cutting off the black market. "We're getting the low-hanging fruit," the professor said. "The other piece of the puzzle we're not really touching on is the whole gun distribution network."

HEADLINE: The Agents of Change in Cuba 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "How to Hurt Castro," by Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona (Op-Ed, May 12):
 On the basis of a recent, legal trip to Cuba, I agree with Mr. Flake. 
Contact with Americans and with people from other free countries is a valuable agent for change. 
 Cubans are highly curious about other countries, and few appear to share Fidel Castro's bitter anti-Americanism. Discontent increases as Cubans contrast their own poverty and restricted personal and economic freedoms with what they hear about the outside world.
As a result of the growth of a dollar economy, introduced by tourism, many Cubans have become engaged in entrepreneurial capitalism.
I concluded that the best way to undermine Mr. Castro's power and to bring about a more open society in Cuba is to continue to undermine its isolation and poverty. Policies that have isolated and penalized Cuba have aided Mr. Castro, enabling him better to control information and to blame outside forces for economic deprivation and human rights violations.

HEADLINE: Korea Distiller Is Ordered Into Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

 BODY:
A South Korean court ordered Jinro, the country's largest distiller, into bankruptcy yesterday and removed its management.
 The ruling was a groundbreaking victory for a group of foreign creditors led by Goldman Sachs. They hold $449 million of the company's debt and have been fighting with Jiro for five years over repayment. Goldman itself holds bonds with a face value of $270 million. 
 The case has taken on immense symbolism in South Korea, where the courts are believed to have never issued such a ruling before on behalf of foreign creditors. There is strong nationalist sentiment against foreign ownership or control of Korean businesses, and Jinro is seen as especially Korean because it is the leading producer of soju, the national drink, a liquor distilled from rice, sweet potatoes and tapioca.
Jinro said it would appeal the ruling immediately.
The company has been in financial distress since the Asian currency crisis of 1997, when, despite a 38 percent share of the domestic soju market, the company nearly collapsed under $1.5 billion in debts run up on diversification moves into department stores and other ventures. It was delisted by the Korea Stock Exchange in January.
The company began selling off peripheral assets in 1998, and in the years since has built its core business to an even more dominant 54 percent market share. But it has tried the patience of creditors, principally the group led by Goldman Sachs.
A five-year moratorium on repayment of debts expired in April, and the company immediately defaulted, failing to make a $58 million payment due to Goldman Sachs and its partners. Goldman responded by suing in Seoul district court to force the company into receivership. 
Domestic creditors, who hold 64 percent of Jinro's total debts, have tended to back management, including the company's leading Korean lender, Hana Bank, which has expressed concern that putting the company in receivership will make it harder to line up future financing from foreign sources. Many of the company's 3,000 workers, fearful for their jobs under any new management, demonstrated angrily in Seoul yesterday, according to news agencies. 
South Korean corporate receiverships are similar in some ways to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Debt collection by creditors is blocked while the company tries, sometimes for several years, to right itself and win court approval for a new financial plan. The most important difference lies in who runs the company during the process: under South Korean law, the court appoints new management at the outset.
In the Jinro case, the court was at pains to allay fears that its ruling amounted to a takeover of the company by Goldman Sachs. The purpose of the decision, the court said, was to rebuild Jinro "through strict and transparent procedures to maximize the company's corporate value." It did not mean, the court said, that "the fate of Jinro rests in the hands of foreign creditors or that it will disappear."

HEADLINE: Africans Suffer, As We Look Away 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "Ethiopia's Dying Children" (column, May 13), Nicholas D. Kristof quoted an alliance of aid groups as claiming that "for the international community to allow this to happen in the 21st century is unforgivable." 
 Unforgivable it may be, but it is certainly not unpredictable. As Mr. Kristof stated, Africa has been the forgotten continent in recent years.
But he must remember that Africa has been the forgotten continent since Alexandria was considered a major city -- or a city at all. If the world can recoil at the thought of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, how can it ignore the deaths of thousands of Africans at the hands of poverty-stricken, corrupt governments? 
Tragic as it may be, famine and poverty in Africa have become a cliche in the eyes of the West. This, combined with Africa's low economic productivity, results in the West's finding it too easy to ignore Africa. While we are laboring over how to reconstruct the United Nations, why not seek to construct a plan by which the international community might be forgiven?

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The benefits to the economy of a weaker dollar and global coordination.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THE falling dollar has raised alarms in certain circles. But it is just what the doctor ordered for a weak American economy. And if it falls some more, all the better. 
 In fact, there is now an opportunity for the Bush administration to stimulate the economy without relying almost solely on tax cuts that are likely to sap the nation's long-term strength. It should try to coordinate fiscal and monetary policies with Europe and Asia to push the dollar down further while simultaneously stimulating demand in other nations. 
 John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, hinted on television on Sunday that the administration, despite subsequent official denials, might not be opposed to a lower dollar. But there is little sign the administration will take the important step of coordinating policies, especially given the continuing friction over its foreign policy in major capitals. Good relations with Poland and Portugal, part of "New Europe," are not going to get anyone far. Mr. Snow travels to Europe on Saturday to meet with finance ministers there. Perhaps he will surprise us. 
A lower dollar can stimulate the economy by making America's exports cheaper. Though it takes a while, this is particularly helpful to struggling manufacturers. It also makes imports more expensive, enabling domestic producers to capture more market share. "A lower dollar is like a tax cut to producers," said Robert Blecker, an economics professor at American University, "but it doesn't show up in the deficit." 
The dollar has been falling since early last year and is now down about 8 percent against a large basket of currencies and much more against the euro. But to generate adequate stimulus, it will have to fall further. The customary fear that it will reignite inflation is hardly a danger now. 
The main problem is that what is good for American manufacturers is bad for European, Canadian and Asian ones. As the euro and other currencies go up, Americans will buy fewer of these countries' products. And if their economies weaken -- Germany and other European nations are teetering on the brink of recession -- they will not be able to buy American exports, no matter how cheap. Ideally, Europe should be cutting interest rates to support demand at home. So far, it is resisting for fear it will ignite inflation. 
There are several ways to get a reasonable sense of how low a dollar the United States now needs. What crystalizes theissue best is a model developed by the British economist Wynne Godley, formerly of the Jerome Levy Institute for Economics and now returned to the University of Cambridge.
Mr. Godley's model, cited by some academic and business economists, conjectures that the nation's current account deficit, which includes its trade deficit as well as interest payments, will continue to rise from its current 5 percent. 
But this net spending on foreign goods and services means that some of America's demand is lost to overseas economies. This must be counteracted by either private or government borrowing at home to keep spending up and avoid a fall in output. 
Mr. Godley and others argue that the high levels of debt taken on by consumers and business will probably impede this. So the federal government is the last resort. 
If the balance of payments continues to deteriorate, and the private sector does not increase investment, Mr. Godley reckons that the federal deficit might have to reach an astonishing 9 to 10 percent of gross domestic product to avoid serious recession. 
There are several ways out of the morass, some not desirable. A steep recession will reduce demand for foreign goods and lower the trade deficit. 
More hopefully, business could start investing vigorously again. But given the size of the 1990's investment bubble, will it? 
Overseas economies could start growing so rapidly that they would import many of America's goods. But many are getting weaker by the hour, it seems. 
Finally, the dollar could fall enough to reduce the balance-of-payments deficit. Several economists at the Levy Institute -- Dimitri Papadimitriou, Anwar Shaikh, Gennaro Zezza and Claudio Dos Santos -- have updated the Godley analysis and argue that at least a 25 percent fall in the dollar is desirable. 
A more conventional analysis by J. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics arrives at a similar conclusion. He figures that every 1 percent fall in a trade-weighted dollar index results in roughly a $10 billion reduction in the balance of payments. He thinks the current deficit is not sustainable and must be cut in half as a percentage of G.D.P.
The great advantage of coordination is that it requires no single policy to do all the lifting. With coordination, the dollar might not have to fall as far or the deficit rise as steeply as demand overseas picks up -- and all may benefit. 
In one scenario, America would have to admit it wants a lower dollar. It would have to persuade the European Central Bank to reduce its relatively high interest rates and the European Union to allow member governments to run bigger deficits to stoke domestic demand. 
Most difficult, as Mr. Blecker and others point out, the administration would encourage the typically stubborn Asian nations, like Japan and China, to stop holding their currencies down as well. 
The markets might force policy makers' hands anyway. But this runs the danger of unbalanced policy responses and financial instability. 
Can coordination work? It is fashionable to dismiss it. But on balance, a version of it did work in 1985, when the Reagan administration sought to reduce the dollar's level during the famous Plaza Accord, and again in 1987 at the Louvre meetings, when it sought to stop its fall. 
Given its unilateral tendencies, will the Bush administration make such a concerted effort? A coordinated policy would be a mark of leadership in a complex and interconnected world. It is the best chance the world has for renewed stable growth.

HEADLINE: Niagara Hopes Casino Visitors Won't Mutter, 'What Falls?' 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., May 9 

 BODY:
They had a traffic jam here one day last winter. The city was delighted.
 After all, people have been getting scarcer in this town for half a century, ever since the big steel and chemical plants that fed on the energy of the Niagara River began shutting down. If the opening of the Seneca Niagara casino on New Year's Day could back the cars up at Third Street at Rainbow Boulevard, it could only be an improvement. 
 Now, with this bedraggled city on the cusp of its all-important summer tourism season, the first with a casino to match the one on the Canadian side, people here are waiting to see if the opening-day rush to the Indian casino will be the harbinger of things to come or just the latest disappointment. 
Without much good news in recent years, people here are hoping for the best.
"The local guys are starting to feel the momentum," said Michael Wilton, president of USA Niagara Development Corporation, a state economic development agency. "If anything, this casino is a sign to local people that things can happen here, that things are moving."
Mr. Wilton is a booster, but he is not alone. These days, the notion that gambling can lift failing economies is an article of faith across the New York region and beyond. Eastern states from Maryland to Massachusetts are looking at casinos as painless alternatives to tax increases, and Gov. George E. Pataki, who is counting on new casinos to balance the state budget, recently announced a plan for lottery terminals in OTB betting parlors to help New York City cover its deficit.
But it is tourism, not just taxes, that Niagara Falls is hoping for in this first summer of gambling.
"For one thing, the casino brought 2,000 new jobs, so obviously it has already helped," said Mayor Irene J. Elia. "But will people come just for the casino? We're in trouble if we think so."
Will most visitors be the usual mom and dad with kids in tow -- few gamblers there -- or will they be the couples rich in years and in retirement savings who are drawn like moths to the light of the slots?
"I see a certain mutual exclusivity between the casino customers and our customers," said Christopher M. Glynn, president of the Maid of the Mist Corporation, whose boats take tourists into the spray of the falls.
"All of the gamblers won't be tourists, and all of the tourists won't be gamblers," Mr. Glynn said. "But if some of the gamblers decide to spend some time as tourists, that would be great."
Most of all, what people hope is that the millions of Americans who pour into Niagara Falls each summer will not take one look at the dingy, empty buildings and scattered attractions here, then head directly across the Rainbow Bridge to the bright lights, tidy streets and booming casino and other attractions on the Canadian side. 
Plenty of business people evidently believe that the wealth of the casino, which is taking in close to $1 million a day from gamblers, will spill over into the city, home to 52,000 people. Howard Milstein, the developer, bought the vacant Nabisco plant on the edge of the casino development area for $3.2 million. 
"You couldn't have got a dollar for it before the casino," said Howard Smith, a real estate broker. 
And a one-block walk up Third Street from the casino shows that a dozen or so small businesses are following in the casino's wake. The scaffolding is still up in front of the new bar that Dan Vecchies is building, but another spot, Club 427, opened with a big party a few doors down from him last week. Up the street is a new boutique, LaRussa Fashion Casino Wear, and across the street from LaRussa's stands a new restaurant, Donatello's, which is next to Cafe Etc., the old place that Steve Fournier has restored into an hot spot for the city's young crowd.
Mr. Vecchies, who also owns a mortgage business, says he is going to name his bar Shadows.
"I think this market is ready for an upscale martini bar that serves high-end food and liquor," he said. "And besides, there are 200 high-income managers in the casino who will be looking for a place like this after work."
But not everyone is counting on the casino to put money in their pockets. Gary Deutschlander runs a coffee and pastry shop on the pedestrian mall outside the entrance to the American side of the falls. "The casino people, they're not going to come in here," he said. "They've got everything they want to eat and drink right where they are."
The bars and restaurants do worry that the casino will do what casinos everywhere try to do keep their customers inside and gambling with plentiful, cheap food and free drinks. So Mr. Vecchies and other bar owners are pushing the city and county to let them extend their hours to 4 a.m. from 2. As an Indian business, the casino is exempt from local laws, but it voluntarily stops serving alcohol at 4.
Still, Mr. Fournier, in Cafe Etc., said he was not necessarily counting on casino patronage. 
"Everyone's saying we're banking on the casino," he said. "I'm not banking on anything except opening a business in my hometown, like my father and my grandfather did. With all the people crossing the ditch every day, I figure some of them will come in here."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Worries on Retailers and Chip Industry Lead Shares Down

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks declined yesterday as a disappointing forecast from Applied Materials, the world's biggest supplier of equipment for making semiconductors, hurt shares of chip-related companies.
 Retailers like J. C. Penney and Home Depot slid after the government reported an unexpected decline in retail sales in April. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.02 points, or 0.3 percent, to 939.28. The index has gained 17 percent over the last two months. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 31.43 points, or 0.4 percent, to 8,647.82, while the Nasdaq composite index slid 4.78 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,534.90. 
"The big rally we saw in stocks was predicated on the belief that the world was getting better and the economy was getting better," said Joseph Basset, who helps manage $149 billion at Banc One Investment Advisors. Reports like the outlook from Applied Materials suggest otherwise, he said.
Rising and declining stocks were about equal in number on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 1.37 billion shares traded, in line with the three-month average daily volume.
The S.& P. 500 reached a nine-month high this week on optimism that corporate earnings and the economy would accelerate this year. Still, some investors say, the rally since March 11 already reflects the prospect for faster growth.
"It's been a good, solid run, but we'll probably slow to a walk from here, at least until we see confirmation that the economy is genuinely gaining traction," said Paul McManus, director of fundamental research at Independence Investments, based in Boston, which manages $15 billion.
In a sign that the economy may not pick up as expected through 2003, a government report showed that retail sales declined in April. Sales decreased 0.1 percent, to $309.5 billion, as consumers spent less on furniture, clothing and gasoline. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.4 percent. A group of consumer companies, including J. C. Penney, accounted for almost one-third of the decline in the S.& P. 500 index.
Computer-related shares also accounted for one-third of the S.& P. 500's decline. Applied Materials fell 59 cents, to $14.97. The company reported a loss of $62.1 million in the quarter ended April 27, in contrast to a profit of $52 million a year earlier. Revenue declined 4.3 percent, to $1.11 billion, and the company said new orders would be little changed in the quarter ending in July.
Among other chip-related shares, KLA-Tencor, the world's biggest maker of semiconductor inspection equipment, fell $1.21, to $41.54.
Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, slid 16 cents, to $19.66. Texas Instruments, the largest maker of chips that power cellular telephones, declined 28 cents, to $19.42.
Network Appliance, whose machines store and distribute computer data files on corporate networks, fell $1.24, to $15.49. The company reported first-quarter profit of 7 cents a share, excluding some costs, matching expectations.
Federated Department Stores declined 75 cents, to $31.70. Federated, the parent of Macy's and Lazarus, said earnings last quarter decreased 48 percent and sales declined 4.6 percent.
Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement chain, slid 35 cents, to $29.60. J. C. Penney dropped $1.63, to $17.22.
Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, declined $1.87, to $27.98. The company forecast second-quarter profit of 30 cents to 34 cents a share, less than the average estimate of 35 cents.
Millennium Pharmaceuticals rose $1.90, or 15 percent, to $14.39. It received Food and Drug Administration approval for a drug, Velcade, intended to treat multiple myeloma, an incurable form of blood cancer.

HEADLINE: A Job Half-Done in Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Iraqis worried about the future of their country cannot be encouraged by what they see in Afghanistan, America's first effort at nation-building in the Islamic world. Nearly 18 months after American-backed forces ousted the Taliban from power, Afghanistan languishes in a strange limbo between war and peace. Though Washington's efforts have brought a measure of freedom and democracy, many of America's promises about rebuilding Afghanistan have yet to be realized. 
 Two big mistakes proved costly. The Bush administration did not adequately concern itself with issues of internal security. And it seriously underestimated the amount of aid it would take to pay for both relief and reconstruction needs. The combined effect of these errors has seriously weakened the power of President Hamid Karzai and slowed Afghanistan's economic regeneration. 
 Understandably, the Pentagon's main concern in Afghanistan has been fighting what remains of the Taliban, a declared enemy of the United States, not bringing to heel local warlords, many of whom fought alongside American troops. That has left most of the country under the control of feuding warlords. Armed men are everywhere, including about 100,000 in various private armies. Their battles, banditry and financial exactions have impeded economic recovery and national cohesion. This problem might have been better contained if international peacekeepers had been stationed throughout the country, not just in Kabul. 
The longer-term answer to the warlords' power is the new national army Washington is training. While plans call for a force of 70,000, so far only about 4,500 members have been trained. Yet there is talk of withdrawing the remaining 8,500 American troops in Afghanistan next year, long before the new national army will be strong enough to take over.
Roughly $1 billion a year in American aid, along with contributions from other donors, has not been enough to overcome the devastation inflicted by more than two decades of conflict on what was already one of the world's poorest and least developed economies. Continuing security problems have discouraged private investment and slowed the country's economic regeneration. That has kept tax revenues too low to pay the police and other government workers. And with much of the population unemployed, much of the aid has had to go into emergency relief programs. That has left far too little for projects needed to restart the economy, like repairing roads and dams, restoring electricity and telephones and repairing irrigation systems.
Washington needs to augment its efforts to bring security and development to Afghanistan. And it must avoid making similar mistakes in Iraq.

10-Year Treasury Note Yield Falls to 45-Year Low

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.52 percent yesterday, a 45-year low, after a report of weak retail sales in April capped a string of disappointing economic reports.
 But there are signs elsewhere in the fixed-income markets of growing investor confidence about the economic outlook for the second half of the year. In addition, the decline in yields, which has already pushed home mortgage rates back down near four-decade lows, should inject more life into the economy, economic analysts say. 
 A positive sign in the fixed-income market is the spread, or difference, between the yields on Treasury securities and both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds. While not near historic lows, the spread for high-yield bonds is down more than three percentage points from near-record highs last November. The spread on investment-grade corporate bonds just above junk status is down about a percentage point, also from near-record highs. 
The narrowing spread indicates that investors are willing to take on more risk and suggests that their economic outlook is improving.
The yield on junk bonds has dropped to just below 9 percent, according to the KDP Investment Advisors index, from 12.26 percent last September, translating into lower borrowing costs for many companies trying to turn the corner.
"The equivocal economic data is enough to tell a story that the economy is weakening again," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig. "But I don't believe it. The high-yield market is saying the economy is getting better."
David M. Blitzer, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's, agreed.
"I think in this case the spreads have probably got it right," he said. "The spreads are responding to the economy, and they are saying that the economy is not great but it has not deteriorated lately."
Some economists also contend that the decline in the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note is more of a response to the statement on inflation by Federal Reserve officials on May 6 than slowing economic growth.
That statement led many to believe that the central bank was not worried about inflation at all in the near term and intended to keep interest rates low for a long time to ensure that the economy got back to a path of sustainable growth. Since that statement, the yield on the 10-year note has fallen more than a third of a percentage point, to 3.52 percent.
Some economists also believe that Federal Reserve policy makers have signaled a willingness to cut their benchmark for short-term interest rates further if the economy continues to struggle or if there is a significant decline in inflation. Fed policy makers meet again in June.
"This is definitely help for the economy and it is a major help for borrowers," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan.
One impact of the Fed keeping its short-term benchmark, now at 1.25 percent, low is that longer-term rates will come down. This is called a flattening of the yield curve and is positive for the economy because businesses and homeowners pay these longer-term rates when they borrow.
The flattening can be seen in the recent performance of Treasury yields. Until yesterday, the recent low for yields on both the 10-year note and the 2-year note had come on March 10. Since then, the yield on the 10-year note has fallen to a new low, while the yield on the 2-year note, at 1.38 percent, remains above its March 10 low of 1.33 percent.
Mr. Glassman said there were indications that some companies were actually borrowing for new projects at these lower rates. Home mortgage rates have already slipped again. The national average on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.62 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, just above the 5.61 percent for the week ended March 15, the lowest rates since the 1960's. Because mortgage rates are sensitive to the moves of the yield on 10-year Treasury notes, the rate could fall to a new low this week. The new data is scheduled to be released today.
The dip in rates means that homeowners can still refinance their mortgages, freeing up cash for other spending. Over the last year and a half, refinancing to lower interest rates and to withdraw equity out of one's home has supported consumer spending, which has helped pull the economy out of the recession that is now thought to have concluded at the end of 2001.
The possibility that rates can stay low longer also means less of a threat that rising rates will slow the buying and selling of houses and put downward pressure on home prices. If prices hold steady or rise, consumer confidence could strengthen. 
"You couldn't ask for a more positive financial environment to get the economy going," Mr. Glassman said.
In late trading in the Treasury market yesterday, the price of the 10-year note rose 23/32, to 100 28/32, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.52 percent, from 3.61 percent on Tuesday. Based on monthly data from the Federal Reserve, that is the lowest yield on a security with a 10-year maturity since July 1958.

HEADLINE: Consumer Pullback: Retail Sales Fell 0.1% in April 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Consumers spent a shade less in retail stores and food service outlets in April than in March, according to figures released yesterday by the Commerce Department. Experts attributed the sluggishness to job-related uncertainty and the psychological hangover from the war in Iraq.
 Overall spending fell by 0.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis, though sales were still up 2.2 percent since February. 
 "What people are waiting for is to see better economic data -- to see a pick-up primarily in the labor market and to see it reflected in their incomes," said Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Federation. "It's a difficult environment, and people are being very cautious." 
Taking out a 2.5 percent rise in sales of autos and parts, retail spending fell 0.9 percent in April -- the biggest drop since September 2001. Lower gasoline prices accounted for more than half that decline, dragging down spending at filling stations by 5.9 percent. But consumers also spent less at clothing shops, where sales fell 3.2 percent, and at department stores, which posted a 1.4 percent drop.
Several analysts said they were expecting a modest rise in sales. In an average month, retail sales besides autos and parts would increase about 0.4 percent.
"We were a bit surprised that they were as weak as they were, and we're sort of on the weaker side of things in general," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs.
Consumer anxiety may be at the heart of the weakness. Though they have supported the economy through its worst moments in the last two years of recession and uncertain recovery, shoppers may be showing the effects of concerns about their personal well-being.
"They don't feel terribly secure about the future right now because of what's been happening in the recent past," Ms. Wells said. "The war and terrorism was one big factor, and probably won't be entirely gone for a long, long time. The other factor, probably even more important, is their own personal financial situation and their thoughts about how secure their jobs are and how their income will be growing. That's what really drives spending."
The stock market's travails and slow growth in wages, adjusted for changes in prices, could also be holding back spending, said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Concerns about nest eggs for retirement and earnings in the next few years will cause people to save more, he predicted.
"I'd expect the saving rate to move toward 5 percent by the end of this year, and perhaps 6 percent by the end of next year," Mr. Curtin said. The Commerce Department's most recent measure of the saving rate was 3.6 percent for March.
In a truly tentative economic atmosphere, Ms. Wells said, stores have resorted to marking down prices and kicking off special promotions to entice consumers to come in and spend -- just as the biggest carmakers have since Sept. 11, 2001.
Yet those kinds of sales tactics might not make much of an impression on consumers these days, said Barbara E. Kahn, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania.
"People adapted to the state of discounting" during the economic slump, she said, "so it was no longer a reason to buy."
Moreover, Mr. McKelvey explained, the shallowness of the recession in 2001 resulted in little pent-up demand for big-ticket items like cars, furniture and appliances. "The problem is, those sectors never really took the hit," he said, "so you can't really look at them as drivers."
Professor Kahn added that some new technologies that might have spurred consumers' demand -- like hard-drive recorders for television and third-generation mobile phones -- have not yet done so to the extent forecast.
Congress looks increasingly likely to pass hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, intended in part as a spark for the economy. But even if the cuts become law, the experts said, the spark may never materialize.
"Obviously, when you reduce people's taxes and free up a little bit of income for them to spend, it can help," Mr. McKelvey said. "But we've never seen the proposals that they're considering to be strongly stimulative in a near-term sense."
Ms. Wells agreed: "I don't expect any immediate positive reaction to that tax cut. I don't see it as a big stimulus in the near term."
More recent indicators than those released by the Commerce Department have included faint hints of better times, however.
"The weekly retail indexes do seem to be getting a little bit better in the transition from late April into early May," Mr. McKelvey said, "but that's a thin read." According to reports from retailers, Ms. Wells added, "there seems to be a bit of a bounceback."

HEADLINE: Gun Makers Not Liable for Violence, Jury Says 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
A federal jury in Brooklyn found yesterday that the marketing practices of 45 gun manufacturers and distributors were not responsible for fostering gun violence in minority communities in New York City, a finding that was seen as a victory for the gun industry. 
 The jury reached its verdict in its fourth day of deliberations in a case that drew national attention because the plaintiff, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, gained access to previously sealed government data tracing the sales of guns that may have been used in crimes. 
 The jury's verdict will play only an advisory role in the outcome of the case, in accordance with a ruling by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Both sides will submit written arguments interpreting the jury's verdict within 30 days, and Judge Weinstein will make the final ruling. 
The jury was unable to reach a verdict on about 23 other defendants in the case.
Even if the judge rules against the manufacturers and distributors, the case might be rendered moot by pending federal legislation that would retroactively shield the gun industry from most lawsuits. The bill passed the House of Representatives last month and is now before the Senate.
Elisa Barnes, the N.A.A.C.P.'s chief lawyer in the case, expressed disappointment with the outcome and said the absence of identifiable victims and the complex statistical evidence may have influenced the verdict.
"It's a conceptually very difficult case, and it's very hard to understand what it is we were saying they had done wrong," she said.
Lawrence G. Keane, the vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry's trade association, said: "We welcome the advisory jury's common-sense finding that manufacturers and distributors of firearms are not responsible for the criminal misuse of their products."
But before the verdict was released, Mr. Keane had expressed concern that no matter what the jury found, Judge Weinstein, who has a reputation as a liberal, might rule against all 68 defendants.
The verdict followed nearly six weeks of testimony in the case, which was filed in 1999 and followed similar lawsuits by two dozen cities and counties claiming that the practices of the gun industry amount to a public nuisance because they permit guns to fall into the hands of criminals.
Unlike many earlier suits, the N.A.A.C.P.'s suit, brought against 68 defendants, including such industry giants as Smith & Wesson and Glock Inc., does not seek damages for the cost of gun violence. Instead, it seeks an injunction that would create new restrictions on the distribution and marketing of handguns.
During the trial, the association's lawyers argued that the gun industry knows of many ways in which dealers could be monitored to prevent guns from reaching criminals, but has failed to take action.
The gun makers' lawyers countered that the suit was baseless, and that they should not be held responsible for what happens to a gun after it is legally sold.
The association's case relied heavily on a statistical analysis of a registry of guns recovered by law enforcement that is maintained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and was suppressed for years.
The association's experts testified that certain dealers and manufacturers were far more likely to have their handguns become "crime guns" than others, that some practices by dealers were associated with crime guns, and that if they wanted to, gun makers and distributors could pressure dealers not to engage in those practices.
For example, an economist, Lucy Allen, testified that 1 percent of gun dealers hold multiple dealer licenses at the same address, but that those dealers sold 13 percent of the guns that were later traced to crimes by the A.T.F.
The association also called a former firearms industry lobbyist, Robert A. Ricker, in the first important testimony against the industry by a former insider. 
Lawyers for the gun makers countered the association's experts with their own, who called the association's analytical methods shoddy. 
The association's data-heavy approach may have been dictated in part by the outcome of a 1999 case in which Ms. Barnes, appearing before Judge Weinstein, won a landmark verdict against gun makers on behalf of a group of shooting victims. That verdict was later overturned by an appeals court that found the association had not adequately linked industry marketing practices to gun violence. 
In closing statements, the association's lawyers struggled to humanize their case, naming an N.A.A.C.P. member who was afraid to leave her house at night because of the danger of being shot.
But the link between the gun makers' practices and harm to association's members was not clear enough, said one juror, Harold Renault, 56. 
"There wasn't enough concrete evidence," he said after the verdict was released, adding that the association's case would have been stronger if the relatives of crime victims had testified.

HEADLINE: Politics and Sacred Ground, 1853; 
Birth of Central Park Holds Parallels With Ground Zero

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
What vast Manhattan architectural and public works project, the likes of which New York City had never seen before, was begun in a time of economic crisis and changed the city forever? 
 Hint: Stakeholders ranging from real-estate moguls to state and city politicians exerted intense pressure. Republicans stepped in to bigfoot the process. Initial, ho-hum plans were rejected. In the hard-fought design competition that followed, a showdown led to the choice of the Republicans' favorite. The winning and losing designs were placed on display for all to see. Immediately, then, the winning design was altered by powerful competing interests. 
 Another hint: Think way before ground zero. 
The project was Central Park, and there are many eerie parallels between that effort and the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. "The creation of Central Park, one of the greatest works of art in America, is an epic story," said Morrison H. Heckscher, Lawrence A. Fleischman chairman of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "And the dynamic hasn't changed all that much through the centuries."
Today the museum is celebrating the 150th anniversary of the park it has inhabited since 1880 with the opening of "Central Park: A Sesquicentennial Celebration." The exhibition, curated by Mr. Heckscher, traces the design and building of the first great public park in America. The show features the original presentation plans and drawings by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, who won an 1858 design contest that was curiously echoed in the ground zero competition decided last February.
On July 21, 1853, the State Legislature designated as "a public place" the lands that were to become Central Park, accomplishing the unheard-of removal of 17,000 potential building sites from the real-estate market. 
"It's appropriate to celebrate the year of the Legislature's decision rather than, say, the design competition in 1858," said Sara Cedar Miller, the historian and photographer for the Central Park Conservancy, which helped to organize the Met exhibition. "The vision to take so much land for a city park was unprecedented in the history of this country."
The show's 60 original maps, drawings, watercolors, lithographs, engravings, paintings and photographs include rare stereograph views of the park from the museum's collections as well as those of the New York City Municipal Archives, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the New-York Historical Society.
In the exhibit, the genesis of Central Park can be seen in an 8-foot-by-2.5-foot original engraving on heavy paper -- decorated with a blue and green wash -- of the famous April 1811 commissioners' plan that established the grid pattern for Manhattan. It delineated 12 north-south avenues, 155 east-west streets and a planned public park called the Parade, a 229-acre tract between 23rd Streets and 34th Streets.
As demonstrated by the subsequent 1836 Colton Map (a rare section of an early engraver's test print is on view in the show), the Parade succumbed to real-estate speculation before it could be built. The ensuing clamor for a large public park ended in the election of Mayor Ambrose C. Kingsland, who in 1851 proposed the creation of just such an amenity. 
"The rich wanted New York to be a major metropolis, and a park was de rigueur, as in Paris and London," said Ms. Miller, author of "Central Park, an American Masterpiece" (Harry N. Abrams, 2003, $45). "And visionaries saw the park as an outdoor classroom in urban reform. They thought immigrants would witness the fine clothes and the carriages and would want to work hard to be part of the American dream." 
In addition, as at ground zero, Mr. Heckscher said, "there certainly was pressure to make a decision on the use of the land." 
The city's parks at the time were largely decorous and enclosed, often privately maintained, like Gramercy Park. And although City Hall Park was open to the public, those hungry for nature had to cross the Hudson or head to the dead at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. 
The State Legislature finally stepped in to check the corruption of Tammany Hall, Ms. Miller said, and it voted to create a park from 59th to 106th Streets, later expanded to 110th Street in 1863. Many of the great 19th-century public parks of England and France had once been royal hunting grounds given over to the people, "which makes the vote of the Legislature to create a park even more unique," Ms. Miller said. 
The Central Park tract was swampy, scrubby, rocky and not easily farmed. Another of the treasures on view is the original 1855 drainage plan of Egbert Ludovicus Viele, who was hired in 1854 to be the park's chief engineer. He had come up with a design that, though lackluster, was at first accepted by park commissioners in 1856. That workmanlike plan -- also presented in the exhibition -- so appalled Vaux that he politicked to throw the choice open to a competition. 
Vaux had been a partner of Andrew Jackson Downing, the nation's foremost landscape gardener, and he entered the competition with Viele's gifted park construction superintendent, Olmsted. After toiling at his day job in the park, Olmsted would travel to the town house of Vaux, helping to design the park during the winter of 1857-58. Their hand-drawn original 11-foot-long-by-3-foot-wide presentation drawing is one of the stars of the exhibition. 
Also part of the exhibition are eight of the original 11 presentation boards created by Olmsted and Vaux to hawk their plan. The boards feature black-and-white "before" pictures of the existing parkland, taken by the studio of the photographer Matthew Brady (some possibly by Brady himself), as well as oil renderings of the park that would be, some by Vaux. Alone among all the entries, the Olmsted and Vaux plan (they called it Greensward) called for submerged road cuts, isolating the park from crosstown traffic. 
The park, Mr. Heckscher said, "was to be a place for passive entertainment, and for the appreciation of nature -- a public living room for people of all classes, who were supposed to be on their best behavior." 
In all, there were 33 competing design proposals, compared with seven in the final round at ground zero. In the end, the park battle narrowed down to two plans, as in the recent drawdown between Daniel Libeskind and Rafael Vinoly. 
The exhibition presents two new discoveries: the runner-up design in the competition by Samuel J. Gustin, as well as an exuberant original ink-and-watercolor entry by John Rink. They have not been on public display since the competition, and both were discovered by Ms. Miller. 
Though the Gustin plan was originally the betting favorite (not unlike the Vinoly plan after a key planning committee supported it at the 11th hour in the February ground-zero smackdown with Mr. Libeskind), the Republican-backed Greensward plan was victorious. The final 1858 commissioners' tally presaged the vote in 2003, when Republican Gov. George E. Pataki threw his weight behind the Libeskind design. 
Shortly after it was accepted, the Greensward plan was modified to accommodate wealthy New Yorkers' demand for carriage drives and riding trails, adding to the pedestrian paths originally envisioned. An attempt to shrink the size of the park was beaten back by Mayor Fernando Wood, "which was the best thing -- and possibly the only good thing -- he ever did," Ms. Miller said, noting that Wood was an otherwise undistinguished politician. In the end, admirers of Central Park inspired the movement for state and national parks. And, even then, imitation was the sincerest form of flattery. "Every city in the country," Ms. Miller said, "wanted its own Central Park."

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC: 'SUPERSPREADER'; 
Man's Virus Infects Town, Killing His Family

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: LINHE, China 

 BODY:
In the single-story isolation ward of the Ba Meng Hospital, the medical staff and fellow patients heard Dr. Li Song's plaintive cry as SARS ravaged him and his family a few weeks ago.
"If this is going to kill us," Dr. Li said, "let it take us all together."
 SARS did end the lives of Dr. Li's father, mother and wife. But it ignored his plea and merely ruined his own. 
 Dr. Li, a 40-year-old physician, returned from Beijing in late March carrying the SARS virus to this remote town in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, his family's home. He passed it to almost all of his close relatives. Then, after he finally beat the disease, he was arrested.
The police detained Dr. Li on charges of vandalism and violating an infectious disease law. Whatever the validity of the indictment, he stands at the center of a tragedy that involves as much psychological as physical trauma.
"He worried about how he could go about life if he recovered from SARS," said Li Hong, a close friend and fellow medical worker. "Then on top of everything, they called him a criminal."
SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, originated in China in November, and it has been creating medical, political and economic repercussions ever since. Even as the number of new cases reported each day appears to be peaking, SARS is still stigmatizing its victims.
As with AIDS in its early years, the hysteria associated with SARS is as potent and destructive as the virus itself. American colleges have banned healthy people from Asia from attending graduation ceremonies for their children. 
In China, cities and villages have been turning away travelers from Beijing for fear of catching a virus carried by roughly 1 in 6,000 people in the capital.
Nothing, though, can compare to the stigma attached to being one of what the World Health Organization calls superspreaders, people whose genes, hygiene or colossal misfortune cause them to pass SARS to at least 10, sometimes as many as 70 other people, often starting local epidemics. SARS, in a cruel twist, has proven less deadly for some superspreaders than for people close to them.
The strain of SARS that Dr. Li brought to Linhe was powerful enough to infect six immediate family members, at least nine medical workers and a county propaganda official who rode on a train with Dr. Li. All told, the Linhe area now has more than 100 cases of SARS, many of them traced to the city's first SARS victim, Dr. Li.
Friends and relatives say the disease alternately enraged and depressed Dr. Li during his five weeks in the hospital. He briefly fled his unheated room in this chilly northern town in early April, apparently to try to help family members then falling sick.
When his father later died in the same ward where he was being treated, becoming Linhe's first SARS fatality, Dr. Li cursed the medical staff for providing bad care. He smashed a window and overturned a desk, medical workers said. He then became inconsolable.
"I would call him and try to comfort him," said Zhang Xiaoxia, a longtime friend who stayed in touch by mobile phone. "We knew there was no way his heart could take it.
"Most of the time he could barely talk. Or he would mumble something like, 'I'm talking to you, so I guess that means I'm still alive.' "
Dr. Li, currently locked in the Linhe municipal jail, could not be reached for comment, but relatives and friends described him as a devoted doctor. He worked in the emergency room of a local hospital run by the national railway system. He was the one colleagues consulted when they had medical problems of their own.
Friends nicknamed him "big forehead" for his bookish tendencies. Self-taught in English and acupuncture, he was offered a slot at an elite medical graduate program in the mid-1990's, an opportunity that could have secured him a job at a big-city hospital.
He passed up the chance because it would have meant leaving this mutton and cashmere trading town, situated on an elbow of the Yellow River. Friends said he and his wife thought their infant daughter should grow up in the company of their tight-knit family.
He did attend a training program at the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine this spring. It ended in late March, just as SARS was racing through hospitals in the capital, though health authorities were denying at the time that the disease had become a serious problem.
A few days before his planned return, Dr. Li got a headache, then a fever. Whether he knew he had caught SARS, or even knew at that point what SARS was, is in dispute.
Tian Wenhua, the deputy director of the general office of the Linhe municipal government, said in a telephone interview that Dr. Li knew he had SARS and returned to Linhe anyway, needlessly endangering the city.
"He was confirmed with SARS while he was still in Beijing," Mr. Tian said. Asked how he knew that, Mr. Tian first said that Dr. Li had admitted as much. Then he backtracked and said, "It's what everyone is saying."
Li Rong, Dr. Li's younger brother, called the charge unfounded. "I was at his side constantly after he got back from Beijing," said Mr. Li, who subsequently caught SARS from his brother and is recovering in a Linhe hospital. "He did not have any idea what he had."
Shortly after Dr. Li returned from Beijing, he sought treatment at Linhe's best hospital, Ba Meng, where he was initially placed in the regular respiratory disease ward. That suggested that local doctors had not yet isolated him as a SARS patient.
Even a week after he checked into the hospital, it was unclear what his doctors knew, and what they told Dr. Li, about his ailment. What is undisputed is that on April 8 Dr. Li walked out of Ba Meng Hospital, with his wife by his side. 
He told colleagues that he was frustrated with the medical care and the hospital conditions and was alarmed to hear that his father and mother had taken ill.
"He called and said he was feeling better and had to get out," said Li Hong, the friend at the railway hospital, who is not related to Dr. Li. "He felt he had to help his family somehow."
Hospital staff members urged Dr. Li not to leave, but they did not try to prevent him from walking away, said a person who had been present.
A few hours later, Shan Yuli, the deputy director of the railway hospital, acting on orders from regional authorities, went to fetch Dr. Li. Mr. Shan said that he had explained to Dr. Li that he had a virulent infectious disease -- he said he had not referred to it as SARS -- and that Dr. Li had to return to Ba Meng Hospital and submit to quarantine. Dr. Li followed orders, Mr. Shan said.
Not long after he returned, Dr. Li was joined in the hospital by his father and mother, then his wife, then his two brothers and their wives. A family caretaker caught SARS. So did medical workers at Ba Meng. A chain reaction was under way.
After his father died on April 12, Dr. Li exploded with rage, his friends said, smashing hospital property and, by one account, punching a doctor in the face. He was furious that no one dared to dress his father's body in traditional funeral garb for fear of catching SARS. Several days passed before the body was carted away for cremation.
His anger quickly faded to depression when, before dawn a few days later, doctors rushed into the room Dr. Li shared with his mother and wife and performed an emergency tracheotomy to restore his mother's breathing. She died a short time later. He lost his wife the next day.
Friends who spoke with him said they had done their best to keep his spirits up. His brothers appeared to be recovering, they assured him, and his daughter was eager for him to come home.
"If the thought of suicide went through his mind," Ms. Zhang said, "the responsibility he felt for his daughter kept him alive."
The situation in Linhe continued to deteriorate. Residents stopped leaving their homes except to restock food supplies. Hotels closed their doors. By early May, police officers dressed in medical suits and 12-ply masks blocked exits of the train station and barred outsiders from entering the city.
By the time Dr. Li's health improved in early May, city authorities decided to hold him accountable for malfeasance that they claim worsened the SARS epidemic. They cited the April 8 incident, and subsequent destruction of hospital property, as violations of China's infectious disease law.
Even if Dr. Li knew he had SARS before April 8, it is not clear whether leaving the hospital broke the law. SARS was officially added to the list of diseases requiring mandatory quarantines only on April 14, six days later.
Mr. Tian of the municipal government office acknowledged that the statute in question had not been updated at the time of Dr. Li's alleged infraction. He also said investigators had yet to determine whether anyone who had caught SARS from Dr. Li had done so during the brief period when he had left the hospital. But he said Dr. Li should have known better anyway.
"He is a doctor with knowledge of public health," Mr. Tian said. "He caused this serious situation in Linhe. This is about human lives lost."
A strongly worded article on Dr. Li that ran in People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, suggested a search for a scapegoat. "He knew he had SARS," the article said, but "forced his way out of a quarantine area." It went on, "He spread the virus, caused the death of his parents and wife, and created a serious disturbance in anti-SARS work."
Friends and relatives declined to comment on the case. They said they were searching for a lawyer to represent Dr. Li and would have to trust the judicial system.
Li Rong, his brother, said he understood the impulse to hold an individual responsible for the deadly epidemic. But he says people should realize that it makes no sense to blame victims.
"This is a contagious disease that no one knows how to treat," Mr. Li said. "It cannot be said to be one person's fault."
Linhe, he said, really imported SARS from Beijing. So, Mr. Li asked, "is someone going to indict Beijing?"

HEADLINE: GOVERNOR VETOES INCREASE IN TAXES 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 14 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki signed his name to 119 vetoes today, making good on his pledge to reject the tax increases and much of the new spending proposed by state lawmakers in a budget they passed over his objections.
 Acting just under deadline, the governor said he was striking out $1.3 billion in spending added by the Legislature, and vetoing the entire revenue bill its budget is based on. 
 He said he would leave for later this week any action on a legislative package of $1.7 billion in financial relief for New York City. 
"It's become very clear that in many different areas this budget will not only harm our state's economy," Mr. Pataki said of the Legislature's $92.8 billion plan, "dramatically increase the tax burden, hurt our fiscal condition going forward, but instead of putting these difficult economic and fiscal times behind us, will make them even worse in the future." The plan would be partly financed by a sales tax increase and temporary raise in taxes on the highest-earning New Yorkers.
"Accordingly," he added, "I will be vetoing the tax-and-spend budget plan that the Legislature has passed."
Mr. Pataki made his announcement in an ornate, wood-paneled room in the Capitol. The vetoes were sent to the Assembly around 11:25 p.m., said his spokesman, Joseph E. Conway. The governor said there were "dozens and dozens" of cases in which lawmakers, in their budget, put in language he considered unconstitutional, but he stopped short of promising to take legal action.
Afterward, the state's two top legislative leaders vowed to meet the governor's vetoes with overrides, not only revealing how deep the divisions are in Albany over taxes and spending, but setting the stage for a showdown between the executive and legislative branches.
Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, said Mr. Pataki disengaged from the process early on, failed to lead and lost touch with taxpayers who Mr. Silver said were more afraid of the cuts the governor made than the tax increases the Legislature proposed to pay to restore them.
"In the spirit of cooperation, Democrats and Republicans crafted a bipartisan budget that includes a more sensible financial plan than the one proposed by the governor," Mr. Silver said. He said the Assembly would begin the override process on Thursday morning.
Mr. Silver said the Legislature's plan was constitutional and likened the governor to "the kid who goes to the playground with his basketball and doesn't like the way the results of the game are coming out, so he takes his ball and goes home." He added, "The fact remains, we were elected to govern; we have exercised our constitutional authority."
Joseph L. Bruno, who is the majority leader in the State Senate, and who is usually a strong ally of Mr. Pataki, a fellow Republican, said he believed that the governor was simply on the wrong side of this year's budget battle. "I don't care who you are," Mr. Bruno said. "Even the pope is wrong sometimes."
Mr. Bruno said that the override process could be finished by Friday, and that he would visit the governor to reinforce their partnership. "It is too late in the process for us to start over," he said, responding to Mr. Pataki's plea to resume negotiations.
To override a veto, each house needs a vote of two-thirds of its members. Mr. Silver needs 100 votes from his 150 members, and 103 Assembly members are Democrats. A few of the 47 Republican Assembly members, including Pat M. Casale, of Rensselaer County, have voted with the Democratic members on several of the state's budget bills.
The Senate has 62 members, 38 of them Republicans. Even if some of those refused to back their leader, Mr. Bruno, it would not be difficult to get three or more Democrats to join with them for 41 votes needed to override a veto, said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno.
"There is no change in the resolve of the members and their belief that they did the right thing, and now they are prepared to conclude this process," Mr. McArdle said.
In any case, it will be a moment with historic possibilities. Usually Albany governs by three-men-in-a-room: Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver, who decide issues and get their conferences to rubber-stamp them. The last time a veto was overridden was in 1982, when Gov. Hugh L. Carey, a Democrat, faced the united front of Warren M. Anderson, the Republican Senate majority leader, and Stanley Fink, the Democratic Assembly speaker.
Even in a place known for its byzantine ways, this year's budget process has been particularly dramatic. The budget, which is more than 40 days late, had to address an $11.5 billion shortfall. Mr. Pataki chose to close the gap with borrowing and cuts to education and Medicaid, but no new taxes. Legislators said the cuts were devastating to school districts, hospitals and localities.
But attempts to negotiate a compromise with Mr. Pataki broke down, and two weeks ago, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver shepherded the passage of a budget plan to restore $1.9 billion worth of cuts to education and Medicaid, and to add about $2 billion in new spending.
Mr. Pataki objected to its sales tax increase and a raise in the personal incometax paid by the highest-earning New Yorkers, as well as what he described as overspending that outpaced the new revenues. He also said the budget included $200 million in pork-barrel spending.
In his address, the governor asserted that the Legislature's tax increases would hurt hard-working families. He repeated that claim in a two-minute television commercial that was shown statewide during the evening local news.
On Tuesday, the governor announced his own version of an assistance plan for New York City. It did not include $1.2 billion for schools and Medicaid that the Legislature had restored, and relied heavily on video lottery terminals for revenues instead of higher sales and income taxes.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made clear today which plan he preferred. "It is very clear that the city's best interests are served by the legislative budget restorations and the corresponding city revenue bill, even if it has to be done through an override," he said. "Together, these actions address $2.7 billion of our fiscal needs." 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 16, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Gov. George E. Pataki's veto of tax increases misstated the year the New York State Legislature last overrode a veto. It was this year, on a bill to extend the date for school districts to hold referendums on their budgets; 1982 was the date of the most recent previous override of individual budget items.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: RECONSTRUCTION; 
U.S. Officials Ground an Entrepreneur in Iraq

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 14 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration rushes to jump-start the reconstruction of postwar Iraq, it may want to consider the recent woes of Pete Henderson.
 Mr. Henderson, a South African entrepreneur, thought last week that he had lined up everything he needed to start Air Baghdad, the first commercial air service into and out of Iraq since the war. 
 Mr. Henderson had flight approval from American military commanders to operate his first route between Baghdad and Amman, Jordan. He had a plane and crew. Because armed gangs are attacking and killing road travelers with increasing frequency, he had throngs of customers ready to pay one-way fares of $650. He even had insurance from Lloyd's of London. 
But just as the first passengers were ready to board his 50-seat commuter plane last Thursday, Air Baghdad was grounded. The decision boiled down to this: he was moving too early to make a profit and might get a jump on his competitors.
"No flights for profit or commercial purposes will be approved," wrote Lt. Col. David Jones, the senior adviser on Iraqi civil aviation at the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, in an e-mail message to Mr. Henderson on Tuesday. Any attempt to cloak flights as "humanitarian," he added, "will be dealt with harshly."
Mr. Henderson, sitting in a tent that he has equipped with electricity and high-speed Internet access by satellite, said he was dumbfounded.
"I'm putting up my own money," he said. "I'm offering a service that is badly needed and could save lives. I would have thought people would say, 'Great, glad you're here.' "
Many other entrepreneurs are having the same experience. With ordinary telephone service all but nonexistent in much of the country, and likely to remain so for months, many companies want to roll out cellular phone systems that they say could be operating within weeks.
But American administrators say they will not license any commercial mobile telephone services, even temporarily, until they have a comprehensive regulatory system to govern issues from what they call "interoperability" to telephone numbers. 
Meanwhile, Iraq's biggest pharmaceutical company, Dofar Pharmaceuticals, says it has large inventories of antibiotics and other medicines but remains unable to sell them because it cannot figure out whom to deal with in the American-led office of reconstruction. 
That office, which is supposed to oversee the rebuilding of Iraq, is in the midst of an overhaul. Jay Garner, the retired lieutenant general who has been in charge, is being replaced by L. Paul Bremer III, a presidential envoy.
"It's been very difficult," said one exasperated American business consultant. "You can waste three hours a day walking around the halls trying to talk to people." 
The upshot is that Iraqis are left to rely on their own creativity and limited resources. Small shopkeepers, though enduring horrendous economic conditions, are paying $700 or more for satellite phones so they can order products from other countries or from across town. These phones are not only expensive but also tricky to use because they have to be pointed at a satellite to receive calls.
To make up for the absence of Iraqi television, dark since the war, people have been buying satellite dishes and receivers to pull in signals from Iran, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
But home-grown adaptability goes only so far. Many essential services, from telephones to airlines, require government approval. Many others, including the rebuilding of buildings, utilities and telephone networks, require government money. 
Mr. Henderson, 41, was not looking for government money, but he knew he needed approval. A former television cameraman, he spent most of his career supplying crews and logistical services to news organizations covering the first Persian Gulf war, the Balkan wars and various conflicts in Africa. 
But after selling his company, Newsforce, to France Telecom several years ago, Mr. Henderson settled into comfortable homes in Kenya and Britain. After the United States ousted the Iraqi government, he arrived here to set up satellite communications to the headquarters of the Iraqi National Congress, a party built by returning Iraqi exiles under Ahmad Chalabi.
The urge to set up a commuter air service to Jordan occurred to Mr. Henderson almost five weeks ago. 
The highway from Amman to Baghdad has long been a favored route to Iraq, but it has become increasingly dangerous. In the past few weeks, trucks owned by CNN, CBS and The Associated Press have been attacked, and one CNN employee was shot in the hand. 
Business executives and journalists have become increasingly reluctant to make the drive.
Mr. Henderson first pitched his idea for Air Baghdad to the American Regional Air Mobilization Control Center in Qatar, which approved his plans for a round-trip flight for last Thursday.
But he was blocked by Colonel Jones, who told him that the reconstruction office was waiting for an "assessment" of the airport, due June 1, and that final clearance might take another month after that.
As discussions continued, said Mr. Henderson, Colonel Jones argued that Air Baghdad would get an unfair advantage over competitors if it began operations early. Mr. Henderson then proposed limiting the flights to journalists and designating the flights a humanitarian effort. 
But that fell on deaf ears as well, and on Tuesday Mr. Henderson was pessimistic about carrying off his next scheduled flight on Thursday. 
Other airlines are also trying to offer service to and from Baghdad. British Air said it would be ready to resume flights to the capital by June 1, though it appears unlikely they will stay on schedule if American officials insist on completing their airport assessment by June 1.
In addition, at least two wealthy Iraqi families are organizing their own air service.
The roadblocks to offering mobile telephone service may be even more daunting. Despite the near obliteration of telephone service in Baghdad, and only limited service in other cities, American officials have so far approved only the construction of a private network that could be used by United States government workers, Iraqi government ministries and perhaps some aid agencies.
Stephen Browning, the senior adviser to the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, said this week that commercial services would not be approved for "probably two months, at the minimum."
Mr. Browning said American officials were reluctant to give valuable radio licenses before an interim Iraqi government was in place. 
AT&T, Turkcell of Turkey and several Iraqi entrepreneurs are among many groups that have already organized truckloads of cellular equipment in nearby countries that they could deploy around Baghdad and turn into a functioning system.
Asked why American officials could not simply award cellular licenses that would only be valid for a year or two, allowing the new Iraqi government to issue permanent licenses, Mr. Browning said the decision was outside his control.
"These are decisions that are going to be made in Washington," he said.

HEADLINE: New York Cultural Groups Outline Budget-Cut Toll 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Museum of Art would close some galleries. The Bronx Zoo would close for the winter and charge school groups for the first time in its 104-year history. The American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, would shut it doors two days a week.
 These are some of the painful measures that New York City cultural institutions say they might have to take if Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed budget cuts are approved. The budget is scheduled to be adopted on June 5. It is a bleak picture outlined in a report that these institutions are to release this morning to keep pressure on the city in a time of financial strain. The report was prepared by the Cultural Institutions Group, a league of organizations owned by the city or occupying city land. Its pages catalog potential reductions in hours, programming and employees at 34 institutions. 
 The report warns in particular that as many as 1,000 staff members would have to be dismissed under the mayor's budget plan, adding to the 450 jobs already eliminated in the 2002-3 fiscal year.
To turn up the heat further, the actors Tim Robbins, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis testified before the City Council yesterday afternoon, urging it to protect the arts groups and arguing for the importance of culture to the health of New York.
"Please, please, Mayor Bloomberg, think twice about this cut," Mr. Robbins said.
In Mr. Bloomberg's budget, support for the 34 institutions would be reduced to $77.7 million from $105.6 million. Fourteen arts groups with budgets of $6 million or more would be cut by 35 percent. Twenty groups with budgets of less than $6 million would be cut by 24 percent.
"If New York City is to continue as the cultural capital of the world, and we are to provide meaningful services to students, New Yorkers and the millions of people who visit our city from all over the world, then these institutions need to be maintained at a reasonable level," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group.
"We appreciate the magnitude of the city's budget crisis," added Ms. Hopkins, who is also the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "But these cuts are too deep and will impact the viability of these institutions for years to come."
Kate D. Levin, cultural affairs commissioner for the city, said: "The mayor is totally committed to seeing that New York City preserves its cultural vitality. The fiscal climate makes that a particular challenge. These cultural institutions have difficult choices to make. We're as supportive of their efforts as we could possibly be." 
In making their case, the arts groups argue that culture is a financial engine for the city and crucial to leveraging private financing, which has also declined because of the weak economy.
The report, to be presented at a news conference at El Museo del Barrio on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street in East Harlem, says each dollar the city gives produces $6 in private support and $2 in city taxes. In total the city's culture industry generates more than $2.5 billion year in economic activity, the report says. As a result, the report maintains, the cultural budget cuts could reduce city tax revenues by as much as $50 million annually because of declining payrolls, admission fees and sales.
The cultural groups themselves spend $500 million each year on goods and services within the five boroughs, the report says, and employ more than 10,000 people.
Carnegie Hall alone estimates that its performers generate more than $180 million a year in spending on hotels and restaurants, the report says, and blockbuster shows at the Metropolitan Museum attract more people than major sports events do.
"We had hoped to get back to a break-even position by 2005," said David E. McKinney, president of the Metropolitan Museum. "We see no way to do that now without more severe actions." The museum expects to close galleries on a rotating basis Tuesdays through Thursdays, Mr. McKinney said.
The effect of the impending cuts is already pronounced. Last week the Brooklyn Museum of Art announced that it would close for two weeks this summer in addition to making other reductions. Several institutions might increase admissions fees by as much as 20 percent and make suggested admission fees mandatory.
Arts groups also stress that the more than two million visits each year to cultural institutions by public school children are at risk.
At the New York Hall of Science in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, the budget would mean cuts in employees, services and hours. "It reduces our funding from the city back to the level of 1986, which was the year we opened and were only open nine months," said Dr. Alan J. Friedman, director of the museum. "That's a drastic cut. It will fundamentally change the nature of operations of an institution like ours."

HEADLINE: Mind the Gap 

BYLINE:  By Robert J. Shiller; Robert J. Shiller, professor of economics at Yale, is author, most recently, of "The New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
The Senate debate over President Bush's tax plan has focused so far on the plan's short-term effects, like whether a reduction in the dividend tax will help the stock market. While economic stimulus is important, Congress and the president should also take up an issue with far more consequence for America's long-term growth and stability: economic inequality.
 According to the Census Bureau, the bottom 40 percent of American families earned 18 percent of the national income in 1970, but by 1998 they earned only 14 percent -- and that figure could fall to 10 percent before too long. On a global scale, too, inequality is a problem. Per capita gross domestic product in India in 2000 was only 7 percent of that of the United States, and for China the figure was 11 percent. Such a difference could increase the possibility of greater inequality within America. 
 The prospect of worsening inequality is truly frightening, but in the present political environment, there appears little that can be done. In fact, Washington can act now to help prevent inequality from worsening. Without making any changes in tax rates, it could reform the tax system so that it automatically prevents economic inequality from getting any worse.
The tax cut passed two years ago was fairly conventional. Tax rates and brackets were mostly indexed to the Consumer Price Index. President Bush's current tax plan proposes some minor adjustments in this plan that accelerate the tax reductions.
This basic framework for tax law doesn't make much sense. Instead, future tax brackets and rates should be contingent on the extent of future inequality. Tax law should be based on a principle that might be called inequality insurance: the taxes would be collected in such a way as to insure that the level of inequality, after taxes and transfers, does not exceed the levels present when the law was enacted. If such indexing were put in place today, the brackets and rates would adjust whenever inequality worsened beyond today's levels.
If the nature of the economy changes, and a small number of people capture the lion's share of pretax income, then the tax rates on them would automatically rise, and the tax rates on lower-income people decline, until today's level of inequality was restored. Higher taxes on the high incomes would be imposed exactly at a time when the few are suddenly becoming enriched relative to the many. There would be no delays while politicians debated whether taxes should be raised or cut.
Reframing the tax system in this way could help deal effectively with one of the world's most serious problems, which is the potential for growing inequality. Highly talented, educated and hard-working people living in less developed countries often earn only a small fraction of what their counterparts in advanced countries earn. As Americans increasingly compete on a world market, there is a serious risk that their jobs will be given to people overseas and their incomes will drop precipitously -- producing sudden profit opportunities for other Americans and creating sharp increases in inequality here.
No doubt there would be strident opposition, especially among Republicans, to a tax system that would produce automatic tax increases for the wealthy. But the issue is not just what is best for the wealthy; it is how to create a just society with better opportunities for all. Not even the most antitax Republicans want a gratuitously unequal society that could create resentment and even violence.
Besides, the prospect of future tax increases that are contingent on changes in the distribution of wealth may not be as politically unlikely as it seems. After all, high rates on the very rich would be put in place only after it became much easier to get rich. The new system could be designed so it would always be just as easy for people to attain the same relative economic status that the upper segments of society enjoy today. There is no reason to worry that more wealthy people will feel any less of an incentive to work hard than they do now.
The political argument is true in at least one sense, however: this change will become only more difficult as inequality becomes more pronounced. When the top tenth of the population has attained such a high percentage of society's wealth that it can effectively block any reform, it can be counted on to use its power to keep its riches. America ought to act now to make to sure this never comes to pass.

How Microsoft Warded Off Rival Software

BYLINE:  By THOMAS FULLER, International Herald Tribune 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 14 

 BODY:
At least 90 percent of the world's personal computers run on Windows software. But Microsoft wanted still more.
 Last summer, Orlando Ayala, then in charge of worldwide sales at Microsoft, sent an e-mail message titled Microsoft Confidential to senior managers laying out a company strategy to dissuade governments across the globe from choosing cheaper alternatives to the ubiquitous Windows computer software systems. 
 Mr. Ayala's message told executives that if a deal involving governments or large institutions looked doomed, they were authorized to draw from a special fund to offer the software at a steep discount or even free if necessary. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, was sent a copy of the e-mail message. 
The memo on protecting sales of Windows and other desktop software mentioned Linux, a still small but emerging software competitor that is not owned by any specific company. "Under NO circumstances lose against Linux," Mr. Ayala wrote.
This memo, as well as other e-mail messages and internal Microsoft documents obtained from a recipient of the Microsoft e-mail, offers a rare glimpse these days into the inner workings of Microsoft, the world's largest software company. They spell out a program of tactics that were carried out in recent years, ranging from steep price discounts to Microsoft employees lying about their identities at trade shows.
The Microsoft campaign against Linux raises questions about how much its aggressive, take-no-prisoners corporate culture has changed, despite having gone through a lengthy, reputation-tarnishing court battle in the United States that resulted in Microsoft's being found to have repeatedly violated antitrust laws.
Perhaps most important, certain discounts may run afoul of European market regulators, who are still investigating accusations that Microsoft abused their antitrust laws.
Discounting is a perfectly normal corporate practice. But under European law, companies that hold a dominant market position like Microsoft are prohibited from offering discounts that are aimed at blocking competitors from the market. Microsoft has been concerned with the legality of its discounts in the past, consulting a London law firm on a specific discount plan in 1998, before it was determined in court that the company had a monopoly in desktop operating systems.
In a telephone interview today, Jean-Philippe Courtois, the chairman of Microsoft's operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, defended the use of the special fund described in Mr. Ayala's e-mail message, saying it was part of a strategy to be "competitive" and "relevant" in the market for big government and education deals.
"Linux is obviously a key competitor," Mr. Courtois said. Rivals use similar tactics, he said.
Sun Microsystems, for example, "is giving away StarOffice to basically governments and schools," he said. The Sun suite of programs runs on both Windows and Linux operating systems.
Mr. Courtois said that Microsoft sometimes gave software to "very low-income countries." He cited a program where Microsoft donated software in South Africa and helped train teachers to use it.
Mr. Ayala's memo said that the discounts could be offered to "developed and developing countries," and that an "initial focus" was being put on Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, India and China.
In his e-mail message, he focused on governments and large institutions buying mostly desktop software. A separate memo described a discounting program for corporate customers worldwide.
Two days after Mr. Ayala sent his e-mail message, Michael Sinneck, the executive in charge of Microsoft's services department, sent a message giving details of a program to provide corporate clients with discounts on the hourly rates charged by Microsoft's consulting business.
The memo said nearly $180 million had been allocated in the 2003 fiscal year, which ends in June, for this purpose alone. Of that, $140 million was earmarked for consulting services for server software, an area where Microsoft has a growing share of the market but still faces lively competition, particularly from big companies like I.B.M. that are promoting Linux as an alternative to Microsoft Windows.
Servers are the powerful computers used by corporations to store data, manage Web sites and perform other network tasks. The software that runs servers is the subject of one of the two antitrust cases currently open against Microsoft in the European Community. In broad terms, Microsoft is accused of illegally leveraging its overwhelming dominance of the PC software market into the server market.
European antitrust laws are generally stricter than comparable American laws, but the Microsoft practices described in the memos may raise red flags for regulators in the United States as well.
In June 2001, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws by bullying business partners and rivals to thwart any competitive challenge to Windows. Later that year, Microsoft reached a settlement with the Bush administration, agreeing not to use its monopoly power in PC software, including pricing deals and contract terms, to effectively force PC makers to favor Microsoft products over competing offerings.
Among the documents is an e-mail message from an outside lawyer, Bill Allan of the London-based firm Linklaters, to Microsoft that offers a precise interpretation of European Community law on the matter of discounts, including the view that short-term discounting would be more likely to escape scrutiny. The message, from 1998, advised Microsoft that its discounts should not discriminate between clients and that discounts could not be aimed at excluding competitors from the market.
"Discounts are not per se unlawful," Charles Stark, a former antitrust official at the Justice Department and a partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Brussels, said in an interview. "It depends on the market circumstances and how they use them and what their impact is." 
Mr. Stark, who has not seen the documents, pointed out that under European law "pricing behavior can be viewed differently by a dominant firm than by a nondominant firm."
Asked whether the discounting program for server software consulting was legal in Europe, given Microsoft's position, Mr. Courtois, the Microsoft executive, said that consulting was a "break even" business.
"We are not a global services company," he said. "We need to compete against the big guys."
Mr. Courtois cited I.B.M. and Oracle as companies with large consulting businesses.
The Microsoft documents show the preoccupation among top managers with countering the open-source movement, a group of programmers who want the software that runs computers to be offered free of charge. The codes behind open-source software are developed openly by independent teams of programmers, allowing companies to customize their programs and paying for services to make the software perform better. This is in stark contrast to Microsoft, which keeps most of its source code secret -- although governments and some corporations are increasingly allowed to view the code.
Linux, the biggest open-source threat to Microsoft, has a tiny share of the market for personal computer software. But Linux was installed in 26 percent of the large data-serving computers sold last year that power corporate networks and the Internet, according to International Data, a market research company. Microsoft's Windows was the operating system on 44 percent of the servers.
The server market is one area where Linux appears to have some momentum. The use of Linux is also being supported by a handful of Microsoft rivals and encouraged by many governments, especially in Europe, as a cheaper and perhaps more secure alternative to Windows software. The French, for example, have a Web site that recommends Linux systems for government departments. 
Mr. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, once referred to Linux's licensing as "a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches."
In the face of this competition, the Microsoft documents show the significant resources the company devotes -- and the unconventional tactics it sometimes uses -- to combat Linux.
Chris O'Rourke, a Microsoft employee, described attending LinuxWorld, a trade fair in California, where he "purported to be an independent computer consultant" working with several public school districts, according to an e-mail message he sent on Aug. 20, 2002.
"In general, people bought this without question," Mr. O'Rourke wrote. "Hook, line and sinker."
He said his goal was to glean intelligence about the competition. His guise, Mr. O'Rourke said, "got folks to open up and talk." Mr. O'Rourke did not respond to a fax and voice mail message seeking comment.
Another employee, Todd Brix, said in an e-mail message that he attended a Linux conference in June 2001 in San Jose, Calif., pretending to be an "ambivalent OEM." Original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.'s, are companies like Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer that buy Windows software licenses.
Reached at his office on Tuesday, Mr. Brix said that when attending such a show, "you don't broadcast that you're a Microsoft person."
"You don't disguise that fact," he said. "You just don't lead with your chin."
In his message, Mr. Brix described the technical issues discussed at the show and said the tone of the meeting "was an even mix of Local Union hall teamster gathering, Christian Scientist revival and Amway sales conference."
Of all the Microsoft tactics described in the internal messages, the two discount programs appear to be the most aggressive -- and perhaps the most legally questionable.
Mr. Ayala sent his memo at 8:17 a.m. on July 16, 2002. In addition to Mr. Ballmer, the recipients included two Microsoft vice presidents -- James Allchin and Jeffrey S. Raikes -- along with some of the company's top lawyers and the general managers of Microsoft's operations in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 
Mr. Ayalawrote that in today's "difficult economic environment" some institutions and companies were focusing on cheaper software."
"It is important," he continued, "that we have a way to address large PC purchases that involve low-cost/no-cost competitors in the education (and government) sectors, especially in emerging markets." 
The solution, he wrote, was to "tip the scales" toward Microsoft in these deals by using the special fund, which he called the Education and Government Incentive Program. 
The fund was to be used "only in deals we would lose otherwise," Mr. Ayala said.
When he wrote the memo, Mr. Ayala was a quite high-level executive at Microsoft, reporting directly to Mr. Ballmer. He was in charge of sales and marketing and responsible for roughly 22,000 of the more than 50,000 Microsoft employees. 
In March, Mr. Ayala was transferred to lead a new division that focuses on small and medium-size companies. This new push is one of Microsoft's top priorities. Mr. Ayala was not available to comment.
In his separate e-mail message, Mr. Sinneck, the Microsoft services executive, wrote that the consulting fund would be used to cover the difference between the "discounted customer rate and the standard services billing rate per hour."
Reached this week, Larry Meadows, marketing manager for Microsoft's services group at company headquarters in Redmond, Wash., said the fund could be used "anywhere it needs to be."
"There's not really a limit to say that you can use it only in certain geographies," Mr. Meadows added.
He said the funds would be used again in the next fiscal year that begins in July.

HEADLINE: Britain Is Reported to Have Decided Against Adopting the Euro 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 14 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, often depicted as rivals for the future leadership of Britain, met today to debate whether this country should adopt the euro, inspiring news reports that a decision had been reached against adopting the single currency.
 If confirmed, the reports on BBC television tonight would represent a landmark decision by Mr. Blair -- long seen as a supporter of the euro -- to accept Mr. Brown's assessment that the British economy is not ready for euro membership and thus postpone a decision to ask Britons to vote in a referendum on abandoning the cherished pound sterling. 
 In terms of European and domestic politics, a decision to reject moves toward euro membership would eclipse even Britain's decision to join the United States in invading Iraq as a defining moment of Mr. Blair's leadership. Such a decision would dilute Britain's claim to influence the Continent's future and underscore its reluctance to pay the price of full membership in a European club of nations. 
Indeed, for all the talk of economic assessments tonight, any decision on the euro is likely to be driven by the politics of Britain's national identity, with the pound sterling acting as an icon of independence.
Ten Downing Street, Mr. Blair's office, dismissed the BBC's assertion tonight that, in days of talks culminating today, the prime minister had accepted Mr. Brown's assessment that Britain had not met certain economic tests of its suitability for adoption of the 12-nation euro.
"Very few people know what's going on and the BBC is not one of them," a Downing Street spokesman said. "The government has nothing to say on this topic until the economic assessment is published." 
Asked if that constituted a denial, the spokesman said, "It says what it says." The government has not yet said when Mr. Brown's economic assessment will be made public.
The BBC report did not make clear whether Mr. Brown had agreed to make a new series of economic assessments before the next election, which must take place by 2006.
After his return to power for a second term in 2001, Mr. Blair set a two-year deadline for a series of economic evaluations of the likely impact of euro membership on British employment, foreign investment, the financial services industry and the the flexibility of euro nations to absorb economic shocks.
The tests are also supposed to determine whether interest rates and other indicators in the British and Continental European economies are coming into alignment. Britain currently has slightly higher growth and much lower unemployment than the major euro economies, including those of France and Germany.
Under the deadline, Mr. Brown has until June 7 to say publicly whether he believes euro membership would favor the British economy.
In recent months, Mr. Brown has broadened his anti-euro objections to include the slow pace of reform in Continental Europe's sluggish economies and the overall economic stewardship of the euro countries. Tonight, he was also said to have suggested that the booming housing market in Britain, where more people own their own homes than in Continental Europe, had added to arguments against the euro.
Mr. Brown's opposition to the euro -- a stance that mirrors the views of two-thirds of Britons in opinion surveys -- was well known before tonight, and Mr. Blair had long said he would respect the chancellor's economic assessment.

HEADLINE: With Plan for State Aid, Senate Republicans Gain Crucial Democratic Vote on Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
A bipartisan group of senators reached agreement with Republican leaders today on a financial aid package for the states, adding a crucial Democratic vote to President Bush's plan for eliminating taxes on dividends.
 Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a fiscally conservative Democrat, said he would support the temporary repeal of the dividend tax favored by Mr. Bush's allies, now that Republican leaders had agreed to give $20 billion to struggling state governments. With at least three Republican senators balking at supporting the tax cut, Mr. Nelson's vote, along with that of Senator Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia, could give Republicans 50 votes for the cut. Vice President Dick Cheney could then break the tie. 
 It is not clear, though, whether Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, a pivotal Republican who has expressed doubts about the president's plan, will support the dividend proposal when it comes to a final vote on Thursday. Republican leaders said tonight that their plan would pass if it had Mr. Voinovich's support. 
The dividend plan proposed by the president's allies in the Senate, led by Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, differs sharply from the one approved by the Senate Finance Committee last week. Where the committee voted to limit the amount of dividends that could be taxed, the new plan would eliminate half of the dividend tax this year, then eliminate the full tax for the next three years. To stay within the tax-cut limit of $350 billion adopted by the Senate, last month, the tax would be reinstated in 2007. Republicans say they would work to cut it entirely before then.
Mr. Nickels said criticism of the four-year provision as a gimmick was "hogwash." He said the period would be a good test for the president's plan.
"If I'm wrong, and the stock market doesn't have any positive effect, if this is not a positive thing for the economy, we'll know it after three years," he said. "For me, it makes sense to try it."
Republicans said it was important to them to get some form of a repeal of the dividend tax into the final Senate bill to provide extra leverage for the idea when the bill is reconciled with the House version, which would cut taxes by $550 billion, in a joint conference next week. The House dropped the idea of repealing the tax, preferring instead to reduce the tax on both dividends and capital gains. House leaders have said the idea of eliminating the tax and then restoring it is unworkable.
To get the support of centrist senators needed for the dividend plan, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, and other top officials agreed today to the $20 billion aid package for states and cities. The plan would give $10 billion to states to offset higher Medicaid costs, $6 billion in unrestricted grants to states and $4 billion in unrestricted grants to cities and counties. Mr. Nelson said that amount was enough to satisfy him.
"We've got states removing kids from the health care rolls, and seniors worried that they'll lose their nursing homes," he said in an interview. "This assistance will go a long way to resolving those problems. I made it clear that I would support the dividend exclusion if we could get that state fiscal relief, and having done that, I guess I'd better be prepared to take yes for an answer."
With most states struggling with budget gaps and declining tax revenues, the issue of federal aid has become a subject of passionate debate on Capitol Hill. Many Republicans who oppose increased federal spending have said that impending tax increases by state governments could counteract the economic stimulus of the federal tax cuts they favor. Democrats, seeking to reclaim the issue from the centrist Republicans, say that a $20 billion aid package is too small to deal with the financial crisis, and introduced an amendment to the tax bill today that would double that amount.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said elimination of the dividend tax, which she supports, would nonetheless add to the financial woes of the states by depriving them of at least $8 billion in tax revenue. That increases the responsibility of the federal government to help the states, Ms. Collins said.
But assisting the states, which has broad support in the Senate, has provoked little interest from the Republicans who run the House. Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said repeatedly last week that many states got themselves in trouble by profligate spending during flush times, and should not expect help from federal taxpayers now. At the same time, the White House has declined to take a stand on the issue, though Donald L. Evans, the secretary of commerce, suggested this morning that state aid might be the price for a tax cut.
"It was not in the president's plan," Mr. Evans said, when asked about the aid package. "But the administration understands there's a process that takes place in Congress, which is under way. We'll continue to work with the House and Senate to make sure the basic elements and goals of the president's plans are in the final bill."
If House Republicans insist on stripping out the state aid in a joint conference with the Senate next week, it will be almost impossible to win final approval of the tax bill in the Senate. 
Democrats proposed a variety of amendments today that would mostly have the effect of reducing or killing the tax cut plan. One amendment, introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, would block the reduction of the top tax rate until seniors have a prescription drug plan equal to that of federal employees. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts proposed paying for extra unemployment insurance by stopping a tax cut to the wealthiest taxpayers.
But Republicans said that taxes for the rich must be cut in order to energize the economy. 
"You've got to remember," said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, "that it takes people with money to create jobs."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: SECURITY COUNCIL; 
U.N. Vote on Iraq Authority Is Due Next Week, U.S. Says

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 14 

 BODY:
During a day of cordial but persistent Security Council questioning about the legal ramifications of a new draft resolution lifting sanctions and recognizing the forces that attacked Iraq as the legal authority in Iraq, the United States ambassador said today that he expected a vote on the measure next week.
 Speaking to reporters during a break in the day-long private consultations on Iraq, the envoy, John D. Negroponte, said that a new text answering some questions would be presented Thursday. The resolution unveiled last week was proposed by the United States, Britain and Spain. 
 Then he added: "We expect sometime during the course of next week -- we haven't yet determined exactly when -- we would expect to put the resolution to a vote. So for us, the most important point is that we think we need to move quickly. The sanctions need to be lifted as soon as possible."
But the sense of urgency the remarks seemed designed to infuse into the process was balanced by signals from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell -- who was meeting in Moscow with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov -- that Russia is resisting the sponsors' desire to leave United Nations weapons inspectors out of the process. "There are still outstanding issues," Mr. Powell said after the meeting.
It was unclear yesterday whether the United States push for speed, driven in part, Mr. Negroponte said, by the need to begin emptying full oil storage tanks, will help or hurt in its drive to achieve consensus. Originally, United States officials had suggested a June 3 horizon for final agreement.
At the Council meeting today, questions focused on a broad range of issues, but they were particularly pointed on three elements of the resolution.
One was how much, if any, independent authority would be given to a proposed United Nations special representative in Iraq. 
The German envoy, Gunter Pleuger, told reporters today, "The important issues are how the political process is being organized." He added: "The cosponsors said that the United Nations should have a vital role. Now we have to add substance to this."
Another issue was whether the proposed checks on the ability to spend Iraqi oil revenues -- an advisory board with full access to accounts but no supervisory authority -- were sufficient.
Perhaps most important for some Council members, one diplomat said after the meeting, was the portion of the resolution giving Britain and the United States, and possibly other countries, internationally recognized status as the legal "authority" controlling the country.
"The Security Council would be legitimizing the occupation of the territory and state functions of one member by a group of other members," said one diplomat, explaining the legal precedent that made some envoys uncomfortable. "That has never happened before."
A related issue raised in the closed session, according to three people present, was whether the Council has the authority to expand on the provisions of the Geneva Conventions governing the responsibilities and limitations of "occupying powers."
A United States official, speaking on condition that his name not be used, said he believed that the resolution and the actions of the United States complied with these conventions.

HEADLINE: Tom DeLay Stars in Texas Donnybrook 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
Those close to Tom DeLay say he always harbored a secret ambition to be speaker of the House -- of the Texas House, that is. 
 Mr. DeLay, majority leader of the United States House of Representatives and former state legislator who loves the rough and tumble of Texas politics, has touched off a rumble in his home state with his push for a new districting map that would almost certainly hand Republicans four or more additional seats in Congress, at the expense of Democrats. 
 In addition to virtually shutting down the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature, the dispute has brought bitter sniping in Washington between Mr. DeLay and House Democrats from Texas, who accused him today of Nixonian tactics. The Democrats pointed to his suggestion on Tuesday that it would be fine to deploy federal authorities to track down more than 50 Democratic legislators who had fled the Texas House for Oklahoma and so deprived the chamber of a quorum. 
"Not since Richard Nixon and Watergate 30 years ago has there been an effort to involve federal law enforcement officials in a partisan political battle," said Representative Martin Frost, one Texas Democrat whom Mr. DeLay would like ousted. Mr. Frost dubbed the majority leader Tom Nixon DeLay.
Democrats also fired off a letter to the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security asking whether any federal resources had been used in pursuit of the Democratic legislators holed up in Oklahoma. Those lawmakers headed across the state line on Monday when, after they had bolted the Texas House, Speaker Tom Craddick ordered their arrest and return. (That order was effectively lifted today when the House, which since Monday had been in a state of "standing at ease," finally adjourned, as it typically does at the end of every day. Adjournment allowed Republicans to hold committee hearings, and lifted the "call on the House," under which state troopers had been required to round up the missing Democrats.)
Mr. DeLay's reopening the Congressional districting process is a good example of the bare-knuckles politics he likes to practice. Congressional redistricting typically occurs only every 10 years, after the census. Undertaking it in between times, in what amounts to midstream, is aggressive and rare; Democrats say that except for a more modest effort this year by Colorado Republicans -- an effort that is itself headed for the courts -- they can find no other time in the last 50 years when a state engaged in midstream redistricting without a court order to do so.
Mr. DeLay and his allies say the Legislature is only fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. They note that the proposed map would replace one drawn by a panel of federal judges after the last census but before the 2002 election, when the Legislature was unable to decide on one of its own. The judges' map, they say, was based on the previous map, drawn up by Mr. Frost, a leading Texas Democrat, at a time more than 10 years ago when his party controlled the Legislature.
"This redistricting decision is one the Legislature is obligated to do," said one Texas Republican, Representative John Culberson, a former state legislator who challenged his Democratic colleagues on the House floor here today.
Mr. DeLay also frames the quest for a new map as an example of democracy in action: it would give Republicans a majority of the Congressional delegation in a state where they control all statewide offices and both houses of the Legislature. At present, the delegation has a Democratic majority, 17 to 15.
The absent state lawmakers are described by Mr. DeLay as cowards and shirkers. "Representatives are elected and paid for by the people," he said, "with the expectation that they show up for work and do the people's business and have the courage to cast tough votes."
Congressional Democrats maintain that what Mr. DeLay is really doing is protecting his own job, by using his considerable muscle in Texas as a cushion against the possibility of Republican losses in House elections elsewhere next year. Colorado has just completed its remapping, which would bolster a Republican seat, and Republicans have similarly eyed Georgia but met resistance from Democratic legislators.
"It is easier, I think, for Tom to manipulate these lines, whether it is Texas or Colorado or Georgia, than it is to win elections," said Representative Lloyd Doggett, another Texas target of Mr. DeLay. 
The whole matter will no doubt wind up in court if the Legislature adopts the proposed map. In the meantime, Mr. DeLay's chief spokesman, Stuart Roy, seemed not overly concerned today when Democrats lined up at a news conference to take on the majority leader.
"Today's speakers line," said Mr. Roy, mindful of Democratic lawmakers who might be out of a job under a new map, "is tomorrow's unemployment line."

HEADLINE: A Tilt to the Right, a Nod to the National G.O.P. 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 14 

 BODY:
Six months after he won re-election as a liberal Republican, Gov. George E. Pataki today cemented his reputation as a fiscal conservative, vetoing tax and spending increases the Legislature had passed.
 Mr. Pataki insists he has no political reasons for his recent march to the right and says he has never been a proponent of big government. For his entire career, he says, he has consistently opposed higher taxes and onerous government regulation. In his view, he is merely standing up for principle by fighting the Legislature and risking the ignominy of an override vote, he says. 
 The governor also argues that just because he approved lavish spending on education and health programs in recent years does not mean he ever abandoned his roots as a conservative when it comes to taxation. 
"It's very simple," he said today, when asked about his political drift to the right since the election. "In good times, it's easy for everybody to avoid making tough decisions."
Yet Mr. Pataki's stand against taxes has affected his political fortunes, both inside the state and on the national level. Conservatives and right-wing Republicans in New York feel he has come home, after several years in which they feared he was transforming into a liberal on the model of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
On the national level, his fight with the Legislature over tax increases has burnished his image as a Republican in the mold of President Bush, at least on economic questions.
"It's always popular with the conservative base of the party to wage a fight against taxes," said Nelson Warfield, a conservative Republican political consultant in Washington. "It gives him a nice story to tell a national audience."
The governor has chosen to take a hard line on raising taxes despite polls showing it is an unpopular position in a state where Republicans are a minority. He and his aides have also taken pains to point out repeatedly that he is one of a few governors in the nation, from either party, to propose solving a fiscal crisis without raising broad-based taxes.
As he has taken a beating in New York for his proposed cuts to school aid and medical services, Mr. Pataki has tried to enlist help from Grover G. Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that works closely with the White House.
"He called me," Mr. Norquist said. "He said, 'I'm going to fight this. I need some help from antitax groups.' "
These moves have fueled speculation in Albany that Mr. Pataki harbors an ambition to become part of the Bush administration, a theory he and his aides deny. They say he has long been a supporter of President Bush. And this year he has made his stand against raising taxes because he truly believes that higher taxes will hurt the economy and drive jobs out of the state, Lisa Dewald Stoll, his spokeswoman, said.
Still, the fact that Mr. Pataki asked to meet Mr. Norquist suggests that he wants to cultivate a positive image among national Republicans. 
"Grover Norquist is well known as a White House favorite, and he could very well be sending a message from the White House political team," said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist in Washington. "I think the message is that economic conservatives around the country are watching." 
But other Republican strategists and elected officials see another motive. Neither the budget Mr. Pataki had proposed, nor the one passed by the Legislature, is balanced. Both rely on $4.2 billion in borrowing, which means the state will face a deficit again next year in any case. If the Legislature overrides him, he can blame legislators for the mess.
"He just wants to distance himself from the huge fiscal problems attendant on the state," said one Republican legislator, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "He's just trying to solidify in the public's mind that somehow it's not George Pataki who did this."
Aides to Mr. Pataki acknowledge he is more concerned about being vindicated in the long run by public opinion than he is about winning the looming override battle, a fight he appears to be losing today. 
Mr. Pataki's rhetoric on taxes, meanwhile, is music to the ears of many Republicans upstate, who had begun to tire of his liberal stands on abortion, gun control, gay rights and other issues. "We are down 2.1 million in enrollment from the Democrats," said Robert E. Davis, the Erie County Republican chairman. "We have to stand for something different than the Democrats. I'm glad he's standing tall."
Whether it is intentional or not, Mr. Pataki's antitax crusade also puts him in a better position to try for national office. Raising taxes would have extinguished that possibility, political strategists say. "Now he's still an option," Mr. Warfield said.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
Bush and New President Of South Korea Are Vague On North Korea Strategy

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
President Bush and South Korea's new president, Roh Moo Hyun, emerged tonight from their first meeting declaring that the two countries "will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea." But in a series of vague diplomatic statements they stepped around serious differences about whether to isolate the country with an economic embargo or threaten it with a military strike.
 Appearing in the Rose Garden this evening, the two men said they had developed a quick friendship that would aid them in one of the tensest standoffs in the region in decades. In sharp contrast to the kind of language he used about Iraq and Saddam Hussein when foreign leaders visited him earlier this year, Mr. Bush did not publicly demand today that North Korea open itself up to inspections or stop producing bomb-grade material, and he never uttered the name of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il. 
 "We're making good progress toward achieving that peaceful resolution of the issue of the Korean Peninsula in regards to North Korea," Mr. Bush said as he and Mr. Roh, a former human rights lawyer and legislator, talked briefly to reporters. 
They did not take questions and did not specify what kind of progress Mr. Bush was referring to.
On Monday, North Korea said it had "nullified" an agreement with South Korea committing to keep the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free. But the statements fit a White House strategy, aides said, of playing down the North Korean threat, and demonstrating to Mr. Kim that the United States would not give in to what Mr. Bush recently called blackmail.
Nonetheless, the differences in strategy were clearly evident today.
This morning, in an advertisement paid for by the South Korean government, Mr. Roh was described as seeking American agreement to "rule out a military option" in confronting the North, a reference to the Pentagon's longtime contingency plan to knock out the North Korean nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
But today both the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said it would be unwise to rule out the use of military force, even while pursuing a peaceful resolution of the problem. 
"No one should be willing to give in to the kind of blackmail that the North Koreans have been practicing on the world for a number of years now, especially not the United States," Ms. Rice told reporters today. 
She said the president reserved all his military options, though she added that Mr. Bush might be willing to engage in another round of negotiations with the North Koreans, after a meeting in Beijing last month in which the North declared that it already possessed weapons, and had turned 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods into bomb-grade plutonium.
"We are not fearful of talks, and if we believe that they are useful at some point in time we would be more than willing to re-enter them," Ms. Rice said. 
Mr. Roh said on Monday that he would seek to have the United States delay any redeployment of American troops from the border with North Korea until the nuclear issue was resolved. He also said it was far too early to discuss economic quarantine measures that would cut off the North's exports of missiles, drugs and counterfeit currency, all of which are widely believed to give the nation a steady supply of hard currency.
But a senior American official, speaking tonight after the 40-minute conversation between the leaders had ended in the Oval Office, said that the issues had not come up directly. Asked if Mr. Roh had sought Mr. Bush's assurance that American force would not be used, the official said, "He didn't ask for it." 
He said they did not discuss an embargo, either, though other American officials say the planning for intercepting North Korean ships at sea is now quite advanced.
But before that effort could become effective it would require the participation of Japan, South Korea and, most important, China. Mr. Roh has made it clear that he believes it is too early to consider such a provocative step, which North Korea has called tantamount to war. 
"There isn't an on-off switch here," one senior official said tonight, suggesting that the United States and other countries might gradually increase the pressure on North Korea.
This was Mr. Roh's first visit to the United States and an important one to him: he wrote a book about Abraham Lincoln, and Mr. Bush took him on a tour this evening of the Lincoln Bedroom, showing him the White House copy of the Emancipation Proclamation and other Lincoln artifacts. The men then had dinner with members of their cabinets. 
The joint statement that the men issued tonight was deliberately vague on the question of when and how pressure could be increased on North Korea.
"While noting that increased threats to peace and stability on the peninsula would require consideration of further steps," the statement said, Mr. Bush and Mr. Roh "expressed confidence that a peaceful resolution can be achieved."
The vague wording reflects the differing approaches to the problem within the two countries. Mr. Roh said in an interview on Monday that any threats to North Korea could scare away investors and undercut the fragile South Korean economy. At a moment when many of the countries' largest conglomerates, known in Korea as chaebol, are in crisis, that is a problem Mr. Roh can ill afford.
Mr. Bush's team, for its part, is deeply divided. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell pushed hard, over the objection of administration hard-liners, to open negotiations with North Korea. 
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and members of Vice President Dick Cheney's staff have pressed for a much harder line. Mr. Rumsfeld circulated a memorandum several weeks ago seeking an administration strategy to get China to join in an economic embargo intended to bring down Mr. Kim's Communist government. Chinese officials have said they think that would be a disastrous course, leading to instability and a flood of refugees.
Mr. Roh said on Monday that he was coming to Washington "concerned" about the hard-liners in the administration, adding that "many people are concerned that President Bush's 'peaceful resolution' principle may change in the future, despite his assurance otherwise." 
But tonight, after meeting Mr. Rumsfeld and then Mr. Bush, he told reporters: "When I left Korea, I had both concerns and hopes in my mind. Now, after having talked to President Bush, I have gotten rid of all my concerns." 
That statement was viewed as important to the White House, because the administration's first meeting with Mr. Roh's predecessor, Kim Dae Jung, in 2001 was widely considered a diplomatic disaster. The two men split sharply on how to deal with the North, and never re-engaged in serious talks. A rift opened between Mr. Powell and administration hawks that foreshadowed later clashes on Iraq and other issues.

HEADLINE: Interpublic Agrees to Sell Research Unit 

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
After months of negotiations, the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its NFO WorldGroup research division to Taylor Nelson Sofres in London.
 The sale, which is expected to close in the summer pending regulatory approval, is part of efforts by Interpublic to reduce debt as it grapples with financial and operational difficulties. 
 The price, $435 million in cash, stock and future considerations, is much lower than the estimated $625 million in stock and assumed debt that Interpublic paid for NFO three years ago. It is also lower than initial estimates of a potential sale price, which ranged as high as $500 million to $600 million. But, it is in line with expectations that were diminished recently after NFO's performance and profits softened measurably in the first quarter. 
Taylor Nelson, a research specialist company, is paying $400 million in cash for NFO and $25 million in new shares. If the stock achieves certain price targets, Interpublic will receive an additional $10 million in cash next year. Interpublic said it expected an accounting gain of $100 million on the sale.
Taylor Nelson had been identified in late March as the leading contender to acquire NFO over other interested parties that at various times included the Aegis Group, Ipsos, United Business Media and the WPP Group, all in London. Goldman Sachs advised Interpublic, and Deutsche Bank advised Taylor Nelson.
"The sale of NFO will be a capstone to the significant progress we have recently made in strengthening our company's balance sheet," said David Bell, chairman and chief executive at Interpublic. Those efforts included raising $800 million in a convertible debt offering and retiring $582.5 million in zero-coupon bonds. Interpublic also expects to complete the renewal of a $500 million, one-year credit line with several banks this week.
Nevertheless, Fitch Ratings in New York downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of Interpublic to junk status yesterday, making Fitch the second rating service to do so after Standard & Poor's.
The downgrading, to BB+ from BBB-, is the second by Fitch in five months. It reflects what Fitch called "a continuing decline in the operating performance" of Interpublic, as well as "expectations that improvements to the balance sheet in 2003 will be more limited than previously anticipated" after a gloomy first-quarter report last week that included an unexpected net loss at the agency company.
Shares of Interpublic, down sharply from their 52-week high of $34.05, closed yesterday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $11.96, up 4 cents. Shares of Taylor Nelson rose 16.5 percent in trading on the London Stock Exchange, to 158.5 pence ($2.55), after analysts said the acquisition was made at a reasonable price and would strengthen Taylor Nelson's market research offerings as well as contribute quickly to earnings.

As Artists Move In, Can a Gritty Town Adapt?

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
SO why did David A. Ross, the former director of the Whitney Museum and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, buy a second home in the scrappy river town of Beacon, N.Y., where the Main Street is still dotted with boarded-up storefronts and a quarter of an acre is considered a generous amount of property? Isn't Sag Harbor more his speed?
 There was, to be sure, the inimitable landscape surrounding the Hudson River, which he now can spy from the turreted writing room at the top ofhis house. ("There's a reason there were the Hudson River painters, not the Long Island painters," he said.) 
 There was also the house itself, an 1892 Queen Anne with "beautiful bones" that he grabbed up last spring for a "ridiculously low price."
But the big draw was Dia:Beacon, the long-awaited, much-heralded museum set to open on the riverfront on Sunday. With monumental works spread out luxuriously across a quarter of a million square feet of space in a former cracker box factory, Dia:Beacon will, overnight, become the largest museum of contemporary art in the world. 
"It's something that's five minutes from my house," Mr. Ross said. "To think that I can go and spend time with these great works of art is an incalculable benefit of being here. It's the real reason." 
Even before the curtain rises, the anticipation of Dia:Beacon has worked a radical transformation on this city of 16,000, bringing people like Mr. Ross, along with artists and entrepreneurs, to a place that was, by all accounts, seedy and dangerous not 10 years ago.
Once the hat-making capital of the region, Beacon went into free fall when people stopped wearing hats and heavy industry along the river gave way to high-tech jobs inland. Drug dealers conducted business in the open, and gun fights erupted on the otherwise listless Main Street, according to longtime residents.
There was a trickle of antique stores and artists before 1999, when Dia announced its plans to locate here. For a while, it looked as if Beacon, in southern Dutchess County, would end up like so many other Hudson River towns -- a mixed bag of stores selling antiques and bric-a-brac.
After Dia's announcement, Beacon veered off in an arty direction and never turned back. On a recent Sunday, a new dining spot in a sliver of space on Main Street, Allagash Cafe, captured the city's changing face. A Celtic harpist plinked an ethereal tune while a young woman with purple hair sipped strong coffee at the bar. An Italian greyhound sat obediently nearby while its owner finished his eggs.
"There had been artists coming in and then Dia kicked the whole thing into high gear," Mayor Clara Lou Gould said. 
In the last three years, 17 art galleries have opened. Artists from places like Williamsburg, Brooklyn, have packed up their live-work lofts and relocated, attracted by the cheap housing, ethnic and racial diversity and easy commute to New York City (one hour and 12 minutes on a Metro North express). 
A modest number have bought second homes, but real estate agents expect that trend to grow once Dia:Beacon opens. 
There are grand plans, too, for projects that approach Dia:Beacon in scope and ambition. Mr. Ross has teamed up with William S. Ehrlich, a real estate developer and art collector, to create a repository for private art collections, to be called the Beacon Art Society. 
The two men intend to renovate a crumbling yet beautiful factory building on the rushing Fishkill Creek for the "private art museum," as Mr. Ross calls it, as well as an inn, conference center, restaurant and housing. 
"It will be a place where collectors can both store and exhibit their work, privately or publicly," Mr. Ross said. "It's about collectors learning from their collections and working with them." 
Mr. Ehrlich's company, Beacon Terminal Associates, has already bought more than 20 properties across the city's nearly five square miles. Of those, eight properties are single-family houses that Mr. Ehrlich has renovated. "Some I've sold, but some I've kept," he said. "When certain artists or dancers or musicians want to come to Beacon, I want to have something to offer them." 
H E concedes that Beacon is not a natural second-home community, given its rough edges and modest housing stock. Although there are a handful of stately Victorians and carriage houses, the city consists mostly of 19th-century millworkers' houses and more recent split-levels and ranches -- many of them shoehorned onto 50-foot-by-100-foot lots. Still, Mr. Ehrlich believes Beacon could prove irresistible to a certain type of New Yorker. 
"Clearly, somebody who lives on Fifth Avenue is not going to want a second home in Beacon," he said. "But somebody who lives in SoHo or TriBeCa might want a second home here because the energy level and creative base will be there." In fact, one property now on the market seems aimed at that SoHo-minded buyer: a gutted two-story building near Main Street, priced at $175,000 and zoned as a live-work artist's residence.
Also available is a more traditional house, a four-bedroom Cape Cod on 1.7 acres on Mount Beacon with panoramic views and a stone fireplace, for $349,900.
Mr. Ehrlich divides his time between his homes in Manhattan and northeast Dutchess County, 50 minutes from Beacon. But he might as well head the Beacon chamber of commerce, so passionate is his belief in the city's potential as a cultural stomping ground. 
"For 200 years, Beacon was a manufacturing-based economy," he said. "I feel that if we can replace that lost economic engine with a new one, such as culture, that it will regenerate itself. And culture is certainly a very, very democratic direction that is not elitist." 
But not everyone agrees that what is good for the arts is also good for Beacon. A hot dog vendor who refused to give his name labeled the galleries and antiques stores a "disease spreading up Main Street." 
Ted Bowles, an 82-year-old World War II veteran, said the revitalization of Main Street had not translated into new jobs. "I don't think there have been more than 10 people hired" by the galleries, he said. 
Others worry about the rising cost of real estate and what it bodes for the tenants who rent apartments in the walkups along Main Street. Kevin Vacirca, owner of First Choice Realty, said that two years ago a house in need of repair sold for $50,000 to $70,000. The same house today commands $150,000 to $200,000. 
Mayor Gould fields complaints from residents about the new businesses. "The first thing you hear is, 'We don't want an art gallery; we want a shoe store,' " she said. "And I tell them, 'Something in a building is better than nothing in a building.' " 
Today, milelong Main Street, which runs from Mount Beacon down to the Hudson, is a streetscape in transition, with a homegrown culture mingling with an esoteric one seemingly lifted from the East Village. 
There are businesses with names like Sexy Nails and Eat at Joe's. Then there are those whose appellations -- and interiors -- are more elusive, places like Chthonic Clash, a two-month-old coffee house with an eclectic mix of furniture, from a Victorian settee to a 1960's stereo chair. 
"It almost has the feeling that there are two worlds that just don't touch each other," said Karen Rosenbach-Daniel, a partner in an executive search firm who lives in Manhattan and owns a second home in Beacon with her husband, Tom. "I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing." 
To be sure, some residents not only embrace the developments, they are investing in the city's new scene. "Beacon is going back to the way it used to look," said Nancy Wood, a city native who last fall opened Geppetto Wood Works, which sells rustic furnishings made from recycled materials like old doors. "When I was a little girl every store on Main Street was full." 
Both the city and Dia:Beacon are working to ensure that the museum opening does not alienate longtime residents. The city is promoting the development of affordable housing, while Dia:Beacon has already initiated a comprehensive arts program in the public schools. 
"They are not that familiar with museums as institutions," Amy S. Weisser, Dia:Beacon's assistant director, said of the schoolchildren. "This is expanding their boundaries of what is art." 
The environmental group Scenic Hudson wants to create a boat-building program for young people in an old barn. Now under renovation, the barn sits on 23 acres of riverfront property owned by the group. Scenic Hudson is undertaking its first real estate enterprise on the land, with plans for an ecologically up-to-the-minute hotel, restaurants, shops and housing, as well as a "green" marina for paddle boats and electric motorboats. 
One thing seems certain. The transformation of Beacon is likely to continue. This month, the owner of Chthonic Clash, Nell Ogorzaly, is starting a support group for people embarking on home renovations. "It's a way to exchange information," she said. "So many people are buying houses and fixing them up." 
Sara Pasti, an arts administrator and former painter who moved to Beacon last June from Seattle to be part of the Dia-induced renaissance, knows two Williamsburg artists who are fixing up second homes they recently bought.
"Artists are not put off by a handyman's special because they are used to working with their hands," she said.
Ms. Pasti is also director of the Beacon Cultural Foundation, which runs a nonprofit art gallery on Main Street called the Beacon Project Space. 
Some of the local entrepreneurs worry that the city is ill-prepared for the throngs of visitors who may descend on it. 
"I think we'll be overwhelmed by Dia's opening," said Doug Berlin, who owns the Piggy Bank, a two-year-old ribs restaurant in a former bank building. "We'll have tour groups and there will be busloads of people looking for places to eat and we don't have enough restaurants." 
Ms. Pasti agreed, "It'll be a wild summer."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
A New Museum As Unconventional As Its Collection

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

DATELINE: BEACON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THE opening of Dia:Beacon on Sunday changes the landscape for art in America. "Have you seen it?" people in art circles have been asking each other for months. Now you can.
 The museum, the largest one yet for contemporary art, enshrines part of a generation of big-thinking artists in a former Nabisco factory, a building with nearly a quarter of a million square feet of plain exhibition space. The place sprawls beside the Hudson River, a little more than an hour north of New York City. 
 The artists are European and American, Minimalists, Conceptualists and Post-Minimalists primarily, who came to maturity in the 1960's and 70's. Serialism, geometry and the grid are the leitmotifs of the work. The effect is subdued. The undercurrent, if you look with open eyes, is theatrical, and occasionally even joyous. 
Many of these artists were poorly seen or shown only in out-of-the-way places over the years. There are 22 of them, a small, eccentric assortment, reflecting Dia's idiosyncratic roots, shifting priorities and sporadic collecting. Dia:Beacon is not a complete survey of any movement or era. Artists you might presume are here are not. The omission of Carl Andre is glaring. Few artists are presented in any depth. Most are represented by a few works, or just one. All are given room to breathe.
Some look great. Robert Ryman gets a retrospective of white-on-white paintings in three rooms. Fred Sandback's colored string sculptures should come as a revelation to people who don't know his work well enough. The same applies to Michael Heizer's sculptures and Blinky Palermo's paintings. Dia:Beacon makes stars of a few artists who deserve to be.
Others don't look as good. But the museum is clearly worth celebrating. It is a brilliant marriage of art and architecture. All the money has obviously gone into making the building look simple and unobtrusive so that you focus on the art, which is what museums are supposed to do. You admire the light and the atmosphere. The place can make you feel exalted.
The money, and much of the inspiration for it comes from Leonard Riggio, Dia's chairman. The artist Robert Irwin and the architectural firm Open Office collaborated with Michael Govan, Dia's director, and Lynne Cooke, its curator, on the renovation of the building. Mr. Riggio, Mr. Govan and Ms. Cooke deserve credit for the audacity, in a bad economy, to realize a gigantic museum about the accomplishments of a generation of artists who are not particularly popular but whose influence has been significant and generally underrepresented elsewhere.
How to measure influence? By the 1960's, European art was shaped for the first time, to a significant degree, by what artists were doing in the United States. The traffic of influence flowed from here to there as it hadn't before. These were not initially Dia's artists who made an impact. They were other artists who came to maturity during that same crucial decade between 1958 and 1968, when American art meant Pop, then Minimalism and Post-Minimalism. Before then, Europeans intermittently acknowledged what was happening here. Older artists like de Kooning showed at the Venice Biennale in 1954 but Europeans didn't pay particular notice. During the mid-1950's the influence of Pollock on French artists like Soulages, Fautrier and the group called Art Informel, highly debatable at best, was only marginally noteworthy anyway.
But by the late 1950's, the situation began to change. Pollock was already dead and Jasper Johns was in the Venice Biennale. One generation had been followed by another in America, although Europeans now often lumped the two together -- Pollock, de Kooning and Rothko with Johns, Twombly and Rauschenberg -- because all of them crowded the scene there, more or less simultaneously.
Their reception was not entirely good. But they were noticed. And quickly they were followed by Warhol and Lichtenstein, then in the late 60's by Donald Judd, Dan Flavin and Sol LeWitt, whose connections with, and influences on, European artists like Gerhard Richter, Joseph Beuys, Hanne Darboven, Bernd and Hilla Becher and Blinky Palermo constitute Dia's trans-Atlantic narrative.
Europeans who disliked the American invasion, and many did, sometimes equated Minimalism with American industrial and corporate power. It was the Vietnam era. That perception has lingered, misleadingly. The art can be forbidding. But it can also be delicate. Notwithstanding its use of fluorescent tubes and stainless steel, Minimal art exalted finish and precise, one-of-a-kind refinements, an approach that had little to do with the assembly line. Judd endorsed small enterprise and the poetry of plainspoken materials, not mass production. The patronage model was also European. Heiner Friedrich, Dia's founder, arrogantly or not, wanted Dia to emulate the Medicis. 
Artists younger than Judd, like Mr. Heizer and Robert Smithson, then embraced heavy machinery. They moved dirt with bulldozers and blew up rocks with explosives. As Kirk Varnedoe puts it, this partly expressed the "romance of the new left for the old left," a 60's blue-jeans dream of reconciling "longhairs with hardhats." It was an urbane aesthetic of denial and detritus, making stripped-down art from scraps of rubber, rocks and broken glass. It entailed nostalgia for a bygone industry: the equation of working class labor with moral strength.
But even the use of steel and tar and bulldozers went formally toward addressing basic, traditional principles of art: weight, mass, scale. The longer you look at any good art the more you see a common formal language transcending materials and shifting tastes. For artists like Judd, looking was almost a moral matter -- the exchange of aesthetic values between viewer and the object viewed, which demanded that the object, like the viewer, be treated with respect: given space, considered individually. Every work of art had its integrity and also relationship to some group. Serial art was based on that simple principle. Look closely, make distinctions. Artists like Judd sought remote places to make and show their art, in part to restore to this experience of looking its full and rightful dignity. 
Of course, artistic discrimination is the perk and privilege of an elitist culture, and looking at art, fortunately, is an equal-opportunity elitist occupation. Anyone can make discriminations who chooses to walk through a museum's front door with open eyes. The goal of Dia:Beacon, which distinguishes it from other museums, is to take its cues from artists like Judd and give their art the room they wanted so that the works are regarded one by one -- for better and worse.
The sculpture by Walter De Maria right at the entrance, a suite of stainless steel circles and squares on the floor of two adjacent rooms, each the length of a football field, is a disappointment. The work fades into vastness, undone by the space. Mr. De Maria is a better artist than this sculpture conveys.
John Chamberlain's crushed metal sculptures are gorgeous -- playful, crumpled objects of improbable lightness and variety -- but they tend to cancel each other out in the room. In an adjoining space, a mixed assortment of Agnes Martin's evanescent paintings suffer by their proximity to Mr. Chamberlain's brand of art.
Joseph Beuys occupies a corner of the museum with histrionic remnants of one of his famous performances and other eccentric autobiographic paraphernalia. As always, they poorly convey the shamanistic aura that strangely captivated many people.
Three of Robert Smithson's dirt, gravel and mirror sculptures look small and insignificant in a gallery together. Set slightly apart from them, his "Map of Glass," a pile of shards, suggests Caspar David Friedrich's "Sea of Ice," only dimly. Smithson was a writer and self-promoter who, it is increasingly obvious, with the exception of "Spiral Jetty" produced no sculpture of real distinction.
What Louise Bourgeois is doing at all in Beacon, aside from redressing an imbalance of the sexes, is mysterious. She occupies the attic, melodramatically. Some of her small sculptures from the 60's are vivid and original but the later work, including the familiar giant spider, is camp.
By contrast, Warhol's "Shadow" paintings, 72 of 102 multicolored variations on the same obscure image, fill a gigantic room: it looks fantastic. So does Ms. Darboven's "Cultural History, 1880-1983," a dizzy panorama of accumulated magazine covers, postcards, pinups, diagrams, drawings, photographs, exhibition catalog pages -- all identically framed in rows, covering the walls, with several folk sculptures and kitsch oddments on pedestals and hanging from the ceiling. 
The results suggest a kind of Minimalist Wunderkammer, a wonder-cabinet of obsessive compulsion. The strict grid provides a formal structure for eclectic information, broken up, as if in syncopation, by the sculptures. The works can be read as documents and memorabilia or absorbed, formally, as shapes. The whole thing tries to contain messy history, a century's worth, if only to convey the absurdity of that endeavor. Ms. Darboven's deadpan eloquence derives from the tension between serene structure and chaotic content, a psychological subtext of much Minimal art.
You can also find it in Mr. Richter's suite of tilting sheets of reflective gray glass, which looked unmemorable in a smaller version in Berlin last year, but here is magisterial. The panes reflect the room in shifting patterns as you walk past. Like Ms. Darboven's art, the work is spectacularly theatrical.
Richard Serra's sculptures, both early and recent work, crowd the factory's train depot: several enormous "Torqued Ellipses," side by side. "Union of the Torus and the Sphere," also huge, is artfully wedged into another gallery, the snug fit stressing the work's mass and inducing vertigo, a pleasurable version of it anyway, when you try to squeeze through the room. 
The most popular work here is bound to be Mr. Heizer's "North, East, South, West": geometric holes cut 20 feet deep into a concrete floor. The holes are made of steel in the shapes of a cone, a wedge, a double-square and an inverted cone. The work is cordoned off by a glass partition for safety; visitors will be allowed in only when supervised. 
The combination of understated form and instigated fear, akin to the fear you might feel standing on the edge of a cliff, is the essence of this art, although Mr. Heizer would probably not say he means to scare you. Awe would be more like it.
Which, if you're in the mood, is also what you can feel in a gallery of Flavins, including an untitled red and white fluorescent sculpture, a work from 1970, propped beside a wall of windows, which is how Flavin originally devised it for Judd's bedroom. The sculpture is a grid of tall rectangles, stepped, diagonally, across a corner of a gallery.
It is like most art here -- big, improbably simple, bound up with the building. The colored fluorescents mix with sunlight, your interaction with the shifting light and the empty space being the object of the work, the epitome of Minimalist parsimony and insinuation.
"As plain and open and direct an art as you will ever find," Flavin said, which describes Dia:Beacon.

HEADLINE: A Tale of 2 Carmakers and 2 Countries 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: OXFORD, England 

 BODY:
To the casual observer, the sprawling BMW car plant outside this quaint university town appears to be much like the main plant of the Fiat group outside Turin, Italy. At each factory, shiny new cars roll leisurely along assembly lines dominated by giant twisting robots and automated welders that spray sparks like New Year's fireworks. 
 But the similarity ends there. The deeper contrasts between the two factories capture in microcosm the heady revival of British carmaking under foreign ownership, and the crisis facing Fiat, which has no foreign-owned rivals in its home market. 
 BMW spent $500 million to overhaul the Oxford plant, and began producing a new version of the Mini Cooper here in 2001. The tiny car has been a big success, and more than 200,000 of them have been shipped all over the world, including almost 33,000 to the United States. The Minis helped propel Britain's total output of cars to 1.8 million last year, 8 percent more than in 2001, virtually all of them built by foreign-owned companies. 
In Turin, Fiat's big Mirafiori plant churns out six different models of Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo cars. Even though the company has the Italian market largely to itself it is struggling. Demand for its cars is weak, and the company has been forced to sell nonautomotive assets to raise cash to revamp its car business. A factory at Rivalta, near Turin, has been closed, and almost half the work force at Mirafiori -- 15,000 out of 27,000 -- has been laid off in the last three years. Auto production in Italy, which essentially means Fiat, fell by almost 10 percent last year to 1.4 million cars annually.
Things were not always like this. In the 1970's, Britain's carmakers were an endangered species. Their factories were old, British labor unions were merciless, and the industrial policies of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ruled out any resort either to subsidies or to protective trade barriers. Venerable brands ultimately died out or were sold to foreigners, like Jaguar to Ford Motor and Rover and Rolls Royce to BMW. 
Meanwhile, Italy coddled Fiat. A bilateral accord with Tokyo limited Japanese imports to 3 percent of the Italian market. The government was generous with subsidies, and actively discouraged foreign investment. Of Europe's major economies, only Italy is completely devoid of auto plants not owned by a domestic company.
In Italy, said Mario Deaglio, an economist at the University of Turin, "you can talk of an industrial policy that was very much the opposite of Mrs. Thatcher." Successive Italian governments avoided directly violating global trade agreements with protectionist measures, he said, but "the fact is that, while operating in market conditions, there were incentives, there were subsidies, there was encouragement and support in other forms" to sustain Fiat's de facto monopoly. But investment by non-Italian automakers "was not encouraged," he said. 
The British approach is not without its risks and paradoxes. The policy of openness has attracted foreign investment, including major Japanese manufacturers like Nissan, Toyota and Honda, but provides no guarantee that they will stay. With Britain so far remaining aloof from the 12-nation monetary union using the euro, manufacturers there also face exchange-rate risks: In recent months, the pound has strengthened steadily against the euro, making British-made cars more expensive and prompting manufacturers to obtain more components overseas. 
The Mini Cooper illustrates the issue. BMW chose to assemble the car here, but only 40 percent of its components, measured by value, are made in Britain. The engines come from Brazil; some sheet metal parts come from Germany. Each day, trucks from low-wage countries like the Czech Republic roll up to the factory gate to deliver other parts, all to keep the cars' price in euros from rising too high. 
"All foreign manufacturers believed it when the British government said we're going into the euro," said Daniel T. Jones, professor of auto industry management at Cardiff University in Wales. "Now Toyota and Nissan and others are angry." 
Moreover, automakers elsewhere that enjoyed government favor are thriving. In France, the government owns 44 percent of Renault, and the German state of Lower Saxony controls a stake in Volkswagen and seats on its board. 
Still, the revival of the Mini, a cult classic in its original 1960's incarnation, remains a remarkable tale of success that Helmut Panke, BMW's chief executive, said recently had gone "well beyond the expectations" of the company. 
In 1994, BMW bought the remains of the Rover group, the last big British car manufacturer, which made the Mini and other Rover automobiles and Land Rover off-road vehicles. BMW, for decades a successful luxury-car maker, had come to realize that it could not compete in the future without offering cars in all sizes.
It sold Land Rover to Ford and the Rover brand to a British investor group, and then stepped up a development program begun under Rover's previous management, unveiling the new Mini in July 2001.
With a dealer network spanning the globe, the Mini's sales exploded. Even running seven days a week, the Oxford assembly lines cannot make them fast enough to meet demand, and customers who order them now face waits of three to six months. Mr. Panke said BMW had already earned back its introductory investment and was making money on each Mini it sold.
Jerome Panes exemplifies the transformation at Oxford. An 18-year Rover veteran and former toolmaker, Mr. Panes was retrained by BMW to maintain the big computer-run robots that weld the Mini's underbody. Asked whether Britain's auto industry was moribund, Mr. Panes, 35, drawing on a cigarette during a break, replied, "Not here it isn't." Ninety percent of the factory's 4,500 workers are union members. 
In Turin, Fiat is refusing to play dead. It is partway through a three-year, 7.8 billion-euro ($9 billion) reorganization to renew its small car brands and to improve its position in larger cars, with their fatter profit margins, by overhauling the Alfa Romeo brand. 
To finance the project, Fiat has sold off the Toro insurance unit and FiatAvio, an aerospace company, and raised 7 billion euros ($8 billion). 
Moreover, Fiat is relying heavily on its alliance with General Motors. G.M. bought 20 percent of Fiat's auto division in 2000, and the two companies created joint ventures to unite purchasing of components in Europe and Latin America and to manufacture power trains. But the most compelling aspect of the agreement was a provision allowing Fiat to require G.M. to buy the rest of Fiat Auto beginning in January 2004. 
Daniele Bandiera, the general manager of the Alfa Romeo division, said that Fiat was not shying away from the fresh challenge. "When there's competition," Mr. Bandiera, 45, said, "you're inspired to do your best." 
Over the next three years, he explained, Fiat plans to introduce 21 car models -- some of them totally new, like the Fiat Idea, a van-station wagon hybrid. Others will be new versions of existing models like the Multipla, a family car that will be redesigned next year. 
Still, some critics call Fiat's efforts too little, too late. "It's insufficient in its content and its timing," said Claudio Stacchini, a metalworkers' delegate from the leftist Federation of Italian Trade Unions at Fiat. 
Important new models like the successor to the Punto, a compact car that helped pull Fiat out of a crisis in the 1990's, are not scheduled to arrive for another two years, Mr. Stacchini said, and the sales volumes that Fiat forecasts for some new models, like the Idea and the Lancia Ypsilon, a car meant for urban commuting, are only 90,000 to 120,000 a year, too few to be very profitable. 
Moreover, Fiat continues to bleed cash. It posted an operating loss of 762 million euros ($868 million) last year and another 681 million euros ($784 million) in the first quarter of 2003. The losses have jeopardized the company's investment plan, which was already more modest than competitors' plans: While Fiat has earmarked 2.6 billion euros ($3 billion) a year, Peugeot of France is spending 3.8 billion euros and BMW 3.4 billion. 
Labor leaders like Mr. Stacchini say that the only way out is for the Italian state to take a stake in Fiat. The finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, is working on such a plan, but the chances of it coming to pass are clouded by political infighting. 
Professor Jones of Cardiff believes the best model for Fiat would not be the Thatcher approach in Britain but the French government's treatment of Peugeot and Renault. Though the state retains a major stake in Renault, both French automakers have invested heavily in new products and distribution and have forged fruitful alliances abroad. 
Peugeot, whose snappy 206 compact overtook Volkswagen's seemingly unconquerable Golf last year as Europe's best-selling car, cooperates closely with Toyota. Renault owns a controlling stake in Nissan.

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Friday about the revival of British carmaking under foreign ownership misstated the recent performance of the pound against the euro. It has dropped, not strengthened -- nearly 9 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Virus Takes a Toll on Texas Poultry Business 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: NACOGDOCHES, Tex. 

 BODY:
David Alders's business is up a gravel road behind his white, two-story farmhouse: six air-conditioned poultry houses, each filled with 25,000 squawking chickens -- some 150,000 chickens in all, gorging on buckets of corn feed and sipping water from plastic nipples suspended in the air. 
 They are healthy chickens, and they provide a comfortable living for Mr. Alders, a lanky 42-year-old with eight children whose family has farmed on the outskirts of this blistering East Texas town since the 1830's. 
 Now, though, his livelihood is at risk. The detection some weeks ago of a virulent, chicken-killing virus in a few fighting cocks across the state in El Paso has prompted jittery -- and some here say revenge-minded -- governments from the European Union, Mexico, Russia, Japan and even Cuba to embargo imports of Texas poultry. 
Never mind that no trace of the virus, exotic Newcastle disease, has been found in East Texas, the state's main poultry producing area. Or that Nacogdoches, an important base of operations for large food companies like Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride, is closer to St. Louis than El Paso. Geography aside, the state's poultry industry, which ranks No. 6 in the country, says it stands to lose about $100 million as a result of the embargoes.
"The paranoia level has gotten turned up a few notches since the poultry industry here is paying for an isolated incident many hundreds of miles away," said Mr. Alders, who grows chickens for Pilgrim's Pride. "You can understand our concern, when we send most of our dark meat products to Mexico and Russia. We don't know what we're going to do if those markets continue to shut us out."
Consolidation in the poultry industry in recent years contributed to rising prosperity for many chicken growers. But the resulting efficiencies have fueled concern that the industry is more vulnerable to diseases like exotic Newcastle and avian influenza that can spread rapidly in regions producing millions of birds every month.
Poultry producers in other states, especially California, have also been affected by concern over the possible spread of exotic Newcastle, which was detected in October in Los Angeles by epidemiologists from the United States Department of Agriculture after it moved from backyard flocks to more than 20 commercial poultry operations in the state.
Since then, the U.S.D.A. has destroyed more than 3.5 million birds in California in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease, which is often referred to as END. Nonetheless, isolated cases have been detected in Nevada, Arizona and, finally last month, El Paso, after an owner returned from a cockfight in southern New Mexico and infected his game birds. Chickens from California, Nevada and Arizona have fallen victim to embargoes, as well.
The disease can kill virtually every bird in an unvaccinated flock, and vaccines are useless against some of its toughest strains.
Infected birds often suffer fits of sneezing, diarrhea and muscular tremors before dying in 2 to 15 days. The disease is transmitted through infected birds' droppings and secretions, but can also be spread by humans who come in contact with the virus. Experts do not consider the disease a risk to humans.
The last major outbreak was in California in 1971, when the federal government destroyed more than 11 million birds at a cost of $56 million. 
Here in Texas, farmers and industry executives have privately complained that some countries seemed quick to impose embargoes after the recent breakout. They suggest that the moves were in retaliation for strict controls on some imports by the United States, like new tuberculosis exams for cattle coming from Mexico or tariffs on steel products from Russia.
Publicly, however, executives at large poultry producers are hesitant to criticize the embargoes, anxious not to irritate important trading partners or regulators in places where the companies have established operations. For example, Pilgrim's Pride, based in Pittsburg, Tex., also operates a large processing plant in the Mexican state of Queretaro, which mainly supplies nearby Mexico City. 
But the industry is not shy about warning of the consequences of the embargoes for farmers.
"We're certainly upset about this," said James Grimm, executive vice president of the Texas Poultry Federation, which is based in Austin. "All of our markets are set up for export, so this disruption in trade is causing a lot of distress." 
Epidemiologists almost always react quickly to any sign of exotic Newcastle. According to the U.S.D.A., the virus has sometimes been spread by debeaking and vaccination crews, truck drivers and manure haulers. 
"END is the most virulent disease known to birds on the planet, essentially what hoof-and-mouth disease is to livestock," said Larry Hawkins, a U.S.D.A. spokesman. "It is unfortunate that those folks in East Texas are suffering. But if there's any silver lining, it's that we haven't found any additional examples of the disease in that area."
The latest outbreak in California -- which is showing signs of coming under control -- and the small outbreaks in Arizona, Nevada and Texas, are not expected to have much of an impact on consumers in the United States, although prices for dark chicken meat could fall as export restrictions result in bigger domestic stockpiles. 
Unlike consumers in the United States, who largely favor white meat, markets abroad are largely focused on dark meat. Mexico and Russia are the largest importers of poultry from East Texas, where the industry is clustered around farms and processing plants east of Interstate 35.
The poultry industry employs about 15,000 people in Texas, making it a rival to the state's larger beef industry. In Nacogdoches, population about 30,000, Pilgrim's Pride recently surpassed Stephen F. Austin State University as the city's largest employer, with 1,800 employees. But that concentration of chicken growing activity carries risks. 
"If you're an exotic disease like Newcastle, you just died and went to heaven," said Dr. Travis Cigainero, corporate veterinarian for Pilgrim's Pride in the United States and Mexico. "There's no doubt that the evolution of the industry has created more efficiency, but it's also made it more vulnerable to catastrophic diseases."
Dr. Cigainero, who was in Nacogdoches this week to accompany a group of Russian sanitary inspectors, said poultry producers wanted to increase bio-safety measures on poultry farms by, for example, using sterilized white cotton suits and plastic boot sheaths. But while Mr. Alders takes such steps on his farm here, doing so is largely up to individual contract farmers. 
Moreover, Dr. Cigainero added, such measures are thought to be rare among cultivators of fighting cocks, many of whom travel across state lines or into Mexico for cockfights.
"One of the unfortunate features of exotic Newcastle disease is that it doesn't discriminate among birds, whether they are poultry hens, fighting chickens or ostriches," Dr. Cigainero said. "It's an equal-opportunity attacker."
Mexico and Russia have been limiting imports of Texas poultry since last year, citing sanitary concerns, though some people in the American industry suspect them of trying to protect local producers. Wall Street analysts say that the restrictions have squeezed revenues and profits at companies like Tyson and Pilgrim's Pride, whose chicken fetches less on glutted global markets but must still pay growers like Mr. Alders under contracts that predate the trade problems.
If the embargoes endure, the squeeze will reach Mr. Alders, too. And there is not much he can do to stop it.
"The scary thing is that a poultry worker at a cockfight can get in his pickup and transmit the virus a thousand miles away," Mr. Alders said. "If he's wearing the same boots at his destination, then that virus can thrive."

Congressman Seeks Review Of U.S. Effort To Aid Iraq

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
The chairman of the House International Relations Committee said today that he would ask the General Accounting Office to conduct a detailed review of the American-led reconstruction of Iraq, saying that a "lack of transparency" had made Congressional oversight difficult.
 The chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican, complained during a committee hearing today that the Bush administration had not done enough to assist the accounting office, authorizing only one investigator to travel to Iraq for just four weeks. 
 "We hope for more robust cooperation," Mr. Hyde told senior administration officials during the hearing. 
The comments by Mr. Hyde, an otherwise staunch ally of the administration and its Iraq policies, underscored a growing concern among Republicans as well as Democrats with the slow pace and rising cost of the reconstruction effort. Today lawmakers cited reports of widespread violence, looting, power failures and political chaos to raise questions about the administration's policies.
"The sum total impression from these press accounts is that while the war plan was very well planned and executed, the peace plan was either not as well developed or not as well executed," said Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California.
Senior State and Defense Department officials acknowledged that violence and looting continued in some places, mainly in Baghdad. But they described most of the country as relatively secure and asserted that progress had been made toward restoring clean water, electricity, government services and private commerce in many municipalities.
"Only eight weeks have passed since the commencement of military operations," said Alan Larson, the under secretary of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs, "and there's much good news to report. There is no famine, no shortage of food, no refugee crisis."
Mr. Hyde's office said the congressman would ask the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative unit, to send a team to Iraq for an extended stay to monitor the delivery of aid, peacekeeping operations, economic reconstruction, political reforms and the search for prohibited weapons.
Representative Tom Lantos of California, the committee's ranking Democrat, said he planned to introduce legislation asking NATO to send an international peacekeeping force to Iraq. "I believe we must have more military boots on the ground if we are to secure and rebuild Iraq," Mr. Lantos said. "These need not be, nor should they be, the boots of the American military."
One concern repeated by several lawmakers today was whether American military commanders were allowing officials of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party to return to power.
Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy, said the administration's intention was "de-Baathification," which he said would involve removing 20,000 to 30,000 high-ranking party members from positions of authority.
But Mr. Feith said that not all of the party's one million to two million members would be stripped of power or punished, since many had joined under pressure. He acknowledged that the military's information on members was not extensive and that mistakes had been made in restoring some senior party officials to power.
Asked about progress in the hunt for Iraqi chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs, Mr. Feith said evidence of those programs had been found, but offered no details. He added that only 20 percent of 600 possible sites had been scoured and that the search could go on for years.
Mr. Feith and Lt. Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the director for operations of the Joint Staff, also said investigators had not found conclusive evidence that two trailers containing sophisticated equipment were mobile biological weapons labs, as some military officials had contended.
"The inspection we have done to date has not produced any definitive evidence," General Schwartz said. He said "intrusive" examinations of both trailers were continuing.
In his opening statement, Representative Hyde accused the Defense Department of trying to install a favored opposition leader, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress. Without naming Mr. Chalabi, Mr. Hyde said the Pentagon had flown him and 700 of his fighters to the city of Nasiriya without coordinating its efforts with the State Department.
"The United States should not put a thumb on the scales of Iraqi politics," Mr. Hyde said, quoting Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage. "That's a pretty heavy thumb."

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Fall 1.9%, The Biggest Drop Since 1947 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices took a record plunge last month and manufacturing slumped, government reports released today showed.
 The Producer Price Index, which measures prices paid at the factory, farm and refinery gate, plummeted 1.9 percent in April, the biggest drop since 1947, the Labor Department said. Analysts had expected a drop of 0.7 percent. 
 Much of the decline was attributed to an 8.6 percent fall in energy prices, reflecting a big drop in oil prices from late-February highs as fears over a war-related supply disruption eased.
Prices for cars, sport utility vehicles and other light trucks and cigarettes also fell, however, dragging the so-called core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, down 0.9 percent -- its biggest plunge since August 1993.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said output at manufacturing plants, mines and utilities slid 0.5 percent last month, its second consecutive drop. Industry operated at only 74.4 percent of capacity, the lowest level in 20 years.
A third report showed manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted in May, suggesting factories are still ailing.
"The manufacturing sector is still in the dumps and is having problems getting out of the doldrums," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis. "With weak consumer and business spending, manufacturers are not about to crank up production."
Economists had expected wholesale prices to fall 0.4 percent. Still, analysts cautioned against concluding deflation, a persistent drop in consumer prices, was about to set in. The Labor Department reports April consumer prices on Friday.
"The trend is still there to softer prices," said Kevin Logan, senior economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York. "The economy is shaking off the war-related paralysis from March and April, but the question is, will growth be sustained or will it be just a return to the slow prewar growth?" 
Many economists saw at least glimmers of hope for a faster recovery in data released today.
Factories in New York State increased activity in May and sales at retailers, manufacturers and wholesalers climbed in March at their fastest pace in nearly a year.
In addition, first-time filings for jobless aid fell 13,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 417,000, their third consecutive weekly drop, the Labor Department said.
While claims declined, however, they remained above the 400,000 level for the 13th consecutive week. Economists say claims above 400,000 indicate a stagnant labor market.
In another sign of weakness, the number of jobless workers who remained on the benefit rolls in the week of May 3, the latest week for which data are available, rose a sharp 120,000, to 3.77 million. That was its highest level since mid-November 2001, when the economy was reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks.
"The economy is still moving ahead but not very fast and it does not seem to have accelerated much from the 1.5 percent rate that we've seen in the past six months," said L. Douglas Lee, who is president of Economics From Washington, a consulting firm.

HEADLINE: Federal Help for Crumbling Schools 

 BODY:
The No Child Left Behind education act was touted as a way to raise standards, improve teacher training and prevent America's schools from sliding further into mediocrity. But the Bush administration undermined the effort by failing to fully finance the new law at a time when the recession-ravaged states are laying off teachers, shortening the school year and cutting education budgets. 
 The states are especially desperate for construction money that would permit them to renovate crumbling school buildings coast to coast. A General Accounting Office report in the mid-1990's estimated that putting the ancient buildings in working order would require a new investment of $112 billion -- a figure that the states were unable to raise on their own even in flush times, let alone during a recession. 
 Many Republican lawmakers now understand that federal education initiatives are destined to fail unless the states and localities are able to shore up collapsing school buildings and provide children with safe, well-equipped places in which to learn. Two bills that would prime the pump -- and begin the flow of construction money -- have been introduced in the House by Representatives Nancy Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, and Charles Rangel, Democrat of New York. One sponsored by John Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, has been introduced in the Senate. The bills, which differ only slightly, would allow the localities to finance school construction and repairs by issuing inexpensive bonds, on which bond holders would receive a federal tax credit instead of collecting interest. 
The bonding initiative attracted wide bipartisan support in the last Congress, but failed because many lawmakers viewed the bill as too costly or viewed education as an exclusively local matter. In the interim, however, deterioriating schools havebecome a pressing national problem that cries out for leadership from Washington.

HEADLINE: War, SARS and Deflation Leave Japan Economy Flat 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, May 16 

 BODY:
Japan's economy stalled in the first three months of the year after three consecutive quarterly expansions as concerns about the Iraq war and the SARS virus limited exports and dampened some consumer spending.
 The nation's economy, the world's second largest, registered no growth on an annual basis in the quarter ended March 31, compared with the previous quarter. Economists had expected a small gain. 
 The figures suggest that Japan is headed for another year of scant growth and will continue to provide little support for the global economy unless the government and the central bank do more to spur a recovery. Japan has had three recessions in the last decade and may slip into a fourth later this year if growth in the United States and in other parts of Asia falters, economists say. 
The signs are not encouraging. Exports, which played a large part in last year's expansion, slipped in the first quarter. The debt-sodden government has been cutting public spending, removing another brace for the economy. Consumer spending, which makes up the largest part of the economy, and corporate capital investment grew, but at the same or slower rates than in the fourth quarter of 2002.
The economy is also still being gripped by deflation, or falling prices, which have eroded corporate profits, depressed stock prices and made it harder for debtors to repay their obligations. This, in turn, has hampered efforts by Japan's banks to write off about $450 billion in hard-to-recover loans on their books. Adjusting for the fall in prices, Japan's economy contracted 0.6 percent in the first quarter.
More immediately, Japanese manufacturers, the strongest performers in the economy, curbed production in recent months as demand for their products in the United States waned in the period before the war in Iraq. As the war ended, the deadly SARS virus spread through China and other Asian markets, forcing further cuts in output.
"From March, the situation became grave, so we had to reduce our inventories and production significantly," said Nobuyuki Idei, the chairman of Sony, which reported a much larger-than-expected loss last month. "In the first quarter, there was an imminent sense of war and after March, it cast a shadow over the market."
Sony and other exporters that rely heavily on overseas markets are also being hit by a rise of nearly 10 percent in the value of the yen over the last year, which has made their products more expensive in other countries. Most manufacturers start losing money on their exports when the dollar exchange rate falls below 115 yen. Japanese financial officials have pledged to halt any rapid rise in their currency, but the United States Treasury has shown reluctance to take any coordinated action.
The dollar, which settled at 116.45 in New York on Thursday, was trading at 116.50 after the worse-than-expected gross domestic product figures were released in Tokyo this morning. 
Eager to bolster their flagging popularity, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and his top financial chiefs on Wednesday approved a package of proposals aimed at halting the decline in stock prices. Most of the measures, though, require the approval of Parliament and are opposed by some top policy makers.
This resistance is likely to heighten pressure on the Japanese central bank to take additional steps to ease monetary policy. In the two months since the bank's new governor, Toshihiko Fukui, took office, the monetary policy board has increased the amount of stocks it will buy from banks, added cash to the money markets, and expanded the range of collateral it will accept at the bank's loan window.
But Mr. Fukui, who will lead the policy board's next meeting on Monday and Tuesday, has made it clear that he expects the government to come up with additional measures to support the economy as well.
An area of particular concern, economists say, is consumer spending, which makes up roughly 60 percent of the economy. Though spending rose 0.3 percent in the first quarter, consumers are likely to cut back this year. In annual negotiations with management this spring, workers won the smallest wage increases on record, with several major companies offering no raises at all. Summer bonuses, which are typically worth two to three months' salary, are also expected to decline for the third consecutive year, according to the Resona Research Institute.
The government has also introduced a series of tax increases and cuts in health care benefits that are expected to take four trillion yen ($34 billion) out of consumers' pockets. Fear of SARS has also led to large declines in travel and shopping, hurting the economy.
"Consumers have become even more defensive in their spending behavior," said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.

HEADLINE: Mexico Misses Growth Forecast 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 15 

 BODY:
Mexico's gross domestic product grew 2.3 percent in the first quarter of the year over the same period in 2002, the Finance Ministry said today. 
But on a seasonally adjusted basis, the economy contracted 0.49 percent compared with the previous quarter.
 The lackluster figure was lower than the 2.7 percent the ministry had forecast earlier and will make it difficult for the country to reach its forecast of 3 percent for the full year. The central bank has already downgraded its forecast to 2.4 percent, and many private analysts have similar expectations. 
 The economy has been in the doldrums for two years, a casualty of the slowdown in the United States, which has dampened demand for Mexican exports.

Bombs Bring Terror Home, And Saudis Are Reeling
Recent terror attacks around the world, although carried out in the name of Islam, seemed distant in Saudi Arabia, where the faith was born. Now many Saudis are reeling from the deadly explosions in Riyadh, not least because at least seven of the victims were natives, and the 15 attackers probably were, too. A1

F.B.I. agents have joined the Saudis in hunting suspects in the Riyadh bombings. They say there was no proof the attacks were by Al Qaeda, but that they bore all the hallmarks of that group's operations. A15

The Saudi ambassador to the United States, saying that his government "did what was needed" after repeated American requests that it deploy guards around possible Western targets, left open the possibility that no action had been taken. A15

U.S. Forces Crack Down in Iraq
American military forces, in their most aggressive police action yet in Baghdad, are seeking to arrest thousands of criminals that Saddam Hussein released, jail looters for extended terms and run hundreds of night patrols to restore order. A16

Amnesty for Chechen Rebels
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia proposed granting amnesty to Chechen separatists who agreed to lay down arms by Aug. 1, excluding those accused of murder and other crimes, after two suicide attacks in Chechnya this week. A5

British Delay Euro Decision
The British government said it would announce on June 9 if it would adopt the euro. It is a pivotal decision for Britain, whose relations with its European partners were bruised by Prime Minister Tony Blair's support for the American-led war in Iraq. A3

SARS-Related Panic in Siberia
Russia's first and only suspected SARS case lies in medical isolation on its border with China. Meanwhile, the Siberian region's economy, which increasingly has come to rely on Chinese trade and labor, is starting to slow down. A12

Senate Moves to Reduce Dividend Taxes Until 2007
Senate approved a sweeping tax cut bill that would reduce then suspend taxes on stock dividends before restoring them in 2007, adopting at least for now the central element of President Bush's tax plan. A1

U.S. Hunted Texas Legislator
The Bush administration said the Department of Homeland Security had become enmeshed in a partisan dispute in the Texas statehouse when the department agreed to track down a plane owned by a leading Democratic state legislator. A18

HEADLINE: Doctors Rally for Limits on Awards in Malpractice Suits 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 15 

 BODY:
Several thousand New Jersey doctors and nurses staged their second rally of the year here today to press their demand for legislation to limit jury awards in malpractice lawsuits.
 Chanting, waving placards and wearing their white lab coats, the doctors crowded onto State Street, in front of the State House, to hear speakers urge the General Assembly to pass a tort-reform bill that would limit awards for pain and suffering to $1 million, and insurers' liability for such awards to $300,000. The bill was passed by the State Senate in March. 
 The doctors oppose a competing version of the bill, passed by the Assembly and supported by the state chapter of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, that would leave awards uncapped but would subsidize malpractice-insurance premiums for specialists who are most at risk of lawsuits, and who have had the greatest increases in premiums. 
Without the caps on awards, the doctors claimed, physicians faced with ruinous insurance rates will simply give up their practices.
"The average reimbursement for delivering a child is $2,500," Dr. Ruth J. Schulze, president of the Bergen County Medical Society, said in a speech. "When you consider that that includes nine months of prenatal care and the chance to be sued for the next 21 years, many obstetricians are asking themselves, 'Why do it?' "
According to the Medical Society of New Jersey, malpractice rates today are nearly double what they were in 1996.
Many of the doctors' placards bore messages like "When your water breaks, call your lawyer." Others threatened political revenge on unsupportive Assembly members in November, when the entire Legislature is up for election.
"We will let you know, so you can let your patients know, who our friends are and who our nonfriends are in November," said Dr. Anthony Caggiano, chairman of the Medical Society of New Jersey's political action committee.
Although the doctors were bused in from their offices around the state, today's rally was not the kind of work slowdown they staged in February, medical society officials said. In that protest, thousands of doctors closed their offices for a day or more to all but emergency cases, and rallied here and at hospitals in favor of limits on malpractice awards.
The slowdown was the most sweeping protest of several around the nation, and New Jersey is at the forefront of the movement by doctors to control malpractice premiums by limiting jury awards for pain and suffering. Such damages are hard to quantify, and often produce huge awards by sympathetic juries. 
Besides capping pain and suffering awards, the Senate bill, an amended version of the Assembly bill, would create a special state fund to pay any additional award up to the total limit of $1 million. 
The Assembly version sets no limits on awards and would use the same fund to pay half the insurance premium increase for doctors facing large increases. Economic losses from a medical mishap, like lost wages and medical expenses, are not limited in either version.
Even general practitioners, whose insurance costs are comparatively low, maintain that so many specialists have been driven out of practice by high insurance costs that their patients cannot find the specialized care they need.
But the trial lawyers maintain that limits on damage awards are unfair to the victims of bungled medicine, especially the elderly. And they argue that insurance rates will abate once an economic recovery brings new profits to insurers.
"We all know that this is a short-term problem, and it deserves a short-term solution," said Bruce H. Stern, president of the state trial lawyers' association. "There's a lot the doctors could be doing, but the bottom line is that they don't want to be held responsible for the damage they cause."
Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts, the leader of the Democratic majority, said today that the Assembly would take up the Senate version in the next few weeks and replace its limits on pain-and-suffering awards with the original subsidy for premiums. He said the advantage of that approach was that the benefit would be immediate, and the subsidy would be retroactive to the first of the year.
Gov. James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, has not yet endorsed either version of the bill.

HEADLINE: 3 European Economies Contract, Stirring a Fear of Wider Damage 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 15 

 BODY:
Europe, which has struggled for more than a year to regain its economic footing, appears on the brink of tumbling back into recession -- with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands reporting today that their economies unexpectedly contracted in the first three months of the year.
 The European Union said growth stalled across the 12-nation euro zone in the first quarter, prompting fresh demands that the European Central Bank lower interest rates. 
 "The euro zone is stagnating, and Germany, as the sick man of Europe, is falling even further behind," said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Invesco Asset Management in Frankfurt.
Germany reported that its economy contracted 0.2 percent in the first quarter, after shrinking 0.03 percent the previous quarter. That meets the textbook definition of a recession -- two consecutive quarters of "negative growth." It would be Germany's second since 2001, though economists caution that the latest figures are preliminary. 
Even in good times, Europe's economic engine tends to run more slowly than that of the United States. Now that much of the European economy seems to have sputtered to a halt, economists are asking how well the rest of the world can run without it.
"We have to take it very seriously," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley. "The world doesn't have much of a growth cushion. So when we have shocks like SARS in Asia, and Europe seemingly falling into recession, it could push the global economy into recession."
Though the United States has been a reliable motor for the rest of the world, Mr. Roach said that with a growth rate of less than 2 percent, it could no longer be counted on to drag along Europe and Asia.
Indeed, the United States is indirectly aggravating Europe's misery, through the dollar, which has tumbled 26 percent against the euro in the last year. That could hobble growth in Europe by making German cars, Italian shoes and French wine more expensive in the American market. The euro resumed its rise against the dollar today, settling in New York trading at $1.1511, up from $1.1399 late Wednesday.
Yet the surging euro is, in some ways, the least of Europe's problems. Germany and France are plagued with chronically high unemployment, and with what bankers and industrialists see as calcified labor markets and cradle-to-grave social welfare programs that are increasingly unaffordable in an era of big budget deficits.
Already, France and Germany have breached European Union rules that limit the size of budget deficits at 3 percent of the gross domestic product. 
Many economists say that to lift these economies out of their sluggishness, Europe's major countries need to undertake an array of changes that will shake up their labor markets and reduce the role of the state in the economy. 
Recent strikes in France, political feuds in Germany and even protests in Austria demonstrate how hard it will be for European governments to undertake even the most basic of such changes.
"They're marching in France, they're distraught in Germany," Mr. Roach said. "Cutting interest rates is a short-term fix, but the intractability of their political systems is their biggest problem."
Many Europeans would agree with that conclusion. In France, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's plan to overhaul the state pension system drew tens of thousands of protesters to the streets on Tuesday in a paralyzing one-day strike.
In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's proposals to make it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers have ignited a dispute with labor unions and members of his own Social Democratic Party. With a razor-thin majority in Parliament and plummeting poll ratings, Mr. Schroder's grip on power is viewed as tenuous by political analysts here.
"Schroder is having huge problems even pushing through timid reforms," Mr. Kramer of Invesco said. "They're going to be watered down, and they're already not sufficient to kick-start the economy."
Since few Europeans expect economic recovery to come through political change, they increasingly look to the European Central Bank as the remedy for their ills. Pleas for the bank to lower its benchmark interest rate of 2.5 percent resounded across the Continent today.
Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel, said in an interview on Bloomberg's German television channel that the weak economic statistics would give the central bank another reason to lower rates.
"I'm certain the E.C.B. will look very closely at today's data," Mr. Eichel said. "It certainly has room to stimulate growth."
The bank resisted those calls at its last monthly meeting, arguing, in the words of its president, Wim Duisenberg, that "there's not yet anything excessive" in the rise of the euro. Most economists expect it to act in June, however, perhaps with a decisive cut of half a percentage point.
The bank's hard line has exposed a fracture between Europe's large and small countries, which have divergent growth rates and hence require different monetary policies. Disagreements over such issues could disrupt efforts to knit Europe's economies more closely together.
Among big companies, Volkswagen, Altana and other German and French companies have blamed the soaring euro for denting their earnings. Others, like BMW and Deutsche Telekom, make less of the currency's impact.
Deutsche Telekom, the debt-burdened German phone company, reported its first profit in two years today. The company, which operates a vast cellular network in the United States, said it earned nearly $1 billion in net income, after a stringent program of asset sales and cost-cutting.
BMW said it expected to match 2002's record profits this year. The chairman, Helmut Panke, said the company had entirely hedged its risk from currency fluctuations in 2003, and the bulk of the risk for 2004.
"The dollar can be as weak as it wants and the euro can be as strong as it wants," Mr. Panke declared today at BMW's annual meeting in Munich. "It won't make any difference to us in 2003."
Some economists argue that the effects of the euro on economic growth have been overblown.
David Walton, chief European economist at Goldman, Sachs, noted that the bulk of exports of European countries tend to go to other European countries, not to the United States. "For Germany, it's far more important what's happening in France or Italy than what's happening in the U.S.," he said.
That may be cold comfort. Italy reported that its economy contracted 0.1 percent in the first quarter, surprising analysts who had expected growth of 0.1 percent. The Netherlands was an even bigger surprise, shrinking 0.3 percent, when analysts had expected an 0.1 percent contraction.
In both countries, business investment dropped sharply while domestic demand remained slack. The Netherlands also meets the strict definition of a recession, with two consecutive quarters of declining output. 
Germany's stumble was surprising because it contradicted other recent reports, including industrial production data and surveys of business sentiment that indicated modest improvement. Because it was a preliminary estimate, the government offered no details.
"It came not only as a surprise, but as a shock," said Jurgen Pfister, the chief economist at Commerzbank.
Mr. Pfister stopped short of declaring Germany in recession, saying he needed another quarter to verify the trend. But the line between recession and recovery has become so fine that today's data confirms a more basic reality: Germany, Europe's largest economy, is dead in the water.
Commerzbank and its rivals were scrambling to lower their forecasts for the rest of the year. Absent an upward revision, most now think that the German economy will not grow at all in 2003. That would be the fourth consecutive year of little or no growth.
While some analysts likened Germany to Japan, others said that Germans simply needed to lower their expectations.
"Do we need to have more growth?" asked Martin W. Hufner, chief economist at HypoVereinsbank in Munich. "We already have our refrigerators, we already have our cellular phones, we already have our second cars. We'll be content if we adapt our expectations to the new reality."

HEADLINE: American Air Again Warns Of Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
American Airlines said yesterday in a securities filing that it might have to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors despite having extracted nearly $4 billion in annual cost cuts.
 The glum warning came on the same day that American, the world's largest airline, said that it had obtained more than $175 million in annual concessions from more than 100 suppliers, vendors and aircraft lessors. The airline said it would give those companies three million shares of common stock in AMR, its parent. 
 Those savings mean American is near to achieving the $4 billion in annual concessions it said it needed to return to profitability. The largest chunk comes from $1.8 billion in annual labor savings, most from unionized workers. American won the union agreements last month after a contentious voting process during which Donald J. Carty, the former chief executive, resigned over issues of compensation. 
As part of its labor cost cuts, American told its flight attendants' union on Wednesday that it would lay off more than 3,100 flight attendants on July 1, leaving 19,600 on the payroll.
Tara Baten, a spokeswoman for American, said Gerard J. Arpey, the new chief executive, and other managers were working to obtain still more savings from vendors and suppliers. American is $25 million short of its $4 billion goal.
But the company clearly has doubts that even the $4 billion in annual savings will help it avert bankruptcy. In the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, American said that "the company may nonetheless need to initiate a filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code because its financial condition will remain weak and its prospects uncertain."
"Among other things," the securities filing said, "the following factors have had and/or may have a negative impact on the company's business and financial results: the continued weakness of the U.S. economy; the residual effects of the war in Iraq; the fear of another terrorist attack; the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak; the inability of the company to satisfy the liquidity requirements or other covenants in certain of its credit arrangements"; and "the inability of the company to access the capital markets for additional financing."
Though domestic passenger traffic has shown slight year-to-year growth in recent weeks, international traffic remains weak, according to statistics from the Air Transport Association.
Jim Corridore, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, said American's self-assessment was accurate, given the bleak travel climate.
"My position for some time is, even after they got the employee concessions, they're still not out of the woods," Mr. Corridore said.
"Their past losses have been such over the past few years that I fear they won't be able to survive until the industry turns up again," he added. "I don't know if they can survive until 2005."
In April, AMR reported a first-quarter loss of $1.04 billion. It lost a total of nearly $5.2 billion in 2001 and 2002.
John Ward, the president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said in a message on the union's Web site that the round of layoffs in July meant American would have cut more than 6,000 flight attendants from its payroll since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
"The morale is, as expected, pretty awful," Mr. Ward wrote.
If morale among workers continues to deteriorate, then that could present serious problems for American, industry experts said. Disaffected workers could affect service, causing travelers to switch to other airlines.
In the summer of 2000, for example, the pilots at United Airlines, a unit of UAL, refused to work overtime -- what the company called a work slowdown -- because the pilots felt threatened by United's bid to merge with US Airways.
Citing a recent improvement in bookings, United said yesterday that it would restore 162 daily flights next month.
The airline is also recalling 1,527 laid-off flight attendants for June, the flight attendants' union said on its Web site. United confirmed the recall of flight attendants.

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves to Allow Trading Of Radio Spectrum Licenses 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
The government took the first steps today to permit companies to lease and trade radio spectrum licenses, a move that could result in improved service for the nation's millions of users of cellphones and other wireless devices. 
 By a vote of 4 to 1, the Federal Communications Commission removed the impediments for leasing such licenses, making it more economically efficient for big and small wireless companies to gain access to spectrum licenses held by others. That should help them patch the holes in their networks that create cellphone dead spots, without having to make big capital investments. 
 The move followed heavy lobbying by the largest wireless carriers, including AT&T, Verizon and Cingular, as well as players on Wall Street like Cantor Fitzgerald that are hoping to serve as brokers or clearinghouses in the creation of a secondary market for swapping licenses. 
Officials and industry analysts say the hope is that by allowing license holders to lease slivers of the spectrum that are currently underused, consumers will benefit from reduced instances of cellphone calls being dropped. More efficient use of the spectrum would make it easier to connect to the Internet with hand-held computers in crowded areas where the spectrum available is inadequate to move data and it should help extend wireless services in rural areas that are underserved.
The decision to allow companies to transfer portions of the spectrum they do not use promises to reshape the economics of the market. It will also change the longstanding federal framework that regulates the holders of spectrum licenses. 
The commission extinguished a 40-year-old rule that had the effect of requiring the holder of a spectrum license to also control the physical infrastructure needed to use that piece of the spectrum -- the antenna, the transmitter and the employees who run the operation. The rule was intended to ensure that the license holder be responsible for fixing signal interference and other problems. 
Under the new rules, the holder of a license who is not making use of the spectrum will be able to lease it to another company that would provide the equipment and personnel.
"Today's action is one of the most important spectrum reform decisions by this commission in the last decade," said Michael K. Powell, chairman of the commission, in a joint statement with another commissioner, Kevin J. Martin. "For years, the commission has rhetorically praised the concept and possibilities created by secondary markets in spectrum. Today that rhetoric turns into reality."
"Our decision signals a new day of increased spectrum access and improved services for consumers," they added.
Telecommunications industry executives were similarly pleased.
"Permitting secondary markets for spectrum will deliver to carriers improved access to the airwaves, increasing their flexibility and bringing down their costs, which should ultimately result in lower prices for consumers," said Tom Wheeler, president of the industry's main trade group, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association. "Football teams aren't done after draft day. They continue to meet their changing needs through trades and late-season acquisitions. Wireless carriers deserve, and will now receive, similar flexibility." 
Officials have provided a variety of examples of how a commodities market in the spectrum would work, including the following:
*Nationwide cellphone companies would be able to lease pieces of the spectrum in different regions of the country depending on the available supply and on customer demand. 
*News organizations covering political conventions or the Olympics, for example, would be able to buy contracts to use a piece of the spectrum during the event to give them greater capacity to beam pictures, sound and data.
*An airport with congested airwaves from air-traffic transmissions and cellphone use would be able to lease a piece of the spectrum from other spectrum holders that are not using their space during peak hours.
With the proliferation of wireless communications, including growth in wireless browsing of the Internet, an expanding group of companies has been clamoring for scarce space on portions of the spectrum.
But federal regulations have long impeded the ability of holders to sell or lease licenses. A 1963 F.C.C. decision called Intermountain Microwave linked the license to the requirement that each holder also control the transmission equipment. 
Three years ago, William E. Kennard, then chairman of the commission, proposed altering the rules and allowing the formation of a secondary market for spectrum licenses in response to increasing complaints from phone companies and others that they did not have enough space on the spectrum. 
In reconsidering the Intermountain case, the agency found a host of problems that prevented the owner of a license from lending it. In particular, it was not clear which company in such a transaction ought to be held responsible for problems like signal interference.
The commission said today that it had resolved that issue. A company can become what officials call a lease manager and provide short-term access to the spectrum. In those circumstances, the license holder would remain responsible for complying with rules and would be liable for any interference problems.
For long-term transfers, a company could turn over control of the license along with the responsibilities of complying with the regulations. That would require the approval of the commission, although officials emphasized today that they would streamline the process.
One commissioner, Michael J. Copps, dissented. He said the agency did not have the authority under the Communications Act of 1934 to alter the rules in such a way.

HEADLINE: Restless Koreans, Stifled at Home, Head Overseas 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
Jeong SeungKeun's apartment sits on a high floor of a recently built skyscraper, affording a fantastic view of the city. Modern art hangs on the walls. Fancy exercise equipment sits tucked away in a corner.
 Indeed, just about everything in Mr. Jeong's home speaks of a successful life, from the elegant clothes worn by his wife, who attentively oversees their two children's homework, down to the Calloway golf bag propped up by the door, ready for an early morning outing. 
 For all of his comfort, however, Mr. Jeong, a 43-year-old civil engineer, wants out. Like hundreds of other high-achieving South Koreans each year, he has decided to emigrate to the United States, where he figures his family's life, if not necessarily richer, will be far more enriching in personal terms. 
"I've walked an elite path all of my life in Korea, and it would be easy to spend the rest of our lives here," said Mr. Jeong, who is a managing director at one of South Korea's major international construction firms. "But the United States is the center of the world these days, the country with the most to offer. We have a saying, if you want to meet the tiger, you have to enter its cave, and I want our children to grow up according to American standards."
The profile of those who emigrate from South Korea has changed significantly in less than a generation, a shift that reflects the country's dizzying economic rise.
In the 1970's and 80's most South Koreans who left their country were from the lower middle class and went abroad because they thought that was the only way they could improve their economic status. Once in the United States, they often founded mom-and-pop grocery stores in depressed urban neighborhoods, working endless hours, sacrificing themselves for the education of their children.
Now, South Korea's economic takeoff and democratization, which began in the 1980's, have created widespread opportunity and hope. Fewer people are seeking their fortunes abroad -- and those who do increasingly tend to be among the most successful, those who find that even the newly affluent and open South Korea cannot match their ambitions.
In 1980, 29,572 South Koreans were issued immigration visas to the United States; the number last year was just 6,696. 
"Up until the early 1990's, the push factor out of Korea was much more important than the pull factor from the United States," said Bernard Alter, the consul general at the American Embassy in Seoul, adding that immigration to the United States has sharply declined. "Levels are probably one-fifth of what they were in the 1980's, but proportionally, the investor category has become much more important."
High achievers of the upper middle class who leave today often do so with $250,000 or more in savings. Their reasons include a yearning for the wide-open spaces not found in South Korea, one of the most densely populated countries, and an itch for more professional stimulation.
Better education for children remains another huge part of the equation, although in these cases the switch is often from the best that South Korea has to offer to elite American schooling. South Koreans like the Jeong family say they expect that in the United States their children will learn things like individuality and problem-solving that they feel are missing back home.
"My daughter, who is 11, has to work until 11 p.m. every night just to finish her homework," said Mr. Jeong's 39-year-old wife, Kyung Woon, who said she eagerly looked forward to their move to the Seattle area later this year.
"Things are so competitive in Korea there isno time for children to play," she said. "In America, she will be able to get a good education and relax sometimes, which makes you well-rounded.
"Besides, I think there is more fresh air there." 
Generally, American consular officials say, the United States is happy to receive well-heeled immigrants like the Jeongs, who will be entering on investor visas, which, among other qualifications, generally require an investment of more than $100,000 in a business in the United States. The Jeongs' plans include investing immediately in several small retail store franchises, to develop a stream of income until Mr. Jeong can find work in his own profession again.
The Jeongs are arranging their relocation, including their American visas, through an emigration service run by Kang Young Ho, the chief executive officer and founder of the Nammi Emigration Corporation, a pioneer 13 years ago in a field that has now grown crowded with international relocation services for this country's upper middle class.
"I myself emigrated to Canada in 1971, with my wife and son, and $200 in my pocket," said Mr. Kang, a voluble man with a loud laugh. "Everybody was like that back then."
Asked what motive for moving is most frequently cited by his clients, without hesitating Mr. Kang, whose company relocates about 50 families to the United States and 200 to Canada each year, said English-language education.
"Before, people were going to make money and survive, but now it is to raise their children in English," Mr. Kang said. "We are one of the worst countries in the world for English education. Even our English teachers can't speak English."
The consolidation of the English language's place as an indispensable tool in business and many other fields, in the 1990's, coincided with the most profound period in South Korea's economic transformation.
"The people who hire my services think of $100,000 as peanuts," Mr. Kang said. "They are doctors, professionals, civil servants, and most of them made a killing with the explosion of real estate values."
As upscale emigration has become more and more popular in South Korea, recently, many professionals have begun to eschew the services of companies like Mr. Kang's, which cost $15,000 or more, pooling information, both tactical and practical. Sometimes they do business together in their new country of adoption.
Kim Jong Kap, a 37-year-old manager with the Industrial Bank of Korea, banded together in an online group with about 30 other South Korean accountants who have passed the accreditation test of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and are seeking to emigrate and set up businesses in the United States.
Mr. Kim, whose wife, a cancer researcher at Columbia, lives with their two small children, plans to join them in August. He invited three other men he had never met in person, all C.P.A.'s who have been talking up American business ventures online for weeks, to meet a foreign journalist at a downtown hotel.
"There's nothing bad about Korea, but the company I work for doesn't really have a lot to teach me anymore," Mr. Kim said. "We view America as the frontier, and I want to experience it."
Kim Song Ho, his online acquaintance, plans to move to the United States this summer too, even though this month he will marry a women with a big job -- and salary -- at the Korea Stock Exchange. Mr. Kim is not sure yet whether he wants to set himself up in Los Angeles, Chicago or Atlanta. Whichever he chooses, at least for now his soon-to-be wife, will stay behind.
"I know that in America I'll be rewarded for the amount of work I do, and not just designated to a position and stuck there," Mr. Kim said. "My fiancee is behind me all the way. Even if I have to struggle, she says, she wants me to have the reward of being a self-made man."

HEADLINE: Slicing and Dicing: Tired Senators Achieve Goal, to Pass a Tax Bill, Any Tax Bill 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
When the Senate began to talk last month about cutting taxes, the goals set out by Republicans were clear and high-minded: End the double taxation on dividends Republicans said they were seeking. Create jobs through business investment. Reduce the tax burden on two-income families.
 But by tonight, as weary senators finally approved their oddly shaped tax cut, the goal had shrunk to something very different: Pass a tax bill, any tax bill, and get it to a conference with the House where the real work would begin. 
 Theoretically, the point of a tax reduction is to revive a stagnant economy. But even the most conservative senators said they barely recognized that original objective in the bill they passed tonight, after it had been sliced, diced and rearranged to fit the needs of the many swing senators whose votes were necessary for passage.
"I think there's a great question of exactly what we're passing today," said Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who strongly supports the president's drive for widespread tax reduction. "But here in the Senate, with the way things are, we just had to pass something out of here and get it to conference. Hopefully there we can get back to the idea of stimulating the economy."
The Senate bill would not end the double taxation of dividends that Mr. Bush has crusaded for across the country. It would halve the dividend tax this year, then stop it for three years, at which point it would come back again. This maneuver, known as a sunset, was necessary to satisfy senators who said the tax cut could not cost more than $350 billion, less than half of President Bush's original request. Supporters say they hope that after the cut expires in 2007, they can reinstate it.
The bill raises the taxes of Americans working abroad, to stay within the $350 billion shoebox, and reduces only slightly the so-called marriage penalty on two-income couples. To placate centrist senators concerned about the huge budget gaps in the states, the bill would provide $20 billion in aid to state and local governments.
All of these techniques have had the unusual effect of uniting House conservatives and Senate Democrats in ridiculing the final product, which seemed to generate no parental pride tonight. Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat who supported the Bush tax cut in 2001, said today's bill "set a new standard for gimmicks," and predicted that it would not improve in conference.
"To get the votes, they had to resort to gimmickry to sunset things that they always argued should never be sunsetted," Mr. Breaux said. "I mean, we're cutting the dividend tax for three years and then trying to extend it every year? No one thinks that's a good idea."
Another lawmaker who says he considers the bill a bad idea is House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who today described the plan as an "all of a sudden you see it, and now you don't" idea.
"If the dividend tax is 50 percent and then nothing, and all of a sudden it is back to 100 percent or whatever it is, my feeling is that it does not solve the problem," Mr. Hastert said, also expressing hope that things would be worked out in conference. By contrast, he said, the House had passed "a very good bill," but he did not mention that his chamber's bill also sunsets a half-dozen major provisions.
The off-again-on-again dividend tax cut was included at the insistence of the White House, Republican officials said. The president has invested time and prestige in the idea that the dividend tax must be eliminated completely because its underlying premise -- taxing corporate profits twice -- is wrong at a fundamental, almost moral level. By having it in the bill even in a truncated form, administration officials argued, there was a greater chance that something similar would appear in the conference agreement.
But the very act of eliminating the tax and then restoring it in 2007 has stunned and angered the economic conservatives who would normally be the president's natural allies on the bill. Several said it would not change business behavior and investment, because no manager could know for certain whether Congress would bring it back after it expired.
"I can understand the political reasons why they put it in that way, but it's such an incredibly bad idea," said Norbert Michel, a tax policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington. "Phasing it in and then sunsetting it so quickly will eliminate all the economic benefit. And then when it doesn't work, your enemies will just say it produced no growth, so why should we pass it again."
Kevin A. Hassett, resident scholar at the pro-business American Enterprise Institute, called the idea bizarre and "one of the most patently absurd tax policies ever proposed."
With the Senate so closely divided, however, political concerns tend to trump fiscal ones. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of two Democratic senators who supported the final plan, spoke for many in the chamber today when he said an idea was not a gimmick "if it lets you do the best you can with what you've got." 
Mr. Brownback said many senators were relieved that a tax bill passed at all.
"Getting anything through is a success," he said. "Of course, I realize that in the Senate our standards of success are a bit lower than in other places."

HEADLINE: BUDGETS IN CRISIS: OVERVIEW; 
STATE LEGISLATURE OVERRIDES PATAKI ON BUDGET VETOES

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 15 

 BODY:
For the first time in two decades, New York's Legislature overrode a governor's vetoes of its spending plan today. The lawmakers revived a budget that increases state taxes to restore billions of dollars in spending on schools, hospitals, nursing homes and localities.
 Moving deliberately and in a coordinated fashion rarely seen in Albany, both Republicans and Democrats rolled over George E. Pataki, the three-term Republican governor, who seemed resigned to losing the biggest governing battle of his career. 
 Both chambers of the Legislature moved with far greater speed than even they had expected, engaging in very little debate. The only support for the governor came from the hard-line conservative Republicans in the Assembly, who said the budget was financially unsound. 
The process began shortly after 11 a.m. The Democratic Assembly finished overriding all 119 vetoes by 3:26 p.m. The Republican Senate, which had started the process later, finished soon afterward, passing all 119 overrides unanimously. 
Less than 20 hours after Governor Pataki had signed the scores of vetoes with much fanfare, they were cast aside.
But the governor continued to act in defiance: Later in the day, he announced that he would veto a $1.8 billion assistance package that the Legislature had passed for New York City. That set the stage for another override fight in the Legislature, which has until the end of its session in June to act.
By enacting tax increases that a governor had vetoed, the Legislature revealed a boldness that many in Albany said they could not remember seeing before. The two houses had not turned back a veto of a spending plan since 1982, when Hugh L. Carey was governor.
The lawmakers' swift action demonstrated that a legislative body known for its plodding ways and entrenched partisan politics could exert a different kind of influence on state government.
The process departed from the usual custom in Albany of governing by three men in a room: Mr. Pataki; Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader; and Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, who normally decide issues and get their conferences to rubber-stamp them.
Mr. Pataki acknowledged early in the day that he did not have the votes to prevail. "This is a sad day for New Yorkers," said the governor, speaking after ceremonies this morning honoring the state police. "The Legislature is passing, over my vetoes, the largest tax increase in the state's history." Legislators vigorously dispute that assertion.
The governor, as he has all week, seemed to be looking beyond the moment, perhaps setting up his argument for next year. He said the Legislature's $92.8 billion budget was unbalanced, would worsen the state's financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression, and create deficits in future years. "I knew that it was going to be a very difficult fight to prevent the override, but the vetoes were purely a matter of principle," Mr. Pataki said.
The governor said he would carry out the parts of the budget that his lawyers believe are constitutional. He said he would ensure that school districts receive their state aid, even though he believed that part of the budget was unconstitutional.
He said he had not decided yet whether to put in place other large appropriations he says were improperly drafted by the Legislature and which he considers unconstitutional. He also would not say whether he would take the Legislature to court, as he did in 1998 and 2001, to ask a judge to nullify much of the budget.
By leaving the possibility of lawsuits open, he left an air of uncertainty over a budget that appeared to be all but resolved, more than 40 days late but still earlier than in many other years. The state has missed the April 1 budget deadline every year for 19 years in a row.
Mr. Silver characterized the day's mood as solemn. Sitting in his office after the overrides, he munched on pretzels and watched the governor's news conference on television.
Mr. Silver said that he wished the governor had been more involved in the final budget deal, but that the overrides showed that "there is a safety mechanism when there is a failure of agreement between the three parties." He added, "The framers of the Constitution actually had this circumstance in mind, and we went right through it the way they had it in mind."
On the Republican side, in the Senate, the overrides were seen by many as a breakdown of the governor's influence over his own party.
Still, Mr. Bruno said the legislative victory was not a political breach with Mr. Pataki. Rather, he said, it represented the senators' determination to carry out the will of their constituents, who across the state had expressed fears that the governor's proposed cuts would push local property taxes up, close hospitals and cause teacher layoffs.
"The two-thirds majority felt that they were right, and they overrode all of the vetoes, and that is now the budget for the people here in New York State," Mr. Bruno said. He said it was time to move on and heal whatever hurt remained.
"Two-thirds of the Legislature voting, again, unanimously in the Senate on every issue ought to make some statement," he said. "And I would think the governor would take that into consideration as he contemplates how he moves forward."
The state's $11.5 billion deficit and its dire fiscal situation set off the battle that led to the veto-override showdown, with the two sides disagreeing on how to bridge the shortfall. The governor wanted to borrow and cut local assistance. The Legislature wanted to raise sales and personal income taxes, borrow and restore local aid.
The lawmakers received one bit of positive news today: The United States Senate was set to pass a tax-cut bill that included a provision that would provide $20 billion over two years to states and localities. Half the money would be set aside to bail out states and localities facing the worst financial problems in decades; the rest would help them cover mounting Medicaid costs.
New York State stands to receive about $2.2 billion, with as much as $460 million going to New York City, according to Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who was one of the authors of the aid package for states. The package still needs approval by the House.
Some Republicans in the State Senate said they resented what they saw as Governor Pataki's withdrawal from the process. Senator Dale M. Volker, a Republican from Depew, in western New York, said Mr. Pataki did not propose Medicaid reform in his budget, but then complained that the Legislature had failed to enact such reforms.
"I think that the governor, in my opinion, made it an institutional thing," Mr. Volker said. "And when the members saw that they felt it was an institutional thing, some of them got mad."
He said history showed that governors who challenge the entire Legislature rarely win. "If you challenge the institution, you're going to be in trouble," he said.
Over recent days, fiscal purists said that both the Legislature's and the governor's budget plans were flawed, mainly because each relied on $4.2 billion in borrowing to pay for day-to-day operating costs, which would lead to deficits in later years.
Some lawmakers said that point was not lost on them. One, Assemblyman William L. Parment, Democrat of Jamestown, said that the decision to override was a difficult one, but that he decided to vote for the overrides in part because he thought that the Legislature's budget was fairer to the poor and put less burden on property taxes.
"The governor is calling this a fiscal train wreck," Mr. Parment said, repeating an idea he had told a television reporter. "I would point out, though, that the governor was the chief engineer. He put the train on the track, opened the throttle wide open, then jumped from the cab and now is standing on the side of the tracks calling, 'Train wreck!' Well, of course it's a train wreck. There's no engineer in the cab."
Others said it was a simple decision of not wanting to accept the governor's cuts to education and Medicaid, which they said would drive up property taxes in localities.
Paul A. Tokasz, a Democratic assemblyman from Cheektowaga, in western New York, said the Cleveland Hill school district has indicated that its property tax levy would increase by 19 percent under the governor's proposal, compared with 4 percent under the legislative proposal.
"By not doing state aid to suburban school districts, the governor is saying, 'Property taxpayers, you pay the bill,' " Mr. Tokasz said. "Property taxes are the most regressive way we can pay for services."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
With Quick Approval, Moreno Buys Angels From Disney

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
For $182.5 million, Arturo Moreno bought a baseball team yesterday. Why did he want to do that in these perilous times both for the economy and baseball?
 "I guess I look at baseball as something that historically has been here for a long time," Moreno said after other owners unanimously approved him as the new owner of the Anaheim Angels, the defending World Series champions. "I think it's going to be here for a long time. It's a fun thing. It's a kids' game. I think long-term the balance of entertainment will always lean toward baseball. I think it's just part of our culture." 
 Moreno, 56, was rewarded for his faith in baseball by gaining rapid approval by his new partners.
"This sale went through the ownership committee, executive council and ownership as fast as anything I've ever seen in all my years in baseball," Commissioner Bud Selig said at an unusually brief news conference at baseball's Manhattan headquarters. 
Most often the approval process takes many months. In this instance, Moreno was the sole buyer, and he was paying cash. "He's what you hope you're going to get when you get an owner," Selig said.
Both Selig and Moreno played down the fact that Moreno is the first Hispanic, or even member of a minority group, to buy controlling interest in a Major League Baseball team. There's even some question whether Moreno can be considered a minority-group member. He is of Mexican descent, but as he said: "I'm fourth-generation American. First thing is I'm an American" He was born and raised in Tucson and has homes in Phoenix and Southern California.
"I'm proud of being a Mexican-American, but as far as being a first minority," he added, he didn't place any significance on that. "I think we're all Americans. Most of us are immigrants from someplace, and I think we always try to do our best being an American." 
Moreno bought the Angels from the Walt Disney Company, which paid Gene Autry, the original owner, $130 million for the team in a two-stage transaction. Disney bought 25 percent and assumed control in 1996, then added the rest after Autry died in 1998. Disney spent $100 million for a stadium renovation and has said it has lost $100 million on the team during its ownership. 
The Angels succeeded in doing under Disney what Autry yearned for in vain -- win the World Series. They never even reached the World Series in Autry's 38-year ownership. They reached it and won it as the American League wild-card team last year.
"I think they have good people," Moreno said when asked if he planned changes. "Obviously they won a world championship. For me, it's a learning process. I'm going to try to sit back and listen. I've been very successful surrounding myself with good people and keeping those people in place and over a period of time try to step up to the plate."
But, Moreno added, he would be involved with the operation of the team on a day-to-day basis. 
Moreno sold his outdoor advertising company in 1999 for more than $8 billion. He sold his 5 percent ownership of the Arizona Diamondbacks in November.
The completion of the sale of the Angels leaves the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Atlanta Braves, the Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos as teams available for purchase. Among those teams, the Dodgers are most actively in play.
Malcolm Glazer, owner of the National Football League's Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is the leading contender to buy the Dodgers, whose owner, the Fox Group, wants to get at least $350 million for the team it paid $311 million for in 1998. Glazer and his family are considered the most likely buyers because other prospective purchasers, including the Dave Checketts group, have dropped out.
The N.F.L. has a cross-ownership policy that could ordinarily block Glazer's ownership of the Dodgers, but Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has said a deal could be approved if the Glazers use independent resources and financing and have a management that is separate from that of the Buccaneers.

HEADLINE: If You Want to Lead the Fed In New York, Raise Your Hand 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Does anyone want to be president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York? Only a month before the planned departure of the current president, William J. McDonough, several top candidates for the job have apparently pulled out of the running.
 Yesterday, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said he did not want to assume the post after Mr. McDonough leaves for Washington to become chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
 "I am not interested in the job," Mr. Ferguson said in a statement relayed by a spokeswoman. "I am extremely happy in the job I'm doing here in Washington." 
Attention shifted to Mr. Ferguson and a few other well-known names in economics and finance after two former leading candidates for Mr. McDonough's position appeared to drop out.
"I would have thought that Roger would be a good choice as someone who has been on the outside and on the inside, and has the respect that's needed," said Stephen G. Cecchetti, a professor of economics at Ohio State University and former director of research at the New York Fed. Mr. Cecchetti had not been informed of Mr. Ferguson's decision at the time he was interviewed.
In the last few days, The Washington Post and news wires reported that Peter R. Fisher and Stanley Fischer were no longer in contention.
Mr. Fisher, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, was widely regarded as a shoo-in for the New York Fed's presidency, thanks in part to his role in coordinating the bailout of Long-Term Capital Management, a troubled hedge fund linked to several big banks, in 1998.
A few weeks ago, however, a buzz began to build around Stanley Fischer, a vice chairman of Citigroup who had been the chief economist of the World Bank and second in command at the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Fischer declined to comment on the search process when reached by phone on Wednesday evening.
Mr. Fisher could not be reached for comment, though a person close to him said he had removed himself from consideration.
The president of the New York Fed acts as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions about monetary policy.
"The job is much more powerful than the public understands," said Anthony M. Solomon, a former president of the New York Fed and current chairman of the executive committee at the Institute for International Economics.
In addition to making the securities trades that carry out monetary policy, Mr. Solomon said, "probably two-thirds of the U.S. government's bond sales are in the New York federal district, and a great number of the financial transactions in the country are in the New York federal district."
Other names that have circulated on Wall Street and in Washington include William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Stephen Friedman, the White House's top economic adviser; and Martin S. Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard University who is also president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan group.
Mr. Poole was not available for comment yesterday.
Professor Feldstein had been held out as a successor to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before President Bush declared his intent to reappoint Mr. Greenspan. Professor Feldstein was out of the country yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
A senior Wall Street economist said he considered Professor Feldstein a candidate, "although I really think he wants Greenspan's job." The economist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that David H. Komansky, a former chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, might also be a good choice. "Having somebody who's involved in the marketplace has its advantages," he said.
If no one is appointed to succeed Mr. McDonough before he leaves in mid-June, the first vice president, Jamie B. Stewart Jr., will assume the president's responsibilities, said Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the New York Fed. Mr. Bakstansky said Mr. Stewart was not granting interviews.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Weekender Bridgewater, Conn.

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH MAKER 

 BODY:
"IT's delicious," said Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines, who bought a 1790 farmhouse in Bridgewater for $1.3 million in 1997 and has spent every possible weekend there with her family since. "I look out at the horses and the baby cows in the fields across the road, and just say 'ahhh.' You come to Bridgewater and just completely chill out and calm down."
 Back in the 1980's, weekenders were virtually unheard of in Bridgewater. Now, drawn by the country serenity, they make up about a third of the residents, according to the town clerk. 
 Bridgewater is determined to retain its character. The vigilance of both residents and public officials, most notably William Stuart, who has been the first selectman for 22 years, have kept it a quiet country town of stately Victorian and Colonial houses -- many of them now worth millions of dollars -- and sprawling farmsteads. 
"Developers lose completely here," said Rebecca Devine, a third-generation Bridgewater native. "I think most of them know enough to not even bother trying."
Mr. Stuart is especially protective of the town. "We're blowing up the bridge over Lake Lillinonah," he said with a wink, speaking of the main entrance to town, "and we're posting 'Keep Out' signs everywhere else."

The Scene
"We have a lot of celebrities here, but nobody bothers them," said Sandra Neary, director of the town's public library. "They just sort of blend right in with everyone else."
At the Bridgewater Village Store, built in 1899 and now stocked with specialty coffees, chocolates, deli meals and fresh flowers, longtime farming families line up for coffee and scones with celebrities like Mia Farrow, or the writers William and Susan Kinsolving, or Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer, who have sold their home here but still own a large Arabian horse farm in town.
Susie Gharib, a co-anchor of the "Nightly Business Report" on public television, and her husband, the venture capitalist Fred Nazem, may have pioneered the weekender movement in Bridgewater. They bought a dilapidated 1775 house 22 years ago and have transformed the property into a luxurious estate worth millions. They are happy that Bridgewater has no "high-pressure social scene," as Ms. Gharib puts it. "Here, you can go around in a baseball cap and jeans and feel just right," she said.
Many wealthy New Yorkers board their horses at Shallow Brook Farm, owned by Mr. Stuart, and are members of the Fairfield County Hounds, a cross-country riding club associated with the farm.
Despite the name, it is not a hunt club. "We don't kill foxes," said one member, John Hennigan, who escapes to Bridgewater from Rye every weekend. "It's all about riding."
Community events flourish. In October, contestants rig contraptions to launch pumpkins in the pumpkin catapult party, open to everyone from Bridgewater and neighboring Roxbury. In the ridiculously entertaining Tractor Parade, held on Labor Day weekend, fancifully decorated tractors parade down Main Street and Mr. Stuart holds a barbecue at his house, open to all residents. In August, many of the town's residents volunteer in some way, from baking pies to selling tickets to spinning the cake wheel, at the Bridgewater Fair, a large and deliberately old-fashioned country fair and the main source of revenue for the fire department.

Pros
Bridgewater has been unusually successful in preserving open space, mainly through zoning regulations that require four-acre lots for new houses in most of the town. Wealthy residents have also bought up farm land and deeded it to land trusts, and many have preserved their own property through conservation easements.
Stuart Saft, a commercial real estate lawyer in Manhattan, and his wife, Stephanie, live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and own a weekend home on Lake Lillinonah in Bridgewater. "This lake is 16 miles long and there are maybe 40 houses on it," Mr. Saft said. "It's totally pristine because so much of it is preserved in land trusts."
There are two points of public access on the lake -- a state-owned boat launch on Route 133 and a town park tucked away down a quiet lane.
With residents well able to pay their town taxes, Bridgewater has good services, including highly efficient road maintenance. "You might recall we had a bit of snow this year?" Mr. Saft asked. "Well, not once did we have a problem getting down our road. It was plowed constantly."
A 42-acre recreation area in the center of town has ball fields, playgrounds, tennis and basketball courts, bike paths and a riding ring. Another 26-acres across the street is for hiking and other recreation. 
Bridgewater also has a long history of generous gifts from citizens, including large sums of money for public land, the library, town hall renovations and the Bridgewater Scholarship Fund, which helps local students with college costs.
"There's a great sense of community here, and everyone treats each other with enormous kindness and respect," Mrs. Saft said.

Cons
Bridgewater has the distinction of being one of only two dry towns in Connecticut, so there are no liquor stores, restaurants or nightclubs. The only two retail businesses in town are the Village Store and a gas station with a convenience shop. The nearest grocery store is about seven miles away.
There is a bank, but no doctors or hospitals. There are no water or sewer lines. Residents must have their own wells and septic tanks.
The price of admission to Bridgewater is high. The town's exclusivity is reinforced not only by stringent zoning, but by high real estate prices.

Real Estate Market
Housing prices have steadily soared over the last two decades. Carolyn Klemm, an agent at Klemm Real Estate in nearby Washington, Conn. (860-868-7313), said she helped an owner sell a three-bedroom home on 10 acres with a pond and guesthouse for $325,000 in 1985 and then represented a new owner who sold the same house this year for $1.2 million. Another property that she handled, an 1820 farmhouse on 17 acres with a pool, went for $300,000 in the late 1980's and is now on the market for $875,000.
"I do think you'll see prices leveling off for a while, because of the war and the economy," Ms. Klemm said.
This week, Joy Luongo, regional manager of William Raveis Real Estate in Washington (860-868-0511), was listing a contemporary home on five acres with a pond and a brook, Spanish marble floors and a Japanese spa made of stone that was blasted from the property, for $2.25 million. 
Altogether the Multiple Listing Service had 23 properties available in Bridgewater this week, ranging from a simple 1,125-square-foot cottage for $254,000 to a 3,330-square-foot lakefront home with a pool and guesthouse on 34 acres for $2.6 million.

HEADLINE: As Ethics Panel Raises Its Profile, Chairman Warns of Budget Cuts 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Unlike, say, that of the Department of Sanitation, the work of the Conflicts of Interest Board goes largely unnoticed by most New Yorkers. The board members spend much of their time advising city employees on things like what to do when they marry someone with a stock portfolio full of companies doing business with the city, or whether it is acceptable to take a gift from a contractor (as a rule, no).
 But a billionaire mayor, an anemic economy and an administration determined to avoid even the appearance of impropriety have combined to greatly raise the profile and expand the mission of the board, which examines and rules on myriad financial and conduct issues. 
 Yet even as its work increases, budget cuts are threatening some of the basic missions of the board, said its chairman, Steven B. Rosenfeld, who was appointed by the mayor last year. 
"The mayor has said there are no sacred cows," Mr. Rosenfeld said in a recent interview in his Midtown office at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, where he is a partner in the law firm's litigation department. "And I'm not asking to be an exception. But I would think there would be some recognition that a small agency can't function with these kinds of cuts in staffing."
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg first took office, he became the most scrutinized mayor since the agency's inception in 1988. The board spent several months poring over the personal finances of Mr. Bloomberg, who at that time had extensive stock holdings and complicated relationships with major companies doing business with the city through his firm, Bloomberg LP. 
At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg's administration has been soliciting contributions from the private sector to help shore up city services that are threatened by extensive budget cuts. Last week, the board essentially reversed its earlier ruling on fund-raising by city officials, saying that some degree was acceptable.
Mr. Bloomberg has required many city officials to be trained in conflict-of-interest issues. 
"The mayor wants our administration to have the highest ethical standards," said his press secretary, Edward Skyler. "So having an open and ongoing dialogue with the C.O.I.B. helps avoid even the appearance of impropriety."
Since 2001, telephone requests for advice from the board have risen 46 percent, and complaints to the agency have risen 85 percent. At the end of 2001, 40 requests for advice had not been resolved and were rolled over to the next year; at the end of 2002, 184 such requests were pending.
"The number of complaints and requests are up because people are much more knowledgeable and sensitive about the law," Mr. Rosenfeld said. But, he added, "advice that has to be delayed that long ends up being not useful advice at all."
Mr. Rosenfeld said his agency recently laid off the four people who made up its education and training unit, which the Bloomberg administration has been relying on to spread the word about conflict-of-interest issues. Today, he will ask the City Council to restore $143,000 to reinstate that unit. And he will seek to remove the mayor's authority over the agency's budget, as is the case with the Campaign Finance Board.
The Conflicts of Interest Board was established in 1988 as part of the city's charter reform and as the successor to the Board of Ethics, which was formed in 1959. The board is a nonmayoral city agency charged with interpreting and enforcing the city's conflict-of-interest rules, but the mayor appoints the board's five members to staggered six-year terms. The agency had been operating with 23 people -- it is down to 17 after budget cuts -- divided among six units: legal advice, training and education, financial disclosure, enforcement, management information systems, and administration.
One of the first acts the board undertook after Mr. Bloomberg took office was an eight-month study of the mayor's holdings and relationships with a wide variety of companies.
The resulting 13-page opinion advised the mayor to sell all of his stocks, along with his interests in a hedge fund, and to refrain from participating in the selection of the city's bond underwriters, so as not to appear to favor Merrill Lynch, which owns 20 percent of his firm. 
The board also said Mr. Bloomberg should recuse himself from city decisions about cable television franchises, so as not to appear to favor Bloomberg Television.
"No mayor has ever confronted these issues," Mr. Rosenfeld said. "And he has attracted other people from the private sector who require similar kind of scrutiny."
In what Mr. Rosenfeld characterized as one of the board's most important rulings in years, the panel concluded last week that city officials could directly solicit contributions for the city from the private sector unless those being solicited had matters before the city. Before that, such solicitation had been prohibited. 
The board will also ask the mayor's charter revision committee to remove the agency from mayoral oversight of its budget. "There is something inconsistent with having a watchdog agency watching over city officials when the city holds the purse strings," Mr. Rosenfeld said. It will also seek to increase the maximum fines for violations to $25,000 from its current $10,000 level, to streamline the financial disclosure process and to raise the income threshold of those subject to financial disclosure law.

HEADLINE: Keepers of Bush Image Lift Stagecraft to New Heights 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
George W. Bush's "Top Gun" landing on the deck of the carrier Abraham Lincoln will be remembered as one of the most audacious moments of presidential theater in American history. But it was only the latest example of how the Bush administration, going far beyond the foundations in stagecraft set by the Reagan White House, is using the powers of television and technology to promote a presidency like never before.
 Officials of past Democratic and Republican administrations marvel at how the White House does not seem to miss an opportunity to showcase Mr. Bush in dramatic and perfectly lighted settings. It is all by design: the White House has stocked its communications operation with people from network television who have expertise in lighting, camera angles and the importance of backdrops. 
 On Tuesday, at a speech promoting his economic plan in Indianapolis, White House aides went so far as to ask people in the crowd behind Mr. Bush to take off their ties, WISH-TV in Indianapolis reported, so they would look more like the ordinary folk the president said would benefit from his tax cut. 
"They understand the visual as well as anybody ever has," said Michael K. Deaver, Ronald Reagan's chief image maker. "They watched what we did, they watched the mistakes of Bush I, they watched how Clinton kind of stumbled into it, and they've taken it to an art form."
The White House efforts have been ambitious -- and costly. For the prime-time television address that Mr. Bush delivered to the nation on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, the White House rented three barges of giant Musco lights, the kind used to illuminate sports stadiums and rock concerts, sent them across New York Harbor, tethered them in the water around the base of the Statue of Liberty and then blasted them upward to illuminate all 305 feet of America's symbol of freedom. It was the ultimate patriotic backdrop for Mr. Bush, who spoke from Ellis Island.
For a speech that Mr. Bush delivered last summer at Mount Rushmore, the White House positioned the best platform for television crews off to one side, not head on as other White Houses have done, so that the cameras caught Mr. Bush in profile, his face perfectly aligned with the four presidents carved in stone.
And on Monday, for remarks the president made promoting his tax cut plan near Albuquerque, the White House unfurled a backdrop that proclaimed its message of the day, "Helping Small Business," over and over. The type was too small to be read by most in the audience, but just the right size for television viewers at home.
"I don't know who does it," Mr. Deaver said, "but somebody's got a good eye over there."
That somebody, White House officials and television executives say, is in fact three or four people. First among equals is Scott Sforza, a former ABC producer who was hired by the Bush campaign in Austin, Tex., and who now works for Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. Mr. Sforza created the White House "message of the day" backdrops and helped design the $250,000 set at the United States Central Command forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, during the Iraq war.
Mr. Sforza works closely with Bob DeServi, a former NBC cameraman whom the Bush White House hired after seeing his work in the 2000 campaign. Mr. DeServi, whose title is associate director of communications for production, is considered a master at lighting. "You want it, I'll heat it up and make a picture," he said early this week. Mr. DeServi helped produce one of Mr. Bush's largest events, a speech to a crowd in Revolution Square in Bucharest last November.
To stage the event, Mr. DeServi went so far as to rent Musco lights in Britain, which were then shipped across the English Channel and driven across Europe to Romania, where they lighted Mr. Bush and the giant stage across from the country's former Communist headquarters.
A third crucial player is Greg Jenkins, a former Fox News television producer in Washington who is now the director of presidential advance. Mr. Jenkins manages the small army of staff members and volunteers who move days ahead of Mr. Bush and his entourage to set up the staging of all White House events.
"We pay particular attention to not only what the president says but what the American people see," Mr. Bartlett said. "Americans are leading busy lives, and sometimes they don't have the opportunity to read a story or listen to an entire broadcast. But if they can have an instant understanding of what the president is talking about by seeing 60 seconds of television, you accomplish your goals as communicators. So we take it seriously."
The president's image makers, Mr. Bartlett said, work within a budget for White House travel and events allotted by Congress, which for fiscal 2003 was $3.7 million. He said he did not know the specific cost of staging Mr. Bush's Sept. 11 anniversary speech, or what the White House was charged for the lights. A spokeswoman at the headquarters of Musco Lighting in Oskaloosa, Iowa, said the company did not disclose the prices it charged clients. 
White House communications operatives in previous administrations said many costs of presidential trips were paid for by whoever was deemed the official host of a trip -- typically a federal agency, a city or a company. Trips deemed political are paid for by the parties.
"The total cost of a trip is ultimately shared across a wide spectrum of agencies and hosts," said Joshua King, who was director of production of presidential events in the Clinton administration. "To get to who really pays for presidential events would keep a team of accountants very busy."
The most elaborate -- and criticized -- White House event so far was Mr. Bush's speech aboard the Abraham Lincoln announcing the end of major combat in Iraq. White House officials say that a variety of people, including the president, came up with the idea, and that Mr. Sforza embedded himself on the carrier to make preparations days before Mr. Bush's landing in a flight suit and his early evening speech.
Media strategists noted afterward that Mr. Sforza and his aides had choreographed every aspect of the event, even down to the members of the Lincoln crew arrayed in coordinated shirt colors over Mr. Bush's right shoulder and the "Mission Accomplished" banner placed to perfectly capture the president and the celebratory two words in a single shot. The speech was specifically timed for what image makers call "magic hour light," which cast a golden glow on Mr. Bush.
"If you looked at the TV picture, you saw there was flattering light on his left cheek and slight shadowing on his right," Mr. King said. "It looked great."
The trip was attacked by Democrats as an expensive political stunt, but White House officials said that Democrats needed a better issue for taking on the president. A New York Times/CBS News nationwide poll conducted May 9-12 found that the White House may have been right: 59 percent of those polled said it was appropriate, and not an effort to make political gain, for Mr. Bush to dress in a flight suit and announce the end of combat operations on the aircraft carrier.
But even this White House makes mistakes. One of the more notable ones occurred in January, when Mr. Bush delivered a speech about his economic plan at a St. Louis trucking company. Volunteers for the White House covered "Made in China" stamps with white stickers on boxes arrayed on either side of the president. Behind Mr. Bush was a printed backdrop of faux boxes that read "Made in U.S.A.," the message the administration wanted to convey to the television audience.
The White House takes great pride in the backdrops, which are created by Mr. Sforza, and has gone so far as to help design them for universities where Mr. Bush travels to make commencement addresses. Last year, the White House helped design a large banner for Ohio State as part of the background for Mr. Bush; last week, the White House collaborated with the University of South Carolina to make Sforzian backdrops for a presidential commencement speech in the school's new Carolina Center.
"They really are good," said Russ McKinney, the school's director of public affairs, as he listened to the president.
Television camera crews, meanwhile, say they have rarely had such consistently attractive pictures to send back to editing rooms.
"They seem to approach an event site like it's a TV set," said Chris Carlson, an ABC cameraman who covers the White House. "They dress it up really nicely. It looks like a million bucks."
Even for standard-issue White House events, Mr. Bush's image makers watch every angle. Last week, when the president had a joint news conference with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, it was staged in the Grand Foyer of the White House, under grand marble columns, with the Blue Room and a huge cream-colored bouquet of flowers illuminated in the background. (Mr. Sforza and Mr. DeServi could be seen there conferring before the cameras began rolling.) The scene was lush and rich, filled with the beauty of the White House in real time.
"They understand they have to build a set, whether it's an aircraft carrier or the Rose Garden or the South Lawn," Mr. Deaver said. "They understand that putting depth into the picture makes the candidate or president look better."
Or as Mr. Deaver said he learned long ago with Mr. Reagan: "They understand that what's around the head is just as important as the head."

HEADLINE: Senate Adopts A Tax Cut Plan Of $350 Billion 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday May 16 

 BODY:
The Senate Thursday night approved a sweeping tax cut bill that would reduce then suspend taxes on stock dividends before restoring them in 2007, adopting at least for now the central element of President Bush's tax plan.
 Vice President Dick Cheney cast a vote breaking a 50-50 tie on the dividend measure. Several hours later, the bill was approved 51 to 49 when a Democrat who had voted against the dividend aspect, Evan Bayh of Indiana, voted for the overall bill. 
 The bill will now go to a conference with the House, which passed a substantially different tax cut package last week.
Mr. Bush wanted to eliminate the tax on dividends for the full 10-year period covered by the legislation, but the the president praised the bill approved Thursday. 
"Jobs are on the line, and I look forward to working with the full Congress to pass a robust economic growth plan," Mr. Bush said in a statement issued this morning. 
The measure would exclude half of a taxpayer's income from stock dividends from taxation this year and eliminate taxes on dividends altogether for three years, from 2004 through 2006. But to keep the 10-year cost of the bill within the $350 billion limit set by the budget the Senate adopted last month, dividend taxes would be fully reinstated in 2007.
The bill's sponsors expressed confidence that once the taxes were off the books they would never be allowed to reappear.
Democrats ridiculed the temporary suspension, called a sunset, as an irresponsible gimmick. Republicans said it would let Congress revisit the issue after a few years to see if eliminating the tax bite on dividends proves to be as effective in bolstering the stock market as its sponsors hope. 
"It would make the growth package a lot more robust," said the main sponsor, Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma. "It would encourage investment. It would encourage jobs. It would encourage growth."
The dividend vote mostly followed party lines. Only two Democrats, Zell Miller of Georgia and Ben Nelson of Nebraska, voted for the measure. Three Republicans, John McCain of Arizona, Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, were opposed. 
In contrast to the action taken last week by the Senate Finance Committee, the dividend measure moved the Senate closer to Mr. Bush's position. The committee would have excluded from taxation the first $500 of dividends and a small part of the remaining dividends.
The provision suspending the tax on stock dividends means that some dividend cut is almost sure to be in the final package, a major victory for the president. Mr. Bush has said it is unfair to tax corporate profits twice, once when the companies pay their taxes and again when individuals receive their share in dividends.
Democrats offered a substitute that would have paid a tax rebate this year of $300 a person, but it lost on a procedural vote, 54 to 46. The Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said his proposal would have led to more new jobs and been much less costly than the Republican bill.
The bill would repeal the law that let American workers overseas exempt $80,000 of their income from taxation. An effort to delete this provision was rejected, 51 to 49, but senators said there was an understanding it would be knocked out of the bill in the conference committee.
A large share of the tax benefits from the Senate bill would go to the wealthiest taxpayers. Sponsors said this would give new impetus to the economy, since rich people make the investments that lead to new jobs. 
The 10-year cost of the Senate bill is substantially lower than the $726 billion plan Mr. Bush proposed and the $550 billion package adopted by the House last week. But it would still be the third-largest tax cut in history, behind only the reductions in 1981 in the Reagan administration and 2001 in Mr. Bush's first year in office.
The key provision on dividends is completely different from what the House passed, a reduction of the tax rate on dividends and capital gains. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, objected to the Senate measure Thursday, saying, "It doesn't solve the problem."
The conference committee will begin next week to resolve the differences in size and policy.
In the last few weeks, Republicans in Congress have tried not so much to draft a tax bill that might become law as to assemble packages that could win majorities in the House and Senate so the final details could be worked out in the conference.
The Senate bill would reinstate the full tax on dividends after four years and would eliminate after two years a tax break the bill would provide this year for married couples. These sunsets keep the cost of the measure artificially low, since the sponsors expect Congress to re-enact the tax benefits before they expire.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the sunset "a huge yo-yo tax provision, now you see it, now you don't."
"This is absurd," he added. "This is irresponsible tax legislation."
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group that opposes the tax cuts, calculated that if the exclusion of dividends from taxation and the marriage bonus are in effect for the full 10 years, the cost in lost revenue would be $660 billion.
The House bill also holds down the price tag with sunsets of its own. Without them, its cost would be more than $1 trillion over 10 years.
Sunsets have been employed in tax bills before but never so extensively as this year. The willingness of lawmakers to use them may mean that the biggest battles in the conference will be over policy, not size.
The swing votes that passed the dividend proposal came from Mr. Nelson and Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio. Both are former governors who said a decisive factor was the Senate's agreement earlier today to provide $10 billion a year for two years to help state and local governments. Half the money is for Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. The House bill does not have a comparable provision.
"I feel good about this package," said Mr. Voinovich, who declared his position only this morning. "It will give this economy a good jolt."
Another important provision would raise the tax credit for each child to $1,000 from the current $600. Families could expect a $400 check for each child this summer, representing the larger credit.
Thursday, the Senate added a measure raising the Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals in rural areas. To offset the expense, Medicare payments would be cut for equipment like wheelchairs and chemotherapy drugs. Patients would also be charged deductibles and co-payments for laboratory services, both completely covered now.
The Medicare provisions are not in the House bill and could lead to some difficulty in conference.
Like the House bill, the Senate would let small businesses deduct up to $100,000 each year for the next five years to offset expenses on plants and equipment. The current maximum is $25,000.

(Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)(pg. A22) Chart: "Two Approaches on Tax Bills"These are the main areas of difference between the Senate's 10-year, $350 billion tax-cut bill, passed last night, and the $550 billion version passed by the House. The two bills will now be reconciled in a conference committee. STOCK DIVIDENDS HOUSE -- Would lower the maximum tax rate for stock dividends, now taxed at the same rate as earned income, to 15 percent. Taxpayers in the two lowest brackets would owe only 5 percent on dividends. SENATE -- Would reduce tax rates on stock dividends as follows: 50 percent of dividends would be tax free in 2003, all dividends would be tax free in 2004 through 2006, then in 2007, dividends would again be taxable at the same rate as the taxpayer's other income. CAPITAL GAINS HOUSE -- Would lower the maximum tax rate for capital gains to 15 percent. The maximum capital gains rate is now 18 percent on stocks held at least five years, and 20 percent on those held for a shorter period. Taxpayers in the two lowest brackets would owe only 5 percent on capital gains. SENATE -- No provision on capital gains taxes. TAX CUTS FOR INDIVIDUALS HOUSE -- Would lower the top tax rates for middle- and upper-income people to 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2003; increase the tax credit for children, now $600 per child, to $1,000; and expand the 10 percent tax bracket to cover more income. All changes would be effective through 2005. SENATE -- Would keep these changes in effect through 2013. TAX CUTS FOR BUSINESSES HOUSE -- Would temporarily increase, to 50 percent from 30 percent, the percentage of investment expenses larger businesses could write off. Also would extend through 2004 the current law allowing businesses to use current losses to recoup taxes paid in the profitable years of the 1990's. SENATE -- No provisions. HOUSE -- Would increase the amount of expenses on plants and equipment that small businesses could write off immediately to $100,000 from $25,000, expiring in 2007. SENATE -- Includes the same provision. PROVISIONS IN SENATE BILL THAT ARE NOT IN HOUSE BILL AID TO STATES -- Would provide $10 billion a year for two years to state and local governments, half for Medicaid and the rest for other services. Sixty percent of the money not earmarked for Medicaid would go to states and the other 40 percent to local governments. TAX SHELTERS -- Would curtail several tax shelters and other tax breaks, generating about $30 billion in additional revenue for the government over 10 years. FOREIGN INCOME -- Would repeal the law that lets Americans working abroad exempt $80,000 of their income from taxes. MEDICARE -- Would allow higher payments to hospitals and other providers in rural areas. To offset the cost, payments would be reduced for some equipment like wheelchairs and drugs used in chemotherapy, and patients would have to pay more for laboratory services. (pg. A22)

HEADLINE: Target Posts Slow Growth as Spending Lags 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Target Corporation said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose 1.2 percent, the smallest increase in a year and a half. The company predicted disappointing results for this quarter. 
 Net income rose to $349 million, or 38 cents a share, in the quarter ended May 3, from $345 million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales increased 7.6 percent, to $10.3 billion from $9.59 billion. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year fell less than 1 percent, including results at its Marshall Field's and Mervyn's department stores.
Analysts' expectations of 42 cents a share for this quarter are "slightly above" the company's profit forecast, Target officials told investors in a conference call.
Slower consumer spending has hurt Target more than its larger rival Wal-Mart because of a greater reliance on discretionary items, like Swell sheets by Cynthia Rowley and other designer housewares, investors said. Target plans to cut prices on some food items and increase advertising of basic products like napkins to compete with Wal-Mart's larger grocery sections.
"They spent too much time emphasizing the designer items and not enough time in a tough economic environment emphasizing good value," said Martin Bukoll, an analyst at the Northern Trust Corporation. "You need to advertise specific goods at low prices now."
Target said it still expected to meet Wall Street estimates of $2.03 a share in profit for the year.
Shares of Target, which is based in Minneapolis, fell $1.47, or 4.1 percent, to $34.46.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid By Consumers Decline 0.3% 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Lower prices for energy, cars and clothes drove consumer costs down in April by the largest amount in 18 months, underscoring Federal Reserve anxiety about the possibility of a destabilizing decline.
 The Consumer Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, declined by 0.3 percent last month, after rising by 0.3 percent in March, the Labor Department reported today. 
 For the 12 months ended April 30, consumer prices were up a modest 2.2 percent. The performance of core prices, which exclude volatile energy and food costs, was even lower, a gain of just 1.5 percent during the period, the smallest increase since 1966. 
Faced with lackluster customer demand, businesses are keeping a lid on price increases and in some cases are cutting prices to lure shoppers.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues are on guard for any signs of deflation -- a prolonged and widespread decline in prices -- in the economy. Though they say the chances of deflation are remote, Fed policy makers signaled last week that they were prepared to lower short-term interest rates to ward off even the threat of that happening.
Private economists said the Fed's worries over deflation raised the odds of a cut in the federal funds rate, now at a 41-year low of 1.25 percent, at the central bank's next meeting on June 24 and 25.
The drop in the Consumer Price Index came one day after the government reported that wholesale prices fell by a record 1.9 percent in April.
While deflation is dangerous, more normal and contained cases of falling prices can benefit consumers.
High energy prices have put a damper on consumer spending, the main force keeping the economy going.
Economists are hopeful that retreating energy prices will make consumers feel more inclined to buy. That is important because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity in the United States.
In April, as the Iraq war wound down, energy prices fell 4.6 percent, which reversed an increase of the samesize in March. Gasoline prices fell 8.3 percent, fuel oil prices were down 14.9 percent and natural gas prices decreased 3.8 percent. Even with April's decline, energy prices are still up 13 percent over the last 12 months.
A preliminary report showed that the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 93.2 in May from a reading of 86 in April.
One bright spot of the economy, the residential construction market, hit a rough spot in April, another report showed.
The number of new housing projects that builders began work on in April dropped 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.63 million, the Commerce Department said. The decline, which some economists said reflected rainy and cool weather in some parts of the country, came after housing starts rose by a solid 6.6 percent in March.
David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said that with 30-year mortgage rates at record lows and builders now feeling more upbeat about sales prospects, he expected a rebound in residential construction in May.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
Race as a Fiction Invented By the Ruling Classes

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
To make the point that people are all alike under the skin, PBS interviewed not one or two but eight eminent scholars who all agree: under the skin, people are all alike.
 Instead of diversity of opinion, PBS's three-part series "Race: The Power of an Illusion" offers viewers a racially diverse selection of like-minded experts, ranging from Stephen Jay Gould, the white Harvard paleontologist who died last year, to Evelynn Hammonds, a black female professor of History of Science and Afro-American Studies at Harvard. 
 The series has some important things to say about race in America, particularly in explaining how society concocted expedient notions about race that have no backing in genetics or biology -- what Mark Twain described as a "a fiction of law and custom." But its larger message is overpowered by the intellectual timidity of the messenger. 
The series could more aptly be titled "PBS: The Power of Self-Delusion," a study of how a publicly owned television network with a mandate to challenge the mind can instead put even the most caffeinated brains to sleep.
In three hourlong installments the filmmakers painstakingly examine the evolution of race discrimination, from Thomas Jefferson's "Notes on the State of Virginia" to restrictions in the postwar suburban development of Levittown on Long Island.
"Race is a human invention," Ms. Hammonds says. "Race is a concept we invented to categorize the perceived biological, social and cultural differences between human groups."
She and others describe how stereotypes and assumptions still stigmatize nonwhites in American society, yet the filmmakers avoid addressing race relations as they are lived right now.
There is no discussion, let alone lively debate, about the issues confounding our society, from college affirmative-action admissions policies to racial profiling. Instead, it is a history lesson about economic and social injustice that PBS has told well, many times, and with much of the same source material. Like the character played by Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day," PBS keeps reliving the horrors of slavery, segregation and discrimation without advancing to the more politically and culturally sensitive issues of race relations today.
The project isn't helped by its shopworn format: images of scholars, interviewed against the same blue backdrop, are interspersed with clips, old photographs and archival materials. A cello plays mournful music, and the narration by the actress C C H Pounder ("The Shield") is enunciated so slowly and sonorously that it seems addressed to viewers who speak English as a second language.
The notion that race is not biological but merely an artificial construct imposed by the country's ruling classes to justify first slavery and then segregation is not new. It has been articulated by some of the most respected scholars in the country, from K. Anthony Appiah, a professor of philosophy at Princeton, to Alan Goodman, a professor of biological anthropology at Hampshire College, who is one of several dozen experts interviewed on camera. 
The implications of modern genetics are not as easily grasped, and it is understandable that the filmmakers felt they had to set a slow, careful pace when dealing with science. Scientific research showing no significant genetic or biological differences between the races can be counterintuitive: in the film, a black high school student who assumed he would have fewer differences in his DNA with another black student than with a white student, was surprised to learn he was wrong. 
The film also takes up the common assumption that African-American prowess in sports like track or basketball is somehow a result of genetics or biology. (In the film, a young black high school track star says, "I assume a white girl can't beat me in the 200.") 
The documentary suggests where she is in error, but that still complicated issue was explained more thoroughly and persuasively by the science writer Malcolm Gladwell in a 1997 article in The New Yorker, "The Sports Taboo: Why Blacks Are Like Boys and Whites Are Like Girls," a mischievous title that would never find its way past the political correctness of PBS. 
The documentary goes out of its way to avoid conflict. There are some scholars who contest the notion that race is neither genetic nor biological, but they are not interviewed. Instead, the documentary shows a short clip of John Entine, author of "Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It," heatedly expressing his views on CNN's "Talk Back Live," a television format that reduces all guests to the level of hollering crackpots. 
The famous quote of Justice Harry A. Blackmun of the United States Supreme Court is the film's conclusion: "In order to get beyond racism we must first take account of race." Oddly, however, reliably decent PBS does not trust its own viewers' decency enough to take account of an opposing view.

HEADLINE: A Ruling Makes E-Mail Evidence More Accessible 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
UBS Warburg was ordered this week to pay for the search and recovery of e-mail messages requested by a plaintiff, giving aggrieved investors a new legal tool to support their cases against investment banks.
 Shira A. Scheindlin, a judge in the southern district of New York, said that UBS had to dig into its archives and pay for the restoration of a limited batch of e-mail messages sought by a former employee who is suing the firm for sexual discrimination and retaliatory dismissal. 
 Judge Scheindlin's opinion, delivered on Tuesday, is already being referred to by lawyers representing investors and investment banks as a definitive piece of jurisprudence. It suggests that investment banks will have to take responsibility and pay for the recovery of e-mail messages as long as plaintiffs can demonstrate that the evidence sought is relevant to their cases. 
Arbitration lawyers say that Judge Scheindlin's decision will change the economics of arbitration cases involving investors seeking damages from investment banks over fraudulent research.
"The decision is very significant and will help customers get crucial evidence for their cases," said Jacob H. Zamansky, a leading arbitration lawyer. "As long as you can make a showing that the evidence you are asking for is relevant, the banks must bear the cost for searching through the e-mails."
Investment banks have cited the technical challenge and cost involved in retrieving old e-mail traffic as a reason to dismiss arbitration claims, many of which are frivolous, bank and arbitration lawyers agree. (Under industry rules, most customer and employee complaints must be resolved by arbitration, rather than in court.) In the UBS case, lawyers for the bank stated that if the plaintiff, Laura Zubulake, wanted the additional files, which were stored on tape and not readily accessible, she should pay the $175,000 it would cost to retrieve them.
Ms. Zubulake, who has not worked since her dismissal in October 2001, could not afford to pay such a sum, her lawyers say. In her decision, Judge Scheindlin ordered UBS to turn over 5 of the 94 files that were stored on backup tapes and additional e-mail messages on optical disks, which will cost much less than the original request.
"We are pleased that we won this motion, which significantly limited the scope of discovery and prevented an unjustified fishing expedition," a spokesman for UBS Warburg said yesterday.
Much of the opinion's legal punch comes from its author: Judge Scheindlin will be the presiding judge over a seminal class-action suit contending that 55 investment banks and executives at technology companies defrauded investors by artificially inflating the prices of hot initial public offerings.
The outcome of that suit, which could cost investment banks billions of dollars, will depend largely on what kind of e-mail evidence plaintiffs can secure from the banks.
"It's very important for our case," said Melvyn I. Weiss, whose law firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, is leading the suit. "Judge Scheindlin has set the standard. She has made it clear that she will force the defendants to make available all material that otherwise would be difficult to obtain."
In her opinion, which spanned 38 pages and quoted Henry David Thoreau in its introduction, Judge Scheindlin argued that federal standards governing the discovery process are outdated and were written before the flowering of e-mail as the primary means of corporate communication.
She set new standards, which effectively give plaintiffs the right to ask that investment banks provide expanded levels of e-mail traffic that may take a significant effort to retrieve, if the plaintiff proves that the messages are relevant to the case. The investment bank would then be responsible for bearing the cost.
"This will be the law of the land when it comes to arbitrations," said James A. Batson, of Liddle & Robinson, who is representing Ms. Zubulake. "Defendants can no longer hide behind the cost factor." 
More than 7,000 arbitration cases were filed against investment banks last year, most of them involving investors contending that fraudulent research from Wall Street wiped out their investments. Many were dismissed by arbitrators because of the lack of e-mail evidence.
If plaintiffs wanted such evidence, banks argued, they should pay the costs themselves. Given that e-mail recovery operations can be expensive, plaintiffs have often dropped their cases.
The Scheindlin opinion, lawyers say, will be a powerful new weapon in their continuing attempts to extract fresh e-mail evidence from the investment banks.
Analysts estimate that investment banks could have hundreds of millions of dollars of potential exposure to arbitration claims. Banks have become more aggressive in contesting such claims and agreeing to settle fewer of them. One of their most effective defenses has been to hold the line on broad requests for e-mail traffic.
Ms. Zubulake, a former institutional equities saleswoman at UBS Warburg, hopes to use the e-mail messages to support her contention that she was fired in retaliation for filing a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In that claim, she asserted that she had been passed over for promotion because of her gender.
She then filed suit against UBS for gender discrimination and illegal retaliation.
Ms. Zubulake's lawyers at Liddle & Robinson originally made a broad request: they wanted all e-mail traffic concerning Ms. Zubulake and any UBS official, which would have required UBS to delve deep into its e-mail archives for the recovery and restoration of 94 e-mail files.
Such a request is typical in cases between private parties and corporations and is generally seen to be an attempt to pressure the defendant into settling, say lawyers for investment banks that have opposed Liddle & Robinson in other cases. Liddle & Robinson is a leading law firm known for aggressive suits by bankers and brokers against their former employers.
UBS lawyers responded that the bulk of these e-mail messages had been stored on tapes, that they were not relevant to the case and that to restore them would be unduly expensive and time-consuming. Ms. Zubulake's lawyers asked for a more limited trove of e-mail messages and got them.
In ordering UBS to produce only 5 of the 94 files for Ms. Zubulake, Judge Scheindlin also asked that the bank include an affidavit of the cost.
While this decision has thrilled arbitration lawyers, executives at investment banks point out that Judge Scheindlin decreed that UBS provide only a small fraction of the plaintiff's request. And on June 17, Judge Scheindlin will hear arguments to decide whether UBS or Ms. Zubulake would have to pay for the recovery of any more files.

HEADLINE: Big Gamble For Pataki 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 16 

 BODY:
Many legislators were declaring an unmitigated victory today, a day after they moved with striking swiftness to override each of Gov. George E. Pataki's 119 vetoes of the state budget. There was talk of a lame-duck governor, a robust Legislature and a new balance of power in the State Capitol.
 But it may be too soon to write the three-term Republican governor off as a loser. 
 Mr. Pataki and his advisers do not define victory the way lawmakers do. In political terms, he has succeeded in burnishing his credentials as a fiscal conservative within the national party and in laying the groundwork to avoid blame for a budget that may well fall apart and turn into a fiscal debacle.
Indeed, as if to bolster his case, Standard & Poor's today lowered its outlook on New York state bonds, to negative from stable, saying revenues and expenditures do not match up, and giving the governor more ammunition as he rails about the irresponsibility of the State Legislature's $92.8 billion budget.
In the view of most legislators and lobbyists, however, Mr. Pataki's only success was in empowering the Legislature, reversing what has traditionally been a balance of power in favor of the governor and enabling the often-fractious Legislature to prove that, when united, it can accomplish a lot.
"That's what the governor allowed to happen," said Sheldon Silver, speaker of the Democratic-controlled Assembly. "If he planned it, he released something that really hasn't happened previously. I don't think he wanted to do that. I think he believed he would, ultimately, have the control."
"All his friends think he suffered a terrible loss, to my knowledge," Mr. Silver said.
But Mr. Pataki's aides said it is too soon to declare winners and losers. "This is one battle in what will be a sustained war," said one senior aide, who asked not to be identified.
Mr. Pataki's closest aides concede that the outcome was not what the governor had wanted or planned. He never expected his disagreement with the Legislature to lead to the override of his vetoes, labor leaders and others familiar with the budget battle said. He believed that Joseph L. Bruno, leader of the State Senate's Republican majority and a staunch ally, would stand by him, and that Republican legislators would stay in line. He misjudged the pressure on legislators to restore school aid and Medicaid cuts, the lawmakers said.
Once it became clear, however, that he would have to choose between being overridden and breaking his early promise not to raise taxes, he appeared to switch strategies and take steps to turn the situation to his political advantage, say legislators of both parties.
For one, they said, he disengaged from negotiations and accused the members of not producing any creative counterproposals. At one point, he said he did not even need a budget and could run the government on emergency bills, threatening lawmakers at every turn with vetoes. 
While that hurt him in the budget talks, many lawmakers said, it absolved him of responsibility for the final product.
Though he had privately said he might be willing to raise sales taxes and restore some spending cuts, according to lawmakers, Mr. Pataki publicly went on the warpath against the "tax and spend budget" of the Legislature. He labeled it a train wreck and predicted, like some latter-day Cassandra, enormous deficits in the coming years.
He made numerous public appearances to attack the Legislature's budget, projecting confidence, to the final moments of the battle. And even as he faced the cameras Thursday afternoon, less than an hour after the Legislature had rolled over him, he certainly did not appear like a beaten man.
Indeed, he did the political equivalent of spitting in the eyes of legislative leaders. He immediately vetoed a bill they had enacted to aid New York City, saying it would tax city dwellers too much, and again charged they had acted unconstitutionally. The move stole the Legislature's thunder in some New York City tabloid headlines.
In general, the governor departed from his usual low-key approach to behind-the-scenes negotiations and waged a public relations campaign. He tried to paint the Legislature as irresponsible.
The governor controls a large amount of patronage and money for special projects that he could use as leverage over the lawmakers. But aides to Mr. Pataki said he recognized early on that arm-twisting would not work with his Republican colleagues in the Senate, and instead he tried a more gentlemanly campaign of speeches and private conversations about the merits of keeping taxes low. (Some said his allies made a round of threatening calls to both Democratic and Republican Assembly members, however, in the final minutes of the veto-override showdown.)
Meanwhile, he was fighting an onslaught of advertising from various unions and advocates for social services, who spent millions on spots attacking the governor's budget and building support for a tax increase on people in upper income brackets.
In response, the governor went on television more times during this season's budget battle, clamoring for reporters' and the public's attention, than he had in his re-election campaign last fall. 
Still reaching for publicity, he held his vetoes until the final hour on Wednesday night. The next day, as the Legislature voted to reverse his vetoes, he was able to secure more headlines with his veto of the legislative package for city aid, worth $1.8 billion. (Lawmakers in Albany, in both parties, appeared poised to override that veto too, first thing Monday.)
With the battle over, Mr. Pataki seems to be gambling that the budget plan will fall apart and that he will be vindicated in the court of public opinion. Legislative leaders, meanwhile, are gambling that the public will understand that the spending plan Mr. Pataki first proposed was no better and would have created its own deficits.
From a political standpoint, the governor's recent anti-tax headlines might be all he needs. He has reaffirmed his fiscally conservative credentials and linked himself to the same economic philosophy emanating from the Bush White House. 
What may work for him on the national stage may not work in New York, however, his critics say.
"I think that if you're in Wyoming, you like that the governor was fighting what appeared to be an increase in taxes," said David A. Paterson, a Democratic state senator from Harlem. "But you know something, in New York, people used to believe that. Then they got to know him."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: NEW GOVERNMENT; 
IN REVERSAL, PLAN FOR IRAQ SELF-RULE HAS BEEN PUT OFF

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 16 

 BODY:
In an abrupt reversal, the United States and Britain have indefinitely put off their plan to allow Iraqi opposition forces to form a national assembly and an interim government by the end of the month. 
 Instead, top American and British diplomats leading reconstruction efforts here told exile leaders in a meeting tonight that allied officials would remain in charge of Iraq for an indefinite period, said Iraqis who attended the meeting. It was conducted by L. Paul Bremer, the new civilian administrator here. 
 Mr. Bremer, who was accompanied by John Sawers, a British diplomat representing Prime Minister Tony Blair, told the Iraqi political figures that the allies preferred to revert to the concept of creating an "interim authority" -- not a provisional government -- so that Iraqis could assist them by creating a constitution for Iraq, revamping the educational system and devising a plan for future democratic elections. 
"It's quite clear that you cannot transfer all powers onto some interim body, because it will not have the strength or the resources to carry those responsibilities out," The Associated Press quoted Mr. Sawers as saying. "There was agreement that we should aim to have a national conference as soon as we reasonably could do so."
One Iraqi who attended the meeting said Iraqi opposition leaders expressed strong disappointment over the reversal. 
The decision comes at a time when Washington and London have been taking new steps to restore law and order in Iraq, cope with the devastation of civilian institutions and halt the looting and violent crime.
These conditions have emboldened former opposition figures to move rapidly into the political vacuum in Iraq, and former members of Saddam Hussein's government and the Baath Party to blame the allies for fomenting collapse, unemployment and suffering among the population. 
In a step calculated to combat any resurgence of Baath Party influence here, Mr. Bremer today issued an order banning up to 30,000 top-ranking members "from future employment in the public sector."
"By this means, the coalition provisional authority will ensure that representative government in Iraq is not threatened by Baathist elements returning to power and that those in positions of authority in the future are acceptable to the people of Iraq," Mr. Bremer said in a statement.
Today's decision to extend allied control indefinitely over the governing of Iraq was conveyed to Iraqi political figures as the United States and Britain worked assiduously at the United Nations to win broad international consensus for a resolution to lift economic sanctions on Iraq, in order to begin selling oil to finance reconstruction. 
In seeking support, the allies are facing demands for a greater United Nations role in shaping postwar Iraq, including a setting of the terms by which an "interim authority" would make the transition to democratically elected government. 
"They want broader support because they are desperate to get the oil pumping," said an Iraqi who attended the meeting. Mr. Sawers, who is Britain's outgoing ambassador to Egypt, spoke of the need to complete the "tactical" measures of re-establishing legal and social institutions before vesting a government with sovereign control.
The Iraqi who attended the meeting added that the decision also appeared to reflect apprehensions in the Bush administration, and more intensely in London, that the former Iraqi opposition forces are still a disparate group and that the Kurdish leaders as well have yet to coalesce into a ruling body. 
The fear is that a divided or weak interim government will not be able to withstand the intense and at times conflicting ethnic and religious pressures that have tended to divide Iraq instead of cementing it together.
"I don't think they trust this group to function as a political leadership," said the Iraqi political figure who attended. "And for us it is very difficult to participate in something that we have no control over. We don't want to be part of the blame committee when something goes wrong." 
Opposition leaders were "very respectful" to Mr. Bremer and Mr. Sawers, a participant said, "but I think everyone was also pretty forceful about the need to have full sovereignty for the Iraqis." A question they kept posing, he added, was, "Do you want to run this place, or should we?" 
No date was set for creating an interim authority, and no details about its powers and functions were discussed in the meeting, the Iraqis said. Mr. Bremer said he would meet with the opposition leaders for further discussions in two weeks. 
"They retracted what they said before," an Iraqi political figure said. The provisional government idea is gone, he said. As for the idea of convening a national assembly to select a government, he said, "there is no such thing anymore."
Today's decision was a disappointment for the former opposition forces and their supporters in the Pentagon and the Congress, where officials had been pressing for an early turnover of sovereign power to a government formed by the opposition groups. 
On April 28, the United States and Britain sponsored a political gathering of about 300 Iraqis and supported their call for a national conference to meet by the end of May to select a transitional government. Zalmay Khalilzad, who has served as President Bush's envoy to the Iraqi opposition, was a co-chairman of the April meeting, but did not return to Iraq for tonight's meeting. 
On May 5, Jay Garner, the civilian administrator who preceded Mr. Bremer, said the core of a new Iraqi government would emerge this month. "Next week, or by the second weekend in May, you'll see the beginning of a nucleus of a temporary Iraqi government, a government with an Iraqi face on it that is totally dealing with the coalition," General Garner said during a visit to Basra.
At that time, he said he expected such a government to include figures like Ahmad Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress, Ayad Allawi of the Iraqi National Accord, the Kurdish leaders Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. 
Since then, the group of former exiles and their Kurdish allies has expanded their leadership council to include another Sunni Muslim leader and another Shiite Muslim leader. 
The Iraqi figures were also surprised by the reversal since it appeared in recent weeks that Pentagon officials had persuaded the White House that the best course was to turn over power as quickly as possible to opposition forces.
But as the breadth of systemic breakdown in Iraq has become more visible, a counterargument has grown -- that the failure of the opposition to make the transition to a viable government would reflect poorly on the allied victory over Mr. Hussein and add to instability.
General Garner attended tonight's meeting but spoke very little, participants said. He was accompanied by Ryan Crocker, a deputy assistant secretary of state. 
Attending from the Pentagon was Walter Slocombe, who has been given the assignment to examine the growing problem of how to get under control the military forces that each of the main opposition leaders now controls in Iraq. He is said to be working on a plan to meld them into a national security force, a task that would require Kurdish leaders to give up control over their armies.
The opposition leaders were also asked to meet on Tuesday with Lt. Gen. John Abazaid, deputy to Gen. Tommy Franks, the overall American commander in the Middle East and South Asia, to discuss how the opposition groups can contribute to improving security. 
All of the Iraqi figures were pleased with Mr. Bremer's decision on dismantling the Baath Party. Nonetheless, Mr. Bremer reserved the right to himself to make exceptions to the ban in cases where the knowledge and expertise of a former Baath official might be essential to government functions, where the person's prior membership in the party was deemed nonthreatening and where a renunciation of Baath principles had been secured.

 Re "College Graduates Lower Sights in Today's Stagnant Job Market" (front page, May 14): 
 As an '02 grad, I saw my classmates introduced to the disheartening dose of reality known as the American job market a year ago. 
This year is no better. Yet a majority of students still seems to harbor the comforting belief, as one put it, that "it's definitely temporary. Everybody has that feeling -- two or three years, and everything will be back to normal."
This is the kind of ignorant optimism that mires our country in economic (as well as social and political) woes. How bad do things have to get before Americans wake up and take notice? 
I implore the fresh faces in today's job(less) market to learn more about the sorry state of our union -- particularly the disastrous economic policies of the Bush administration -- and then either work to change it, even just through vocal disapproval and diligent voting, or leave for greener pastures, as I have.

 The move, which was announced Thursday, comes less than a month after Wall Street's top brokerage firms agreed to pay a total of $1.4 billion to settle allegations about conflicts of interest between analysts and the companies they follow. 
As an analyst, Mr. Phillips was host to Oracle executives for dinner at his Manhattan home. He has followed makers of so-called enterprise software, used by large businesses and organizations, since 1986. 
For a decade he was extremely bullish on Oracle's stock, even at times when the stock price was falling and Mr. Ellison was under attack from investors for cashing out options for Oracle stock. 
Among the 13 software companies Mr. Phillips covered, Oracle was one of only two that he rated overweight, or buy. The other one was J. D. Edwards & Company.
Mr. Phillips cooled on Oracle for one month, in March 2001, when he cut his rating to neutral after the technology bubble burst. A month later, he raised the rating back up to outperform, or buy. 
While Oracle's stock has fallen from its split-adjusted highs of around $45 in September 2000, it has done better than many of its peers. It is up 32 percent in the last year. 
At Oracle, Mr. Phillips will be responsible for corporate strategy and business development. He will be one of three executives, including Mr. Ellison, in Oracle's office of the chief executive. He will also be on the executive management committee. 
Mr. Phillips joined Morgan Stanley in 1994 and has been named the top enterprise software analyst every year since then by Institutional Investor magazine.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves AIDS Bill, Pleasing White House 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
The Senate voted early this morning to approve President Bush's $15 billion global AIDS initiative, handing the White House a legislative trophy that Mr. Bush can carry with him next month when he joins world leaders at an economic meeting of eight major industrial nations in Evian, France.
 At a time when nearly 10,000 people in Africa are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, every day, the bill authorizes the government to triple its spending on global AIDS, to $15 billion over five years. It makes good on a promise Mr. Bush made in January in his State of the Union address. 
 The White House had been pressing Senate leaders to adopt the bill, which is similar to one that passed overwhelmingly in the House. The measure gives Mr. Bush an opportunity to demonstrate to other nations, especially France -- where relations with the United States were seriously strained by the war in Iraq -- that America is committed to exercising moral as well as military might.
Mr. Bush told reporters today that he was "so pleased" the Senate had adopted the bill. "I'll be able to sign it and take it to Europe with me," he said, "as a symbol of the great depth of compassion that our country holds for those who suffer." 
The measure was approved by voice vote shortly after 2 a.m. after a marathon session ordered by Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader. Dr. Frist urged his colleagues to approve the House version intact.
Instead, the Senate made a slight change, a nonbinding provision encouraging the Bush administration to negotiate additional debt relief for AIDS-stricken African countries. House Republican leaders said they expected to adopt the Senate version early next week.
"We have given the president the leverage he needs to call upon the world's wealthiest nations to join our commitment to address this crisis," Dr. Frist said after the vote. 
The bill is intended to curb the AIDS epidemic in 12 African nations and two in the Caribbean. It will authorize enough money, proponents said, to prevent 7 million new infections, provide antiretroviral drugs for 2 million people infected with H.I.V. and care for 10 million patients as well as children orphaned by the disease.
Advocates for people with AIDS offered a mixed reaction to the vote. Some said the bill was not generous enough; others objected to its fine print, including a provision, inserted by House conservatives, that requires a third of the money for prevention to go to programs that promote abstinence until marriage.
"The president will get to pat himself on the back for this bill at the G-8 summit in two weeks in Evian," said Sharonann Lynch, an official of Health GAP, a nonprofit advocacy group. "But good P.R. won't win a war on global AIDS."
The Global AIDS Alliance, another nonprofit group, described the measure as "a cruel joke."
Still, Bono, the Irish rock star who has traveled the world to promote more spending on global AIDS, called it a "historic bill."
The measure does not actually provide money for the initiative; that will be left to House and Senate appropriators. Senate Democrats complained today that Mr. Bush's budget for 2004 includes only slightly more than half the $3 billion promised in the Senate bill. "The real test of America's resolve," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, "is whether we fund this promise."
In a series of votes, mostly along party lines, Republicans beat back efforts by Democrats to alter the bill. The exception was the provision on debt relief, which was adopted by voice vote.
The defeated amendments included one to strike the abstinence-only provision, and another, offered by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, that would have authorized more money for a new global fund to fight AIDS. Mr. Durbin accused Dr. Frist of rushing into the vote without adequate debate.
"This is too important an issue, and it really should be bipartisan," Mr. Durbin said before the vote. "It shouldn't be an issue where they're trying to stare down anyone who wants to change the House bill."
The measure authorizes the United States to donate as much as $1 billion next year to the global fund, but caps American contributions at a third of what international donors provide. Mr. Bush has said he intends to use the bill to press other countries to donate more.
In recent weeks, Mr. Bush met with senators involved in the AIDS bill negotiations. Among them were Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the committee's senior Democrat. 
"He wants money from the G-8, he wants commitments, he wants somebody besides the United States in the ballgame," Mr. Lugar said, explaining why he took his name off the amendment for debt relief, which Mr. Biden favored. "I have told him that I will support him."
Despite the disagreement over the details, some senators, including Dr. Frist, said the vote was one they could feel good about.
During the debate late on Thursday night, Dr. Frist spoke of the destruction caused by AIDS, saying, "As history looks back at this day or this year on senators in this body, will we be able to say that we did everything possible to reverse the course of that destruction? I think at the end of this day, we will say yes."

HEADLINE: Candidate Bush Files Papers for '04 Race 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
President Bush declared himself a candidate for re-election today, filingpapers that allow him to begin raising money and put a campaign staff in place for a race that his advisers say will hinge on whether he can revive the economy and protect the nation from terrorism.
 After months in which it said Mr. Bush was ignoring electoral politics to focus on the war with Iraq and pushing his tax cut through Congress, the White House pulled back the curtain today on a campaign operation that plans to send out one million fund-raising letters in the next few days, has a Web site up and running and has assembled a group of top officials ready to start work. 
 Although the core of Mr. Bush's strategy is to remain an above-the-fray leader, his aides and political advisers said he planned to move quickly to collect millions of dollars to wage his campaign, beginning with a fund-raiser next month. Republican fund-raisers said the campaign was drawing up a heavy schedule of appearances this year for Vice President Dick Cheney, who confirmed last week that he would be on the ticket again. 
But in what could be a move to tamp down expectations, officials disputed widespread reports that they intended to raise $200 million or more to pay for advertising and other activities through the Republican convention in New York late next summer. They said their announced goal would be closer to the record $100 million the Bush campaign raised for the 2000 election.
Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's longtime strategist and the architect of the re-election plan, will remain on the White House payroll, administration officials said. Mr. Bush named Ken Mehlman, the White House political director, as his campaign manager. Mr. Mehlman will run the campaign from an office in Northern Virginia.
The campaign's finance chairman, overseeing fund-raising, will be Mercer Reynolds, a friend of Mr. Bush who is a former ambassador to Switzerland. Jack Oliver, the deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, will run the campaign's fund-raising operation day to day as deputy chairman for finance. 
Republicans said Marc Racicot, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, would probably leave the committee to take the post of campaign chairman. The leading candidate to replace Mr. Racicot is Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist, though Mr. Gillespie may be named instead to run the convention in New York next year, people with ties to the White House said.
White House officials said Mr. Bush made the decision to set up the campaign, officially Bush-Cheney '04 Inc., in a meeting on May 8. He approved the personnel appointments over the weekend and this morning signed the forms required by the Federal Election Commission.
The White House said Mr. Bush would forgo federal matching funds during the primary campaign. By doing so, Republican strategists said, Mr. Bush will free himself from any spending limits and be able to bank a huge war chest that he can use in the months next spring and summer between the end of the primaries and the party conventions, when the Democratic nominee is likely to be broke. 
In comments to reporters this afternoon as he left the White House for a weekend at Camp David, Mr. Bush made it clear that he would resist being cast as a candidate, insisting that his mind was on creating jobs and keeping the American people safe.
"The American people will decide whether or not I deserve a second term," he said. 
His focus, he said, is "helping people find work" and "dealing with countries from around the world to make sure that they know that the war on terror continues."
Mr. Bush begins the race at a time when his standing in the polls is formidable and the Democratic field is fractured and little known by voters. But he must also deal with an economy that has lost more than two million jobs since he took office, a rapidly rising budget deficit, a depressed stock market, 41 million people without health insurance and an aging population that is increasingly concerned about the long-term viability of Social Security and Medicare.
"The Democrats are clinging to the one piece of flotation they have, and that's the economy and the associated issue of health care," said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University.
Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he was surprised that Mr. Bush had gone through the formalities of setting up a re-election campaign "since all this man does is campaign every day" through a slick White House operation that juxtaposes his role as commander in chief with his domestic agenda.
"This election will be about jobs and who the American public thinks will do a better job of creating jobs," Mr. McAuliffe said. "The American public is sick and tired of him trying to use patriotism to push through an ultra-right-wing agenda."
Although Mr. Bush's re-election effort is primarily about keeping him in power, Republican strategists said Mr. Rove was hopeful that it could further a broader goal: tipping a nation that has been almost evenly balanced between the parties more clearly and lastingly to the Republican side.
They said the White House was intent not just on winning a convincing victory for Mr. Bush, but also on expanding the thin Republican majorities in the House and the Senate to reduce the need to compromise on nearly every issue. In pursuit of this goal, they said, the White House has been unusually involved in recruiting candidates for House and Senate races, reinvigorating state party organizations and encouraging interest groups to back the administration's agenda.
White House officials, they said, hope to keep up a strategy of dividing Democrats on critical issues like tax cuts, leaving the party prone to infighting and without a coherent message.
Mr. Bush and his political team have also worked hard to court elements of traditionally Democratic electoral blocs, including labor unions and Hispanic voters, without alienating their base of white conservatives in the South and West.
Republican strategists and administration officials said the White House's emphasis in the next few months would be on winning as many legislative victories as possible to establish a record of accomplishment they can carry into 2004. 
They said Mr. Bush would push hard to resolve differences between House and Senate Republicans over the tax bill as quickly as possible so he can claim credit for having given the economy a lift. They said he would also like to push a bill providing prescription drug coverage to retirees through Congress this summer to neutralize Democratic efforts to attack him on health care.

HEADLINE: Job Security a Thing of the Past for City Workers 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
For Winifred Gourdine, 2003 at least started out as a good year. 
 A promotion she had spent 12 years working toward as an addiction counselor for prisoners had recently come through, bringing with it the promise of $46,000 a year, money enough to help her care for a teenage nephew. 
 But Ms. Gourdine's good fortune ended yesterday as she and about 2,000 other municipal workers were ushered into the unemployment line, casualties of the city's fiscal crisis and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's effort to pare the city's largest expense, its payroll. 
Hundreds more city workers who have also received pink slips will work their last days over the next several weeks. The mayor signaled yesterday that still more employees could be laid off if the State Legislature does not override Gov. George E. Pataki's veto of a $1.8 billion revenue package.
"If they were not to override the veto on Monday," Mr. Bloomberg said during his weekly radio show on WABC-AM, "we'd start the process to send out cuts, the next $1 billion contingency plan. We'd lay off 10,000 workers. It would devastate the city."
For Ms. Gourdine, one of 57 employees laid off from the Rikers Island drug intervention program, the devastation has already begun.
"I always thought when my time was right, I would get my promotion and my raise," said Ms. Gourdine, 47, of the Bronx. "But this is terrible. My father was a civil servant, a bus driver. I come from an era that believed when you get into city government you're secure. You don't have to ever worry when you work for the city."
Now, with no job, no college degree and limited savings, Ms. Gourdine says her worries are endless. There is the cost of maintaining the single-family home she shares with her mother and her 14-year-old nephew. 
"It's like everything came at one time," she said. "I'm already one of the homeowners with the 18.5 percent tax increase. Now the water is going up. There is no break. There is an increase for this, increase for that. There is no affordable anything in New York right now."
As she milled about the Manhattan offices of the Social Service Employees Union, which represents 385 of those who worked their last day yesterday, Ms. Gourdine said she was certain of only one thing: "The mayor is trying to push working people out of this city." 
With yesterday's layoffs, the prison drug intervention program is all but shut down, with just a skeletal staff remaining. 
Ronald B. Moore, a colleague of Ms. Gourdine's who was also laid off from the program, said he was as worried about the inmates who depended on it as he was about himself.
"We were making a difference," Mr. Moore, 44, said of the program, which provided 600 beds for drug treatment 24 hours a day, year-round. "These are things that correlate into savings for the taxpayer and the city when we can give some knowledge to young people that interaction with drugs is not a good thing." 
He said being angry at Mr. Bloomberg or the union would be a waste. "I can't fault them," he said. "My beef is with the people I worked with every day. They didn't do anything to present something to keep us around."
For now, Mr. Moore said, he continues to hope that a miracle will restore his job. 
The cost of living in New York City without a job, even with a college degree, is too discouraging to think about, he said. His monthly payments include $1,800 for a two-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights and $565 for his car loan. 
"I've got to move to a smaller place, leave my neighborhood and my people," he said. "I've got to do all of this because somebody didn't want my program. It's sad."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: DIPLOMACY; 
Germany Pursues U.N. Accord to End Sanctions on Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 16 

 BODY:
Moving away from Germany's near-total opposition to American policy on Iraq, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said today that he wanted to reach an agreement on the Security Council resolution being pressed by Britain and the United States.
 The resolution would lift economic sanctions on Iraq and give the United States and Britain broad authority to administer the country in the aftermath of the war. 
 After meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell here this morning, Mr. Schroder said in a statement, "Together we established that it makes sense to come together in New York at the United Nations headquarters and, if possible, to develop a unanimous position." 
Mr. Schroder explicitly agreed for the first time with the central American demand that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1990 be lifted.
With relations between Germany and the United States virtually frozen since well before the beginning of the Iraq war, Mr. Schroder's conciliatory statements were in sharp contrast to the diplomatic jousting over the American-led campaign, which Germany adamantly opposed. Mr. Schroder's statements seemed clearly intended to repair ties between two important allies.
Relations between Mr. Schroder and President Bush have been particularly frosty for months, and the countries have exchanged insults that would long have been unthinkable. 
There are still tens of thousands of American troops based in Germany, a country that was pivotal to America's European alliances for decades.
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who met separately with Mr. Powell today, said afterward: "The U.S. draft resolution is a good basis for our discussions and the talks today also showed that we are well on the way to an agreement. I am very optimistic."
Mr. Powell said, "It should be possible to come to closure quickly over the next several days, a week, on a U.N. resolution."
The Germans, who hold a nonpermanent seat on the Security Council, stopped short of announcing outright support of the resolution, with Mr. Fischer indicating that there was still more negotiating to be done, not only with the United States but with other Security Council members.
"We are of the opinion that the sanctions that were imposed in the past no longer have any meaning and that they should be lifted as soon as possible," Mr. Schroder said.
"I was pleased at the chancellor's commitment to lift sanctions entirely," said Mr. Powell, standing on the lawn behind the gleaming, modern German presidential office, with Mr. Schroder at a lectern beside him.
The changed mood seemed to mark some success for Mr. Powell, whose one-day visit to Germany came at the end of a weeklong foreign tour that also included the Middle East and Russia, during which he sought to garner support for the British-American Security Council draft.
Europeanmembers of the Security Council, including Germany, France and Russia, want the United Nations to play a central role in Iraq, while France and Russia have called for United Nations weapons inspectors to return to Iraq before the sanctions are formally lifted, something that the United States opposes.
In an effort to win broader approval of the resolution, Britain and the United States have submitted a revised draft that gives a somewhat greater role to a United Nations envoy to Iraq, but the resolution still gives the members of the coalition that joined the war there decisive power to administer the country and control its resources while a new Iraqi government is created.
"We believe the United Nations must play a vital role," Mr. Powell said in a German television interview broadcast today. But, he continued, "There is probably still continuing discussion as to how large a role it should play." 
Mr. Powell arrived here from Russia, where he failed in talks with President Vladimir V. Putin and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov to reach agreement either on ending sanctions or on the wording of a Security Council resolution. Today, Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri V. Fedotov said Russia and China, both permanent Security Council members, wanted further "serious amendments" to the British-American draft.
But while Mr. Powell acknowledged in Moscow that there were still "outstanding issues" between Russia and the United States, the mood following his talks in Germany seemed warm and friendly, particularly in contrast with the recent past.
Mr. Powell and Mr. Fischer seemed to go out of their way to announce their close personal friendship, with Mr. Powell referring to Mr. Fischer by his first name, saying, "Joschka and I are always able to speak our hearts and minds to one another."
Mr. Powell also notably reiterated a point that had been a refrain among German leaders during the months of nearly frozen relations but had rarely, if ever, uttered by Bush administration officials: that friends can disagree with each other, even sharply, and still remain friends.
"We also know what draws us together -- shared values, sacrifices together and working in many parts of the world together now, whether it's the Balkans, in Afghanistan or elsewhere," Mr. Powell said.
Despite the expressions of optimism, neither side was prepared to say they were in full agreement yet on the terms for the lifting of sanctions or on the resolution. Germany, while clearly eager to mend its ties with the United States, entered into an informal alliance with France and Russia in opposition to the Iraq war, and the government here seems eager for those countries to agree on a postwar formula for Iraq.
Mr. Schroder has apologized in recent weeks for what he called "exaggerated remarks" made during his successful election campaign last fall in which his opposition to military action in Iraq both won him a second term as chancellor and deeply angered the United States. 
At a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin last week, Mr. Schroder spoke of the "truly vital friendship" between the United States and Germany, but he also said he rejected the idea that Germany would have to choose between the United States and its partners in the European Union.
Throughout the months of openly hostile relations, German officials said they wanted to find ways to heal the rift. 
"The last several months have been very, very difficult," Mr. Powell said in an interview with German television, but he added that the two countries needed to move on.

HEADLINE: The Art in Budget Cutting 

 BODY:
The depth of the city's fiscal crisis, with its $3.8 billion hole, means nothing is untouchable, no cuts unthinkable. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has tried to do the right thing by protecting the fundamentals: education, health, safety and sanitation. But even these are vulnerable. Among the thousands laid off over the next few months will be hundreds of teachers' aides and dozens of fire marshals. Nearly half of the city-supported children's health clinics will close. There will be fewer police officers enforcing quality-of-life laws. Trash collections in the outer boroughs will become less frequent, just in time for the hottest days of the year. 
 This is a three-hankie budget, with something to make almost everyone cry. In such a bleak picture, there is little justification for keeping firehouses open just because they have been community fixtures. And, sad to say, the city does not really need to keep open small zoos in Brooklyn and Queens, much as some residents love them. 
 But the mayor may want to take a second look at proposed cuts in some useful and cost-efficient social programs, like funds to help keep low-income families together instead of sending children into foster care, which costs a lot more. The proposed cuts in the budgets of the parks, libraries and cultural institutions that help make New York the place it is may also merit review. The cuts would eliminate many workers who keep up park grounds and restrooms, threatening a return to the bad old days when green spaces were dirty and dangerous. The 34 members of the Cultural Institutions Group, which includes some of the city's largest and most visited sites -- like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Botanical Garden and the Brooklyn Academy of Music -- will lose $25 million in operating funds. That translates into layoffs, canceled programs and lost revenue.
Mr. Bloomberg suggests that cultural institutions compensate by passing the hat. To his great credit, the mayor puts his own money where his mouth is -- he is a major private contributor to the arts. But fund-raisers say that finding well-heeled contributors and foundations to fill the void is becoming harder and harder. Even with an ambitious fund-raising drive, the New York Public Library, which is mostly privately financed, foresees reduced hours and book purchases if it loses a projected $7.3 million in city aid on top of the $16 million cut last year.
Because these institutions draw not only New Yorkers but also millions of tourists, the cuts could have enormous impact on neighborhoods where they are the chief employers. The amount of city support is a tiny slice of the municipal budget, and the size of the projected cuts for cultural institutions is proportionately much larger than the cuts for other programs. The mayor and the City Council, as they continue working on the final spending package, need to trim very carefully in this area and ask themselves when the money saved is outweighed by potential economic losses.

HEADLINE: Talks in Congress Dim Hopes for Speedy Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
President Bush is determined to get a tax bill enacted quickly that eliminates taxes on stock dividends, even if only briefly, administration officials said today.
 But the view in Congress is that negotiations between the House and Senate on tax legislation could take weeks, and there is little enthusiasm in many quarters for a temporary tax suspension. 
 Just before midnight on Thursday, the Senate voted, 51 to 49, to approve its version of the tax legislation. The central element, adopted when Vice President Dick Cheney cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie, would reduce taxes on dividends for one year, abolish them entirely for three years and reinstate them in 2007. 
Last week, the House approved a substantially different tax bill, which would reduce the tax rate on dividends and capital gains to 15 percent. The 10-year revenue loss from the House bill was calculated at $550 billion, compared with $350 billion for the Senate bill.
Administration officials said today that the president much preferred the Senate bill, was not concerned about charges that the off-again, on-again tax was a gimmick and was most interested in proclaiming victory and moving on.
Once the tax on dividends is off the books, these officials said, Democrats will not have the political stomach to restore it.
As he boarded his helicopter to spend the weekend at his retreat at Camp David, Md., President Bush told reporters: "I'm optimistic about our economy and its future. I'm even more optimistic now that the Senate has acted."
The administration's next goal, the officials said, is to move on to Medicare legislation, a step that cannot happen in earnest until the tax issue is resolved. 
Moreover, they said, delay in enacting a tax cut will limit its effect on an economy that is flagging now.
One aspect of the legislation passed by the House and the Senate that has received relatively little attention and that could help the economy at once, one official said, is a $400 per child tax rebate that will be paid to nearly all taxpaying families within weeks of the time the bill becomes law.
What the president does not want, the officials said, is a protracted fight over taxes among Republicans in Congress, but that is what may happen.
Republican officials on Capitol Hill said House leaders might wait a week or two before appointing members to the House-Senate conference committee on the legislation in the hope that the additional time -- and increased pressure from President Bush -- would persuade the Senate to increase the size of the tax cut.
Senators tend to advertise their independence and play down the influence the president has on their votes. But on the tax bill, three crucial votes came from senators -- George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, and Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Evan Bayh of Indiana, both Democrats -- whose states the president had visited to promote his tax plan while the Senate was considering it. 
The ability of senators to negotiate in the conference committee is restricted by the promise made by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, that he would not bring a bill to the floor of the Senate that showed a revenue loss of more than $350 billion over 10 years. Mr. Grassley, who would be chairman of a conference committee, made the pledge in order to get a budget passed by the Senate last month.
House leaders were furious when Mr. Grassley did this without warning them. Now some are considering a strategy to avoid a conference and bypass Mr. Grassley. 
Under this plan, Senate and House leaders would determine next week the elements of a bill that would please the House and still get enough votes to pass the Senate. On Friday, the House would take up the bill passed by the Senate, rewrite it to meet House specifications and pass it, and then leave for a 10-day recess, challenging the Senate to pass it too or thwart the president's desire to have a bill through Congress by Memorial Day.
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader, has told Republicans to be prepared to work late on Friday.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, who is often less confrontational than Mr. DeLay, seemed uncomfortable with this approach. "A formal conference is how we usually do things," Mr. Hastert said. "It would have to be an extraordinary situation if we did not do that."
In addition, Mr. Grassley is proud of his reputation for being straight-forward and is unlikely to relent without a fight. "I keep my word," he said Thursday night.
House leaders are cool to the Senate's approach of suspending taxes on dividends and then reinstating them, a procedure known as a sunset. "The general view," one top staff member said, "is that it is gimmicky and not very good economic policy. You want a policy that changes people's long-term behavior, knowing this is the way the law is going to be."
In moving the tax bill through the Senate in two days of marathon sessions, Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, pleased the White House, and he annoyed Democrats by refusing to bring up a bill that would increase the nation's debt limit by nearly $1 trillion. Democrats had hoped that a debate over the debt limit this week would highlight the effect of tax cuts on the record budget deficits, but Dr. Frist decided to postpone the matter until next week, putting some distance between the issues.
The postponement, however, strained the Treasury Department's ability to manage the debt. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said the debt had come so close to the limit of $6.4 trillion that the department had to postpone next week's routine sale of short-term securities.
"Things are rather urgent now," said the spokeswoman, Betsy Holahan. But Ms. Holahan said that if the Senate raised the debt limit next week, there would be no danger of default. The House has already voted to raise the limit by $984 billion, the largest increase ever.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: WAR CRIMES; 
Mass Grave in Iraq May Hold Kuwaitis Missing Since 1991

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: HABBANIYA, Iraq, May 16 

 BODY:
A map provided by a former driver for Iraqi military intelligence brought Abdulaziz al-Qubaisi Abu Musab to the abandoned Iraqi military camp here this morning in search of the answer to the question that most Kuwaitis have asked -- and dreaded -- since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf war: where are the nearly 600 missing Kuwaitis?
 Mr. Abu Musab, a member of the Iraqi National Congress, the political movement headed by Ahmad Chalabi, said he had been given the map by a man who, in October 1991, was among the drivers who took the Kuwaiti prisoners to their execution in Baghdad and subsequent burial here, 50 miles west of the capital. 
 It was impossible to speak directly to this driver, who calls himself Samir and still fears for his life, or to say today how accurate his account of the execution is. But the map he gave Mr. Abu Musab proved very accurate. 
For the past 12 years, Kuwait has demanded to know the fate of nearly 600 prisoners taken by Saddam Hussein's security forces after the country was invaded by Iraq in 1990. It has offered $1 million for information. Mr. Abu Musab said attempts to mobilize Kuwaiti or United States military help to open the suspected mass grave here had drawn no response for days.
So, today, he put a tractor and backhoe on a trailer and drove west from Baghdad past American checkpoints and burned-out Iraqi tanks to this gentle slope of desert facing the crystalline Lake Habbaniya shimmering in the early summer heat.
He straddled the mechanical claw and began digging. He had to go deep, 10 feet down, past a viper that he disturbed and then killed, through gravel and sand, because that is where Samir said the bodies were heaped in three places marked on the carefully drawn map.
Then, just where Samir's map said they were, he found the first 40 decomposed bodies that, according to the driver's account, are the first installment of nearly 600 Kuwaiti corpses.
If forensic examinations confirm Samir's account, the mass grave here would answer one of the most painful and enduring mysteries for Kuwait, the tiny American ally that fought invasion and occupation in 1990-91 and, 12 years later, turned over much of its country to United States-led forces that drove Mr. Hussein from power last month.
The bodies lay in bundles, the same jumble of bones, decay and bits of fabric that the earth is yielding all over Iraq.
Some skulls betrayed execution wounds. Green plastic ties that can be used as handcuffs were scattered among the remains. A finger bone was all that lay within the coil of one. A random shoe separated from its owner still held a constellation of foot bones that had collapsed to one flat dimension without the flesh that once gave them shape. 
"They killed them in Baghdad and brought the bodies here," Mr. Abu Musab said. 
In pre-empting allied forces and the forensic specialists whose task it will be to document the mass graves that are being unearthed throughout Iraq, Mr. Chalabi's group appeared to be trying to elevate the priority that American officials have assigned to the investigation of the killings by Saddam Hussein's security forces. 
Mr. Chalabi, by taking matters into his own hands in a period of political transition here, appeared to be pushing himself forward on an issue that has the potential to galvanize the Iraqi people by calling attention to the mass killings.
The ambition of Mr. Chalabi to play a central role in the governance of postwar Iraq is well known, and he has strong allies in the Pentagon. But many Iraqis are hostile to him.
"This grim discovery, together with the mass grave sites being found across the country in cities like Hilla, reveal to the world the scope of the brutality of Saddam's regime and his crimes against humanity," Mr. Chalabi said. "The world must act now to assist the Iraqi people with proper forensic experts and documentation specialists, so that the full extent of Saddam's crimes can be uncovered."
In a pointed criticism of Arab leaders, one he has already made, he added, "Those who supported this regime are now witnessing the monster that they enabled."
Mr. Abu Musab gave this account of what Samir told him in a meeting in Baghdad three or four days ago:
The killing began one morning in October 1991 at 8:30. The frightened Kuwaitis -- blindfolded, with hands bound by lime-green plastic ties -- were ordered into horseshoe formations at the training school for the intelligence service in Baghdad. The prisoners had been brought there that morning in vans and buses.
A single intelligence man carrying a machine gun positioned himself inside the horseshoe. The prisoners wept and cried out the Muslim prayer before death: there is no god but God.
The gunfire began. The shooter pivoted, according to the account provided to Mr. Abu Musab, using the horseshoe formation to make the executions quicker. 
Formation after formation was brought forward until all were dead. All were men, save one.
In Samir's account, he and three other drivers then loaded the bodies onto Mercedes trucks and drove them to this base, where one 10-foot-deep pit already was cut into the sand. Two other pits were dug to hold the remaining bodies near a large sand berm, a water tower and a fence. 
When the work was done, Samir and theother drivers and 15 men who had helped with the burial were forced to live here for three months as the desert removed all traces of their grisly dig. 
Before they were allowed to leave, they were warned that if they ever talked, Iraqi intelligence would find them and kill them.
Today, Samir is just another unemployed Iraqi who does not want to advertise his old profession, but he has heard about Kuwait's offer of a $1 million reward for information leading to the recovery of its missing. 
"But he is still scared that someone in intelligence will take revenge because the people who participated in this act are still around," Mr. Abu Musab said.

HEADLINE: City Lays Off 2,000 as Talks Grow Bitter 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration appeared to toughen its stance toward the municipal unions yesterday, ratcheting up the harshness of its criticisms and carrying out layoffs that the unions said should have been delayed while negotiations continued. 
 The unions accused the city's chief labor negotiator of walking out of last-minute negotiations aimed at stopping the first major round of municipal layoffs since the Dinkins administration. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had suggested that he might suspend the layoffs if the unions agreed to $600 million in labor savings. But City Hall officials, using tough language, dismissed the unions' money-saving proposals as paltry. 
"The mayor has given them chance after chance to help save these jobs, and they are the ones who have so unfortunately refused to help, and so a few thousand workers will end their employment with New York City today," said William Cunningham, communications director for Mayor Bloomberg.
The standoff is one of the most bitter between City Hall and labor leaders in decades, and raises questions about whether the two groups can come together on productivity savings and other contract issues at a time of dire fiscal crisis.
After yesterday's bargaining session ended, the administration's top negotiator, the city labor commissioner, James F. Hanley, announced that the layoffs threatened by Mayor Bloomberg would take effect, making yesterday the last day of work for more than 2,000 city workers. They represented the first major layoffs by the city since 1992, when David N. Dinkins was mayor.
"They asked us to stop the clock on layoffs, and we said we weren't going to do it," Mr. Hanley said after leaving the bargaining session. "We said there was nothing further to talk about."
The failure of yesterday's negotiations represented the most definitive rupture between the unions and Mr. Bloomberg, who has looked to the unions to play a major role in helping the city close its $3.8 billion budget gap and ease future budget pressures. 
Among the money-saving proposals the unions made to City Hall this week was for union volunteers to use the unions' political phone banks to make calls to help collect more than $1 billion in uncollected taxes and fines. The unions also fleshed out their proposals on how to save the city $100 million annually through the workers' health plans, including, one city official said, increased employee co-payments. In addition, the unions said they would be willing to lend the city $200 million from their health-care funds at low interest rates.
Like other union leaders, Randi Weingarten, chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee and president of the teachers' union, voiced anger about the layoffs and the failure of the talks, held at the headquarters of District Council 37. 
"We did everything, despite the name calling," she said. "I was shocked that they would walk out."
But Mr. Hanley said the unions' proposals were hardly worth discussing. "It's been a year since we've been at this, and the unions have not proposed meaningful, quantifiable, recurring savings," he said, asserting that many of their proposals were one-shot revenue sources, which Mr. Bloomberg rejects.
The city sent out 3,000 pink slips two weeks ago, and Mr. Hanley said about 2,000 people would stop working effective yesterday, with several hundred more losing jobs over the next few weeks. The layoffs affect many groups, including sanitation workers and caseworkers in the Administration for Children's Services. 
"I'm angry at Bloomberg and the union for what they're doing to us," said James Wilson, who lost his $28,000-a-year job at a homeless shelter in Jamaica after working there for 12 years. "The union should have given back something. I don't know what they did. It's all confusing. I don't know how to accept this. I just pray something opens up and they call me back."
Mr. Hanley said that in June, 2,000 workers in the department of education would be laid off.
Ms. Weingarten, the chief negotiator for some 300,000 municipal workers, is caught between the city's demands for substantial sacrifices, like adopting a longer work week and reducing vacation and sick days, and the demands from the uniformed unions not to grant substantial concessions. Several union leaders have said that, if they had to choose, they would prefer seeing layoffs to agreeing to concessions that could take years for the unions to win back. 
Ms. Weingarten seems increasingly trapped between her roles as leader of the larger group of municipal employees and as head of the teachers' union, as teachers are largely immune from the threat of layoffs. Many people on both sides of the table note that teachers and perhaps members of the city's largest union, District Council 37, might be willing to entertain some of the mayor's ideas for savings, but that leaders of the uniformed service unions are completely intransigent. 
Peter Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, said the unions should not give "one penny" to help the city. Several union officials said the presidents of several uniformed unions have taken Ms. Weingarten to task in private Municipal Labor Committee meetings when she suggested meeting Mr. Bloomberg halfway.
Ms. Weingarten said it was quite an accomplishment to persuade all the unions to propose $100 million in health savings, which would come to $330 per union member per year. She said the $600 million in savings sought by the mayor would cost union members $2,000 each.
"The mayor is asking unionized workers to pay twice," she said. "The unionized work force is paying the new taxes, new fare increase, the new tuition hikes. Why should they, as opposed to everybody else, pay twice?"
Ms. Weingarten said Mayor Bloomberg appeared determined to lay off workers because he rejected the unions' proposal to have City Comptroller William Thompson, State Comptroller Alan Hevesi and an official to be named by the mayor examine the validity and value of the union's proposals. 
The union leaders insist their proposals are worth $600 million, while the Bloomberg administration says they contain just $20 million in specific savings.
"The real issue today was whether we're on the right track to stop the clock on layoffs until we exhaust this process," Ms. Weingarten said.
Arthur Cheliotes, president of Communications Workers 1180, which represents 8,000 supervisors and middle managers, asserted that the mayor's strategy was to take back labor's hard-won gains. 
"I think long-term he's looking to use this fiscal crisis to really undermine our health benefits and pensions," he said. 
City officials insist that Mr. Hanley did not walk out of yesterday's session, and that he would like to continue a dialogue with the unions.
"The mayor remains interested in any proposals by labor to increase productivity and create real and recurring savings, none of which we have seen to date," said Ed Skyler, a City Hall spokesman. "Substantial fiscal challenges still lie ahead, and labor can still help shoulder the burden and protect our work force."

HEADLINE: Tax Cut Plan: A Boon for Whom? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Senate Adopts a Tax Cut Plan of $350 Billion" (front page, May 16): 
 While President Bush muscles his way to a big tax cut, our economy slogs along at a pathetic pace. 
 One wonders if the Bush administration likes to have a high percentage of the work force unemployed. Unemployment helps employers to hold wages down.
Meanwhile, the thrifty who depend on interest income have less spending power. That further depresses the economy.
Most people would be happier to have more income rather than lower tax rates. The unemployed don't pay taxes. The underemployed pay little. Spending creates jobs.

HEADLINE: Imperial Blues 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Margaret MacMillan's review of "Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power," by Niall Ferguson (April 20), is perhaps rather too lenient. Ferguson's lucid work certainly does justice to some of the more positive remnants of the imperial rule: exportation of parliamentary systems of democracy, economic infrastructures and a global economic system. The experience of India, however, which was the "Jewel in the Crown" of the empire, raises some serious concerns. The thrust of Ferguson's work stresses the positive, more "modern" legacy of the empire. But the very notion of "modern" in India's case is problematic. 
By the middle of the 18th century, India accounted for nearly 25 percent of the world's global trade. Whenthe British left, this figure had dwindled to around 4 to 5 percent. The world demand for fine Indian textiles was essentially satisfied by those from the "dark satanic" Manchester mills. Much scholarly research has demonstrated that during the period of British rule India's economy underwent a process of "peasantization," whereby agriculture was given primacy at the expense of domestic industry and which ensured that Britain would be able to exercise dominant economic muscle by guaranteeing itself a market for British textiles in a country from which the colonial power had learned so much (over 1,000 words of Indian origin have made their way into the English language, a majority commerce-related). Thus, to claim that the British Empire helped to spearhead a modern, global capitalist system would be somewhat misleading.
 MacMillan's review certainly addresses the more convincing arguments of the book, but it ignores the complication that the "Jewel" of the argument raises: that the British Empire bequeathed a "modern" legacy to the current world.

HEADLINE: FOOD; 
Cat Fight

BYLINE:  By Julia Reed

 BODY:
I should declare my loyalty to catfish upfront. Or, more precisely, to American farm-raised catfish, more than 70 percent of which comes from the Mississippi Delta, where I grew up.
 During my brief career as a business reporter, I wrote about the fledgling catfish industry first for The Orlando Sentinel and then for U.S. News & World Report. The Catfish Farmers of America were so grateful that they sent me a plaque "in recognition for the contribution made . . . through the use of my craft." More thrillingly, they asked me to reign as a sort of ad hoc Catfish Queen and ride on their float in the 1987 Mobile, Ala., Mardi Gras parade. The fact that I didn't remains one of my greatest regrets. I assume I would have gotten to wear a crown, and I have always imagined it to have been in the shape of two catfish with their mouths meeting in the middle, their rhinestone whiskers shimmering above my forehead. 
 The fish I would have represented is, forgive me, a relatively new breed of cat, bearing almost no resemblance to the omnivorous, mud-loving bottom feeders my father and I fished for when I was little. 
That's because in the 1970's and 80's, when Mississippi farmers were facing the worst depression since the 1930's, many of those who could still get a bank loan decided to trade in their soybean and cotton seeds for fish fingerlings and started digging ponds. Since then, the farmers and their trade organizations, the Catfish Farmers of America and the Catfish Institute, have spent at least $70 million aggressively marketing their product. They printed endless cookbooks, published impressive stats (the fish is raised in environmentally controlled conditions; it is low in fat and cholesterol) and supported enormous events like the Catfish Festival in Belzoni, Miss., a community of 2,660 that is rightly billed as the "Catfish Capital of the World." Last year 630 million pounds of farm-raised catfish were processed in the United States, bringing an estimated $243 million to Mississippi alone, with an impact of more than $2 billion on the state's economy.
So when the Vietnamese started peddling catfish from the Mekong Delta in this country under brand names like Delta Select (a moniker mighty close to the popular Mississippi brand Delta Pride), the farmers got very upset. One of the first things the Americans challenged was the right of the Vietnamese farmers to use the word itself. They maintain that the Vietnamese fish is really basa fish, whatever that is, and that labeling it as catfish is, in the words of Hugh Warren, executive vice president of the C.F.A., the equivalent of "selling kangaroo meat as sirloin." Last year the C.F.A. persuaded Congress to bar the Vietnamese from calling their fish catfish and to require them to stamp their packages with the country of origin so there wouldn't be any more confusion about which delta had been the fish's birthplace.
Since there are more than 2,000 species of catfish in the world, it does seem a tad ridiculous to contend that our North American family, Ictaluridae, is the only one that can be correctly called catfish. But in this current war with Vietnam at least, I am firmly on our side. I can't help it. I have never been good at escaping my roots. And I honestly do believe it is a superior product.
Farm-raised catfish are pure little packages of protein, raised in ponds filled with aerated and circulated well water and fed pellets composed of soybeans and corn. They don't taste muddy; they taste sweet. John Edgerton, the Southern historian and food writer who laments what has happened to the taste of chickens since they've been mass-produced, admits that farm-raised catfish are "an anomaly: one of the few artificially produced foods that may be better than the original." Nothing, he says, "beats pond-raised catfish, not even the native cats of the South's lakes and rivers."
The latter is a point the American catfish farmers have seized on in their battle with the Vietnamese, who raise their fish in huge underwater pens in the polluted Mekong River. "They've grown up flapping around in third-world rivers and dining on whatever they can get their fins on," read one advertisement produced by the catfish lobby. Representative Marion Berry of Arkansas, whose state is also a top catfish producer, went so far as to accuse the Vietnamese fish of being contaminated with Agent Orange. "That stuff doesn't break down." That last crack is a bit much, especially since we're the ones who sprayed the stuff over there in the first place. Also, now the farmers are claiming that the Vietnamese are illegally "dumping" their catfish on the U.S. market at artificially low prices and asked the Commerce Department to impose import duties. The department responded with a preliminary ruling recommending import duties of as much as 64 percent. The Vietnamese contend that this violates the spirit of free trade and that the United States is protecting the interests of "a relatively small group of wealthy catfish industrialists." 
I have to confess that I agree with the free trade part, but until now "wealthy" and "industrialist" were not words I thought I would ever live to see bracketing "catfish." First of all, these days you don't get rich (much less become a personage as impressive as an industrialist) farming anything in the Mississippi Delta. Also, catfish has always been an inexpensive food for the masses. At catfish fries across the South, hundreds and sometimes thousands are fed -- the world's biggest, which serves 12,500 pounds of catfish, lasts about a week and is held every April in Paris, Tenn. A staple of old-fashioned Southern retail politicking, a catfish fry features fillets dredged in seasoned cornmeal and deep-fried in huge drumsof roiling oil, accompanied by tartar sauce, pickles, coleslaw and fries. I can think of no better way to enjoy catfish and frequently do at catfish joints like Middendorf's in Manchac, La., or at the Taylor Grocery in Taylor, Miss. 
But since the farm-raised industry has taken off, the locals have gotten more adventurous. I have become addicted to both the catfish and capers and the smoked catfish pate from the Crown Restaurant in Indianola, Miss. (They ship just about anywhere in the United States: 800-833-7731.) I also love catfish meuniere, and it is excellent in a classic bouillabaisse or bourride and in a Creole concoction called courtbouillon. This has almost nothing in common with a proper clear court-bouillon used to cook fish or shellfish and is usually pronounced COO-bi-yon. It is closer to a stew than a soup, and like most things that originated in New Orleans, it is an amalgamation of French, Spanish and African cooking. It is easy and delicious, and I hate to admit that it can also be made with redfish or red snapper. As much as I love it, recently -- and perhaps perversely -- I have been more inclined toward a dish that originated in Vietnam's neighbor Laos, where, by whatever name, they have been eating catfish for a long time. While I bow to their history, I am still mindful of my own. So I would never actually make it with anything other than farm-raised catfish from the (Mississippi) Delta.

Laotian Catfish Soup
1 1/2 pounds catfish fillets
12 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
3 to 4 Thai chilies, seeded and finely chopped
3 (double) fresh kaffir lime leaves, stem and main vein removed, finely chopped
14-inch piece fresh lemongrass, thinly sliced
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil
1 quart chicken broth or water
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 1/4-inch-thick slices peeled galangal (fresh or frozen), optional
1/4 cup smooth peanut butter
1 can (about 14 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk
6 tablespoons Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
Cooked jasmine rice (optional).
1. Cut the catfish fillets into strips about 1 inch long by 1/2 inch wide, place on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
2. Saute the garlic, chilies, lime leaves, lemongrass and shallots in the oil in a deep skillet over medium heat until very fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth or water, the lime juice and the galangal if you're using it and heat the mixture to a slow simmer. 
3. Whisk the peanut butter and 2 tablespoons of the coconut milk in a small bowl until blended and then whisk it into the garlic mixture. Stir in the fish and remaining coconut milk and simmer gently until the fish layers separate when prodded with a fork, about 2 minutes. Stir in fish sauce, basil and cilantro and simmer 2 minutes. Serve immediately, with rice if desired.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
Note: Thai chilies, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal and fish sauce are available at Bangkok Center Grocery, 104 Mosco Street (between Mott and Mulberry Streets), 212-349-1979.

Catfish Courtbouillon
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 large yellow onion, peeled and finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
3 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1 stick butter
6 cups fish stock or water
1 can (35 ounces) Italian tomatoes, roughly chopped
1 bunch Italian parsley, leaves chopped ( 1/2 cup lightly packed)
3 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon dried or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano, marjoram or basil
Juice of 1 lemon
1 cup dry white wine
4 pounds catfish fillets
1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
Cayenne pepper and salt to taste
Cooked rice for serving.
1. Heat the oil in a heavy 5-quart saucepan or enameled Dutch oven until smoking. Add the flour and stir until blended. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is smooth and straw colored, about 3 minutes. Stir in the onion, pepper, garlic and celery. Reduce heat to medium and stir in the butter. Continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Meanwhile, bring the fish stock or water to a boil.
2. Stir in the tomatoes and their liquid, parsley, bay leaves, thyme and oregano, marjoram or basil to the flour mixture. Add the boiling fish stock, lemon juice and wine and stir gently. Simmer until thickened, 20 to 30 minutes. Add the fish, green onions and cayenne, stir gently and simmer just until the fish layers separate when prodded gently with a fork, about 2 minutes. Taste for seasoning. (It will need salt if water is used.) Serve over rice.
Yield: 10 to 12 servings.

 I was surprised by the decidedly unsympathetic letters (May 4) in response to Jonathan Mahler's article (April 13). As half of a couple that have experienced serial unemployment and the persistent threat of job loss, I understand the nonfinancial implications. For a family, it is not unlike chronic illness: uncertainty about the (near) future, depression, feeling that others (employed or healthy) are vaguely uncomfortable around you -- friends stop calling because they don't know what to say.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Ken Loach: Still Driving On the Left

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
"IT'S funny how critics never seem to write about the content of films," said Ken Loach on a wet, snowy Manhattan afternoon in early March. Why was it, he wanted to know, that reviews in British and American newspapers will typically deal with every aspect of a movie except what it is centrally about?
 This was, I suspect, a rhetorical question. In any case, the content of Mr. Loach's films -- he has been making them since the mid-1960's, when he began working on weekly dramas for the BBC -- is hard to ignore. He has weathered the vicissitudes of British ideological and cinematic fashion and remains a staunch and unapologetic proponent of the stark, politically charged realism that flourished in those days, when, as he put it, "it was sexy to be on the left." Sexy or not, Mr. Loach, a stoop-shouldered, shy-seeming man of 66, has stayed there ever since, unbudged by the Thatcherism of the 1980's or Tony Blair's post-socialist "third way." 
 Mr. Loach's films are both the expression and the record of his political commitments; it would be a disservice to him and to them to pretend otherwise, though he does not make any grand claims about their political effectiveness. "We used to say back in the 60's that one good shop steward was worth six filmmakers -- or one good union organizer was worth six filmmakers," he said over lunch at a Midtown restaurant. "I think that's probably true." Since his first two features, "Poor Cow" in 1967 and "Kes" two years later, the grim lot of the British working class -- in particular the effects of work, poverty and the putatively benevolent intervention of the state on proletarian family life -- has been Mr. Loach's principal subject, though far from his only one. He has made movies about political violence in Northern Ireland ("Hidden Agenda"), Nicaragua ("Carla's Song") and Civil War-era Spain ("Land and Freedom") as well as about social misery in London and Glasgow; about Los Angeles janitors ("Bread and Roses") as well as Yorkshire railway workers ("The Navigators"). But to dwell too much on the overt political content of these films -- in solidarity, in disapproval, or in some wishy-washy liberal combination of the two -- is to risk missing their deeper theme, which is the terrible, almost always tragic collision between individual free will and the impersonal forces that mock, manipulate and thwart it.
Needless to say, Mr. Loach approaches this question less in the spirit of "The Matrix" than in the spirit of Marx, who observed that while people may make their own history, they do not do so in circumstances of their own choosing. When the title character in "My Name is Joe" (1998), who struggles with alcoholism and unemployment, cries out "I've got no choice," he could be speaking for any number of Mr. Loach's heroes and heroines, who seem driven, deceived or dragged kicking and screaming to their sad fates. They do, however, kick and scream -- they do, in spite of everything, make and act upon their choices -- which is what makes them heroes and heroines, rather than case studies.
Liam, the main character in "Sweet Sixteen," which opened in New York and Los Angeles on Friday (the day after "The Matrix Reloaded"), is a young teenager growing up in the drug- and unemployment-plagued housing projects of Glasgow. Like Maggie, the welfare mother in "Ladybird, Ladybird" (1993), or Maya, the illegal immigrant in "Bread and Roses" (2000), he meets the hard facts of his life with a fair amount of inventiveness and grit. "I think fighters are always attractive," Mr. Loach said. "I think people who see themselves as victims are not." But the attractive qualities his characters show -- the resilience and joie de vivre that make us root for them -- more often than not contribute to their defeat. Liam, whose mother is in jail on a drug charge, wants nothing more than to make a better life for her, his sister and his young nephew, and so, with admirable entrepreneurial pluck, he goes into the drug business himself, with consequences that are no less devastating for being foreseeable. "In a way I think that's what makes them tragic characters rather than just victims," Mr. Loach said. "Their strength is their undoing. I mean that's like classical tragedy in a way."
The tragic dimension that Mr. Loach allows his workaday characters, and that Paul Laverty, the screenwriter with whom he has frequently collaborated, teases out of their situations, is most fully realized in the performances of the lead actors, many of whom have been non-professionals. Martin Compston, who plays Liam, had never appeared in so much as a school play before he auditioned while still in high school for "Sweet Sixteen," but he inhabits Liam so completely that you sometimes have the impression of watching a documentary, and his air of innocence and determination -- of being a child growing up fast and wrong before your eyes -- gives the film's climactic scene an almost unbearable power.
This scene, in which Liam confronts his mother's bullying, criminal boyfriend, Stan, echoes the pivotal moments in many of Mr. Loach's other movies -- moments when the heroes' confident belief in their ability to control their own destinies is exposed as a fantasy, and their knowledge of themselves and their world shown to be crushingly incomplete. Ian Hart, playing an Englishman fighting with the Spanish Republicans in "Land and Freedom," learns, from his lover, of fratricide and betrayal within the ranks of the left. In "Bread and Roses," Maya lambastes her sister, Rosa, for selfishly opposing the union she is trying to organize, and is brought up short by Rosa's horrific story of sacrifice and abuse.
In these cases, and when Maggie is confronted by the social workers who have come to take away her newborn daughter in "Ladybird," the characters are taken by surprise. And one of the reasons these scenes, so full of tears and conflict, escape the distortions of melodrama is that the actors partake of their shock. "They should know everything about the character but not about the story," Mr. Loach said, explaining that he insists on withholding crucial details of the script from his cast members. "It's a test of the script, of the writing, that their instinct will follow the character." If he had told Mr. Compston the outcome of Liam's encounter with his mother's boyfriend, Mr. Loach said, "he would have artificially ratcheted it up. It would have been phony." Instead, the young man's panic and confusion -- the actor's instincts melding perfectly with the character's responses -- produce an excruciating realism, without the slightest tincture of sentiment or theatricality.
The way Mr. Loach works is strikingly resonant with the content of his movies: the actor is simultaneously free and subject to the invisible control of the story, poised like the hero on the knife-edge between choice and fate. There is a social and political dimension to this predicament -- since the agency of fate tends most often, in Mr. Loach's films, to be the cruel logic of capitalism or the bland, crushing power of the modern democratic state. It is also, in a larger sense, a painful and universal aspect of the human condition.

So Sweet, So Sensitive, So Self-Absorbed, So 70's

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
IT doesn't require the Council of Economic Advisers to recognize that the United States is having economic troubles. All it takes is turning on a pop radio station or MTV to get the strange feeling that the mid-1970's have returned: the days of post-Vietnam and post-Watergate letdown, oil crisis, unemployment and soothing soft rock to provide consolation for it all. Three decades later, sensitive, guitar-slinging nice guys are once again swarming the airwaves, blanketing the concert circuit, accounting for innumerable Internet downloads and easing untold dorm-room seductions. 
 John Mayer, who had been plugging away since the late 1990's, has become a headliner, and alongside him have come strummer-songwriters like Jack Johnson, David Gray, Pete Yorn, Jason Mraz, Howie Day, Jesse Harris, Mason Jennings, Scooter Scuderi, Steven Delopoulos and more. To heighten the deja vu, James Taylor, the songwriter Mr. Mayer hailed as "the blueprint" on the Grammy Awards show, released a new album and a greatest-hits collection, while Fleetwood Mac has re-emerged with an album, "Say You Will," that deliberately echoes its mid-1970's heyday. Both 1970's stars returned to the Top 10; Ben Taylor, the son of Mr. Taylor and Carly Simon, also released a debut album, "Famous Among the Barns," with unmistakable paternal influences. 
 But what are younger songwriters, members of the punk and hip-hop generation, doing when they croon about the beauty of their girlfriends and the pain of getting kissed off? Shouldn't they be shouting rather than whispering, toughing things out instead of moaning, as Mr. Mayer does, "My stupid mouth has got me in trouble/ I said too much again." 
Mr. Mayer and his fellow songwriters often play the same comforting role as their forebears. Turning away from the bad news of the outside world, they focus on personal affairs: mostly romance, but also the endless processes of self-invention and finding a place in the world. They make a show of modesty, singing quietly and letting their music share a room instead of dominating it. They offer harmony instead of noise, conversation rather than confrontation, resignation instead of rebellion. 
They're not uniform by any means. Some, like Mr. Gray on "A New Day at Midnight," can make private ruminations riveting. Some, like Mr. Mayer on "Room for Squares" and Mr. Rice on "O," merge a deceptively low-key charm with supple grooves and telling details. Some, like Mr. Yorn on his album, "Day I Forgot," are hit-or-miss songwriters, and many more drown under cliches. Individually, the songwriters tend to come across as genial, good-natured, unpretentious characters who don't mind joking about themselves; Mr. Mayer cheerfully mocks the word "sensitive," even as his songs embody it. But collectively, as a movement, all those edgeless tenor voices and all that deference, self-consciousness, sublimated anger and self-pity might just get on your nerves. Singing about love, they project profound self-absorption. 
Every so often, the songwriters bemoan some larger problem. In songs like "Cookie Jar" and "The News," Jack Johnson worries about violence and callousness in the media. But for Mr. Johnson and the other songwriters, the general response is a shrug: "Times Like These," the opening song on his new album "On and On," philosophizes, "What will be will be, and so it goes." Instead of a rallying cry, it's a sop for complacency.
These guys also do a whole lot of apologizing. The mark of the new sensitive songwriter is that sooner or later, he finds himself lingering over the words, "I'm sorry." They're atoning not only for their own romantic mishaps but also, in a way, for the surge of machismo in 1990's rock. After a decade of gangsta-rap misogyny and metal and punk posturing, virtually the only nice guys left on the charts were the smiley automatons of the boy bands, who were packaged for teenage and preteen listeners. So there was a niche waiting to be filled by friendly young men who write their own songs, play their own instruments and come across as genuine and uncontrived, singing from the heart. They were perfectly placed when the pop pendulum swung away from artifice. 
There was a already a sincere streak in 1990's rock. It was soon classified under the indie-rock genre emo, which is full of small, nervous voices and lyrics that confess to endless insecurities, wounds and second thoughts -- the same things that preoccupy the acoustic pop songwriters. But emo's music, rooted in punk, often puts up obstacles to keep away nonbelievers: truncated melodies, shifting meters, sudden bursts of noise. The pop guitar-slingers (and a few emo figures like Chris Carraba of Dashboard Confessional) take away those musical barriers. They don't want their music to be as jagged as their emotions; they invite everyone to listen and sing along. 
While these songwriters have ended up in roughly the same position as their 1970's models, they got there circuitously. They don't have roots in ragtime, blues, old-time country or protest songs; their foundation is 1970's pop and what followed it. The 1970's provided both worthy prototypes -- Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell -- and tacky ones. Onstage, Jason Mraz unabashedly covers songs by unctuous 1970's groups like Bread, while the Thorns -- a songwriters' alliance of Pete Droge, Matthew Sweet and Shawn Mullins -- ape the sticky-sweet high harmonies of Crosby, Stills and Nash. 
But current male songwriters have two more recent models: the women who were gathered on mid-1990's Lilith Fair bills -- among them Sarah McLachlan and Jewel -- and the Dave Matthews Band. Though Mr. Matthews and his band revel in musical intricacies and unfolding jams, he himself is a brooding songwriter strumming an acousticguitar. As the Dave Matthews Band worked up to the arena circuit, it showed songwriters there was an audience for earnest, handmade music and a way to reach them: through the jam-band Internet grapevine. It also brought home the boundless utility of a groove, which can carry a song through uninspired patches and move audiences to dance as well as listen. 
The younger songwriters are far more rhythmically fluent than the folkies who grew up in the 1960's. Many of them are thoroughly at home with jazz chords and reggae syncopations, and every so often they'll allow themselves a few lines of something like rapping. Onstage, although not on their mild-mannered albums, they often show a pushier side. Pete Yorn's band pounds out his folk-rock songs while he sings with a slurred grunge yowl; Damien Rice, whose recorded songs are hushed and calmly intimate, plugs in his distortion pedal to make the live versions much stormier. 
Turbulence isn't hard to find elsewhere: in hip-hop, in hard rock, in overblown power ballads. Even current country music dispenses its verbal treacle with a brawny beat. Perhaps we should be grateful that at least one zone of pop still prizes light-fingered subtlety and tries to beguile listeners instead of buttonholing them, and still presents men who try to respect and understand women. There's nothing wrong with songwriters offering solace in unsettling times. But it would be much easier to love their sensitivity if they weren't so in love with it themselves.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Detroit

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD; MICHELINE MAYNARD reports on business for The Times from Detroit.

 BODY:
When Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903, he was just one of dozens of American automobile entrepreneurs, but he endured to become the most recognizable of the industry pioneers.
 One hundred years later, the company that bears his name is dealing with a financial crisis that is forcing it to cut costs and close factories, but Ford is celebrating its heritage anyway. 
 In June, the company plans a five-day event on the grounds of its headquarters in suburban Dearborn, including concerts, test drives and an exhibition of Ford's most notable vehicles. The activities are just part of a busy summer for the Motor City, whose residents avidly take to the outdoors during the one season when it isn't likely to snow.

Events
Birthplace of the Motown sound and home to the rap star Marshall Mathers, better known as Eminem, Detroit is also a world center for pulsating techno music. Movement 2003: The Detroit Electronic Music Festival will be held May 24 to 26 on Hart Memorial Plaza downtown; www.movementfestival.com. Past festivals have attracted a million fans to various stages. The lineup will include Slum Village, Jeff Mills and Buzz Gorree.
The Ford centennial, www.celebrateford100.com, will be held June 12 to 16 at the Henry Ford II World Center, The American Road, Dearborn, known locally as the Glass House. Thousands of owners of Ford's classic vehicles are expected to put their cars on display, and there will be Model-T rides. You can also whip around the Ford test track nearby for a $50 charitable contribution. Concerts include the Detroit Symphony Orchestra June 13, Beyonce Knowles June 14, and the country singer Toby Keith June 15. Tickets good for all five days, including the concerts, are $24.94. 
At the Henry Ford Museum, 20900 Oakwood Boulevard, in Dearborn, (313) 982-6100, www.thehenryford.org, "Bond, James Bond," previously shown in London, will include gadgets, costumes and storyboards from 40 years of Bond films. Timed tickets for the exhibit, June 28 to Dec. 31, are $7 in addition to general admission for the museum, which is $13.50.
On May 29, 30 and 31 and June 1, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra www.detroitsymphony.com, (313) 576-5111, features Jian Wang playing the Dvorak Cello Concerto, with Neeme Jarvi, the music director, conducting at Orchestra Hall, 3711 Woodward Avenue, Detroit. Tickets are $15 to $80.
Summer wouldn't be complete without the Ann Arbor Art Fairs, www.artfair.org, July 16 to 19 this year. A combination of serious art, collectibles and kitsch, the free fairs are held at locations throughout Ann Arbor, 45 minutes west of Detroit and home to the University of Michigan. The oldest and most prestigious is the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, a juried display, on the grounds of the Burton Memorial Tower, in the middle of the Michigan campus. 

Sightseeing
 Though downtown is compact, the city's outlying attractions are most easily reached by car, just as Henry Ford would have liked it. 
The Edsel and Eleanor Ford House, 1100 Lake Shore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, (313) 884-4222, www.fordhouse.org, was home to Henry Ford's only son, Edsel Ford, who lived at this 87-acre estate with his wife, Eleanor, on the shores of Lake St. Clair. The 60-room house and grounds lie in one of Detroit's prettiest and wealthiest areas. Entrance $6.
After being closed for renovations since September, Greenfield Village, www.hfmgv.org, a 90-acre outdoor museum of American history, with buildings, homes, amusements and shops spanning 300 years, reopens June 10. The village's entire underground infrastructure was replaced, with roads, curbs and sidewalks added. Tickets are $16. (Combination passes will be available with the Henry Ford Museum.)
The Charles A. Wright Museum of African-American History 315 East Warren Avenue, Detroit, (313) 494-5800, www.maah-detroit.org, houses the ongoing exhibition "Of the People: The African American Experience," which covers 400 years of history. Free outdoor concerts every Friday in June at 6 p.m. celebrate Black Music Month, and each features a different musical genre, including gospel, jazz, rhythm and blues, and techno. Closed Monday and Tuesday. Admission is $5.
Ford Field, 2000 Brush Street, Detroit, www.detroitlions.com, which opened last year, didn't bring the Detroit Lions football team any better luck in its debut season. But the $500 million stadium, which will play host to Super Bowl XL in 2006, is a popular downtown destination. Tours are conducted daily, while its shopping concourse and restaurants are open weekdays, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Ford Field sits next door to Comerica Park, home to the Detroit Tigers, www.detroittigers.com, whose baseball fortunes this year have mirrored the Lions' and whose stadium is another draw. The park, at 2100 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, boasts a Ferris wheel and a merry-go-round, with fireworks on Friday nights. The Yankees are in town May 30 to June 1; tickets are $5 to $60.
The Detroit Institute of Arts, 5200 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, (313) 833-7900, www.dia.org, is home to one of the city's most familiar images, Diego Rivera's Detroit Industry murals depicting the autoworkers at Ford's sprawling Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn. Henry Ford and Thomas Edison are shown conversing in one corner of the murals, which decorate the walls of the Garden Court. Closed Monday and Tuesday. Suggested admission is $4, $1 for children.

Where to Stay
Rooms may be hard to come by in Dearborn during the Ford centennial, since Ford reserved hotels well in advance for its dealers and other guests. But hotels encourage visitors to call for last-minute cancellations.
The Dearborn Inn, 20301 Oakwood Boulevard, Dearborn, (313) 271-2700, fax (313) 271-7464, a Marriott hotel, was built in 1931 on the orders of Heny Ford to serve passengers landing at the Dearborn airport across the street, where Ford's test track now stands. Designed by Albert Kahn, the inn has a traditional look, and its garden is a favorite place for weddings. The 220 rooms and 34 suites, renovated in 1996, tend to be on the small side, with a bed-and-breakfast feel. The inn also has five houses in back called the Colonial Village, each featuring suites. Rooms start at $169 for a double; Colonial Village suites are $209 a night. 
Budget: Detroit, being predominantly a business town, has few reliable choices under $100 a night. One less expensive option is the Courtyards by Marriott chain, with more than a dozen properties in prime spots throughout the area. A double room at the Courtyard Dearborn, Dearborn, 5200 Mercury Drive, (313) 271-1400, fax (313) 271-1184, behind Ford's headquarters, starts at $104 a night but discounts are widely available.
The copper-colored-glass Hyatt Regency Dearborn, at Fairlane Town Center, (313) 593-1234, fax (313) 982-6884, www.dearborn.hyatt.com, screams 1970's on the outside. But the 772-room hotel is gleaming inside from a much-needed $25 million renovation, completed last year. Rooms are tasteful, with blond-wood furniture, beige walls and red accents, and vary in size and shape, because of the curved walls. Rates start at $109 for a double room.
The Inn on Ferry Street, 84 East Ferry Street, Detroit, (313) 871-6000, fax (313) 871-1473, www.theinnon ferrystreet.com, a block from the Detroit Institute of Arts, is a rarity in a city dominated by chain hotels. Located in a regentrified neighborhood that was once home to Detroit's Jewish elite, the 42-room hotel, which opened in 2001, is actually four Victorian mansions and two carriage houses with rooms furnished with antiques. The hotel offers a free shuttle within a five-mile radius. Doubles start at $109 including breakfast, while a suite is $179.
Luxury: Detroit's slim luxury hotel pickings gained a welcome addition in December with the opening of the $85 million Westin Hotel at Detroit Metropolitan International Airport, 2501 WorldGateway Place, Detroit, (734) 942-6500, fax (734) 942-6600. The hotel, with 404 rooms and 10 suites, has a Pacific Rim air, with a live bamboo forest and streamlined furnishings. It is the only meeting and dining place at the airport that visitors can reach without clearing security. The rooms are decorated in dark brown, beige and cream. There is a state-of-the-art fitness center with a small pool and roomy whirlpool. Doubles start at $199; one-bedroom suites from $350 to $750. For weary travelers with long layovers, the Westin offers day rooms at $139 for eight hours.

Where to Eat
The Detroit Red Wings' late dominance of the N.H.L. has earned Detroit the nickname Hockeytown. That's also the name of a sprawling bar and restaurant at 2301 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, (313) 965-9500, across the street from Comerica Park. With an outdoor roof terrace, Hockeytown is noisy, especially after games, but child-friendly, and the menu encompasses both bar food and specialties that include broiled Canadian whitefish with a mushroom and sun-dried cherry sauce; and beef ravioli with homemade marinara sauce. Dinner for two, with a beer or glass of wine, will run about $40.
About a mile north, Agave, at 4265 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, (313) 833-1120, serves sophisticated dishes from the Mexico City region. Entrees include sauteed duck breast with an achiote seed-orange sauce and fresh beet-jicama salsa and mahi-mahi in a chipotle-cilantro cream sauce. Among the appetizers are a standout chile relleno, a whole poblano pepper stuffed with panela cheese, corn and summer squash; and ceviche made from scallops, rock shrimp and squid. For dessert, the warm chocolate-chipotle cake is worth the trip. The bar stocks 60 tequilas. Dinner for two, including drinks, will run $60.
Il Posto, 29110 Franklin Road, Southfield, (248) 827-8070, is run by Gianni Belsito, the chef and owner, who came to suburban Detroit from Italy by way of New Jersey and Florida. Service is attentive and decor understated. Fish, including sea bass, turbot and Dover sole, is flown in daily from Normandy, pastas are made in-house, and pastries, including a dense lemon cake, are shipped direct from Italy, except for the homemade tiramisu. Dinner for two with wine runs $150. Reservations recommended.
Dearborn is home to one of the nation's biggest Arab populations, and there is no better place to sample Middle Eastern food than at a La Shish restaurant. There are 10 in the suburban Detroit area, 4 in Dearborn alone. At the main restaurant, 22039 West Michigan Avenue, Dearborn, (313) 562-7200, portions are enormous, with one order of any appetizer, salad or entree easily feeding two. All the classic Arab specialties are available, but the restaurants have been expanding their menus lately with, for example, beef tenderloin or chicken sajji, marinated and seared. Big groups should spring for La Feast, appetizers, entrees and salads on a huge platter and serving at least six ($89.99). Dinner for two, with beverage, is $30. Alcoholic beverages are not served at all branches.

HEADLINE: Ashland, Ore. 

 BODY:
To the Editor: "What's Doing in Ashland, Ore." (May 4) offers a prime example of how the arts can transform a community. 
 When I presented myself as an actor to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in the summer of 1949, Ashland was a sleepy town with a large park, the Lithia Hotel, a movie theater, La Marre's drugstore, a coffee shop and the (then) Southern Oregon College of Education, overshadowed by Medford, its larger neighbor to the north. 
 The festival itself, in its third season after World War II, was a motley yet dedicated mixture of professionals, academics, and college students like myself. Yet supported by the Ashland community, Angus Bowmer (the founding director) put on good shows that attracted increasingly larger audiences, developing a vibrant arts community and a flourishing economy, enlivening the entire region. 
In these times of shrinking funds for the arts, Ashland can serve as an object lesson on why such support has implications that go far beyond the aesthetic and educational.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.; 
Costs of Prepaying Underlying Loans

 BODY:
 Q. I live in a co-op building on the Upper East Side. The interest rate on our underlying mortgage is close to 9 percent. When shareholders have asked about refinancing, we have been told that a punitive clause in the mortgage makes refinancing problematic. Do co-op mortgages typically have clauses that discourage refinancing, or were our board members unsophisticated when they negotiated the terms? . . . Jonathan R. Gross, Manhattan.

A. Andrew P. Brucker, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the punitive clause, more typically called a prepayment penalty, is very common in underlying mortgages.
 "Prepayment penalties come in all shapes and sizes," Mr. Brucker said. In some cases, he said, the loan terms expressly prohibit prepayment within a certain number of years and then allow the borrower to pay off the entire mortgage before the end of the term only with a penalty. 
Other loans might allow prepayment at any time, with the penalty reduced over the years. For example, with a 10-year loan the prepayment penalty in the first two years might be 5 percent of the loan balance, dropping to 4 percent in the next two years, 3 percent in years five and six, 2 percent in years seven and eight and 1 percent in the last two years.
It is also possible for the underlying mortgage to be written with a penalty that guarantees that the lender receives the full interest income, even with prepayment. 
Mr. Brucker said that depending on when the loan was taken out, if banks were insisting on prepayment penalties the board might have had little choice but to accept the terms. But he said that the board might want to explore the possibility of refinancing or try to renegotiate the terms with the current lender, even with a prepayment penalty.
"We had a client two years ago that paid a penalty in excess of $1 million," he said. "When we did a financial analysis of the new loan the result was startling. Interest rates had dropped so precipitously that the co-op would recoup the penalty in less than a year and a half."

A Building In Disrepair

Q. I live in a rental building in Manhattan. The apartments are in total disrepair, with bursting pipes, falling plaster and faulty wiring. Our landlord owns a building up the street whose tenants have had the same trouble we have had in getting repairs. However, in that building, the landlord renovated the lobby and used the capital improvement to raise the rent. Although our lobby is in acceptable shape, we believe he plans to do the same thing here to raise our rents. Is there anything we can do to prevent this from occurring? . . . Liza Englander, Manhattan.

A. Jeffrey Ween, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said there is a provision in the Rent Stabilization Code that prohibits granting a capital improvement increase if essential services in the building have not been maintained or if inherently hazardous conditions are present.
"And I would say that bursting pipes, falling plaster and faulty wiring would qualify as inherently hazardous conditions," Mr. Ween said. 
As a result, he said, the building's residents should make sure that government officials are aware of the conditions. One way to do that, Mr. Ween said, is to file an action in the housing part of civil court. Once that action is filed, the court will schedule an inspection by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. 
Another way would be to object to the landlord's application for a capital improvement increase when the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal advises tenants that the application has been filed.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Pennington; 
Small Town With a Sense of Community

BYLINE:  By JULIA LAWLOR 

 BODY:
THE pace of life is relaxed in Pennington, a one-square-mile borough in Mercer County, N.J., that was settled in the 17th century. Drivers traveling south on Route 31 must obey the sudden drop in the speed limit -- from 45 miles per hour in neighboring Hopewell Township to 25 at the borough's edge -- or risk speeding tickets. Elementary-school children walk to school along streets lined with pink-blossomed cherry trees. The mayor shows up at the Cup of Joe coffee shop in downtown Pennington every morning, ready to chat. 
 You do not have to live here long before just about everybody knows your name. "When people come into my store," said Jack Koeppel, a gallery owner on Main Street and lifelong Pennington resident, "I can greet them by their first names, ask them how their kids are doing. I know what's going on in their lives." 
 Pennington's small-town atmosphere and highly rated school system are big draws for young families. Because the borough is so small, children can easily walk to the two-block-long downtown and parents rarely have to drive their children to play dates or after-school activities. 
Many Pennington residents commute to Manhattan or Philadelphia. There is no train station in town, however, and the closest station with service to New York, in Hamilton, is a 15-minute drive away. From there, it is more than an hour to Penn Station. The commute is much easier for workers driving to state office buildings in Trenton, Princeton University and large corporate facilities in the area, including Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merrill Lynch. 
Pennington is just far enough off the beaten path that its tiny downtown has not yet been discovered by the national chains. There is no Starbucks, no Gap. Drive-through fast-food restaurants are banned. There are, however, a bank, a drugstore, a cobbler, a pizza parlor, a hardware store, several gift shops and restaurants.
The closest grocery shopping is the Pennington Supermarket, where, according to a former councilwoman, Susan Porcella, "the dairy section is in Pennington and the rest is in Hopewell Township." The nearest mall is the Quaker Bridge Mall, about a 10-minute drive away on Route 1. 
Laura Semler moved to Pennington in March with her husband, Michael, and their two boys, 5 and 6. They had been living in Madrid and decided they wanted a big yard and a slow-paced lifestyle when Mr. Semler took a job near Philadelphia. They found it in Pennington: "We really wanted a small town," said Ms. Semler. "We're two blocks from downtown. Once the kids are old enough to cross the street by themselves, I'd feel comfortable letting them walk."
Ms. Semler and her husband had first looked for houses in Princeton, just 12 minutes away. But they found that a comparable house in Pennington cost $200,000 less. They paid $730,000 for a four-bedroom, 15-year-old colonial in a small development.
Real estate agents say that home prices have risen steadily in recent years but that demand is currently not particularly intense. Beverly Willever, manager of Peyton Associates in Pennington, said prices range from $248,500 for a small two-bedroom house that needs work to $655,000 for newer construction. Houses are selling in about a month, she said, but some take longer. "The houses that need repair can sit for four to six months," Ms. Willever said.
Jimmy Maul, a broker associate for Keller Williams Realty in Princeton and a 13-year resident of Pennington, said prices had risen 12 percent a year since 1998 and jumped to 15 to 20 percent last year. But this year, he said, a harsh winter, the war with Iraq and the slowing economy combined to put a dent in sales. In the first week of May, there were 22 houses on the market. "We usually don't have as many houses on the market at one time," Mr. Maul said.
PENNINGTON also has a small number of condominiums, town houses and rental apartments, he said, an adult community for those 55 and over and an assisted living facility for seniors. 
Now that his children are grown, Mr. Maul is planning on leaving Pennington because of the high property taxes he pays -- $14,000 a year on a house with an asking price of $629,000. Because his house is newer, he pays more in taxes relative to his house's value than those with older homes. 
The high property tax level, most of which goes to finance the schools, is the biggest issue facing the town, said Mayor Jim Loper. "We want to keep a balance of senior citizens and young families," he said. "In the last few years, we've tried to have zero increase in taxes. But we can't do that forever." Rising housing prices also make it hard for middle-class families to buy. 
When Bob and Kathy Frederich and their two children moved to Pennington from Lexington, Ky., in December of 2001, they rented a house on Main Street. Once they realized how much they liked the schools, they decided to buy a 70-year-old fixer-upper in July 2002. The house needs extensive renovations, but it was the only one they could afford that had the space they needed. 
"The schools here are incredibly good," Ms. Frederich said. Her older daughter is in the second grade at Tollgate Grammar School, one of four elementary schools in the Hopewell Valley Regional School District and the only one in Pennington.
Ms. Frederich has been impressed not only with the quality of the teachers, but also with the wide variety of programs offered. There is a "Meet the Masters" program run by parent volunteers that introduces children to different styles of art; there are classes in violin, Spanish and computers; and the school just finished a "million minute challenge," with students recording the number of minutes they read outside of the classroom. 
After elementary school, students who live in Pennington attend Grades 6 through 8 at Timberlane Middle School and Grades 9 through 12 at Central High School, both located on the outskirts of Pennington. In 2002, 98 percent of fourth graders who took the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment test were found to be proficient in language arts and 92 percent were proficient in math. That compares with state averages of 86 percent in language arts and 74 percent in math. In the Grade 8 Proficiency Assessment tests, 96 percent were proficient in language arts, 89 percent in math and 96 percent in science. State averages for the eighth grade were 83 percent in language arts, 67 percent in math and 82 percent in science. 
At Central High School, the average scores on the SAT reasoning test for 2002 were 559 on the verbal test and 573 in math, compared with state averages of 498 in verbal and 513 in math. Last year, the school's average scores placed it 27th out of 307 high schools in the state, according to Dr. Robert J. Sopko, superintendent of schools. Seventy percent of last year's 280-member senior class attended four-year colleges, and 17 percent went to two-year colleges and nursing schools. 
"We are a highly academic high school," Dr. Sopko said. "We offer 55 extracurricular activities and a multitude of advanced placement courses." The high school also offers auto shop as an elective, has two woodworking programs, a robotics team that competes nationally and its own TV studio. A new TV studio, auditorium and gymnasium will be completed in July. 
Pennington is within a 20-minute drive of several private schools and is also the home of the Pennington School, a private day and boarding school founded by the Methodist Church in 1838. The school, which has 440 students in Grades 6 through 12, allows local residents the use of its tennis courts, indoor pool and playing fields. In 1980, after a fire destroyed a building at the school, the borough created Pennington Day, a street fair with proceeds going to rebuild facilities at the school. Since then, Pennington Day has been held in May each year, benefiting a variety of nonprofit groups. 
There are several popular summer programs for children in Pennington, run by the Hopewell Valley Recreation Department. One is a six-week teen travel camp for middle school students, featuring trips every day to the beach, an amusement park, New York City or a baseball game. The camp culminates in a three-day overnight trip; this year's trip is to Niagara Falls. 
For children 5 to 12, a weeklong Art in the Park program at Pennington's Kunkel Park is offered in the mornings for $140. Throughout the year, there are day and extended trips for adults and a senior program that includes a bridge club, walking club, exercise program and annual picnic. 
WHAT sets Pennington apart, many residents say, are its sense of community and tradition of volunteerism. The fire department and the rescue squad are made up of volunteers, and residents donate time to work on Pennington Day, the Memorial Day parade, the recreation commission and the streetscape committee. The mayor and council members are all unpaid.
Robbi Jones moved to Pennington after being divorced more than four years ago. She had lived on five acres in Hopewell Township, barely knew her neighbors and missed being part of a community. After moving to Pennington, "I went to the mayor and said, 'Put me on a committee,' " she recalled.
She moved into a house downtown, and started getting involved -- in the library, the Girl Scouts, the streetscape committee, Pennington Day and the Parks and Recreation Commission. "It's like Mayberry," Ms. Jones said. "My neighbor mows my lawn; I shovel his driveway."
Pennington's mix of Colonial, Federal, Greek Revival and Victorian-style architecture appeals to old-home lovers, and the Victorian stone Pennington Railroad Station, which now holds two condominiums, is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The borough's history dates to the late 1600's, when it was a crossroads called Queenstown, where travelers between Philadelphia and New York stopped overnight. In 1708, the Presbyterian Church was built, the village grew and two years later the name was changed to Penny Town -- a reference to the fact that a night's lodging could be had in a tavern there for pennies.
During the Revolutionary War, the Presbyterian Church became a barracks for British and Hessian soldiers, who were said to have usedthe pews for chopping meat. They also used a wall outside the church to practice jumping their horses, according to the legend. A crack in the communion table, which remains on view at the church, is said to have been caused by the blow of a Hessian soldier's sword.

Undeterred, a group of parents devised a plan to raise funds privately to get a football program started. They proposed to pay the full cost for two years, then gradually reduce their share of the financing until the district picked up the full tab in the fifth year. The school board agreed, and Central High's first football team in 70 years won six games last fall and lost three. The group has raised more than $69,000. Those who opposed football at the high school organized and fought back. The opponents have petitioned the New Jersey Department of Education to rule that the plan to require public financing of football in five years violates due process. A decision is expected this month. Map of New Jersey highlighting Pennington.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: DIGBY ANDERSON; 
A Cultural Critic Becomes Friendship's Best Friend

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
TO hear the angry pundits tell it, many business scandals of the last few years -- Enron, WorldCom, ImClone Systems, the list seems endless -- can be traced back to excess coziness among directors and chief executives, among management and favored investors, or, in other words, among friends. Friendships and the conflicts of interest they entail, some say, are increasingly interfering with ethics and good business judgment.
 Digby Anderson thinks that's hogwash. What's wrong with business today -- in fact, with society as a whole -- is a lack of friendship, not too much of it, he says. 
 "Friendship is a public virtue, not a threat," he said. 
Dr. Anderson, who holds a doctorate in sociology from Brunel University in London, is the director of the Social Affairs Unit, a London research center that he founded 23 years ago and has since earned a reputation in England of thoroughly relishing controversy. He and many of his colleagues have spent the last two decades publishing copious treatises and books about what has gone wrong in modern society -- for instance, why virtues like fortitude, courage and prudence are rarely talked of and no longer prized; why excessive sentimentality has taken over from true emotion and clearheaded thinking; why formal manners have all but disappeared; and why genuine ethics have taken a back seat to verbose moralizing.
Friendship is the latest addition to Dr. Anderson's list. "Society has simply pushed friendship out of politics and business," he said.
It is a belief he has gone to great pains to document. The death of friendship is a theme running through the introduction he wrote for "The War on Wisdom," a book scheduled to be published by the Social Affairs Unit next month. Two years earlier, he began sounding that theme in "Losing Friends," also published by the Social Affairs Unit. (In the United States, the books are distributed through the Manhattan Institute.)
In "Losing Friends," he wrote about the rise and fall of friendship, including its heyday in Greek and Roman society and its nadir today. He blames the usual suspects: geographic mobility, the shrinking nuclear family, the jealous demands spouses make on time. And he bemoans the disappearance of friendship from written fact and fiction: no friends listed in obituaries, few friendships extolled in modern literature.
Dr. Anderson gave voice to his laments at a recent informal lunch at a reporter's home -- a place chosen in part for convenience, in part for its seeming aptness as a friendly setting for discussing friendship, and in huge part because the hostess did not know that Dr. Anderson had once been a magazine's food columnist. As the meal continued, he expounded on why friendship's wane is bad for individuals, for society and, yes, for corporate America and the people who derive their livelihoods from it.
"All past civilizations have declined, and Western civilization is about due to go," he said, gamely piling his plate with assorted meats and salads. "The death of friendship is one symptom of that."
He says he believes political extremism has rendered friends powerless to help one another. Liberals' insistence on equal opportunity and impartiality, he said, has led to "egalitarian bureaucracy," a muddling of what had once been smooth-flowing business networks based on friendships. Years ago, he said, friends happily helped one another find jobs; today they shy away, lest they be accused of favoritism.
"Even though it makes sense to hire a friend, or even a friend's friend, there's this feeling that you have to give everyone an equal chance," he said.
The blow from the right, he said, has been a constant emphasis on the family as the "repository of all virtues" -- and, thus, the only institution worthy of trust and time.
"The ancient Greeks had a better idea: they considered their friends to actually be their family," Dr. Anderson said.
Both sides, he complains, have forgotten the benefits that placing friends above others can confer in business. To him, the company most likely to succeed is the one whose employee roster smacks of cronyism. 
A company whose board is run by the chief executive's best friend is probably better managed, Dr. Anderson said, "because only a friend will tell you that you're going down the wrong path."
Hiring someone on a friend's say-so also makes good sense, he said, "because a good friend's advice is worth a lot more than the bureaucratic knowledge you get from lists and questionnaires and applications." Hiring friends helps guarantee ethical behavior, he contended. "It takes ethical people to run an ethical business, so you are best off hiring friends, whose characters you know well," he added. 'After all, someone who cheats on his wife will cheat on the company."
(Dr. Anderson said he recently ended a friendship with someone who brought him a nasty piece of gossip "because I figured he would say similar things about me.")
The temptation to poke holes in Dr. Anderson's theories is irresistible. Indeed, that "friendly" lunch evolved into a four-hour freewheeling thrust-and-parry session in which Dr. Anderson deftly countered challenges to his beliefs. Among them:
* Have highly public friendships really disappeared in the last few decades? What about the Rat Pack, the Brat Pack or even the actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck? "Those aren't true friendships; they are people indulging in activities together," he said.
* Doesn't business owe a chance to people who didn't grow up in the right neighborhood, go to the right schools or otherwise get a chance to make the right friends? "You can hire someone because you do not want to offend the rules of justice, or because you want a competent person who has been vouched for by someone who's known him for years," he said.
* What about all those conflict-of-interest stories that stem from cronyism and favoritism -- friends hiring one another's less-than-competent nieces and sons, approving one another's pay packages, feeding one another insider stock tips? He called it another case of faux friendship: "Friends do not ask friends to do dishonorable things," he said. In other words, those people are not friends, just mutual users masquerading as such.
It all sounds like a purely semantic argument, and maybe it is. But Dr. Anderson says semantics are not to be taken lightly.
Consider those ubiquitous corporate mission statements. "They're long and ethically nonsensical and full of inarticulateness," he said, temporarily veering from the subject of friendship to fire a salvo at his other pet peeve, faux ethicists.
"They keep using the word integrity, and they don't even know what it means." (Does he? "It means wholeness, not virtue," he said, sounding genuinely irate at the frequent misuse.)
BUT he is easily brought back to the topic of friendship, or lack thereof. After all, his thoughts on corporate ethics are academic; his thoughts on friendship are personal.
It is not that he feels friend-deprived. He says that he is still close to the man who was his best friend when they were 8 years old, that he has plenty of friends from a past life in academia, and that he and Judith, his wife of 37 years, have deliberately formed and maintained many friendships with other couples. 
But he is 59, and retirement is probably well under a decade away. He noted that people increasingly move away after they retire. "Nowadays, people seem to only worry about whether they can make good friends in the new place," he said. "I'm already thinking in terms of, when my retirement comes, will I be leaving any friend who needs me?"
And if he is? "I might still go," he acknowledged. "But at least I would let my obligations to friends weigh heavily in the decision. And sadly these days, too many people would not think of that."

Warning Signs At the High-Risk Pool

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AFTER Amy Donnelly's husband lost his job last December as a toolmaker for a small manufacturing company, the couple decided not to continue their health insurance under the federal law, known as Cobra, that lets workers keep their policies for up to 18 months if they pay full premiums. The monthly cost, $850, seemed too steep, they said, and they thought they could get a better rate on their own. But Mrs. Donnelly, 40, said no one would sell a policy covering the couple and their 8-year-old son. The reason, she said she was told, was her diabetes.
 Mrs. Donnelly, who lives in Manchester, Conn., is one of a small but growing number of people who are considered uninsurablebecause they have pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease. 
 For them, state-run high-risk insurance pools are supposed to be the answer. The pools, started more than 25 years ago, guarantee coverage for people considered high-risk for insurers. In many states, insurers must pay at least part of the cost to operate these programs.
The pools usually offer a couple of plans, with varying deductibles and co-payments. But for some people, the guaranteed coverage turns out to be an empty promise: the state pools are sometimes hard to join because of enrollment limits, and the premiums, though capped, may still be too expensive for some people. Worse yet, most of the pools themselves withhold coverage of pre-existing conditions for 90 days to a year.
Maybe that is why only about 153,000 people are enrolled in high-risk pools nationwide. But if, as expected, employers continue to cut back on coverage and states cut Medicaid programs, the number of potential members of these pools will continue to grow.
Thirty states have high-risk pools. But that number is deceptive. The plan in Florida has been closed to new enrollment since 1991. Louisiana and Illinois have waiting lists. And even though a state's pool may not be officially closed, "there are delays in getting enrolled," said Nancy Davenport-Ennis, the chief executive of the Patient Advocate Foundation in Newport News, Va. 
Many people never get to the application stage. That is because they can't afford the premiums, which are typically capped at 150 percent of the standard rate for an individual policy. When Mrs. Donnelly looked into the high-risk pool in Connecticut, she said, she was told that the monthly premium would be $650 to $700 -- just for her.
She and her husband, Hugh, 40, remain uninsured; their son received coverage under a state program for uninsured children. Mrs. Donnelly says she is looking for a part-time job to cover the health insurance premiums in the high-risk pool. "I don't want my husband and my son to lose everything if I end up in the hospital," she said.
Perhaps the most troubling feature of these so-called safety-net insurance plans is that they don't initially cover the very conditions for which private insurers rejected people in the first place. That was the problem faced by Sue Bolin, 48, of Gering, Neb., after her human resources consulting firm went bankrupt in December 2001. Ms. Bolin said she had an individual health insurance policy that was paid for by the company, but it ended when the company shut down.
Ms. Bolin, who has colon cancer, said she applied for Nebraska's high-risk insurance pool after being turned down by insurers. She said she was told that the state pool wouldn't cover pre-existing conditions for six months. Unable to afford the $15,000 monthly expense for chemotherapy, she stopped her treatments that December and turned to holistic alternatives. But they apparently didn't work: when she went back to her doctor in March, she said, more cancer was found. 
Ms. Bolin said she received a waiver of the pre-existing condition requirement, as allowed under certain circumstances by Nebraska law. But she said that by the time she qualified, after a grievance process, she had missed three months of chemotherapy and her six-month waiting period was almost up anyway. 
HEALTH policy experts argue that lumping sick people together into high-risk pools runs counter to traditional insurance principles of spreading the risk, in which people who are relatively healthy subsidize those with many health problems. Butsuch subsidizing would mean that healthy people would pay higher premiums, a prospect that insurers and many politicians find unpalatable. 
High-risk pools will play an important role in the Bush administration's strategy for expanding health insurance to the uninsured, said Thomas A. Scully, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Bush plan calls for a $1,000 tax credit to help individuals pay for health coverage. If that is going to work, "it's pretty critical to make sure there's an affordable product people can buy and a pooling mechanism for that to happen," he said.
In November, the federal government said $20 million would be available to help states without high-risk pools to establish them. Last month, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, announced that an additional $40 million in grants would be available in each of the next two years to help states offset losses from their high-risk pools. In 2001, states reported $401 million in such losses, according to Bruce Abbe, the vice president of public affairs for Communicating for Agriculture and the Self-Employed, which tracks high-risk insurance pools. 
Health experts say the federal grants, though helpful, are just a drop in the bucket. The same holds true, they say, for the proposed $1,000 tax credits. "It's like throwing a 10-foot rope to someone at the bottom of a 30-foot well," said Karen Pollitz, the project director at the Institute for Health Care Research and Policy at Georgetown University.
Unless high-risk pools improve their coverage and become more affordable, many people who are ill and uninsured will be left treading water on their own.

Deciding Who Hurts Most in a Slump

BYLINE:  By Steven Greenhouse 

 BODY:
THESE are some of the popular images of New York City's current economic slump. Goldman Sachs dismisses 2,900 workers in 2002 alone, while J.P. Morgan Chase lays off 2,000. Dozens of Silicon Alley start-ups go under while $300,000-a-year tech whizzes are laid off and become sales clerks at apparel shops to support their families.
 With images like these, some New Yorkers have gotten the sense that white collar workers like investment bankers and software developers have been hit hardest by the three-year downturn. But a new study disputes this notion, arguing that the slump has hurt low-level workers the most and that they account for the overwhelming majority of the city's unemployed. 
 The study by the Community Service Society, a nonprofit group that helps the poor, found that 78 percent of the city's unemployed are workers in manufacturing, construction, service, clerical and sales jobs, while 22 percent of the unemployed are white-collar workers, defined as executive, managerial, professional or technical.
"The data shows that blue-collar workers are pretty strongly over-represented among the unemployed and that white-collar workers are pretty much underrepresented," said Mark K. Levitan, a senior policy analyst at the Community Service Society and author of the study, "A Portrait of Inequality: Unemployment and Joblessness in New York City, 2002."
His study found that executives and managers make up 14.5 percent of the city's labor force but just 9 percent of the unemployed, while professional and technical workers comprise 20 percent of the work force, but just 13 percent of the unemployed. In contrast, blue-collar workers, defined as those in manufacturing, construction and repair work, represent 20 percent of the labor force but 30 percent of the unemployed. 
Some economists disagree with Mr. Levitan's argument that this should be viewed as a blue-collar recession. Irwin Kellner, who holds the Augustus B. Weller Distinguished Chair of Economics at Hofstra University, said one unusual aspect of New York's current downturn is that white-collar workers represent a far higher percentage of the unemployed than before. 
Using nationwide numbers based on employer payroll records, Dr. Kellner said managerial and professional specialty workers represent 17 percent of the unemployed. That is nearly double the 9.5 percent level during the 1990-91 recession and up from 13 percent three years ago, before the current slump started.
"I have the definite impression that this is more of a white-collar slump than a blue-collar slump," said Dr. Kellner, who is also chief economist for North Fork Bank. "It's true that manufacturers have cut their payroll 39 months in a row, but with the three-and-a-half-year bear market, there have been massive layoffs in New York of brokers, bankers, analysts and other people associated with Wall Street. And of course there's been the dot.com implosion, which has hit Silicon Alley."
Some advocates have seized on the notion of a blue-collar slump with the aim of persuading policymakers to give more aid to the lower strata of city workers. But other advocates have embraced the idea of a white-collar slump, believing that politicians will grow more concerned knowing that affluent workers have been hit hard.
James P. Brown, who analyzes the city's economy for the State Department of Labor, argued that the important issue was not whether the downturn was blue-collar or white-collar, but that the city was in a protracted slump. 
"We have unemployment rising," he said. "We have a lot of layoffs in the financial sector, white-collar and clerical support. That leads to less office buildings being built, which hits blue-collar workers because there is less construction going on."
He noted that New York City has lost 200,000 jobs over the past two years, with the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 fueling layoffs at hotels, restaurants. and airlines, with white-collar pilots and blue-collar mechanics and baggage handlers losing their jobs. Since the spring of 2001, the city's jobless rate has jumped to 8.5 percent from 5.3 percent. 
James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group, said Mr. Levitan and Dr. Kellner are both right.
"It's both a white-collar recession and a blue-collar recession," he said. "It's a severe recession that's touched virtually every occupational and industrial sector."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Predicting the Path of a Submarine (or a Mutual Fund)

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT

 BODY:
RESEARCHERS at Yale appear to have solved a big problem for mutual fund rating systems. In doing so, the research team may have also found a better way to pick winning stock funds.
 The rating problem has to do with the classification and evaluation of funds that don't stick to a single investment style. The challenge is significant because most funds change styles at one time or another. Say a fund's primary investments, at some point in the past, shifted to small-capitalization from large-capitalization stocks. What is the best way to classify what its investment approach has been? 
 Virtually all major rating systems have simply placed funds into whatever peer group seems most similar, based on the most recent report of the fund's investment holdings. The systems then make statistical comparisons that assume that the funds have never deviated from that category. A fund in the small-cap category, for example, is assumed to have invested only in small-cap stocks even if, in the past, it has often held a big portion of large-cap shares. 
At least since the mid 1980's, researchers have known that these classification difficulties lead to skewed judgments about the performance of funds that change their investment styles.
The Yale researchers -- Matthew Spiegel, a finance professor, Harry Mamaysky, an assistant professor of finance, and Hong Zhang, a doctoral fellow in finance -- believe that they have solved this problem. Their work, which has circulated for several months in academic circles as a working paper, is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=389740.
The researchers relied on a statistical tool that has primarily been used in navigation and rarely in investing. It is known as the Kalman Filter, named for Rudolf E. Kalman, an emeritus professor of engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Mr. Kalman introduced his technique in 1960 in research supported by a grant from the United States Air Force, and the technique has been used to track moving targets like submarines.
Imagine trying to predict the direction of a submarine, and how long it will go in that direction, based only on the location and time of past sightings. The Kalman Filter translates the information in those sightings into a single forecast and updates that forecast when the submarine is seen again.
In some ways, services that rate mutual funds face similar problems. They do not know where a mutual fund manager is taking his portfolio at any given moment. But they do know how the portfolio is performing. The Kalman Filter uses a fund's raw returns to continuously update a forecast of the fund's future performance.
The filter does that by constructing a unique benchmark for each fund, based on the returns of the fund and those of a series of conventional stock market style indexes. The filter adjusts the fund's individual benchmark based on a probability analysis of the shifts that the fund is making among various investing styles. The researchers rate a fund highly only if it has significantly outperformed its own benchmark.
TO test their application of the filter, the researchers calculated the return of a portfolio that invested each month in the five funds that outperformed their respective benchmarks by the greatest amount over the previous five years. (That means the portfolio does not necessarily own the five funds with the largest absolute returns.) From January 1993 through 2002, the portfolio beat the Wilshire 5000 by 5.9 percentage points a year, on average. The portfolio also outperformed all other rating systems studied by the researchers.
Professor Spiegel is confident enough in this system to have a Web site that updates his list of the highest-rated funds (http://som.yale.edu/spiegel/dynamic/FundsRankedbyKalmanAlphaR2Sort.html). The professor, by the way, earns nothing from the site. As of March 31, the five funds that had outperformed their benchmarks by the largest amounts over the previous five years were IMS Capital Value, T. Rowe Price Health Sciences, Needham Growth, Wasatch Ultra Growth, and Smith Barney Aggressive Growth.

 Re "More 'Can I Help You?' Jobs Migrate From U.S. to India" and "American Official Praises India's Move to Defuse Tensions With Pakistan" (news articles, May 11): 
 You report that India is attracting American jobs, and that India is moving to ease tensions with Pakistan. Could these events be related? The more American jobs move to India, the more India has to lose from an escalation of tensions. Also, higher employment means that people can find fulfillment in work rather than in pursuit of nationalist ambitions.
The United States should seek to employ more people in troubled countries, as a way of stabilizing these countries and giving their governments a stake in stability. Perhaps we could offer free English classes to increase the number of employable people. Wouldn't it be great to read someday that North Korea is reducing tensions in order to attract American jobs?

A Hat That's Way Cool. Unless, Of Course, It's Not.

BYLINE:  By JULIA CHAPLIN 

 BODY:
NATHAN ELLIS, a 26-year-old publicist with spikey black hair, remembers the exact moment trucker hats really started to annoy him. It was at a party in a Lower East Side bar in February given by the owners of Colette, a Paris boutique. 
 "I scanned the room and I could count 30 or 40 hipsters wearing trucker hats," Mr. Ellis said. "You could have closed your eyes and thrown a stick and hit a dozen foam caps at any given point of the night." 
 Mr. Ellis, who grew up in Greenville, N.C., where there are real truckers who wear tall foam-billed caps advertising chewing tobacco and the like, never appreciated city dwellers sporting them as some kind of winking joke. "Now every out-of-work male model is wearing one with their faded, ripped-up jeans," he complained. "The whole thing has gotten totally absurd." 
Simon Navarre, 21, hung up his camouflage-patterned trucker hat for good last summer. On a recent Saturday night at the Pussycat Lounge, a strip club near Wall Street, he stood by the bar wearing a striped engineer's cap instead. When a group of young Japanese men walked in wearing trucker hats, he shook his head sadly. "Dude, those hats are so six months ago," said Mr. Navarre, who had just finished his shift as a chef at the Lovely Day restaurant. "Every kid with Nikes and a trust fund is wearing them. It's played out." 
R.I.P. the trucker hat, a fashion statement that traveled from downtown to the mall so swiftly it is still below the radar of most mainstream fashion publications, even as some hipsters themselves seem unaware it has been declared over. 
Like the flannel logger's shirt that epitomized the grunge look of the early 1990's, the trucker hat is a ubiquitous accessory for slumming 20-somethings who favor sideburns, drink canned beer and listen to gritty sounding rock bands like the White Stripes and the Strokes.
The hats are wardrobe staples of truck drivers and farmers in the Corn Belt, who often use them as cheap, disposable sun shades. Referred to as trucker hats or mesh hats, they are bigger, uglier versions of baseball caps. Instead of fabric, they are made with a plastic mesh back and a large, nearly vertical foam front that is a perfect marquee to advertise farm machinery, auto parts and beer. 
Young people in enclaves like Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles adopted the trucker hat two or three years ago as a sartorial response to the expensive, logo-covered clothing of the bull-market years. The hats are economical, usually costing under $10, and are readily available at thrift shops or on eBay. The more exaggerated and ridiculous the silhouette, the greater the irony quotient. 
"The trucker hat has the conflation of high and low," said Andrew Coulter Enright, 23, the author of "How to Be Fashionable or Consume Like Me," who lives in Williamsburg. "It fits into a lot of these postmodern ironic things. It's like, 'I'm either a black skateboarder who lives in New York City, or I'm a waifish white fashion stylist," who no one would expect to be wearing something that a Midwestern trucker would wear.
As the look became popular, the way the trucker hat was positioned on one's head became a code in itself. Although not everyone agrees on the details, according to one street authority, a hat that is cocked up to the right means the wearer is from Williamsburg, one pulled down and to the right signifies a gay man from Chelsea, pushed up and to the left represents the Lower East Side, and down to the left is for arty areas of Queens like Long Island City. (Women from all areas generally wear their hats pulled down flirtatiously over one eye.) 
This practice alone spawned its own backlash on the streets and in Internet chat rooms. On the Web site Craigslist, an online community, one user who was identified only as "a longtime resident of the Northside" (an area of Williamsburg), posted this complaint last week: "The sideways-trucker-cap deal is the most affected, lemminglike bit of hilarity I have seen yet here in hipster ground zero. C'mon people, nothing shouts 'trying too hard' louder than these hats, especially when they're sideways."
Perhaps the most grievous development for hipsters has come in the last few months, when the trucker hat has trickled out from Brooklyn's second-hand stores to the malls. Now, trucker hats with campy sayings like "Washington Is for Lovers" can be found at large retail chains like Diesel, Hot Topic and Urban Outfitters. The first trucker-hat shipment arrived at Barneys New York three weeks ago; the hats cost $35 apiece and display images of vintage Mexican playing cards. And the Gap plans to start carrying the hats next winter. 
Even the caliber of celebrities who wear trucker hats has gone mainstream. Two years ago, the hats' most visible proponents were stars with street credibility like Pharrell Williams, of the hit-making music production team the Neptunes, and Johnny Knoxville, the star of "Jackass," the movie and MTV show.
Now the hats have been scooped up by entertainers who seem to be seeking a rougher image. The actor Ashton Kutcher, on his MTV show "Punk'd," typically wears up to five different trucker hats per episode. (He spends a good portion of the time sitting in front of the camera shifting the hats on his head, which has been known to send purists into a rage.) 
The former teenage idol Justin Timberlake appears to have scraped the gel out of his hair in favor of a trucker hat, and Christina Aguilera wears hers with a do-rag underneath to look more hip-hop.
"We've cut back to just one style," said Sarah Bronilla, a buyer for Vice, a trend-setting boutique in lower Manhattan. "We used to carry 10," she said on a recent afternoon at the store. She sneered at the store's single trucker hat, which had been demoted to a low shelf behind the cash register. "When tourists from Virginia are buying them at flea markets on Broadway, it's not really our thing anymore," she said.
To separate themselves from the masses wearing trucker hats with sayings like "Trucker No. 1," many early subscribers to the trend have begun customizing their hats. A whole cottage industry has sprung up of couture trucker-hat designers who are selling one-of-a-kind hats embellished with ribbon, airbrushing and needlepoint. 
"The foam fronts remind me of billboards or walls and are really fun to decorate," said Joel Dugan, 25, an artist, uses spray paint to make one-of-a-kind trucker hats that he sells for $35 at Isa, a boutique in Williamsburg.
Jamie Rosenthal, 25, a designer and stylist who has worked for Joan Jett, started embellishing her trucker hats last summer because, she said, she wouldn't be caught dead wearing "a lame one with a Schlitz beer logo."
Jennifer Leong, 27, an art director at MTV, combs craft and fabric stores around Times Square on her lunch hour for her hats, which she sells under the label Dame. "The mesh is perfect for cross-stitching," said Ms. Leong, who adorns her hats with colored thread, patches and studs. "I like the contrast between the homemade crafty grandma feel and a raw street style." 
At Bar 13 in Greenwich Village on a recent Thursday night, during an after party for the East Village band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, which had performed at Irving Plaza, the group's guitarist, Nick Zinner, was wearing a black trucker hat that read "Sturgis 2002" with a bald eagle on it. He had it pushed way up on the top of his head and cocked boldly to the side. The look screamed "dork," and that was exactly the point.
"I never would have worn a trucker hat before because they were too cool," said Mr. Zinner, who bought his two weeks ago while on tour in South Dakota. "But now that they are so uncool it's cool to wear them."

HEADLINE: College Students' Debt 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "College Graduates Lower Sights in Today's Stagnant Job Market" (front page, May 14), you reported that recent graduates of the University of North Carolina are looking at the worst hiring slump in 20 years. 
Poor job prospects will exacerbate another problem for this spring's graduates: historically high levels of college loans. Two-thirds of graduating seniors have taken on student loans with average debt totaling just under $20,000. 
 Over the past two decades, college costs have more than doubled while grant aid per full-time student increased by slightly less than two-thirds. Students have made this up by borrowing more, so that today's graduates begin their careers burdened with a level of debt unknown to previous generations. A weak labor market will only increase the time it takes for these young graduates to pay off their college loans and begin saving for life's other major events like a home or a family.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: David O. Nicholas; 
Nicholas II Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
MIDCAPITALIZATION companies that are market leaders in light manufacturing, technology and business service sectors are the current focus of David O. Nicholas, the manager of the $416 million Nicholas II fund. 
 Mr. Nicholas says slow but steady improvement in the economy is already under way, and he believes that these companies are most likely to produce big investment returns because they are "sensitive to the economy." 
 The fund lost 6.5 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, but it still places among the top 12 percent of all funds that buy midcap growth stocks. That category lost 16.8 percent a year, on average, versus an annualized decline of 12 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. 
The fund lost 11.4 percent in the last 12 months, compared with losses of 16.5 percent for its group and 11.7 percent for the index, Morningstar said.
Mr. Nicholas, 42, is the president and chief investment officer of the Nicholas Company in Milwaukee, the fund's adviser. The company was founded in 1967 by his father, Albert O. Nicholas, who is its chairman and chief executive. The son also manages the $110 million Nicholas Limited Edition fund, which buys small-cap growth stocks.
He calls himself a "growth at a reasonable price" investor. "We look for quality companies with consistent long-term earnings, good brand names or a well-managed enduring franchise," he said.
Specifically, he seeks companies that generate solid cash flow and show earnings growth of 15 to 20 percent a year, whether the economy is weak or strong.
He uses no initial computer screening to pick the 70 to 90 stocks in the Nicholas II fund among companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion to $10 billion.
Instead, he and five sector analysts find purchase ideas by attending industry and investment conferences and by talking to management of companies, asking which competitors, managers or suppliers they respect.
Management is an important part of successful midcap companies, Mr. Nicholas said. "These are the people who are driving the bus," he said. "They have to know how to run the company in a financially sound manner, motivate employees and grow the business at the right speed."
He also likes to see high operating margins, and figures that the portfolio companies' percentage profit margins range from the high teens to low 20's, versus about 10 percent for his customized benchmark index, which combines the S.& P. 500 and Russell 2000 indexes.
Ideally, he likes to buy companies when they are out of favor because of what he considers short-term difficulties.
He reviews shares for sale when they sell for more than 30 times projected 12-month earnings, or when a company's fundamentals start to deteriorate.
Mr. Nicholas began buying shares of Affiliated Computer Services in December 2002 and has paid $46.97, on average, for the entire position; the stock now trades at $51.50. Affiliated, based in Dallas, provides customer order processing, drug benefits management and other services for corporations and government agencies. 
"There's been concern recently about state budgets and competitive price issues within their markets," causing the stock price to fall from its level of more than $55 in June 2002, Mr. Nicholas said. But he said that investors' fears were overblown. Besides being an industry leader, Affiliated "is the type of company that can produce good earnings growth in just about any type of economic environment." he said. 
LAST July, Mr. Nicholas began buying shares of the Cintas Corporation, a Cincinnati company that provides work clothes and uniforms for the airline and other industries. He paid $41.16, on average; the stock now trades at $36.80.
"Because of the slowing economy and falling employment, their business slowed a bit and that knocked down the price of their stock," Mr. Nicholas said, "allowing us to buy what I consider a great franchise at a good price." The stock traded at more than $56 in May 2002. 
Mr. Nicholas also likes CDW Computer Centers, a company in Vernon Hills, Ill., that markets computers and related products to businesses and individuals through catalogs and the Internet.
"We think the time is right for this stock because the tech industry is still in a little slump," he said, "but we think earnings will pick up as the economy picks up."
CDW is a market leader in its industry niche, he said, and he expects earnings growth averaging 18 percent annually over the next three to five years. The fund began buying shares in the July 2002, paying $46.97, on average, for the entire position. The stock closed on Friday at $40.06.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Stocks AreLooking Up. Bonds Look Askance.

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
HAPPY days are here again. Or at least they must be close.
 So says the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which has risen 11 percent since March. Certain that an economic rebound is imminent, investors are seizing on shares. 
 In bondland, however, the view is darker. There, rising bond prices -- and the corresponding collapse in yields -- signal an economy that is stuck in the mud and unlikely to extract itself anytime soon. 
Of course, the stock market is famous for spotting sunshine well before storm clouds disperse. But as oracles go, the bond market has the superior record, alas. Stocks often run on vapors, as they seem to be doing now. 
Some money managers say the current market mood is reminiscent of autumn 1999. Internet stocks are racing, the Nasdaq composite is on a tear, and short-sellers are squawking. Nonchalance over stretched valuations, especially in the technology sector, also feels depressingly familiar. 
"I just don't buy it," said Eric P. Von der Porten, portfolio manager at Leeward Investments in San Carlos, Calif. "There is little if any economic activity that would seem to justify the run-up." 
One propellant for stock prices has been the steep decline in interest rates. Lower rates are good for stocks largely because they reduce corporate costs. They can also drive stock prices higher as investors exit low-yielding bonds for better returns in equities. Since last May, the yield on Treasuries maturing in five years has plummeted more than two percentage points.
But sharply lower rates, at least this time around, have negative implications for stocks in that they signify a sickly economy.
"We have been looking for a postwar acceleration, a bounce in the economy, some pickup in spirits," said Jan Hatzius, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "But I'm not seeing very much of that." He puts the current economic growth rate at around zero and estimates that for the full year of 2003, gross domestic product will grow just 2.1 percent. 
Things won't get much better in 2004, either, Mr. Hatzius said. He reckons that the economy will expand by 2.5 percent. 
If he is correct, that would mean four consecutive years of annual growth below 3 percent. The last time this streak occurred, he noted, was in the early 1930's. 
During those grim years, the economy was shrinking; it is not now. But growth of less than 3 percent cannot produce the kind of earnings sizzle that stock investors want.
Mr. Hatzius said it was taking longer to return to more typical economic growth rates because the economy is still working through the excesses of the 1990's spending and stock market booms. The process is only half over, he said.
The economy will barely inch along partly because corporations and individuals are still getting their financial houses in order. Too much debt was amassed by both, and while companies have been paring, individuals have not. The jobs picture is troubling, too. Mr. Hatzius said nonfarm payrolls might contract in May. That would be the fourth monthly decline in a row, a sequence that has not occurred outside a recession since World War II.
Is it any surprise that personal bankruptcies hit a record 1.57 million in the year that ended March 31? According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, these filings are up 25 percent since 2000. In contrast, the number of businesses filing bankruptcy petitions fell 5.8 percent this year.
"People are under pressure to cut their spending relative to income," Mr. Hatzius said. "That doesn't mean spending has to fall, but it puts downward pressure on demand growth." With demand slack, the bounce in the stock market's step may fall flat.

InternationalFunds Confront the Time-Zone Gap

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
THE Vanguard Group is taking increasingly aggressive measures to yank from the table what some shareholders in their international funds have taken to be a free lunch.
 Vanguard, the nation's second-largest fund manager, told investors in nine international equity funds last month that they would be charged a 2 percent fee for cashing in shares held for less than four months. The policy is intended to halt what the industry calls "gaming," a form of arbitrage in which investors trade in and out of funds to try to profit from perceived discrepancies in their prices and the values of underlying portfolios. 
 Overseas markets are most prone to these anomalies because of the way fund values are calculated -- and because overseas trading hours seldom correspond to those of American markets.
Every night, mutual funds must determine their net asset values -- how much each share is worth -- to set prices for buyers and sellers. This is straightforward for funds that invest domestically: just take the closing price of the stocks and do the arithmetic. 
But the situation is trickier for funds that specialize in foreign stocks. What if Wall Street starts the day on a strong note, then stages a sharp reversal -- long after many foreign markets have closed?
The United States, as the world's dominant economy and stock market, tends to set the tone for markets worldwide. A late plunge is very likely to depress foreign markets when they open the next morning. If a foreign fund's value is based on the closing prices of the portfolio's holdings, which had yet to feel the brunt of the American decline, then sellers of the fund will be paid too much. The same process works in reverse. If American markets rise sharply late in the day, foreign-fund buyers can get in at bargain prices. 
Gaming may seem an arcane way to make money, but many investors have taken it up because there is plenty to be made. Eric Zitzewitz, an assistant professor of strategic management at Stanford's graduate business school, estimates that fund arbitragers net $4 billion a year. That includes gains from trading funds in all asset classes, not just international equities.
Brian Portnoy, senior fund analyst at Morningstar, said: "It's a major problem. So many investors have tried it, and tried it successfully. What a fair amount of investors have done, especially through 401(k) plans and other sorts of accounts, is trade in and out when they have a strong hunch that one-day returns are going to be positive." Participants in employer-sponsored direct contribution plans are among the most frequent gamers, Mr. Portnoy said, because they often have more freedom than individual investors to switch portfolios.
FUND managers are eager to discourage arbitraging, of course, because the free lunch is not free at all. It is just paid for by someone else: the loyal shareholders who remain in the funds. In fact, they are stuck with the bill not once, but twice.
Any money disbursed through gaming must come from a fund's assets. Beyond that, managers must take costly measures to undo the damage caused by the gamers. To meet redemptions, they may have to go into the markets the next day and sell shares, potentially at much lower prices. In some countries, most notably in emerging markets, transaction expenses can be high and stocks may trade so infrequently and in such small quantities that good prices are hard to get. Conversely, a flood of buy orders can leave a manager scouring overseas markets for stock to buy in a hurry -- and at premium prices. And for trades in both directions, there are processing costs to cover.
Gaming is most troublesome and frustrating for managers of Asia funds, said Gus Sauter, Vanguard's chief investment officer. Asian markets are among the most difficult in which to trade, and their location in the most inconvenient time zones for Americans makes these markets the most intense focus for arbitragers.
"The ones most targeted would be in the Pacific Rim -- Japan or the Asian tigers," Mr. Sauter said. "If something is going on in the U.S. that causes the market to move a lot, the Asian markets are closed the entire time and have not adjusted at all. The markets are closed when the cash flow is coming into the fund, so already you're a day behind. It's a difficult process getting exposure from all the Asian markets you need; a good portion of those stocks are very illiquid and have high transaction costs. Worst of all, they're closed."
The nine Vanguard funds that are affected by the fees, which will be applied on sales of shares bought after June 26, are International Growth, International Value, International Explorer, Total International Stock Index, European Stock Index, Pacific Stock Index, Developed Markets Index, Institutional Developed Markets Index and Emerging Markets Stock Index.
Vanguard has an arsenal of antigaming weapons. Early last year, it limited shareholders to two telephone or online switches out of its international funds within 12 months and barred fund trades less than one and a half hours before the Wall Street close.
Vanguard also uses so-called fair-pricing techniques to try to ensure that discrepancies do not occur in the first place. These involve taking into account the values of various substitutes for foreign stocks whose prices continuously update through the American session, like stock-index futures, exchange-traded funds and American depository receipts, which are bundles of foreign shares traded in the United States.
As a result, arbitragers stand little chance of success, Mr. Sauter said. The redemption fees and trading restrictions have been imposed to accomplish through microeconomics what could not be achieved through logic. "That was the odd thing," Mr. Sauter said about the gaming. "There was no advantage and this was still occurring. We wanted to stop this behavior and feel very confident that this will stop it."
The use of fair-value pricing, redemption fees or both has become the rule rather than the exception for international funds.
"We have had short-term trading fees on our international funds for many years," said Scott Beyerl, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments, the largest American fund manager. "For example, the fee on Fidelity Emerging Markets fund dates back to 1990. Currently, all of our international funds have them."
He added, "Short-term trading of our international funds has not been a serious issue for us recently, and we believe that these fees and our continued attention to this matter are a large part of the reason why." Mr. Beyerl said Fidelity uses fair-value pricing techniques when conditions warrant.
T. Rowe Price also uses both methods to control arbitrage. "We have an active fair-value pricing process that monitors price movements in U.S. markets and their effect on foreign markets," said Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for the company. "As a result of this process, we have fair-valued fund securities held in a number of foreign markets on many occasions over the last several years." The price of its Japan fund can vary by more than 3 percent depending on whether a fair-value calculation or the conventional procedure is used.
T. Rowe Price also imposes 2 percent redemption fees on four international funds for sales within one year of purchase and a 1 percent fee for sales within six months of its International Equity Index fund. In addition, Mr. Norwitz said, "we actively monitor excessive traders and have barred persons identified as excessive traders from further purchases of T. Rowe Price funds."
BARCLAYS GLOBAL INVESTORS, which manages $184 billion in foreign stocks for American investors, has also had to restrict gaming by participants in employer-sponsored savings plans.
"There are a few plans that we've worked with to eliminate this gaming problem," said Stephen Rogers, the firm's managing director for American institutional investing. "When we see this activity twice -- large movements of assets in a handful of funds correlated with certain sets of market activity -- we write a letter and say we need to resolve this problem."
Barclays declined to name any of the companies involved. Mr. Portnoy of Morningstar also declined to name companies whose plans have caused difficulties for fund managers.
When Barclays has asked plan sponsors to restrict their participants' trading activity, they have complied each time. Were the problem to persist, Mr. Rogers said, Barclays would be prepared to resign an account.
The increasing attention to gaming, he added, is both a boon and a hindrance. "The more press it gets, the more helpful it is to have plan sponsors study activity and take action when it occurs," he said, "but it also tells people how to do it."

HEADLINE: URBAN TACTICS; 
The People's Architect

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
TO be responsible for the design of the 2,702 buildings of the New York City Housing Authority is a little like putting bow ties on a flock of ugly chickens. But that is David J. Burney's job. As the agency's director of design and capital improvement, he spends about $500 million a year to maintain and improve the city's public housing stock. 
 Mr. Burney has the radical idea that public housing needn't look grim and may even be pleasing. This notion springs from his conviction that people want more from their housing than functionality. They want interesting shapes, good materials, artful details. 
 "There is a popular perception that most public housing is banal and inadequately designed," said the slight, mild-mannered Mr. Burney the other day while taking a visitor on a tour of several developments that he and his staff of 280 have had built or refurbished. "It's an opinion I share myself. But there are still things you can do about it." 
That is not history's most stirring call to arms. But design professionals say that Mr. Burney, a 55-year-old architect who worked on such projects as Lincoln Center's Rose Building before joining the agency 12 years ago, has substantially upgraded public housing and, in so doing, improved the lives of its 418,000 residents. 
One such resident is Mona Lisa Lopez, a 42-year-old mother of three who lives in the Dome Site, a development on West 84th Street. "Every day, I have the good fortune of waking up and looking out the window at a garden," Ms. Lopez said. "I can go outside and sip a cup of tea." 
In announcing the annual Sloan Public Service awards, which went to Mr. Burney and five other city workers, Barbara J. Cohn, vice president of the Fund for the City of New York, said: "He has changed many places from an eyesoreto something that residents can be proud of. It's a major transformation in public housing." In particular, the fund praised him for taking residents' viewpoints seriously. For example, in 1998 he dispatched students from the Pratt Institute to see how families used their apartments in the Marlboro Houses in Gravesend, Brooklyn. The students concluded that the residents needed larger kitchens, more storage and a bedroom that could double as a study for children. Those modest changes, Mr. Burney said, have been made at Marlboro and other developments. 
One of the first stops on the tour was Lower East Side III, a 56-apartment complex on East Ninth Street near Avenue C. As Mr. Burney approached the townhouse-style buildings, he pointed down Ninth Street toward Jacob Riis Houses. 
"That's your popular conception of public housing," he said. Riis Houses, built in 1949, are 12-story plain brick buildings that hold 1,800 apartments and are spread over a 12-acre superblock between Avenue D and the East River Drive. Critics see soulless geometry in such places and say the lack of stores and through streets isolates them. 
"All those towers that look like cookie cutters, they just stamped them out and got on with it," Mr. Burney said. He quickly added that the design, though flawed, was an understandable attempt to bring "open air and children running in sunshine" to the overcrowded Lower East Side. 
Lower East Side III, which cost $7.3 million and opened in 1996, takes a sharply different approach. The long row of four-story brick walk-ups blends with the area. 
"Our design goal is that you can never find us," Mr. Burney said. Another is to keep out intruders. Toward that end, the development has no elevators or even a main doorway; each apartment has its own entrance. The common area, open only to residents, is a lush rear courtyard of grass, trees and bench-lined pathways. 
"This is the future," Mr. Burney said. 
Around the corner at Avenue C and East Eighth Street sits a new station for the housing police. The building, which opened last July, looks more like a downtown cinema than a standard New York station house; its facade is a 30-foot wall of glass that pours light into a lobby of terrazzo floors and two curved steel reception desks.
Mr. Burney originally wanted the street level of the building's long south wall to be lined with windows. One of his counterintuitive principles is that transparency breeds security. When a development is plagued by crime, he says, it is time to remove the iron window grates and replace the reinforced steel doors with glass doors. "The people inside need to see what's going on in the street, and the people outside need to see what's going on inside," he said. But with the station house, he explained, the police "were afraid people were going to shoot them." So the wall now holds a series of cases in which 18th-century perfume bottles and other artifacts found buried at the site are displayed behind laminated glass. Schoolchildren come by to view this miniature museum. 
The next stop was the Williamsburg Community Center at 195 Graham Avenue in Brooklyn, a $6 million project scheduled to open this summer. With its brushed steel, translucent walls and bird's-eye maple cabinets, the center looks like the sleek gym one might find at a wealthy college. Instead, it will serve the 3,000 residents of Williamsburg Houses across the street, a development dating from 1938 that Mr. Burney recently renovated, taking care to be faithful to original modernist touches like the Prussian blue of the buildings' exterior panels. 
THEN it was on to Morrisania Air Rights Houses, on Park Avenue at East 169th Street in the Bronx. This long row of high-rises sit directly over train tracks. Slanting concrete buttresses flank the entrance to each building and, Mr. Burney said, trespassers long used the buttresses to hide as they broke locks and smashed windows. His solution: extend each lobby out past the buttresses to the sidewalk and build a large, glass-walled pavilion next to each entrance. Volunteers and security guards now sit in the pavilions, and crime at the development has dropped. 
The lobbies' inside walls are inlaid with colorful tiles painted by children who live in the buildings. Mr. Burney said such a domestic touch, almost voodoolike in its power to ward off vandalism, "makes people much more invested in the place." Similarly, the buildings' outer walls will soon be lighted at night -- a flourish meant to confer some Manhattan-style grandeur. 
Mr. Burney, who was born in Liverpool, England, came to New York in 1982 and lives with his architect wife and two children in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, is relentlessly upbeat. A typical Burney principle: Better public housing is achieved less by "a series of bright ideas than a conspiracy of small things." But then he came across bullet holes riddling the thick laminated-glass doors at the Jackson Houses. "You can tell they're from bullets by the concentration of shattering at the point," he said. 
Is he ever discouraged by such abuse? "It's very depressing," he answered. But he forges on -- one of the projects on his drawing board is a redo of the inner courtyard at the First Houses, a development at Avenue A and East Third Street. And he also reminds himself that at least he's not working for rich people. "One of the satisfactions of my job is that when something works, the level of appreciation by users is very high," he said. "When you do high-end work, nobody is ever happy." 
Another satisfaction is being in New York. "I'm a city guy," he said as he drove patiently through Midtown traffic. "I've lived my whole life in cities. I get nervous if there isn't a streetlight."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH STREET SEAPORT; 
After 27 Years, With Money Tight, A Tall-Masted Classic Must Go

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
For 27 years, the barque Peking has bobbed at Pier 16, her masts as tall as an 18-story building and her black hull as long as a football field. Before the South Street Seaport Museum bought and towed her here, the Royal Navy in England used her to teach young men how to sail. Long before that, this merchant vessel sailed the world, carrying grain and fertilizer between Chile and Western Europe. 
 But now the ship, part of the final generation of sailing ships built for world trade, is up for sale. Asking price: $11 million. 
 Peter Neill, the president of the museum, said it was struggling to pay for the ship's $750,000 yearly upkeep. A sale to another maritime museum would free up money and docking space for the museum's six other vessels. One of them, the Wavertree, has riggings similar to the Peking's but it has closer ties to the city. Built in 1885, the Wavertree once sailed to New York and can still sail. The Peking, built in 1911, never brought goods into New York Harbor and can no longer sail. 
Right now, tours and educational programs are held aboard the Peking, but Mr. Neill said such programs could be easily transferred to the other ships the museum owns. 
So far, the only nibble has come from a German preservation group called the Stiftung Hamburg Maritim, which is located near the shipyard where the Peking was first launched. A group from the German museum toured the museum six months ago, but Mr. Neill said a sale was not imminent.
"It is a perfect repatriation of a cultural artifact to return the ship to her home port and to a group that seems perfectly qualified to repair and show her," Mr. Neill said. "But economic times are as tough in Germany as here, so we don't yet have a deal" 
News that the Peking is on the market has saddened residents, said Paul Goldstein, district manager of Community Board 1, which held a committee meeting last Tuesday to discuss the ship's fate. 
"It's a very visible symbol of the South Street Seaport, and so it's a sad situation of survival," Mr. Goldstein said. "We'd like to see the museum succeed, though, and maybe it just has one too many ships."
The Peking's cross-hatching of masts and foot ropes is exactly what lured Helen Blumberg to the seaport last week. She and her family were visiting from Boulder, Colo., and she was delighted to see a seeming wharf of ships. "Right now, with all these ships, it feels like a real seaport," she said, after touring the Peking. "I had never been on a big ship before, and now I wish I had spent more time aboard."
"Yeah, me too," said Andre Sala, who lives in the Financial District and is a friend of the Blumbergs. "I don't think people come to this seaport to eat pizza and shop. They come to see ships." KELLY CROW

HEADLINE: Life: The Cost-Benefit Analysis 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
HOW could the Environmental Protection Agency decide that the life of someone over 70 years old is worth $1.4 million less than the life of a younger person?
 Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. administrator, preferred to duck the question, when asked why a cost-benefit analysis of a clean-air proposal valued the life of a person under 70 at $3.7 million, and a person over 70 at $2.3 million. Instead, after protests this spring over the "senior death discount," Ms. Whitman disavowed the numbers and said that henceforth all Americans would be equal in her eyes. 
 That was an understandable political response, but it dismayed the researchers who divine the precise monetary value of every stage of life. Their number-crunching may seem the modern equivalent of determining how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but they are far more conscientious than any medieval philosopher. They have spent careers agonizing over every dollar in the estimates buried in the appendices of federal reports. Now, because of political pressure, the E.P.A. is trying to pretend their work doesn't exist.
Give them their due. Let them explain how much your life is worth to you.
Analysts at the E.P.A. once made the uncontroversial assumption that every life saved by cleaning up the environment was equal. To compute the value of each life saved, they relied mainly on studies of how much extra money workers demand for risking their lives in dangerous occupations like mining or fishing.
The methodology is complex, but it goes something like this:
Suppose that a worker digging in a coal mine earns $6,000 more than a comparable worker above ground, and that the miner has a one-in-a-thousand greater risk of dying on the job. So for every worker killed underground, the mining industry pays an extra $6,000 apiece to 1,000 workers, which adds up to $6 million. Economists call this total the "value of a statistical life" (even though they know that none of those workers would really agree to die in exchange for $6 million). 
That happens to be close to the actual figure -- $6,120,000, to be exact -- that the E.P.A. valued each life that could be saved through the Bush administration's "Clear Skies" proposal to reduce pollution from power plants. But the E.P.A. analysts also included an alternative estimate, derived from an international assortment of scientific studies asking consumers how much they would pay for safety. 
These consumers, who were given a primer in the statistics of risk, were polled on how much they would pay for an improved air bag, for example, or on whether they would choose a bargain-priced bus or a pricier one with a better safety record. By figuring out precisely how much money consumers would pay for a product that would save 1 of every 1,000 lives, researchers could calculate the value of that statistical life -- on average about $3 million. This is only half the value of the E.P.A.'s traditional calculation using workers' wages. 
Another twist lowered the benefits of cleaner air even further. Instead of assuming that all the lives saved were typical middle-aged workers who valued their lives the same, the E.P.A. analysts decided to differentiate by age. After all, surveys in Britain and Canada had shown that people older than 70 were significantly less willing to pay for risk reduction than younger people were. Citing these results, the E.P.A. put a lower value on the lives of the older people. 
Environmentalists, who are opposed to any calculation that lowers the value of cleaner air, seized on the "senior death discount" and orchestrated protests by the elderly. E.P.A. officials vowed to adhere to the every-life-is-equal estimate, and said the alternative estimate was done only at the behest of the Office of Management and Budget and its regulations chief, John D. Graham, the Harvard risk expert who has been subjecting federal agencies to rigorous cost-benefit analysis. 
Dr. Graham, while insisting on the merit of both kinds of estimates, also rejected the $1.4 million elderly discount, but on narrower technical grounds. He said it was now out of date as a result of a new study showing that elderly Americans, unlike the elderly Britons and Canadians in earlier studies, are not significantly more tight-fisted than younger people when it comes to paying for safety. 
But even if elderly Americans put a high value on their lives, does this mean that ethical policy makers should value their lives equally? Not necessarily, said the new study's co-author, Alan J. Krupnick, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington research group. 
"E.P.A. may want to reconsider the techniques they used to get the $1.4 million figure, but they shouldn't throw out the differential just because it upsets people," Dr. Krupnick said. "This is a teachable moment to move further ahead the debate about how we value programs that save lives. If you ask people on the street whether they prefer a policy that saves the life of a young person or an elderly person, I think most people, including the elderly, would save the young person."
But not if that person is a politician in Washington.

. . . and Continued Wariness

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer

 BODY:
Global fund managers polled by Merrill Lynch this month said they were encouraged by the earnings of American corporations in the first quarter but remained wary about the prospects for the world economy.
 The managers raised their forecast of average earnings growth per share over the next 12 months to 8 percent from 6 percent, their estimate in surveys in March and April. 
 But most fund managers said growth in global corporate earnings would probably depend more on cost-cutting than on increasing revenue.
The managers rated the United States as the country with the most solid corporate earnings and with the best prospects for earnings growth, displacing Britain.
The survey of 300 managers, who handle $732 billion in investments among them, was conducted from May 1 to 8.

Cars Are First Choice For Memorial Day Travel

BYLINE:  Compiled by Vivian Marino

 BODY:
The weak economy and the lingering effects of the war in Iraq won't keep Americans from traveling this Memorial Day weekend.
 Based on a nationwide survey of 1,300 adults, the leisure travel organization AAA estimates that 35 million people, about the same as last year, will travel at least 50 miles from home next weekend. 
The vast majority of those traveling -- 84 percent, or 29.4 million -- plan to go by car, also about the same as last year. 
 On the list of destinations, oceans and beaches were the choice of 25 percent of the respondents; the same percentage picked towns and rural areas. Those were followed by cities, 14 percent; lakes, 10 percent; mountains, 8 percent; amusement parks, 4 percent; and state and national parks, 3 percent. The rest had other answers or did not know.
Of the total, 37 percent said they expected to stay at a hotel or motel, and 27 percent with friends or relatives. Thirteen percent said they would stay in cabins or condominiums, and 12 percent in recreational vehicles or tents.
Sandra Hughes, a vice president for travel at AAA, said she was encouraged by the findings, which were released last week, "given conditions just two months ago, with the U.S. at war, record-high gasoline prices and dismal consumer confidence."
"The 20-cent-per-gallon average drop from March's record-high gas prices will certainly help" motorists, she added.

HEADLINE: Reversing the Loss Of American Jobs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "A Bet on Textiles, Despite the Doomsayers" (May 11), which described the prospects of various American textile companies: 
 The loss of American jobs to other countries has been a reality for at least two decades. A look at manufacturing capacity utilization or employment numbers drives the point home, as will any gift-buying trip to almost any store for almost any product. The number of consumer goods now made in China is so great, and the variety so diverse, that one almost becomes nostalgic for China's former competitors -- Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.
But job losses might be reduced and even reversed if our government offered a true economic policy, one that did not aim at job creation through debt-financed tax cuts but that set as its objective the restoration of jobs that have moved offshore.
A package including tax and capital investment incentives, factory-site redevelopment initiatives and an advertising campaign spun around pride and domestic security concerns could breathe life into this idea.
Even if only modestly successful, such an effort would bring home many jobs in textiles, apparel, toys, housewares, tools, appliances and electronics. The only question would be whether Wall Street and Main Street could learn to live with the smaller profit margins of these repatriated companies.

HEADLINE: Precaution Is for Europeans 

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL LOEWENBERG; Samuel Loewenberg is a journalist who covers policy and politics.

 BODY:
HERE'S another example of how the United States has decided that Europe is stuck in the past. Bush administration officials are exasperated with Europe's belief in the precautionary principle, a better-safe-than-sorry approach to regulating everything from corn flakes to chemical plants. 
 As outlined in a treaty of the European Union, governments should regulate industries when they pose risks to public health and the environment -- even before all the data about the threat has been collected. 
 In keeping with this precautionary approach, Europe has prohibited bioengineered crops and American beef treated with growth hormones, and is now crafting legislation that will require chemical companies to spend billions of dollars on safety tests of their products. 
But what looks like a question of safety to the Europeans often seems more like protectionism to the United States. The Bush administration believes the precautionary principle is an unjustified constraint on business and does not even recognize the existence of the doctrine. 
"We consider it to be a mythical concept, perhaps like a unicorn," said John D. Graham, the administrator at the Office of Management and Budget in charge of vetting new regulations, in a recent speech to European Union regulators. 
The United States was once a leader in precautionary legislation. The Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, both enacted in the 1970's with bipartisan support, explicitly allow regulators to act in the face of uncertain findings. But in the Reagan era, precautionary regulation was seen as an enemy of the free market. 
It was not just a Republican aversion. Though the Clinton administration was far more active in adopting health and environmental regulations, it battled Europe over the bans on genetically engineered foods and hormone-treated beef.
But the Bush administration has actively challenged the very premise on which the European actions are based. 
In a telephone interview, Mr. Graham said that rather than believing in a single precautionary principle, the administration acts when it determines that the economic and health benefits outweigh the costs. Before implementing a rule, the administration calculates the evidence of harm, the relative risk to a population and whether the effect on the population justifies taking regulatory measures. Mr. Graham cited the government's tightening of limits on diesel fuel emissions as an example of how his agency can act preventively when the numbers add up. 
"In the Bush administration, the focus is on smarter regulation, defined as applying science, engineering and economics, to proposed rules," said Mr. Graham, who became known for his cost-benefit theories after founding the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. Mr. Graham said that when he started in 2001, his office challenged dozens of rules proposed by federal agencies, but these days his office has not needed to send any rules back, as agencies have learned what is acceptable.
Critics argue that Mr. Graham's cost-benefit analyses often lead to the delay or watering down of health and environmental regulations. 
"It is a cloak in many respects for limiting regulation without having to be openly antienvironmental or antiworker or anticonsumer," said Gary D. Bass, the director of OMB Watch, a government watchdog group.
For instance, President Bush withdrew from the international agreement on reducing carbon emissions in order to limit global warming, arguing that more data was needed before taking action.
In another split, Europe recently required industry to run extensive health and environmental tests on the 30,000 most common chemicals. Nearly all of these chemicals have been around for decades, but European officials say little data is available on the vast majority of the chemicals, and that the potential benefits more than justify the cost to industry. 
The Bush administration is up in arms over the proposal. The American Chemistry Council, the industry's main trade group, contends that the European Union wants to "eliminate all risks from daily life" and "replace science with speculation." The United States has a voluntary program in which companies disclose information on 2,200 of their most common chemicals. Mr. Graham says this is equally precautionary and a better use of limited resources. 
Cass Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago who is writing a book on the precautionary principle, believes that strict adherence to the principle can be counterproductive -- like curbs on biotechnology, which, he says, could help feed the developing world.
At the same time, he argues that it is unreasonable for governments to demand absolute certainty before they act. "It's nutty to require conclusive evidence when the risk, if it comes to fruition, is extremely serious," Mr. Sunstein said.
This was the logic, Mr. Sunstein notes, of President Bush's pre-emptive strike on Iraq. President Bush argued that the risk of weapons of mass destruction was great enough to warrant an attack, without absolute proof that Iraq was hiding such weapons. 
That's the precautionary principle, American-style.

HEADLINE: Measuring Up; 
New Front in the Battle of the Bulge

BYLINE:  By GREG CRITSER; Greg Critser is the author of "Fatland: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World" (Houghton Mifflin, 2003).

 BODY:
THE French are measuring themselves. And the French government is paying for it.
 The country's new National Sizing Campaign represents the figure- and fashion-conscious nation's attempt to update clothing sizes so they bear a closer resemblance to today's slightly fuller French figure. Emphasis on slightly: the obesity rate in France has now topped 10 percent. The rate in the United States is three times that. 
 Still, the French are eating more like Americans these days. Between-meal snacking, and fast food and convenience-food consumption are up, particularly among children in big cities. That has fueled no end of newspaper and television features and editorials about childhood eating patterns. Not long ago Le Monde ran a cartoon showing an obese child eating while watching television as his parents look on saying, "He eats whatever he wants."
The government is concerned as well. The influential Institute of National Health and Medical Research in Paris has declared childhood obesity an epidemic. The rate has doubled in the last 20 years. Even McDonald's France got into the act last year when, to the chagrin of its American parent, it took out magazine ads saying it was best not to eat there more than once a week.
Yet in the great -- and increasingly international -- battle of the bulge, the French definitely have an edge. Yes, they may indulge in wine and butter and pastry, but they do so with a better metabolism and with an ingrained feeling about when, where and how much to eat. 
Those advantages are grounded in at least 100 years of state-sponsored, or at least state-supported, programs that have helped create and perpetuate a thin population. In France, it's the state that helps one say no to the seductions of modern fat culture.
These government campaigns did not have weight control as their main objective. At the turn of the 20th century, industrialization had forced many of the rural poor into the cities, and France's infant mortality rate had become so high that it provoked scorn from other European countries. In 1904, the French Public Health Act gave the central government authority to compel local governments to take actions to improve the birth rate.
One important response was a movement known as puericulture. Intent on improving prenatal and maternal health, puericulture advocates set up clinics all over the country to teach young mothers how to breastfeed. The state required any factory doing business with the government to set aside areas for lunchtime breastfeeding.
Puericulturists also taught that overfeeding was as bad as, if not worse than, underfeeding. A prominent obstetrician, Pierre Budin, who shocked the 1903 Conference on Hygiene with this view, liked to tell his medical students, "I always prefer to err by giving a little too little than by giving too much." Thus, early in its modern history, the French government lectured mothers on the medical value of dietary control.
The government also addressed body size. In 1904 the entire Paris school system began sending quarterly reports to all parents detailing their child's physical growth, carefully noting height, weight and chest measurements.
Ultimately, the point of puericulture was simple: raising a child could be a modern, rational act but only if the parents were given the encouragement, facts and tools to do so. Over and over, l'etat tried to do just that.
In the 15 years after puericulture took hold, child mortality throughout France dropped significantly. Childhood health improved so substantially that, by the 1920's, the first cases of childhood obesity began to appear. In typical fashion, the state, joined by domestic feminists of the period, revved up and retooled the puericulture effort.
By far the most effective advocate was Augusta Moll-Weiss, who wrote books about home economics that were considered definitive. She began focusing on the needs of poorer, uneducated young women, and founded the Paris School for Mothers, where she taught her doctrine of rational cuisine.
For Moll-Weiss, the key to good childhood health was parental control of the table. Children, she insisted, should always eat at set times. Portions should be moderate; seconds were out of the question. All meals should be supervised by adults. Snacking was forbidden. 
The child's preferences were unimportant, she said. "The essential thing is thatthe quality and the quantity of the diet correspond to the exertion of the young human being," she insisted. Virtually every young French child was raised based on her advice.
Such boundary-setting continues today. Simply put, the state regulates the excesses of modern life. You will not find Coca-Cola in a French middle school.
What was the long-term impact of all this? In a recent paper the British epidemiologist D. J. Barker said it is puericulture, not red wine, that may be the secret behind the low rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity in France. By focusing on prenatal care, he argues, the nation produced healthier, more metabolically efficient babies. And by regulating feeding, erring on the "little too little" side, French infants did not grow too quickly, an important factor in causing obesity in children in the first place.
It is feared today that such habits are being eroded. Obesity is on the rise. So French health authorities have launched a vigorous effort to reinforce the old attitudes while addressing the needs of new immigrant groups.
Unlike the United States, where the head of the National Institutes of Health's obesity program is loath to use the words "obesity" and "childhood" in the same sentence, France has met the problem head on. There is already a comprehensive set of public health goals, including the training of all school nurses in screening for obesity and its prevention, special care for obese children and "rigorous control of advertisement messages about food products" aimed at children. 
Many may take issue with such zeal. But the French experience seems to demonstrate that there is something to be said for zeal in the face of overwhelming temptation. It may turn out that "a little too little" may go further than anyone ever thought.

HEADLINE: The States Bet More On Betting 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
THE biggest game at the annual World Series of Poker, the no-limit Texas hold 'em tournament, starts tomorrow at Binion's Horseshoe Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The entry fee is $10,000, and by Friday a winner will take home a top prize expected to top $2 million.
 But while the eyes of poker players are focused on the Horseshoe, the real action in the luck business this year is taking place in other, less glamorous locales. 
 States already raise $20 billion annually from lotteries and casinos, more than 4 percent of their total revenue. Now, in capitals from Albany, N.Y., to Springfield, Ill., to Salem, Ore., politicians are debating whether to rely even more on gambling to try to balance their budgets without tax increases or service cuts. 
Over the next several years, the result could well be a speeded-up expansion in gambling nationally, making betting more accessible than ever before, and states and cities more dependent on the willingness of lower-income people to gamble. 
Since 1991, when the current wave of legalization began, the annual amount Americans lose on all betting, including lotteries, casinos and racetracks, has risen from $27 billion to $68 billion, according to Christiansen Capital Advisors, an investment bank specializing in gambling and entertainment.
Americans now spend more on gambling than on movies, videos and DVD's, music and books combined, and with an annual growth rate of about 9 percent since 1991, gambling is growing substantially faster than the economy as a whole.
But so far, that growth does not seem to have caused a serious backlash. During the 1990's, opponents of legalization raised the specter of widespread bankruptcies and broken homes. Those predictions have not come true, however, and gaming -- as the casino industry calls it -- has increasingly become a part of American life. 
ESPN2 regularly shows poker tournaments, and "Positively Fifth Street," a book about the World Series of Poker, is a best seller. Forty-seven states now have some legalized gambling, and Tennessee, one of the holdouts, is considering adopting a lottery.
But as states search desperately for more revenue, more of them are turning to gambling, and specifically to a form of it that aims at people of modest means and that is particularly harmful to those susceptible to becoming addicted to gambling, experts say.
Last week, for example, in his plan to bail out New York City, Gov. George E. Pataki said he would add as many as 4,500 video lottery terminals to three large Off-Track Betting outlets in the city. 
The latest expansion proposals mainly involve video lottery terminals, which are widely agreed to be among the most addictive forms of gambling, and the least likely to create jobs in a community or generate other positive economic effects. 
But, notcoincidentally, video lottery terminals can be taxed at extraordinarily high rates, meaning that they are extremely efficient revenue collectors from the point of view of state governments, as opposed to local economies. 
In West Virginia, one of the poorest states, video terminals account for 12 percent of the state government's revenue, said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association.
In Las Vegas, money won by casinos is taxed at 6.25 percent, noted Eugene M. Christiansen, chairman of Christiansen Capital Advisers. On the other hand, in some states, video lottery terminals are taxed at rates as high as 50 percent. 
"The low-tax-rate, big-entertainment resort presents a different face to the community," Mr. Christiansen said. "It attracts different kinds of consumers. Storefront video poker can be much tougher on low-income people." Experts agree that not all forms of gambling are created equal. 
Don Phares, an economist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said that, unlike casinos, which create some jobs and foster businesses that cater to the casino-goers, video lottery terminals provide almost no economic benefit to anyone but their owners and the states. 
In addition, experts on gambling addiction say that video terminals are especially dangerous because they offer gamblers a very fast, highly stimulating, rate of play. Faster play also means that bettors lose more money, because each bet a gambler makes is, on average, a loser, so more bets translate into larger losses. Inside the gaming industry, the terminals are sometimes called "video crack."
Making terminals more widely available will almost certainly increase the number of problem gamblers, at least in the short run, said Dr. Rachel A. Volberg, president of Gemini Research, which specializes in studies of gambling and problem gambling. Several recent studies have shown, not surprisingly, that the more legalized gambling in a state, the more problem gamblers it has, Dr. Volberg said.
But whether those problems will become severe enough to discourage states from legalizing video terminals is not clear. 
Even in states with lots of legalized gambling, no more than 1 percent to 2 percent of the population is addicted to it, with an additional 2 percent to 3 percent reporting gambling "problems." 
In addition, studies show that the rise in the number of problem gamblers flattens out after the first few years following legalization, Dr. Volberg said.
"There's a lot of different ways that people sort of move through what I think of as a gambling career," she said. "Gambling availability, gambling participation and gambling problem rates don't seem to march in lockstep."
For the moment, the march toward more gambling has stalled. Efforts to legalize terminals at tracks have failed in several states this year, including Maryland, although proposals are still alive in others, including Illinois and Pennsylvania. 
That fact has heartened opponents of gambling, like Tom Grey, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion. "Our best days are in front of us," he said. 
But if the previous decade is any guide, Mr. Grey is wrong. The stock of International Game Technology, the world's largest maker of slot machines and video terminals, has risen fivefold since 1997. And by 2012, the company expects that as many as 10 more states will legalize casinos or video terminals at racetracks, said Robert McIver, its investor relations officer.
Mr. McIver may well be right, at least in an era when the states are starving for cash. That's something gambling can be relied on to provide.
"One way or another, it's a tax revenue source," he said.

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC; 
Economic Impact of New Disease, From Near Outbreak to Far Away

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
The tracks of an epidemic are often wider and deeper than they may first appear, stretching far beyond the lives of sick patients and those who care for them.
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome has reached 30 countries infecting more than 7,700 people and killing more than 600, the World Health Organization reports. Its economic consequences have already been profound. In China, for instance, the economy had been expanding at a rate of 9.9 percent but is now shrinking at an annual rate of 2 percent, and investment bankers attribute the turnabout to SARS. 
 Though death and economic losses from SARS have been well chronicled, less has been revealed about its impact on the day-to-day lives and fortunes of ordinary people, who are feeling its effects. Following are the voices of some of those people.

The Flight Attendant
Forced to Work Longer Hours for Far Less Pay
Up until March, Tony Retkowski, a flight attendant for United Airlines, could be found walking up and down the twin aisles of Boeing 747 and 777 jumbo jets on his usual assignments between Chicago, Tokyo and Hong Kong.
These days, Mr. Retkowski is working red-eye flights from the West Coast, and shorter hops to Denver and Washington, D.C., flying on narrow-bodied jets with a single aisle. He once planned on three overseas round-trip flights a month, but now he often does not know until dawn where he will fly on any workday. "I ping-pong all over the place," he said in a telephone interview from his home in Chicago.
Mr. Retkowski's routine has changed drastically since March 1, when United began eliminating 14 flights to and within Asia. The cutbacks, announced as war loomed with Iraq, were worsened by the drop in travel because of SARS. (United plans to restore some of its Asian flights this summer.)
On May 5, United scrapped its direct flights from Chicago and San Francisco to Hong Kong. Passengers bound for Hong Kong on United must change planes in Tokyo -- and even that is more difficult, since United eliminated one of its two flights a day between Chicago and Tokyo. 
Each of those flights carried as many as 20 flight attendants, and their elimination meant those employees had to find other destinations. Since trips are awarded on seniority, the cuts bumped Mr. Retkowski from international trips to domestic ones, which he had not flown regularly since 1997.
"First it was the war," he said, "then SARS was the icing on the cake." 
The contrast is noticeable. On a domestic flight, "you're talking about an hour and a half with just a beverage service versus a 14-hour flight with three meal services," he said. "It's quite different." His paycheck is very different too. In 2002, Mr. Retkowski, whose decade of service places him in about the middle of United's seniority-based pay scale, earned just under $42,000, flying about 65 hours a month. (Flight attendants are paid for the time they spend in the air, not while waiting for assignments or while performing paperwork before and after flights.)
Now Mr. Retkowski is flying 80 hours a month, but he estimates his salary will drop by more than $12,000 this year because domestic flights pay less per hour than international trips. Mr. Retkowski is a reserve attendant, filling in regularly for attendants who are on vacation or ill. 
To make up for the drop in wages, Mr. Retkowski has taken two part-time jobs -- one with a friend's company that paints house interiors, the other at a hot dog stand on a Lake Michigan beach. He has encountered otherflight attendants with whom he once flew to Asia moonlighting as waitresses and behind the counter in clothing stores. "You have to go where you can make money," he said.

In China, for instance, the economy had been expanding at a rate of 9.9 percent but is now shrinking at an annual rate of 2 percent, and investment bankers attribute the turnabout to SARS. 
 Though death and economic losses from SARS have been well chronicled, less has been revealed about its impact on the day-to-day lives and fortunes of ordinary people, who are feeling its effects. Following are the voices of some of those people.

The Businessman
A Move Upward Turns Sideways, Temporarily
March was a month full of optimism for Russell Ziegler and his family. Mr. Ziegler, an executive with a software design company, had agreed to a two-year stint in Singapore overseeing his company's regional office, and the family was preparing to move there. 
The cars had been sold, the house rented, the "we're leaving town" e-mail messages sent and the two cats adopted by a family. Friends and relatives gathered in late March at the family's house in Pleasant Hill, Calif., to wish them well. Even 3-year-old Kalina Ziegler's preschool class had gotten into the spirit, throwing a party and giving her a group picture of her classmates.
But as reports on the SARS outbreak proliferated, Mr. Ziegler decided to postpone his family's overseas move.
"At the time, I didn't know if it was going to escalate," he said in a telephone interview from the San Francisco office of his company, Macromedia. "My family was more of the opinion that I was overreacting. My wife was getting feedback from her relatives in the medical community -- they thought I was overreacting." 
Mr. Ziegler, 30, said that as April 1 approached, he first considered leaving his family in the United States and going to Singapore by himself. But after his company said he could delay his move, he decided the whole family would wait. They will make the move on June 2. The result has been two months of limbo for the Ziegler family. 
With their four-bedroom home occupied by a tenant, the Zieglers have been living in a two-bedroom rental apartment in Pleasant Hill, just a few miles away. Half of the family's possessions are in Singapore already, and half are in storage. Because the cars are gone, they are driving around in rental cars. Kalina has not returned to preschool because her parents felt it would be too confusing both for her and for her classmates, and her brother, Joseph, will celebrate his first birthday in the apartment.
"We made the disconnect, we said the goodbyes," Mr. Ziegler said. "We're coping." 
Mr. Ziegler's reluctance to move his family to Singapore disappeared after a two-week business trip there during which he saw the precautions being taken by the government. Mr. Ziegler said he is now eager to meet the employees he will soon be managing in person -- and comfortable bringing his family along.

HEADLINE: Smaller Percentage of Poor Live in High-Poverty Areas 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Poverty in the United States became far less concentrated in the 1990's as public housing projects were torn down and millions of poor people left urban slums for other neighborhoods, a new study of Census Bureau data says.
 The number of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined by 2.5 million, or 24 percent, to 7.9 million in 2000 from 10.4 million in 1990, the researchers said. 
 The author of the study, Paul A. Jargowsky, an associate professor of political economy at the University of Texas at Dallas, described this as "a significant turnaround from the 1970-1990 period, during which the population in high-poverty neighborhoods doubled."
In 1990, 15 percent of all poor people lived in high-poverty neighborhoods. By 2000, the proportion had declined to 10 percent, according to the study, issued today by the Brookings Institution. 
"Concentrated poverty -- the share of the poor living in high-poverty neighborhoods -- declined among all racial and ethnic groups, especially African-Americans," Mr. Jargowsky said.
In 1990, 30 percent of poor blacks lived in high-poverty neighborhoods. Ten years later, the proportion was 19 percent. 
Mr. Jargowsky said the changes were generally beneficial.
"Concentrations of poor people lead to a concentration of the social ills that cause or are caused by poverty," Mr. Jargowsky said. "School districts are often organized geographically, so the residential concentration of the poor frequently results in low-performing schools."
The Census Bureau has not issued any studies on the concentration of poverty based on the 2000 census. But Mr. Jargowsky used census data to analyze high-poverty neighborhoods, which he defined as those where at least 40 percent of the residents had incomes below the official poverty level. A family of four was classified as poor in 2000 if it had cash income less than $17,603.
The study defined a neighborhood as a census tract. The population of tracts varies widely, but averages 4,000 people. The number of high-poverty census tracts declined to 2,510 in 2000 from 3,417 in 1990, Mr. Jargowsky said.
The economy was expanding for most of the 1990's, but that alone does not explain what Mr. Jargowsky described as the "deconcentration of poverty." Despite the strong economy, the number of people classified as poor in the 2000 census was slightly higher than the number counted a decade earlier.
Bruce Katz, director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution, said, "The decline in concentrated poverty represents, in part, the triumph of smart federal policies that demolished failed public housing, rewarded work and overhauled welfare."
A separate study, by G. Thomas Kingsley and Kathryn L. S. Pettit of the Urban Institute, found that conditions in high-poverty neighborhoods generally improved in the 1990's. Adult education levels rose, the share of families headed by women declined and the number of households receiving public assistance fell sharply, the study said.
Margery A. Turner, a researcher at the Urban Institute, said the findings showed that "improvements are possible, even in severely distressed neighborhoods."
In his study, Mr. Jargowsky reported these findings:
*The number of blacks living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined by more than one-third, to 3.1 million in 2000 from 4.9 million in 1990.
*Two regions accounted for most of the change in the concentration of poverty. The population of high-poverty neighborhoods declined by 1.6 million people, or 35 percent, in the South and by 1.2 million people, or 46 percent, in the Midwest.
*In the Northeast, the population of high-poverty neighborhoods was virtually unchanged. In the West, it increased by 344,000, or 26 percent.
*From 1990 to 2000, the number of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods fell by 313,000, or 74 percent, in Detroit; by 177,900, or 43 percent, in Chicago; and by 107,000, or 70 percent, in San Antonio.
But poverty remained highly concentrated in the New York metropolitan area, Mr. Jargowsky said. The population of high-poverty neighborhoods there declined only 15,000, or 1.6 percent, he said.
Across the country, Mr. Jargowsky found "a bull's-eye pattern: improvements in the central city and increasing poverty in the inner ring of suburbs." Poverty increased in older suburbs of Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland and Dallas, he said.
Trends in the West were dominated by California, which showed a large increase in the population of high-poverty neighborhoods. One reason, Mr. Jargowsky suggested, was the influx of low-income Latin Americans. Such poverty, though cause for concern, may be different from poverty elsewhere, he said.
"Western inner-city barrios may be more of a gateway than inner-city ghettos in other areas of the country," Mr. Jargowsky said. "Immigrants are moving into the barrios for opportunity, as part of an assimilation process that may channel many of them into jobs."

HEADLINE: G-8 Ministers See Growth And Look Into Help for Iraq 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: DEAUVILLE, France, May 17 

 BODY:
Struggling to brighten the global economic mood, the finance ministers of the major industrial countries and Russia agreed today that while their economies faced multiple challenges, they were confident that a revival of growth was possible.
 Their assessment comes as economic growth is largely stalled in the world's three major economic regions -- Japan, Europe and the United States. With Japan's economy virtually becalmed, three major European countries -- Germany, Italy and the Netherlands -- announced this week that their economies had contracted in the latest quarter, shifting the burden of generating growth more than ever onto the United States. But there, too, the cushion of growth has been thin. 
 "While major downside risks have receded, our economies continue to face many challenges," the ministers in a statement approved at the conclusion of their two-day meeting. Yet they added that they were "nonetheless confident in the potential for stronger growth."
The ministers met in this French resort, heavily guarded against terrorist attack, to prepare for the annual summit meeting of the Group of Eight leaders, to be held this year in the French spa of Evian June 1-3.
The French finance minister, Francis Mer, said that stable oil prices and the "historically low" cost of capital gave grounds for guarded short-term optimism. But speaking at a news conference, he said that the focus of the discussion was on long-term changes both in the developed world and in emerging markets "to create the best conditions possible for growth."
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said that "finding ways to strengthen global growth" was the "single most important issue we faced."
Mr. Snow, at a news conference, said he had laid out the measures the Bush administration was taking to promote growth and had urged America's economic partners to take "action, even bold actions," to "spur growth, create jobs and contribute importantly to global prosperity."
But he said one of the main achievements of the meeting was to obtain the agreement of America's allies to support a sweeping assessment of the economic requirements of Iraq by international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Mr. Snow said he had "stressed the importance of beginning a process for countries to donate funds for the reconstruction of Iraq." He said he was "pleased with the response we got," but did not provide details.
But Mr. Mer, asked about the issue, said the ministers had agreed to meet in "three to four months" to review the question of "how we can build economic conditions for the revival of Iraq." The ministers did not mention Iraq in their final communique.
Mr. Snow said that while the ministers had shown themselves receptive to a role in aiding Iraq and in resolving its enormous debt problems, they had not raised the issue of the apportionment of contracts for reconstruction work. Some countries, and notably Germany and France, had expressed reservations in the past about the awarding of contracts solely to American companies.
But returning to the question of economic growth, Mr. Snow said that "clearly this issue was center stage for us."
That urgency was reflected in the news that Japan's government had decided to agree to a request by that nation's fifth largest bank, Resona Holdings, to a government bailout that could cost the Japanese government as much as $17 billion.
Mr. Mer said the news, which was conveyed by the Japanese minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, was "judged rather positively" by the group.
Mr. Snow said he had discussed the bailout in a meeting with Mr. Shiokawa on Friday. Mr. Snow said he was "very encouraged by what the minister had to say." Both Mr. Mer and Mr. Snow stressed that the stability of the Japanese financial system was a condition for a revival of Japan's ailing economy.
The ministers seemed to go out of their way to dispel mistrust among consumers and investors caused by such events as the war in Iraq, the attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco, instability in the Middle East, and the diplomatic chill among the United States and some key allies.
In recent weeks, concern has mounted that the economies of Europe and Japan may be menaced by deflation, or falling prices, which erode corporate profits and make it harder for debtors to repay their obligations. In Europe, inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro fell to 2.1 percent in April, from 2.4 percent in March, the European statistics office reported Friday.

HEADLINE: Euro Beginning to Flex Its Economic Muscles 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 17 

 BODY:
Its leaders are divided and its economies are distressed, but Europe stands tall in one respect. The euro, its toddler currency, is growing into a cheeky rival to the dollar, one of the most visible symbols of America's power in the world.
 After a hapless debut in January 1999, marked by a long, stomach-churning slide in its value, the euro has made up virtually all the ground it lost against the dollar. It now trades at an exchange rate of about $1.15 per euro, only three cents shy of its value on the first day of trading. 
 More important, the euro has gained stature as a safe haven for investors and governments. 
The dollar remains the world's default currency -- the lingua franca of oil traders and bond dealers, and the bedrock of foreign reserves held by central banks from Brussels to Baghdad. But the euro is gaining ground, both as an attractive currency in which to issue bonds and as an alternative to the dollar for national foreign exchange reserves, notably in southeast Asian countries with predominantly Muslim populations. 
With the United States piling up vast deficits, economists say the euro has a chance to consolidate its gains. "U.S. federal finances are coming under increased strain," said Niall C. Ferguson, a senior research fellow at Oxford. "Money that had been invested in dollar-denominated assets is shifting to euro assets. For the euro to become a little brother to the dollar seems perfectly plausible." 
Such a role would vindicate the guardians of the euro, who watch over it from the European Central Bank's glass-and-steel tower in Frankfurt. They have always had grand ambitions for the currency, viewing it as an alternative to the dollar and an instrument to drive Europe's integration. 
Yet an almighty euro carries risks for champions of a united Europe. It could supply fresh ammunition to opponents of the monetary union in Britain, Sweden and prospective members. 
It could also open fissures between existing members that depend on exports and stand to suffer from a currency that rises too far, too fast. Last week, three euro countries -- Germany, Italy and the Netherlands -- reported that they were on the brink of recession. 
"If it goes much beyond $1.25, we've got a problem," said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research group in Brussels. 
The introduction of euro notes and coins here last year was striking for how smooth the process seemed. After a noisy buildup, the German mark, the French franc and the Italian lira faded into history like quaint relics. In the financial markets, where the euro had traded as a virtual currency since 1999, the transition was equally seamless, with investors showing prompt acceptance of the new currency. 
The shift toward euros is most pronounced in the global bond market. From 1995 to 1999, according to Professor Ferguson's research, 53 percent of all corporate bonds were issued in dollars, and only 20 percent in the currencies of the 12 European countries that now use the euro. 
In the four years since the common currency began trading, however, 44 percent of new global bonds have been issued in euros, nearly equaling the 48 percent issued in dollars. There is also anecdotal evidence that central banks, especially in some Asian countries, are beginning to diversify their reserves, to reduce dependence on the dollar. Bank Indonesia, the nation's central bank, has increased its holdings of euros, currency traders said. 
"We are strongly tied to the dollar," Rizal Ramli, the former finance minister of Indonesia, said in an interview. "But with the dollar's decline, it is wise for Indonesia to diversify its reserves into euros." 
In Muslim countries like his, Mr. Ramli said, there is a political dimension to the shift. The American-led war on Iraq was fiercely opposed by Indonesia. Vice President Hamzah Haz, an Islamic leader, has encouraged local investors to switch from dollars to euros. A similar switch has occurred in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries, currency traders say, though accurate numbers are elusive. 
"Some people, especially in the Muslim world, think that this is not a secure asset from a political point of view," Mr. Ramli said. 
In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad recently suggested that the state oil company, Petronas, switch to euros from dollars for its oil trading. His rationale, he said, was purely economic. "The U.S. dollar has depreciated by 25 percent," he said in opening a new Petronas natural gas plant. "In other words, we are earning 25 percent less." 
Mr. Ramli played down the politics, noting that the yield on euro-denominated assets is better than that on dollars. If that were to change, he said, even Muslim countries would quickly switch back.
Some analysts caution that one should not jump to conclusions from anecdotal reports about central banks. According to the International Monetary Fund, 68 percent of the world's foreign exchange reserves were held in dollars in 2001, the latest year for which it has figures.
That number has remained roughly constant since 1999, and rose from 55 percent in 1992. The 13 percent of reserves held in euros in 2001 also stayed constant from 1999.
"Incumbency has enormous advantages," said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. "Sterling hung on as the world's No. 2 currency for the better part of the 20th century, even though Britain stopped having the No. 1 economy in the 19th century."
Still, Professor Eichengreen said there was no reason the euro's influence would not eventually match the dollar's. The euro zone already has 300 million people; it would have more than 450 million if Britain, Sweden, and the countries of Central Europe adopted the currency.
Most are eager to do so, believing it will help their populations. But the price of belonging to a monetary union -- obeying strict fiscal rules and one-size-fits-all interest rates -- has made some Central Europeans relieved that they will not be allowed to adopt the euro until at least 2007.
"It would be so easy to sell the concept of the euro if there weren't these tough requirements," the prime minister of Hungary, Peter Medgyessy, said recently in an interview at a conference in Munich. "That is why we should be very cautious about setting a date for joining the euro zone."
Among Western Europeans, feelings are even more ambivalent. Sweden, which is scheduled to hold a referendum on joining the monetary union in September, has historically been pro-Europe. But in recent polls, public sentiment has swung narrowly against the euro. 
Part of the problem is that Swedes fear a strong euro would cripple their exports. They also point to neighboring Germany, which has limped through four years with the euro, in part because the tight monetary policy of the European bank is arguably ill suited to its faltering economy. 
The same arguments are heard in Britain, where the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, is to deliver a judgment next month on whether the country has met five economic conditions for entry to the union. His verdict is widely expected to be "not yet." 
Mr. Brown's obdurate resistance has revived rumors of a rift between him and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who favors the euro. The two men issued a statement on Friday denying that they were are at loggerheads. 
In one respect, the rise of the euro should remove a barrier for Britain. Because the pound, like the dollar, has lost value against the euro, the danger of converting it into euros at an inflated rate has been mitigated. 
"If you lock in the pound at too strong a rate, you run into some of the same problems Germany did," said David Walton, the chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London. Still, Mr. Walton said Britain's reluctance to join the union was driven less by economics than by politics -- springing from inchoate but deeply held notions of sovereignty and national identity. 
Ultimately, the success of the euro will also depend on politics. That is why the currency's creators seem quite satisfied with its rebound. While they recognize it is mostly a reflection of the dollar's weakness, they relish the chance to erase the memory of its stumbling start. 
"The European bank once had to come out and tell the market, 'Your money is safe,' " said Mr. Gros, recalling one of the currency's low points in 2000. "This takes away that embarrassment."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: BAGHDAD; 
Iraq's Slide Into Lawlessness Squanders Good Will for U.S.

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 17 

 BODY:
It was another bad week for Karim W. Hassan, director general of Iraq's electricity commission.
 Looters had already pilfered underground cables, carted off computers that regulate power distribution, stolen 25 of the guards' 30 patrol cars, emptied warehouses of spare parts, ransacked substations and shot up transmission lines across the country's electric grid. 
 Then, his men reported, armed bandits stole the only cable splicer in central Iraq, needed to repair countless vandalized electric lines.
On top of that, another group of gunmen stole his own car. The upshot: yet more delays in restoring electricity in this city, weeks after the war ended. 
"Give me security," said Dr. Hassan, speaking for many Iraqis, "and I'll give you electricity."
The power company's problems are but one example of how Iraq's descent into lawlessness has stalled its return to normalcy, increased the costs of reconstruction and squandered much of the good will Iraqis felt for their new American overseers.
In the space of a few weeks, awe at American power in war has been transformed into anger at American impotence in peace. A crime wave, increasingly the work of organized gangs far better armed than the skeleton Iraqi police forces, has kept citizens in a peculiar state of limbo, free yet fearful.
Delays in restoring electricity and telecommunications have kept businesses closed. Banks, looted of at least $500 million in deposits, have yet to reopen. Traders, attacked daily by armed bands on the highway linking Iraq to Jordan, are reluctant to send much needed imports. 
Iraq's government, the country's biggest employer, is essentially shut down, aggravating unemployment.
During the bombing of Iraq, the American military took pains to limit damage to the country's infrastructure. The intent, commanders said repeatedly, was to ensure that Iraqis could speedily resume a normal life once Saddam Hussein's dictatorship was eliminated.
But the wholesale plundering of government property, often under the eyes of American soldiers in the capital, has largely undone those good intentions. Iraq's new administrators now say the cost of reconstruction, in both time and money, will be much higher than expected.
"The impact of the looting was greater than we probably realized at the time," said Col. John Peabody, an Army engineer charged with securing public utility sites. "Everything of value to making things run was stolen."
Military commanders have said they were surprised by the scale of the initial pillaging but were, in any case, preoccupied with securing the city. In Washington, in the glow of the war's successful finish, the dismantling of Iraq's government buildings attracted little interest. 
As the looting evolved into brazen daylight carjackings, revenge killings and armed robberies, a few American officers on the ground took the initiative to impose order on individual neighborhoods and towns. 
But overall, the military's most senior people resisted using their combat forces as crime-busters, except when opportunities arose to seize weapons. Meanwhile, local police officers returning to work were permitted to carry only sidearms. Most have refused to confront criminals or even stay in their looted station houses overnight. 
L. Paul Bremer III, Iraq's newly appointed civilian administrator, said after arriving here last week that he recognized the need to restore law and order. Army officers said a debate was under way over whether to allow the Iraqi police to have AK-47's. A new infusion of American military police officers is on hand to respond to reports of violent crime -- if they are summoned by the intermittent Army patrols on Baghdad streets.
Only in recent days, long after the value of using American soldiers as guards became clear, have tanks taken positions outside government buildings. But most ministries have already been gutted of desks, light fixtures, computers, air- conditioners, records and toilets.
Iraqi frustration at the power vacuum burst out this week, when Baghdad city workers pleaded with the American-run Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance to at least issue a public announcement that citizens must obey the law. 
A senior official of the reconstruction office said a statement, to be read on a local American-financed radio station, was being prepared, although it was not clear what laws were now in effect in Iraq. For many Iraqis, the damage has been done.
"We used to have a brutal dictatorship that controlled everything," said Mahmoud Ahmed Uthman, chairman of Al Khair Financial Investments Company, an investment fund that has been active here for years. "When the government collapsed, there was nothing left except a great emptiness. And that emptiness has been filled with chaos."

The Road to Amman
Smooth and six-lanes wide for much of its course, Highway 11 from Baghdad to Jordan's capital, Amman, is Iraq's most important land route to the rest of the world. 
These days, it is also an illustration of how crime is crippling the recovery of commerce.
One day last week, less than an hour west of Baghdad, three hijackers shot out the windshield of Abdulnasser Rafiq's GMC. After forcing him to stop, they stole the car and lobbed a grenade at him and his passenger as they drove away.
"It used to be that they would just take your money and whatever you had inside," said Mr. Rafiq, who has been ferrying merchants to and from Jordan for eight years. "I paid $20,000 for that truck, and they'll try to sell it for $1,000. I'd be happy to pay $1,000 myself just to get the truck back."
Attacks like these occur almost daily, and they have reduced traffic on the highway to a trickle. Iraq's reconstituted police forces do not patrol it. Many officers admit they feel too outgunned by the criminal gangs to mount serious investigations.
As a result, travel between Baghdad and Amman is limited to those who are either very determined or very armed. 
For the lucky few, like companies bringing in gasoline or other key supplies from Jordan, American Army units with six Humvees have begun escorting convoys of trucks. 
Even that protection is limited. Units of the Third Infantry Division escorted four civilian gasoline tankers from the Jordanian border to south of Baghdad. But they refused to escort the tankers on the equally dangerous trip back to Jordan.
"The bandits don't know whether my truck is loaded or not," said Hatam Suleiman, a Jordanian driver, as he waited for his convoy to be handed off from one set of Army escorts to another. "Next time, if I don't get protection in both directions, I'm not coming back." 
To the casual observer, many ofthe markets in downtown Baghdad seem as thriving as ever. Vendors display imported products aimed at postwar coping: satellite telephones, to substitute for Iraq's obliterated telephone system; satellite television dishes, which were illegal under Mr. Hussein's rule; portable kerosene stoves, because the usual cooking gas is hard to find.
But on closer inspection, the situation is abnormal. Scores of stores, looted immediately after the war ended, are still shuttered. Those that have reopened close before dark. Vendors have armed themselves with pistols and automatic weapons. Sales are down sharply. 
Largely because of the initial wave of lootings at government ministries and businesses, millions of Iraqis have not returned to work or received any wages beyond a one-time $20 payment for emergency needs. But fear has kept many shoppers, especially women, at home.
"People are afraid to come here," said Muhammad Qassim Mustapha, a spice trader in the heart of Baghdad's huge Showja wholesale market. Between housewives who are afraid to shop and restaurant owners who are afraid to reopen, he said, spice sales are running about one-tenth their prewar rate.
Corporations and foreign investors are even more paralyzed. In the Jordanian port city of Aqaba, which serves as a major gateway for exports to Iraq, shipping executives say cargo is piling up in warehouses because customers are too nervous to move it across the border.
Without predictable rules, or any ability to protect property from theft or seizure, even the most enthusiastic believers in a new Iraq say it is still to unstable major commitments.
"How can you do business if you cannot ensure the security of your warehouses and factories?" asked Saad al-Janabi, whose family group owns scores of businesses in Iraq. As a result of the original looting, compounded by new security fears and the lack of electricity, Mr. Janabi said, none of the family's factories have yet resumed operation.
Assim al-Janabi, Saad's father and patriarch of the family industrial group, has yet to return to Iraq after fleeing to Dubai shortly before the war broke out.
"I told him it's just too dangerous," said the younger Mr. Janabi.

Brick by Brick by Brick
Colonel Peabody remembers the day last month when he first visited the electricity authority's control center in Baghdad, which used computers to modulate power across the country to prevent crashes.
"The floor was covered with three inches of paper, debris and glass," he said. "The computers were stolen or destroyed." 
In retrospect, the colonel said, American troops should have protected the center -- "had we known about it." 
Now the job of putting the system back together again falls to a committee of Iraqi and American engineers who meet several times a week in a building on the vast grounds of one of Mr. Hussein's palace compounds. On the wall they have taped up a diagram of the country's electric grid, with two dotted lines snaking around the system to indicate what is damaged. 
Electric power remains intermittent in much of Baghdad. The electric company workers who shut down neighborhood substations to ease the load have been attacked by residents. Others are too frightened to go to work, worried that thieves will come seeking whatever equipment remains.
Soldiers and tanks have been assigned to deliver air conditioners to the plants, where they are needed to keep instruments cool. They have been deployed to accompany the cranes that go out to repair transmission towers. 
"I don't worry about getting stuff in here safely," said Colonel Peabody. "I worry about it getting looted once it gets here."
While some of the damage to the electrical grid resulted from the war, as advancing troops plowed past power lines, most of the difficulties are the result of looting, according to Dr. Hassan, the senior Iraqi electricity official. "They are taking anything," he said. 
Like other government properties, where looters still can be seen disassembling the buildings brick by brick, the electrical system has been methodically vandalized. 
But because the system is a hodgepodge of Chinese, French, Russian, American and other parts, replacing what is stolen has not been easy -- since spare parts were also stolen. 
Last month, Army engineers were thrilled to find a private construction company here with supplies of lumber and other materials needed to start repairs. But, two weeks ago, a gang of thieves broke into that company's warehouse and cleaned it out.
Everyone attending the regular committee meetings agrees that the only way to restore power is security -- that, and money. 
But for the moment, military officers say they do not believe it is practical or possible to put armed guards at every one of the 600 electrical stations, substations and transformers in the country, as well as nearly 420 additional water and sewage system sites. 
As a stopgap measure, they are trying to get uniforms, badges and AK-47 assault rifles for 125 new guards, who will work in two shifts, for priority sites in the electric grid.

Imprisoned at Home
When American forces crushed Mr. Hussein's government in early April, few people were more delighted than Basir, a wealthy architect in one of Baghdad's best suburbs.
Yet today, he and his family remain imprisoned by fear in their own home. Pale and fatigued even at 10 in the morning, his mood has soured.
Ten days ago, armed men ambushed and robbed Basir and his wife, Lubna, as they were walking outside their house. Five days ago, assailants shot and stabbed to death Lubna's uncle in his garden at 8:30 a.m. Lubna's aunt, Faiza, is still hospitalized with a bullet wound to her head.
"How is it that the United States could plan every single step in this war so perfectly, and then be so ignorant about what is happening now?" said Basir, who spoke on the condition that his family name not be published.
Lubna, who works for the International Telecommunications Union, listened quietly and then vented her own anger.
"People are already beginning to say, 'Why don't we go back to Saddam?' " she said. "At least it was more safe, more peaceful." 
Such attitudes are mild in comparison to the frustration that many less affluent and less Westernized Iraqis express.
Rich or poor, people seem shocked as the initial wave of postwar looting turned into the plague of chronic street crime. Conspiracy theories about American motives abound, providing some distraction but doing little to ease the paralysis that has gripped people like Basir and his family.
Although the family lives on a pretty street in the affluent neighborhood of Jadiria, they are so frightened that they drive rather than walk the 50 yards to their next-door neighbor's home. They said they left the house only when absolutely necessary, and they have bricked up their front window rather than replace the plate glass that was shattered during the war.
"Even if they couldn't control it in the beginning, they aren't doing anything about it now," said Basir of the Americans. "What's happening here does not comply with any Western standards, not even the standards of Albania."

HEADLINE: As AIDS Ravages Caribbean, Governments Confront Denial 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: GUAYMATE, Dominican Republic 

 BODY:
A ragged and exhausted man summoned his dwindling strength to lift himself off a foam rubber mattress on the floor of a stiflingly hot shack.
 "I drink cold water," he said, haltingly, in this town of sugar cane workers, many of Haitian descent. "And that feels hot. Look at my skin. It burns." 
 Since January, he has wasted away from diarrhea. He insists that the local clinic does not know his illness. But a health worker confirms what others only whisper: he is dying from AIDS, one of about half a million people with H.I.V. in the Caribbean, where the infection rate is the highest outside Africa. 
While the sheer scale of Africa's epidemic has tended to overshadow the problem here, health experts and political leaders warn of the potential for devastation in a region of small, image-conscious countries that depend on a limited pool of labor and resources, as well as tourism.
Some 40,000 adults and children in the Caribbean are believed to have died of the disease in 2001 alone. It is already the leading cause of death among young men.
"The overall threat is very simple; it is affecting the most productive population in the most productive age group," said Patricio Marquez, a principal health specialist for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank, which is financing a regional response to the disease. "There is the risk that an entire generation could be wiped out." 
The epidemic's full extent is obscured by fear, denial, limited treatment and a lack of public health resources. What is certain, however, is that a social and economic catastrophe is imperiling many countries as infections steadily climb and AIDS spreads in the general population. 
Some estimates say 2.4 percent of the Caribbean's adult population is infected with human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS, though rates vary widely. The World Bank estimates that in some urban areas as much as 12 percent of adults carry the virus. While Haiti, with an infection rate of more than 6 percent, has gained attention as the region's hardest-hit country, the disease is by no means confined there, officials said.
"It has been compared to a volcano that doesn't stop erupting," Rafael Mazin, a regional adviser on H.I.V. prevention and care for the Pan American Health Organization, said of the epidemic. "It's there. It's there. It's there." 
The persistent growth in infections has underscored both the special dangers and challenges that AIDS holds for the region. Migration between islands -- and to the United States -- is common and helps spread the disease. But the possible isolation of islands under separate governments and different languages remains a huge obstacle to cooperation.
"Being an island is in a sense a figurative way to think about how things have been planned in an insular fashion," said Dr. Arletty Pinel, Latin America portfolio director at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
Political leaders have strongly spoken for prevention, casting AIDS as a development threat that they are trying to confront in order to avoid another Africa-style tragedy. If not, they will end up diverting scant resources to hospitals and clinics that are often hopelessly outmatched by the task of treating the disease.
Antiretroviral drugs for those already infected are almost nonexistent. Money, and often political will, is short. Programs that are effective find themselves quickly overrun. A state-of-the-art treatment program started last year in Barbados, for example, has now drawn more than 600 patients from all over the region. 
International donors, meanwhile, have mostly ignored the Caribbean in favor of poorer African nations. Money is now beginning to flow in, including some of the $15 billion pledged by President Bush and earmarked for Haiti and Guyana, another of the region's worst cases. 
But some leaders, while welcoming the decision, said the effort was insufficient. "Singling out those two we don't believe is the right approach," said Dr. Denzil Douglas, prime minister of St. Kitts and Nevis, who is considered among the region's most knowledgeable leaders about AIDS. 
"Because of the mobility of people within the Caribbean region," he said, "it is to some extent a demonstration of not understanding the nature of the epidemic."
Indeed, although Hispaniola -- the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic -- accounts for more than 80 percent of Caribbean AIDS cases, the Bush plan provides nothing for Dominican programs. Dominican officials said any fight against the virus must include joint programs with their Haitian counterparts. 
"The epidemic in Haiti is a reality, and it is out of control," said Luis Emilio Montalvo, director of the Presidential Commission on AIDS in the Dominican Republic. "It is the poorest country in the hemisphere with AIDS. And we are neighbors." 
Faced with that threat, Dominican officials have begun to confront the epidemic in ways that donors and policy experts hope could provide a model for the region. In many ways, the country shows both the challenges and advances in the Caribbean.
Dominican officials boast that a recent survey shows infections are 1 percent of the population, or half of what was originally estimated, a decrease they attribute to education and prevention campaigns. But the country needs to tackle the danger posed by migration from Haiti, as well as discrimination, denial and insufficient financing.
"I'm not saying all the barriers have been overcome," Mr. Marquez said. "But it is being discussed in the open and seen as something that requires national attention, because of the risk that it could undermine the whole society and have economic repercussions."

A Point of Entry
In a place called Peligro -- Danger -- the rapid-fire sounds of Creole, the language of Haiti, are more common than Spanish inside the houses of men who earn about $2 for each ton of sugar cane they slash. These bateyes, communities of sugar cane workers of Haitian descent, are among the epidemic's hot spots.
"The bateyes have been the point of entry for the disease," said Dr. Jose Alberto Roman, who works with H.I.V.-positive women in a nonprofit clinic in the nearby southeast coastal town of La Romana and supported by Columbia University. "When I first came here in the 1987, it was rare. Not anymore. Now it is something terrible."
But the epidemic is terrible not merely in its presence, but also in the ignorance that surrounds it and in the near total absence of resources to stem the spread of a disease that does not respect borders.
As it has in their native country, AIDS has ravaged the bateyes, where superstition, poverty and prejudice conspire against hope. The brother of one AIDS patient recently told Sister Anne Liam Lees, a nun who runs several health and nutrition projects, that the man had died from a spell cast by a creditor. 
"It's very difficult to confront reality if you do not think this disease exists," Sister Anne said. "Even if you told someone they were H.I.V. positive, they would not believe it. They would just go off and have sex with the first person they saw." 
Although several people in Peligro are dying from AIDS, neighbors insist that they do not have a clue. In the neighboring community of Batey 105, residents who are volunteer health educators insist that no one is infected with the virus, a dubious claim.
Hygiene is abysmal in Batey 105, where there is not even a single latrine. One health volunteer attributed an outbreak of fevers to a cold breeze, and many people are sick from diarrhea. Public health workers sometimes come by to hand out antimalaria medicines, when they have them.
If Sandy Senatic Feliz, a volunteer health promoter, is a front-line fighter against AIDS, then her arsenal is woefully inadequate. Every few months, she said, she is given a couple of dozen condoms. She still has five left from her last supply run about half a year ago. 
"We haven't had any infections here," she insisted. 
Sister Anne doubts that, because there is often a lot of traffic in and out of the bateyes, as many men go looking for construction or other jobs after the cane-cutting season ends. When they return ill, and die, she said, their widows often are forced to pair off with another man to secure a place to live.
"He comes back and spreads the virus without even knowing," she said. "Then she has to find another man because she cannot live alone in the batey. The houses are for the workers in the industry, and a single woman does not work in the industry."

Working the Clubs
A syncopated twang blasts through the open-air bar of Jhonnys Patio, as couples embrace and twirl under a flashing rainbow of lights. There is a forced festiveness to the scene, a payday party where men -- single and married alike -- dance and drink with prostitutes surrounded by murals of nudes. 
According to government estimates, as many as 80,000 people earn a living as sex workers in the country, and 4.5 to 13 percent of them may be infected. In Puerto Plata, a north coast resort town, sex is for sale at places from upscale clubs to car washes. 
The nonprofit Center for Human Solidarity and Promotion, or Ceprosh, is one of the country's most successful anti-H.I.V. programs and was founded in Puerto Plata in 1989, to help H.I.V.-positive people find new work, and to provide health care and enlist sex workers to teach each other and their clients about protected sex. 
Harder to reach are the bisexual gigolos or female massagists who cater to tourists but refuse to consider themselves prostitutes and resist prevention efforts. 
The tourist industry has been shy to confront the disease openly for fear of tarnishing its image. But the Punta Cana Group, which developed popular resorts on the island's eastern tip, recently signed an accord with the government -- the first of its kind in the Caribbean -- to finance H.I.V. awareness programs, as well as to help improve local health facilities.
Other innovative public and private efforts are emerging as well, like that of Ceprosh, whose workers do not use a classroom or clinical terms but take their program to bars and nightclubs using the attitude and language of the street.
At Jhonnys, several woman strut past while an emcee asks which one is clean. Another woman, part of the troupe, strides up to say looks are deceiving.
"How do you keep clean?" she asks rhetorically. "With a condom. Remember, no party without a birthday hat!"
The prostitutes laugh, and even their clients chuckle. The crowd applauds as the women drift out, distributing pamphlets and comic books with graphic depictions of how to prevent AIDS and other infections.
The bar owners-- some of whom charge the prostitutes a percentage for cruising for clients -- welcome these skits. 
"It's good for business, and the client is happier," said Jose Antonio Acosta, the owner of El Consulado. "You know the problem, so it's good to cooperate."
Women who work the clubs said they almost always used condoms with their clients, but they said sexism prevented them from persuading their husbands or pimps to do the same. Most women in the clubs sell themselves to help rear their children. Some work for pimps who have sex with several women, while others have husbands who have affairs.
Antonio de Moya, an epidemiologist at the Dominican government's AIDS commission, said such relations underscored a cultural contradiction common in the Caribbean, where using a condom with your mistress can be considered the same as being faithful to your wife. 
"The paradox of our culture is we have resolved Hamlet's dilemma," Mr. de Moya said. "For us it is to be and not to be. The culture is disjointed. We should be talking about fidelity or prostitution, not both."
The women who work in the industry say condom use is perhaps the best and only hope to slow the epidemic, even if programs like those favored by President Bush emphasize abstinence and fidelity as well. 
Josselina Reyes, a quick-witted woman who became a prostitute three years ago when her husband left her and a newborn child, said those options were fantasies.
"Abstinence and fidelity do not exist," she said, laughing. "Neither abstinence nor fidelity will make me any money. Only using a condom."

More Patients, but Few Tools
Two solemn relatives prop up a skeletal young man as he shuffles past Dr. Ivelisse Garris's office in the country's only public clinic offering comprehensive services for AIDS patients. Dr. Garris, a compassionate but overworked physician, frowned.
"That patient never should have been sent here," she groused, referring to the man. "In an ideal world he would have been treated closer to his home."
The problem, as on most other islands, is that hospitals and doctors lack the will or the resources to treat H.I.V.-positive patients, bouncing them from clinic to clinic. But the patients keep coming. Even Dr. Garris's clinic in the capital, Santo Domingo, is hardly enough for the 2,000 patients on its rolls, and it is open only on afternoons.
The clinic is not more than a warren of rooms on a second floor that is reached only by stairs, making it a daunting climb for weakened patients. Support-group members, some of whom have lived with the virus for more than a decade, meet regularly to encourage one another. Almost none of them, however, are receiving medication. 
It was only last year that the government started providing antiretroviral drugs at all, and then only after six patients brought a suit against the government in the Organization of American States' human rights court to make the drugs available.
This year, the Global Fund has approved a $48 million grant to the country, which officials said would allow them to provide medicines for 6,000 people and set up treatment centers. Advocates and aid officials are hopeful that the money will drive what they feel could be a model program.
But for now, medications remain unavailable in many places. Sixty patients at the social security hospital in Santo Domingo -- financed by the government, employers and workers -- have gone for two months without medications, increasing the risk of drug-resistant viral mutations. 
"There is no integrated attention in this country," said Felipa Garcia, director of the country's association for H.I.V.-positive people. "People go to hospitals and don't get the medicines they need. They might get tranquilizers or antibiotics, but that is not real care."
Doctors complain that they have not had deliveries of critical medicines in a program to prevent mother-to-child H.I.V. transmission, a large part of the epidemic's spread. Worse yet, some doctors, fearful of infection, have refused to perform Caesarean sections on H.I.V.-positive women, even though the procedure is crucial to reducing the risk of transmission to the child.
In Puerto Plata, fear of a personal crisis fills the waiting room at the public hospital each morning as pregnant women await the results of mandatory AIDS tests. Every week, a couple of people test positive, prompting denials and anger, doctors said. 
On this morning, a woman tethered to an intravenous unit squirmed in her chair, loudly protesting the suggestion that she was H.I.V. positive. Dr. Sonia Ramirez ushered her into a consultation room. 
"I'm ready for whatever," she said defiantly, insisting that she was not infected.
Dr. Ramirez gently repeated the test result. She pushed a slip of paper with it across the desk. The woman tore it into small pieces.
"I do not want my mother-in-law to know," the woman said. "My husband said you can live with this virus."
A few blocks away, several dozen members of an H.I.V. and AIDS support group were proving that that was so.
Even given the lack of understanding from employers, and sometimes family and friends, increasingly they and many others are dealing openly with the disease and its effects, waiting for medicines and government resources to catch up. 
Not that long ago, they would have been written off for dead. Now, they spoke about the future as a possibility, not a fantasy. Some have small businesses. Others are rearing children.
"This does not take away your dreams," said Elis Consuelo Collado, 31, who received a diagnosis 18 months ago. "You understand life continues."

HEADLINE: Hard Times Get Harder Upstate As Fiscal Crisis Spans New York 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN 

DATELINE: ELMIRA, N.Y., May 14 

 BODY:
Amy and Kevin Degnan were just the kind of people this small and ever-shrinking city needed. They were young and college-educated. They hoped to buy a house. 
 That was the plan, anyway, when they moved here from Buffalo two years ago. Mrs. Degnan was fresh out of graduate school at the State University at Buffalo with a degree in library science, and she got a job at the local library. 
 "I came thinking I'd try it for a couple of years and stay if we liked it," Mrs. Degnan said. "And I like it and wanted to stay." 
But now Mrs. Degnan, 26, and her husband, 34, are planning to leave Elmira, an old industrial city in the state's struggling Southern Tier, just as soon as they can. 
After an emotional meeting of the Chemung County Legislature, which was considering whether to cut several dozen county jobs, Mrs. Degnan assessed her chances of holding on to her library position. 
"I'll be the first one to go," she said. "I was the last person hired, so I'll be the first one out." 
The sagging economy and the state's money troubles are taking a grim toll here in the Southern Tier, a rugged patch of central New York just north of the Pennsylvania border. Already depressed by the post-1990's bust, which depleted the local tax base and increased unemployment, cities like Elmira and counties like Chemung are facing even worse times as the state's fiscal woes trickle down to localities.
The fallout can be measured both in political terms, as this solidly Republican region rails against Gov. George E. Pataki's pledge not to raise state taxes -- thereby forcing higher local taxes -- and in personal ones that can be counted with each individual who moves away. 
Upstate New York and counties across the nation are littered with communities like this one, where the steel mills, manufacturing plants and rail yards closed long ago. While some of these places felt the benefits of the economic boom of the 1990's, they did not experience the flood of prosperity visited upon downstate counties, towns and cities. Now that the tough times have returned, upstate communities are struggling to cope. 
"We have a lot to be proud of here," said Thomas J. Santulli, the chief executive of Chemung County, a largely rural area with 91,000 residents. He said the county had added hundreds of jobs, built new homes and held down taxes. "But now we are looking at a tough situation," he said. 
Chemung County's unemployment rate is creeping up. Sales tax revenue, the county's biggest source of income, is failing to meet projections, even though the county raised the sales tax rate to 8 percent from 7 percent.
The state's fiscal crisis is making the problems worse. School districts, facing stagnant state aid as the expense of running schools grows by double-digit percentages, are raising their tax rates to cover the gap. 
County governments are facing an increased tax burden as they struggle to pay their share of the state's ever-expanding Medicaid program. The state requires its counties to pay for 25 percent of the cost of these programs, which in Chemung County's case would mean $20 million. This year, Medicaid expenses will account for more than 100 percent of all county property taxes here. Mr. Santulli, like county executives across the state, is urging the governor and the Legislature to cut the number of benefits Medicaid offers to bring costs under control.
After years of giving next to nothing to the state pension system because the system's investments in the soaring stock market made contributions unnecessary, counties are stuck with multimillion-dollar tabs to cover pensions for their workers. In 2000, Chemung sent just $270,000 to the state for employee pensions. This year, the bill was $2.4 million. 
The financial misery means Mrs. Degnan will probably not have a job for long. Chemung County, the library's main benefactor, is looking to cut spending and raise taxes to close a $13 million budget deficit. Mr. Santulli is seeking to lay off dozens of workers. 
It is time forthe Degnans to move on. "I have been looking for six months," Mrs. Degnan. "As soon as I get something we'll have to go." She hopes to return to the Buffalo area. Mr. Degnan, a part-time personal trainer at a local gym, had to agree. "Pretty soon this place will be Nowheresville," he said, shaking his head. "Why would anyone want to live here at all?" 
The only way for the county to raise money independent of the state is to raise sales or property taxes. Chemung County would have to raise its property tax rate by more than 30 percent to close its budget gap. "The greatest job-killing tax there is," said Mr. Santulli, a Republican, "is the property tax." 
Homeowners face higher school taxes, too. The State Legislature restored the state aid to school districts that the governor cut from the budget but froze it at last year's level. Meanwhile, expenses like health insurance, pension payments and the ever-expanding need for special education programs mean that school district budgets for small cities grew by an average of 12 to 18 percent, said Vito DiCesare, president of the State Association of Small City School Districts.
"Now your choice is, which programs do I cut?" said Mr. DiCesare, who is superintendent of schools in Beacon, N.Y. "And how much can I raise taxes?" 
The Horseheads Central School District, with 4,600 students five miles north of Elmira, will raise taxes by almost 9 percent this year, and has had to trim spending on popular programs like advisers for musicals students put on.
"The cuts start at the top, with the things you want to offer, like advanced courses, but that the state does not require," said William Condon, the district's superintendent. For a homeowner like Gladys Haff, who is 77 and lives on Social Security and on the state pension she earned as a kitchen manager for the Horseheads district, increases in school, county and sales taxes are a crushing burden. "If the taxes go up too much, I won't be able to live where I live," Mrs. Haff said at a meeting of the Chemung County Property Tax Coalition at a diner in Elmira. Mrs. Haff lives in a 100-year-old farmhouse perched on 62 hilltop acres that had belonged to her husband's family. She pays more than $2,000 a year in property taxes. "I can't afford any more," she said. "I don't know what I would do." 
In neighboring Schuyler County, the poorer Odessa-Montour Central School District will have to raise taxes by more than 20 percent. The district has cut deep into nonessential programs, eliminating its prekindergarten program and postponing large purchases like new buses. The district picks up and drops off 900 children on dairy farms and in tiny villages and towns across 85 square miles of county roads, some rutted and unpaved. Some of the district's 17 buses are more than a decade old. 
"We just can't afford them this year," said Carol Boyce, the district's superintendent. 
Cities like Elmira will suffer, too. The mayor, Stephen M. Hughes, can point to everything new in his city, no matter how small. He takes a visitor to see these signs of progress with as much enthusiasm as he shows off Mark Twain's grave and the high school alma mater of Tommy Hilfiger, an Elmiran. There is the new auto parts store on the south side of town and a new coin laundry. When he stops for gas, Mr. Hughes notes that the Tops gas station represents a new investment in his hometown. 
Still, he is mayor of a struggling city whose downtown streets yawn with empty storefronts and shuttered windows. In 1960, there were 46,000 residents here; the 2000 census counted only 30,900. At the end of Lake Street, where the city meets the Chemung River, the only shops that remain are a pornographic bookstore offering 25-cent peep shows, a mortgage broker and an ancient office supply store. 
"We are a trickle-down victim of what happens at the state and the county level," Mr. Hughes said. "The taxpayer that pays county taxes also pays city taxes and sales taxes. They are all interconnected."
In the mid-1990's, Elmira enjoyed a modicum of prosperity. A state program that paid local taxes for new businesses that chose to locate in depressed areas brought in jobs and broadened the city's tax base. The city built a hockey arena that brought a breath of life into the desolate downtown, and today the minor league team that plays there is popular. City officials socked away more than $4 million for a rainy day. They did not raise taxes for seven years.
Almost in the blink of an eye, that changed. Suddenly, the sales tax money that had flowed into the city's coffers became a trickle. Job growth slowed. Costs for things like health insurance rose. The city's reserves dwindled to a couple of hundred thousand dollars. Last year, the city raised its property tax rate by almost 3 percent and this year by almost 2 percent. 
"You have to wonder if we aren't headed down that same road again," Mr. Hughes said. In the recession of the early 1990's, the state cut aid to small cities. "We lost $1.8 million in aid in one year, and we had to lay people off and cut services. It took the better part of five years to recover. Now we are back to square one."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY; 
Nothing Goofy as Disney Ducks Start Preparing for Stanley Cup Finals

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., May 17 

 BODY:
When the National Hockey League awarded an expansion franchise to the Walt Disney Company in December 1992, the company's chairman, Michael Eisner, wore a jersey designed after the uniforms worn in the hockey movie "The Mighty Ducks."
 On his head was a hat with the words Coach Goofy. The table in front of him was decorated with stuffed dolls of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. When someone asked him what he intended to call his team, Eisner said, "The Mighty Ducks." 
 When this drew a chuckle from the audience, Eisner looked around the room with an expression that seemed to say, "What's so funny?"
They are certainly not laughing now at the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. After 10 years in the league, even as Disney is trying to sell the franchise, the Ducks are heading to the Stanley Cup finals. They qualified with a 2-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Friday night at the Pond, a marble-walled arena down the road from Disneyland.
The victory gave the Ducks a four-games-to-none sweep in the Western Conference finals. Now Anaheim will wait to play either the Devils or the Ottawa Senators in the championship round. The Devils hold a 3-1 advantage in the four-of-seven-game series.
The Ducks will have at least a week off, and goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere said this would work in their favor. "Rest is a weapon and I think we can use it," said Giguere, who set a record for a seven-game series by giving up only one goal in four games.
Giguere and his teammates won the first three games by shutouts of 1-0, 2-0 and 4-0. The Wild scored first Friday night, on a goal by Andrew Brunette on a power play, but the Ducks prevailed on two power-play goals by Adam Oates and 24 saves by Giguere. 
"We've rode our horse a long way so far," Oates said, referring to Giguere.
The last minute was frantic as the Wild pulled goalie Manny Fernandez and came close several times to tying the score. "Kind of blurry," Giguere said, recalling the commotion around him. "Pucks were flying. It was like there were five pucks on the ice. I could hear the fans counting down the final seconds. I was counting down with them."
The victory came on his 26th birthday. The Ducks had played only three playoff rounds in their previous nine seasons and had won only one, in 1997. Now they have won three in succession behind a goalie who has ripened in his three years here. 
"It was a great birthday present," Giguere said. "Something I've been dreaming of since I'm a kid."
There are still more dreams.
When a league official presented the team's captain, Paul Kariya, with the Clarence Campbell bowl at center ice for winning the Western Conference, Kariya smiled politely, posed for a picture, then left the shining trophy on the table. 
"I didn't want to touch it," Kariya said. "That's not the trophy we're after." 
Although the team had been a popular success in its first few seasons, local interest fell off as the victory totals dwindled. The Ducks missed the playoffs for three seasons before this one. Nine of 41 regular-season home games drew crowds announced as less than 12,000 in an arena that seats 17,174. Some of the tickets sold were not used.
But Anaheim, seeded seventh among eight Western teams, opened the playoffs with a stunning sweep of Detroit, the defending champion, and a six-game elimination of Dallas, getting valuable rest breaks after both rounds. 
The most recent series might have been the easiest; the Ducks beat a sixth-seeded third-year team that was weary.
The Wild needed seven games to oust Colorado and Vancouver, both times after trailing by three games to one. Minnesota started the third round only 38 hours after completing the second and traveling from Vancouver to St. Paul in that span. Jacques Lemaire, the veteran coach of Minnesota, said of his players, "I could see that they were mentally tired."
His counterpart was Mike Babcock, a first-year coach who works for Bryan Murray, a veteran executive who is in his first season as general manager here. Along with Giguere, the best-known Duck is Kariya, a nine-year veteran who leads the team in postseason goals with five.
Babcock has persuaded Kariya and his teammates to accept a disciplined, defensive style, and Murray has added scoring skill and experience by acquiring Oates, Petr Sykora, Steve Thomas, Rob Niedermayer and Sandis Ozolinsh. 
As for Eisner and the Disney business, they are not much of a presence around the team anymore. Eisner's name is hard to find in the media guide and the Disney corporate name is barely seen. 
Along with Disneyland, another neighbor near the Pond is Edison Field, home of the Anaheim Angels, who were owned by Disney last season when they won the World Series. The Angels were sold this week, perhaps more attractive as champions.
When Eisner's company bought into hockey, the cost was $50 million. Even in a sluggish economy, the value of the team has probably increased in recent weeks. Although no one is laughing, there are plenty of smiles.

HEADLINE: Russia Finds in North Korea a Source of Cheap Labor 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: VLADIVOSTOK, Russia 

 BODY:
Amid the construction dust of a faux Southern California shopping mall, where cream walls, marble floors and luxury boutiques were taking shape, a construction worker resolutely pushed his wheelbarrow, ignoring a poster of a lingerie model, dressed in little more than a black cowboy hat.
 "The North Koreans are great, they don't smoke, they don't drink," said Grigoryi T. Akhoyan, the Armenian developer of the new downtown mall here. "I have friends in California who employ Mexicans. I think North Koreans work just as hard." 
 On May Day, Russians here were enjoying their holiday with a parade and concert by the docks of this Pacific port. But across an avenue, two North Korean stonemasons were working, tapping bricks with mallets to complete a sidewalk.
"Koreitsi," Russian for Korean, announced 14 classified advertisements listing the availability of North Korean workers in a recent issue of the Dalpress newspaper. The advertisements included words like "fast," "cheap" and "quality."
With their numbers rising here, North Korean construction workers are now so ubiquitous that one recent morning an American diplomat noticed a North Korean crew at work plastering the bomb-barrier flower boxes in front of the United States Consulate here. They were replaced with Russian workers.
In an inheritance from Soviet days, as many as 10,000 North Koreans work in the Russian Far East under a contract worker system. North Korea provides cheap labor under tight controls to the Russian Far East, which is short of labor, but fears Asian immigration.
By contrast, China gives no legal security to North Korean economic migrants. In a yearlong crackdown, China has forcibly sent back tens of thousands of North Koreans, often to harsh punishment at home.
With North Korea now the poorest nation in Northeast Asia, all of its neighbors -- China, South Korea, Russia and Japan -- have adopted contingency plans to block a sudden outflow of migrants in the event of a collapse of the Communist government. But while Japan, South Korea and Russia lack workers willing to do dirty and dangerous jobs, only Russia has been willing to accept North Koreans as guest workers.
"It is good the North Korean workers are here," Yuri M. Kopylov, Vladivostok's mayor, said in an impromptu interview on the edge of a children's folk concert. "They work all day long. There is no competition between North Koreans and Russians. There is work for everybody."
The arrangement allows the North Korean government to milk the maximum money from the workers, who generally come here on three-year contracts. Most of their wages are retained or collected by the North Korean state companies that bring them here, workers and employers interviewed here said.
Two North Koreans interviewed at an apartment renovation project here said their unit leader told them they must earn a minimum of $400 a month (close to the local minimum wage), which for most means moonlighting at private jobs. They are allowed to keep $100. This money, the men said, they either send home to their families or carry back on their yearly vacations. Although they often work 16-hour days, sleeping in apartments they are renovating, they said they considered themselves lucky to be working in Russia and hoped to renew their contracts.
The men asked not be identified in any way, saying that they could be harshly punished for talking about North Korea to foreigners. One man drew his fingers across his throat in a universal sign of execution.
"The men coming here realize they are prisoners of the system," Mr. Akhoyan said, referring to North Korea's hold over workers here. "But all the workers come here willingly. And when the contract is over, they seem to regret going."
The Armenian developer said he paid "about the same amount of money" to his 60 North Korean workers as to Russians with the same skills. The advantage to him, he explained, "is that the Koreans do a greater volume of work."
His North Korean foreman said in broken Russian that when his contract expired, he would "go home." Uneasy about talking with a foreigner, he said only that in North Korea he had a wife, son and daughter whom he only saw once a year during a monthlong vacation.
One North Korean dormitory here is on the third floor of an old merchant marine training academy in an industrial suburb. On a recent morning, about 12 North Korean men were fishing for dinner off a pier.
In a hallway leading to the dormitory's sleeping quarters, a red-and-gold banner brightened the drab interior.
"Our great leader, Comrade Kim Il Sung, will be with us forever! Hurrah for Gen. Kim Jong Il, the son of the 21st century!" read the slogans, referring to North Korea's late leader and his son and successor.
In the Russian Far East, North Korea's tightly controlled migrant worker system is welcomed by local authorities worried that uncontrolled Asian migration could end 150 years of European dominance here. On a visit to the region two summers ago, Kim Jong Il told an aide to President Vladimir V. Putin that the Russian authorities had his permission to shoot any North Koreans found dealing in drugs.
North Korea's worker control system is especially harsh in remote Siberian logging camps which, according to Amnesty International, are directly run by North Korea's ruthless Public Security Service. Escapees interviewed in Moscow in recent years have told human rights researchers that the North Korean camp authorities maintain private prisons and prevent escapes by rationing food and punishing would-be escapees with torture and sometimes execution. During the Soviet era, most logging in Siberia was done by prisoners in forced labor camps.
Viktor Ishayev, governor of Khabarovsk since 1991, has said in interviews with Russian reporters over the last year that the Russian authorities have regained control over the camps and have reduced the number of North Koreans loggers.
There used to be 15,000 North Koreans in labor camps," he said in a news conference in January. "Now 600 is the quota, mostly in logging."
On May 3, Ben Christie and Nicholas Wrathall, two documentary filmmakers, visited the Alonka camp, a 16-hour train ride and a 3-hour jeep ride from Khabarovsk, a regional capital. Even though the team had filming permits from Khabarovsk officials, Mr. Christie said, North Korean authority was made clear by a North Korean flag on a crane emblazoned with Korean slogans.
Mr. Christie recalled in a interview what happened when the workers spotted the team filming. "The chief came running up to the car," he said. "He tried to pull the aerial off. Then, he tried to pull the door off. Then he reached inside the car for the camera."
After the driver turned around, Mr. Christie said, "they threw a huge rock at the car." 
On their return train ride from the town of Chegdomyn, Mr. Christie and his crew found and interviewed a North Korean Communist Party secretary, in full uniform, who had been attending a meeting for camp overseers in Chegdomyn.

HEADLINE: Renaissance by the River 

BYLINE:  By D. DOMINICK LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
TODAY, the Dia Arts Foundation is opening Dia:Beacon, its new 300,000-square-foot museum on 31 acres along the Hudson River in southern Dutchess County. And Beacon, until recently just another city on the river with a faded industrial past, is poised to become a prime destination for art connoisseurs. 
 Over the last couple of years, as the art world woke up to the fact that Dia, the preeminent nonprofit organization that supports contemporary art, was renovating a space in Beacon, a number of excellent galleries have popped up downtown that have become a boon to established and emerging artists living and working in the Hudson Valley. Restaurants and antique shops have also opened in anticipation of a hoped-for onslaught of visitors. 
 The Dia building is itself remarkable. Built in 1929 as a Nabisco packaging factory, with its edge-to-edge skylights and high ceilings, it is perfectly suited for the work of artists who need cavernous space and natural light. The effect is of a temple where the spirit of the art on view can truly shine. 
 Dia:Beacon may be the newest attraction, but its setting is also remarkable, a draw in itself. Beacon's Main Street stretches east from the Hudson an easily walkable two miles lined mostly with newly restored two- and three-story brick buildings. Main Street is bounded by the Hudson River to the west; Mount Beacon, with its 1,500-foot peak, and its 32 miles of public trails, is to the east. To the north is Tallix, a world class foundry, most famous for its casting of Leonardo's "Cavalo," a 24-foot sculpture of a horse that was installed in Milan. 
 Bordering Main Street just to the south is the Madam Brett Homestead site, built in 1709, and visited by George Washington during the Revolutionary War, thought to be the oldest home in Dutchess County.

Chthonic Clash Coffeehouse
 Most recently, Nell Ogorzaly, a gallery manager and art dealer from New York City, opened one of Beacon's most compelling hybrid spaces, which promises to be a hot spot. It's called Chthonic Clash Coffeehouse (pronounced Thonic) from the Greek word meaning "of the earth" or "of the underworld." In addition to changing art exhibitions, the coffeehouse will hold poetry readings, musical performances and chess tournaments. Ms. Ogorzaly's hope is to create a contemporary version of the Cedar Tavern, a storied Greenwich Village meeting place in the 40's and 50's where artists, philosophers, poets, musicians and the like can meet to discuss all things important, which is why it looks more like a living room than a cafe. 
 "I want to create a feeling of openness and collaboration here," she said. "One of my favorite concepts, when one looks at designing and starting a business, is that people need three places to go: home, work and someplace else. I hope this place is that some place else." 

Minetta Brook
 Minetta Brook, a public art organization that commissions artists to create work related to sites in New York City and the Hudson Valley, also has a number of projects going on in Beacon. 
 Diane Shamash, Minetta Brook's founding director, said Dia had enticed her to come up in the summer of 1999 to look at the ways the building they had just purchased could be connected to the river through environmentally sensitive art. "We also looked at the ways other artists could be involved in that process, which began the Beacon connection for Minetta Brook," Ms. Shamash said. "We met with about 40 people, including, and especially a representative of Scenic Hudson. It was decided that Mount Beacon, Madame Brett Park, Beacon Landing and Denning's Point State Parks would be future sights for public works. Since we asked all of the artists to focus on the natural and cultural geography of the Hudson River, we named the program 'Watershed."'
 Three gallery spaces in Beacon are showing work by Minetta Brook's artists. A film by Petter Hutton titled "Two Rivers," which examines Henry Hudson's voyage to the North China Sea in 1609, can be seen at 199 Main Street. Another film, by Matthew Buckingham on the watershed, can be seen at 197 Main Street.
 Then there is an exhibition of works by 10 artists at the Minetta Brook offices at 4-6 South Chestnut Street, which includes several photographic works by James Welling and a new body of work by the photographer Matts Leiderstam: views of West Point taken through Claude Lorrain glass made in the 18th century.
 The initial financing for Minetta Brook came from Lee Balter, chairman the Tallix art foundry, a longtime resident of Garrison, and founding patron of Watershed. Since then, the financial support has come form small and mid-sized private foundations, the city of Beacon and Hudson Valley residents.

Beacon Cultural Project
 Sara Pasti is the deputy of the Beacon Cultural Foundation, which was developed as part of the Beacon Cultural Project headed by the team of David A. Ross, past director of the San Francisco Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art; and the real estate developer Bil Ehrlich. The Beacon Cultural Project comprises both commercial and not-for-profit cultural projects. Ms. Pasti oversees the Beacon Project Space and the Record Shop, a yearlong project by the artist Carrie Mae Weems that chronicles her experiences with the changing local culture and people of Beacon. In addition to changing exhibits, the Beacon Project Space sponsors cultural events including open slide nights, where the first 10 artists to arrive with their slides are given 10 minutes to show and discuss their work. 
 "It was successful not just because artists were able to show and talk about their work, but they also met other artists," said Ms. Pasti. "I often hear 'Gee, I saw this work around, but did not know who had done it,' or 'I see so and so on the street all the time, and never knew they were an artist."'
 Performing arts are not neglected.
 Beacon Project space holds movement workshops in which professional dancers work with the local high school students. 
 So why Beacon? The story is familiar; the confluence of affordable space, convenience and setting that has beckoned to artists in places like Soho and Chelsea in New York City, South Beach in Miami, the Loop in Chicago and San Antonio. "A few years ago, there were a lot of empty buildings here," said Ms. Pasti. "With the potential of the setting, and Dia moving up here, the train line from Manhattan, Interstate 84 close by, Stewart International Airport, the potential of artist's lofts in the industrial buildings -- all these things combined to make Beacon a great location for artists and creative businesses.
 "Beacon also has one of the friendliest populations I have seen anywhere," she added. "The people are very supportive. For me, it's important to be a part of a community, and Beacon is a great community."

Hudson Beach Glass
 Hudson Beach Glass converted a three- story firehouse into a commercial gallery complete with its own glassblowing studio for its four owners: Michael Benzer, Jennifer Smith, John Gilvey and Wendy Gilvey. The four were in Beacon long before the promise of Dia ever materialized. "Beacon was dumb luck," said Mr. Benzer. "We came to Beacon in 1984, because space was affordable, the business climate for our work was still good, and it's just a train ride away from the city." 
 Mr. Benzer and Mr. Gilvey design glass and sell it wholesale to department stores, galleries and museum stores all over the world. In their new space they will be selling their work retail.
 Jennifer Smith, who designs, and works in the glass casting area, also does a lot of the photography and designing, and feels at home with both the creative and business aspects of the business. Michael Benzer is the operations manager, keeping all the machines going. He is the main glass caster and designer. He creates molds, as well as his own 12-color palette from scratch. John Gilvey is the main glassblower, and is assisted by his wife, Wendy. 
 The four also plan to hold workshops and seminars "We want to show people that you can make a living as an artist," said Ms. Smith. "We've been doing it for years, and it can work. We're not just a town of galleries. There are many artists here."

Other Galleries
 Kate Rogovin opened Concentric, a commercial gallery space, about two and a half years ago. The front room showcases her art, a mixture of found object assemblages, resurfaced found objects, metalwork, fabrics and jewelry, while the back room is her studio where three looms, a large work bench and a seemingly endless supply of metalsmithing tools that she inherited from her father, fill shelves and benches. 
 "My goal is to create a more complete environment with furniture, art, objects and the rest," Ms. Rogovin explained. "People seem to feel more comfortable in an environment that is more complete and warm."
 Collaborative Concepts gallery opened in March 2001. The space was donated for one year, free of rent, by their landlord, giving the fledgling, not-for-profit space a chance to bloom. Now they rely on grants, individual donations, art sales and fundraisers.
 Success is not a given, said Mary Madden, president of Collaborative Concepts. 
 "It's a tough road; you're always watching the finances. There's heat, air conditioning, rent, exhibition costs, everything, yet so far, we've made it work. With the current state of the market and the economy, foundations have less to give and there are just as many people and institutions asking for help. That's why we are, more and more, involved with fundraisers."
 The gallery is also involved with the community in other ways. The director, Richard Bruce, emphasizes shows that include the best available art from the Hudson Valley as well as from New York City. The gallery has an artist in residency program where two artists are given free studio space for six months to a year. The gallery operates programs with the local high schools, and hires interns.
 In September of 2002, Carl Van Brunt opened the Van Brunt Gallery. He is most interested in abstract art with a high energy level that is as he says, "edgy or provocative in some way."
 He moved to the area two years ago. "I was in advertising, but I knew I did not want to be in advertising," he said. "It became obvious, very quickly, that there was an ingrained art community in the area, so it seemed right to open a gallery." I do represent artists, however I do not limit them in any way from exhibiting elsewhere."
 Van Brunt Gallery also has an important cyber presence. "When I started my gallery, I invested as much in my Web site, as I did in the physical space. I continue to invest in the web site -- every artist who has a one person show here, has a short video produced. I feel it helps people understand the art and the artist. Not everyone can come to the opening, so the Web site, with the video, gives everyone a sense of who these artists are."

The Howland Center
 The Howland Cultural Center is one of Beacon's most prominent buildings. Commissioned as a library in 1872 by the Civil War General Joseph Howland, the Howland Library was an instant success. It was designed by Howland's brother-in-law, the architect Richard Morris Hunt, who created a stirring structure with six gables, and an dome interior dressed in rich Georgia pine. The library itself moved to larger quarters in 1976. Over the last 25 years the Howland Cultural Center has been home to various cultural events such as concerts, poetry readings, lectures, dance performances and art exhibitions. This summer, they will feature the work of artisans from the area's three foundries: Beacon's own Tallix, Argos and Polich Art Works (PAW). 
 The Howland Cultural Center was placed on the National Historic Register 
 in 1972. Since the early 1980's, the center has experienced its own little renaissance, attracting those interested in art, culture and concerts. In fact, Main Street's gentrification began because of the presence of the Howland Center, long before there were any thoughts of Dia:Beacon. 
 Although many visitors will now enter the city on the west side, where Dia:Beacon is, when you drive in to the city from the southeast, with Mount Beacon on the right, the Howland Center is the first building that stands out, a majestic vertical statement. Main Street takes a graceful bend, and it's clear that the businesses there, galleries, restaurants and shops, are well established, beneficiaries of an earlier -- and still thriving -- influx of art.

HEADLINE: The Senate Energy Bill 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Before weighing the merits of the energy bill being considered by the Senate (editorial, May 12), your readers should also know other facts. 
 First, the bill enables our nation to rely more on a domestic energy reserve larger than the world's proved oil -- our 274 billion tons of coal. Official estimates say each ton equals up to 4.5 barrels of oil.
Next, its coal-specific provisions promote higher efficiency in power generation; lower national carbon intensity (for global warming); and the long-term availability of a reliable and reliably low-cost source of energy for our nation.
Finally, its research provisions ultimately support the initiative to vanquish carbon altogether with the hydrogen economy. Such things considered, your readers may conclude that this bill should be passed.

HEADLINE: The Senate Energy Bill 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "An Empty Energy Bill" (editorial, May 12):
 Those in Congress who dare to propose the nuclear solution understand the benefits of nuclear power. 
When compared with other energy sources, nuclear offers low production costs, energy security and stable supplies. Unlike coal emissions, waste from nuclear can be safely consolidated and contained. New nuclear plant designs offer the best means to produce the large volumes of hydrogen necessary for hydrogen to become the fuel of the future. 
 The notion of government investment in the electricity infrastructure is not new. Rural electrification in the 1930's was made possible by a legislated 2 percent interest rate. What you regard as an unenlightened commitment of resources today could tomorrow prove to be a brilliant act of social foresight.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
Madein Italy (Mostly), Driven in the U.S.A.

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PONTEDERA, Italy 

 BODY:
LINDA BOSTON cheers the hearts of executives in this dusty industrial town a short drive from Pisa.
 The day after Christmas last year, Ms. Boston, a magazine art director in Newtown, Conn., paid about $4,400 for a perky Vespa scooter in a shade she calls "toothpaste green." She didn't need it to buck trafficor to avoid the difficulty of finding a parking space, the motives for many Europeans who buy scooters. Most of her driving is in rural Litchfield County. 
 "A friend planted the idea, suggesting it might be fun to have a little scooter," Ms. Boston said in a phone conversation. "It's cool, but silly, too." 
Her purchase was welcome news here because the American market remains just about the only bright spot on a uniformly bleak scooter landscape for Europe's manufacturers. Not too long ago, they recall wistfully, they made the scooter once again the object of European desires, introducing a flurry of sexy new two-wheeled vehicles to outfox Japanese competitors who had almost driven them out of business.
By 2000, European manufacturers were churning out more than 1.6 million scooters, with clean-burning engines and catalytic converters, and Europeans unhappy with urban congestion and high gasoline prices scooped them up. So did many Asians. Piaggio, which makes Vespa, was assembling 250,000 scooters a year with a partner in India, and it had eyes on the Chinese market.
But by last year, European companies -- including Piaggio, the biggest scooter maker, with $1.1 billion in annual revenue -- were suffering anew as their home market collapsed. The economy turned down, and sales slumped 25 percent, to 1.2 million scooters. 
Moreover, the Asian offensive stalled, too. Piaggio stopped making scooters in India, concentrating instead on the light, three-wheeled commercial vehicles originally based on scooter technology.
Now, the industry appears set for a huge reorganization. The first step may have come last week, after the Italian investor Roberto Colaninno agreed with Piaggio's main shareholders and a gaggle of creditor banks to pump 250 million euros, or $285 million, in fresh cash into the ailing Piaggio.
The deal, if completed, would give Mr. Colaninno, who first made headlines in 1999 with a $30 billion hostile takeover of Telecom Italia, a 30 percent stake in Piaggio. A further 30 percent would be held by the current principal shareholder, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, a unit of Deutsche Bank, and 40 percent by the banks through a debt-for-equity swap.
In 2001 and 2002, Piaggio posted losses that its executives say were a result of service on its gross debt of 570 million euros. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had borrowed about half of that sum to finance its leveraged buyout of the company in 1999. The capital increase would cut the debt.
"In Piaggio, I see a great opportunity to enter the market for the urban transport of people and goods," which is plagued by pollution and congestion, Mr. Colaninno said in an interview this month in La Repubblica, a daily newspaper.
News of his move prompted much speculation that Piaggio was his first step toward consolidating the Italian two-wheeled vehicle industry by combining scooter makers with motorcycle makers.
"The purer you are a scooter maker, the bigger your problems," said one industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We believe there will be consolidation."
Indeed, Piaggio had experienced the problem. In 2001, it acquired 20 percent of Agusta, a maker of expensive motorcycles like the Cagiva and Husqvarna, with an eye toward taking complete control. But disagreement over reorganization of Agusta's debt, estimated at 250 million euros -- about $213 million at the time -- thwarted a takeover.
Others had the idea of consolidation, too. When Deutsche Morgan Grenfell acquired control of Piaggio in 1999, it outbid the Texas Pacific Group. Earlier, Texas Pacific acquired Ducati, the company that is to motorcycles what Ferrari is to cars, with the idea of creating a range from the smallest scooters to the biggest superbikes. Deutsche Morgan's success in acquiring control of Piaggio scuttled the plan.
Both scooters and motorcycles have suffered from the general economic slump, experts say, though scooters have suffered most. Last year, European sales of two-wheeled vehicles with engines larger than 50 cubic centimeters fell 8 percent, to 457,000; sales of the smaller scooters plummeted 14 percent, to 762,000.
IN Italy, Europe's biggest market for scooters with roughly 40 percent of sales, a new law requiring riders of scooters and motorcycles to wear helmets hurt scooter sales by eliminating a reason to buy the smaller bikes. At the same time, insurance premiums for scooters rose more than 1,800 percent in the last decade, according to one estimate.
Sales of small scooters have also suffered because of the economics of the business: bigger bikes mean fatter margins. Piaggio has steadily introduced larger scooters with more powerful engines. The Granturismo, introduced in March, has a 500-cubic-centimeter engine, disc brakes and a catalytic converter. It can be equipped with a vapor recycling device that enables it to meet emissions standards even in California, where they are particularly strict. The Granturismo costs more than $4,000 even before options are added.
Some makers say they have benefited from a mix of scooters and motorcycles.
Aprilia of Italy, Europe's No. 2 maker, says it is pursuing a shift that it started last year toward higher-powered scooters and motorcycles. Monica Baretta, an Aprilia spokeswoman, said the higher price of more powerful models "translates into a more restrained drop in overall revenue."
In trying to re-establish itself in the United States, Piaggio is borrowing marketing strategies from others. When tightened emissions and safety laws led it to bail out of the United States in 1982, Piaggio first redesigned its Vespas to meet American standards. Then, three years ago, it copied Ducati's idea of establishing fancy showrooms and opened the first of a chain of Vespa Boutiques on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles. There are now 61 in the United States.
Last year, scooter sales in the United States climbed to 69,000, from 12,000 five years earlier, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council.
"We're just seeing the beginning, especially as people realize they can actually replace the use of the car for many things," said Douglas Day, the owner of Scooter Centrale in Plainville, Conn. Mr. Day, 45, sells scooters from Malaguti and Piaggio of Italy and Kymco of Taiwan. In December, he started a Vespa Boutique and has since sold about 22 Vespas.
His customers are "quite a range," he said. "Everything from college kids, for on-campus use, to retirees, who remember them from when they were young."
That connection with "la dolce vita" -- many Americans first saw a scooter when they watched Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn tool around on a Vespa in the 1953 movie "Roman Holiday" -- gives Italian scooters a marketing advantage over their Asian competitors.
Mr. Colaninno, however, is less romantic. Though he acknowledges having driven a Ciao, one of Piaggio's smallest scooters, as a youth, he recently told reporters that he avoids motorized vehicles for environmental reasons.
His vision for Piaggio, he added, is to meet the needs of modern city dwellers oppressed by pollution and congestion. Vespa's greatest recent success has been in big cities like Paris, London, Rome and Milan, he said.
"Our strategy will concentrate on answers to those needs," he said, "through the production of a scooter and very light commercial vehicle."
Still, Ms. Boston in Connecticut wasn't particularly thinking about the environment when she acquired her Vespa. "It's as cute as a bug," she said. "People notice it."

 THE CLINTON WARS
By Sidney Blumenthal.
Illustrated. 822 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30.
 I ONCE asked John Connolly, the former Texas governor and aide to Lyndon Johnson, if he had deposited personal and public records at the L.B.J. Library. "Yeah," he replied of the papers, which number in the millions of pages, "but you ain't gonna find the whole story there." To paraphrase Churchill on wartime allies, the only thing worse than having incomplete or sanitized records is not having them.
Charting the Clinton administration's eight-year history is probably going to be more difficult than studying any recent presidency. Besieged by lawsuits that threatened to engulf almost everyone at the White House, Clinton assistants shunned paper or e-mail records of their daily deliberations. One told me that he would go down the hall to confer with his division chief face to face rather than discuss an issue on the telephone. Before joining the administration, Sidney Blumenthal recalls, he watched White House officials who "had to cope with stress and depression, and became exhausted" after being drawn into lawsuits. He himself "incurred about $300,000 in legal expenses," he estimates, and cites a survey that puts the costs to the White House staff from Kenneth Starr's inquiries -- in July 1998, before impeachment reached a head -+at $8 million. 
The constricted record makes Blumenthal's sprawling 800-page memoir of his four years as a presidential assistant, from 1997 to 2001, a welcome addition to the literature on Bill Clinton's tumultuous second term. A journalist with stints, most notably, at The New Republic, The Washington Post and The New Yorker, and the author of several books, Blumenthal brings a reporter's keen eye for telling detail and a columnist's talent for considered analysis and unmistakable opinion to his reconstruction of what he calls "the Clinton wars." (John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, gave senior staff members a Lucite paperweight, Blumenthal writes. "It depicted a roller coaster encircling the White House and was inscribed, 'I Survived the Clinton White House 1993-2001.' ")
Domestic and foreign policy issues form a part of Blumenthal's discussion, particularly Clinton's efforts during his second four years to keep the focus on the economic and social problems at home and international strife in Africa, the Balkans, Latin America and the Middle East. But public controversies erupting out of private actions -- above all the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton's impeachment and Senate trial -- dwarfed the country's and the world's business and turn "The Clinton Wars" into a kind of lawyer's brief for the accused.
Blumenthal had found the chance to serve at the White House in general and with Clinton in particular irresistible. He describes working in the West Wing "like being in a turbocharged think tank that was also the ultimate political clubhouse that was also the office of the assignment editor for the nation's press." He compares it to "a 24-hour pickup basketball game," and says it brought past presidencies and even ancient kingships to life: the "West Wing was a vantage point from which one could see the widest expanse of American politics."
As for Clinton, he exuded the qualities of John F. Kennedy that had first drawn Blumenthal to politics. "My early perceptions of modernity," he writes, "about the relevance of intelligence, of the expanse of country and the world, about what politics means, about social mobility and social inclusion, all stem from Kennedy." Clinton had his own special attributes: he was a human dynamo, always in motion. A man of exceptional intelligence, "he rewrote every single speech, marked up every memo that crossed his desk and circulated daily to his aides and friends dozens of newspaper and magazine articles he had read, almost always underlining key parts and writing comments in the margins." His "thorough knowledge of government policy was prodigious. Rarely did anyone in the room know more than he about a given policy's details or implications when it was discussed." And in Blumenthal's view, the policies themselves were wise and constructive, expanding the economy, renovating the welfare state, improving educational institutions; it amounted to "a recasting of the national ideal."
Blumenthal paid a substantial price for his White House schooling and loyalty. Matt Drudge put out a story, soon retracted, that he was a wife beater. He was accused of participation in a cover-up of Clinton's dalliance with Lewinsky and of defaming her as a stalker, and was nicknamed "Sid Vicious" by the right-wing press. He drew Congressional, media and legal fire as an unbending partisan and co-conspirator in Clinton's transgressions, deserving of a prison term. 
Blumenthal remembers the experience as a daily test of discipline: "Anger, frustration, suspicion, doubt had to be suppressed. . . . Self-control didn't arrive on the doorstep like the daily newspaper. I had to put on a suit of armor every morning -- and keep it fastened all day long. While the blows rained down there was little to do but weather them. Inexpressiveness became the psychological order of each day, exhaustion the constant physical condition. . . . Self-denial was the price of public service that had to be paid."
At one level, Blumenthal's memoir may be seen as the counterattack, the release, he felt compelled to resist at the time. The book is partly an exercise in score settling: Kenneth Starr, Dick Morris, Christopher Hitchens are just a few of the tormentors who get the back of his hand. The book is also an exercise in something all too familiar to inside-the-White-House memoirs -- an exaggerated picture of the participant's importance. Comparing himself to the Antichrist in the eyes of the Christian right, Blumenthal "wondered which of my traits had invited this invective." Holding center stage, as his massive volume attests, might be one answer. 
The book offers a powerful and generally persuasive defense of Bill, Hillary and Blumenthal. But this will hardly be the last word on "the Clinton wars." The Clinton presidency will underscore the proposition that history is argument without end. It will also challenge historians to explain why the political combat of the 90's was so fierce. American politics, of course, has never been a vocation for the thin-skinned. Every president has been the object of scathing attacks, including the country's three greatest chiefs: Washington complained of " 'unmerited censures' of the vilest kind"; Lincoln was ridiculed as the "original gorilla"; and Franklin D. Roosevelt attacked as a demented "cripple."
Blumenthal sees the modern news media, with their affinity for scandal-mongering, as principally responsible for recent political bashing. But personal attacks on public officials are as old as the Republic. Newspapers, Alexis de Tocqueville observed in 1835, "disregard principles to seize on people, following them into their private lives and laying bare their weaknesses and their vices." 
Blumenthal may be closer to the sources of our current politics of hate when he says that Clinton's impeachment was "a monumental battle over very large political questions: about the Constitution, about cultural mores and the position of women in American society, and about the character of the American people. It was, ultimately, a struggle about the identity of the country." More specifically, we can see the 90's as a time of clashing cultural values: a battle for the soul of the country between 60's Clintonites -- pot-smoking, draft-dodging, womanizing practitioners of the counterculture, as the Christian right described them -- and bigoted, hypocritical evangelists, as the left would have it, preaching a return to God, country and family values while in pursuit of self-serving personal and political ends. 
Whatever the sources of the Clinton wars, they will be remembered as a low point in the country's history. Caricatures demonizing political enemies are an all too familiar and ugly side of the national experience, but they reached a level never before descended to in the Clinton impeachment. Clinton's egregious act of self-indulgence was outdone by an impeachment based not on constitutionally required high crimes and misdemeanors but on a vindictive determination to bring down a president who had offended self-righteous moralists eager to put a different political agenda in place.
As Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago said, "It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and division," and, he could have added, of energy on a personal matter that distracted the national government from attending to the many domestic and international problems crying out for action. 
Blumenthal's book may do more to stir old controversies than settle them. But participants in the Clinton wars would do well to understand that re-fighting 90's battles will be of less benefit to the country than detached analysis explaining how we can avoid future unproductive quarrels over the personal weaknesses of our presidents. Still, for anyone who wants to revisit the political acrimony of the Clinton years, Blumenthal's book is the place to begin.

HEADLINE: How Architecture Rediscovered The Future 

BYLINE:  By Arthur Lubow; Arthur Lubow is a frequent contributor to the magazine and last wrote about the architects Diller + Scofidio.

 BODY:
In 1988, the Museum of Modern Art in New York showcased seven architects who had accomplished far more as thinkers than as builders. Of the group, Bernard Tschumi had obtained the grandest commission, for a large-scale Paris park, La Villette; but even though he had been working on it for five years, completion was still far off. Among the others, Tschumi regarded Frank Gehry of California, in practice for a quarter-century, as a senior colleague; yet, at that point, Gehry's best-known work was his own Santa Monica residence, notable for its use of plywood planks, corrugated steel and chain-link fencing. Rem Koolhaas was the author of a dazzling, much-read architectural manifesto, as well as the designer of a tiny house in Rotterdam and a dance theater in The Hague. Peter Eisenman was a longtime professor whose pugnaciously impractical Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, was just finished. Daniel Libeskind, Zaha Hadid and the Viennese team of Coop Himmelb(l)au were theorists and teachers, with a knack for winning competitions with exciting schemes that usually failed to find financing. 
 By the end of the 90's, however, these architects were directing large offices and erecting major buildings all over the world. In a turnabout as far-fetched as a didactic children's story, the ugly ducklings had gone from being unable to get any work to swanning about with a disproportionate share of it. Those prestigious projects they didn't nab went to other "advanced" practitioners, some of them relatively restrained formally (Renzo Piano, Arata Isozaki, Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel, Rafael Moneo, Alvaro Siza, Tadao Ando, Herzog & de Meuron, Toyo Ito), and some of them aggressively out there (Thom Mayne, Makoto Sei Watanabe, Santiago Calatrava, Diller + Scofidio, Mecanoo). Provocative, serious buildings cropped up in the unlikeliest places (Midwestern second-tier cities, the Australian wilderness) and not just as museums, airports and corporate headquarters, but also as public schools and multiplex cinemas. What was going on? Had a golden age of architecture arrived? If, like me, you thought so, a tougher question followed: Why? 
 It was tempting just to say "the Bilbao effect," wave your hand and move on. Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao was the big arts story of the 90's. An overpoweringly beautiful building with a baroque extravagance of form and an exquisite sensitivity to its site, the Guggenheim Bilbao transformed an industrial Spanish backwater into a cultural mecca. Tourism quintupled. The fact that its opening in 1997 coincided with and ultimately eclipsed that of Richard Meier's orthodox Modernist complex at the Getty Center in Los Angeles (a hometown project Gehry dearly wanted) underscored the power of avant-garde architecture. Five years later, Gehry's museum is no longer attracting 100,000 visitors a month, but it has retained its allure: in 2002, not a bumper year for world tourism, the Guggenheim Bilbao drew 851,628 visitors and generated more than 162 million euros for northern Spain's economy. Although Gehry's building dominates attention, it is only one part of a municipally subsidized effort, which includes Norman Foster's subway system, an airport and bridge by Santiago Calatrava and an under-construction high-rise development by Arata Isozaki. The goal: to change the city's identity through architecture. 
Like any big-stakes, winning gamble, Bilbao's good fortune has inspired other cities and institutions to take the plunge. Nothing underlined that truth better than the award of the World Trade Center redevelopment project to Daniel Libeskind, after an aborted attempt had been made to give the job to a conventional corporate firm. Weirdly enough, cutting-edge architecture has become de rigueur. This development is encapsulated by a remark that the director for the National Center for Contemporary Arts in Rome made a few years ago to Koolhaas, who had entered the competition (which Hadid eventually won) to design its new museum. "We need a building that does for Rome what the Guggenheim did for Bilbao," Koolhaas was told. As the architect later remarked to me, "That is a staggering statement, because Rome doesn't need to be put on the map." 
Wherever it crops up, the new architecture manages to call attention to itself. Bucking the styles that predominated in the 80's, the best new buildings don't look backward historically or sideways contextually; they look optimistically forward. "Architecture is about exploring new territory," Tschumi says. Other than this refusal to blend in, however, the best contemporary architecture doesn't share a style. Even the seven architects lumped together in the 1988 Museum of Modern Art show under the confusing (and, as it turned out, nonsticking) label of "deconstructivist" varied wildly in their approach to form. They agreed completely on only one thing: most of what was then being built by the historical recyclers of postmodernism and the small-town nostalgists of New Urbanism depressed them.
Is there anything that unites a building like the Dominus Winery in the Napa Valley, designed by the Swiss firm of Herzog & de Meuron, with Koolhaas's Educatorium on the campus of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands -- other than that both were completed in 1997 and both take your breath away? The Dominus headquarters is a private facility for the manufacture and storage of wine. Austerely rectilinear, with two huge cutouts that frame the mottled green landscape, it has one extraordinary feature: its exterior is clad in gabions, the rock-filled wire cages typically used to shore up embankments. Functionally, the stone insulates; it also, depending on the density of the fill, modulates light. To see the sun seeping through the multiple fissures of this building, which in its massive simplicity is otherwise so solid, is a mysteriously beautiful experience. By contrast, the feeling that you get walking through the Educatorium in Utrecht is one of swoopy euphoria. The concrete entrance ramp to this student center slopes up toward a wall that eventually curves over on itself to become the ceiling; the glass boundary of the cafeteria is sharply canted, with supporting columns spaced as irregularly as birches; and throughout the building, materials oscillate between rough and polished concrete, plywood and fine veneer and wire mesh and solid steel. The Dominus Winery and the Educatorium would seem to have nothing in common, other than their originality. However, in both cases, the architects were determined to find new methods and materials to satisfy the client's needs in unconventional ways. Both buildings, in addition to fulfilling their functions, make a powerful impression. Indeed, making an impression may be their most important function.
Before the Bilbao effect, there was the Beaubourg effect. Jean Baudrillard coined the term to describe the way in which another celebrated museum building, the Pompidou Center of 1977 by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, drew visitors to the rundown Beaubourg district of Paris. In the view of the dyspeptic Baudrillard, these museumgoers were being circulated as efficiently and impersonally as the air and water that passed through the building's prominent external ductwork. As Joan Ockman of Columbia University points out, both the Pompidou and the Guggenheim Bilbao are "alien objects dropped in from another world," but it makes a difference whether the object is dropped onto a world capital or a second-tier city.
Many of the museum directors in search of a Gehry-like crowd-pleaser preside over collections of contemporary art. The "difficulty" of modern art is such an old story that you can only imagine the gratification of a museum professional, inured to selling tickets to the sullen, the baffled and the dutiful, upon seeing jubilant throngs queued up at the door. Architecture at the moment boasts an enviable advantage: alone of the arts, it has an avant-garde that is genuinely popular. It appeals both to the critics and to the populace. If anyone doubted that the art exhibits at the Guggenheim Bilbao are at best secondary, Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin might have been a laboratory-designed experiment. Opening without exhibits, it drew in the first two years 350,000 visitors, who usually had to wait patiently to enter a bare museum.
Cutting-edge architecture -- unlike literature, art or music -- delivers sensation without requiring decoding. Its widespread appeal evokes comparison to a pre-Modernist Eden, when Verdi was a popular hero and Dickens a best seller. Like Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York and Jorn Utzon's Opera House in Sydney, Gehry's Guggenheim in Bilbao quickly became an icon. These are not ordinary buildings. Also in this category are the Eiffel Tower and the Seattle Space Needle -- spectacular edifices that didn't need to pretend to be "serious" buildings, since they were designed as symbols of World's Fairs. The gasps of delight elicited by the Guggenheim Bilbao remind me of the gee-whiz euphoria of the Futurama exhibit at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. (The gasps of horror at the Jewish Museum in Berlin are the dystopic variant of the same phenomenon.) And sharp intakes of breath are what the client wants: the gee-whiz response is perhaps the most important element of the program. Gehry told me that Bilbao's Basque government "asked for a Sydney Opera House. They needed that to happen. If it had been a quieter and less provocative work, it wouldn't have accomplished what they were seeking. The tightrope I walked was between doing what they wanted and having it work as a museum." To be sure, that imperative can produce meretricious results; but as programmatic demands go, "Dare!" is a godsend.
Looking for explanations for the flowering of advanced architecture, you must acknowledge the computer. Technological progress has done relatively little to produce masterpieces in the other arts (spectralist music, digital installation pieces, George Lucas special effects and Radiohead notwithstanding), but in architecture, the computer has opened many doors. Back in the early 60's, the structural engineers at the Ove Arup firm devised a system of more than a million repetitive ceramic roof tiles to compose the curved sails of Utzon's Opera House. Otherwise, it could not have been fabricated. A generation later, for the Guggenheim Bilbao, Gehry employed computer technology from the aerospace industry to dictate the various sizes of unique panels that his hand-drawn sketches and crumpled-paper models demanded. However, that was a transitional step, like the cast-iron Classical columns from the turn of the last century, which presaged the era of structural iron and steel. To the next generation, Gehry and his ilk, who use the computer merely for fabrication, seem sadly outmoded. The younger architects compose at the computer screen, with three-dimensional programming to render their unorthodox forms. "I used to study sculpture," says Winka Dubbeldam of Archi-Tectonics, a New York firm. "I can't think flat. I design everything 3-D from the beginning." 
For architects, computer-aided modeling is more than a new tool -- it creates a whole new way of thinking about design, in which structures grow with an organic responsiveness of form to function. Greg Lynn, a pioneer in the field, talks about the blob replacing the box. But Dubbeldam finds even that formal dichotomy outmoded. "It always seems to me that a box and a blob are the same thing," she says. "They are singular. With a sensitive volume, you get something more precise that reflects the surroundings." Going back and forth between the demands of the site and the client's program, she aims with three-dimensional modeling to design a structure that will fit properly, in the way a good helmet fits a head. She is using the sort of computer modeling that produced "Shrek." And the same public that consumed the movie is devouring new architecture.
If advanced architecture is popular, shouldn't it be marketable? The verdict is still out. A well-publicized plan to transform an unremarkable stretch of Hamptons property into the Houses at Sagaponac, designed on spec by interesting architects (Meier, Hadid and Steven Holl among them), has slowed in the two years since it was announced (only one house is under construction). A plan for Guadalajara that is more ambitious by several orders of magnitude, bankrolled by the Mexican herbal-supplements mogul Jorge Vergara Madrigal, is said to be fully financed. Enrique Norten of the firm Ten Arquitectos, who has been working with Vergara for six years, says that construction will begin at the end of the year. Along with a convention center by Ten Arquitectos, this megadevelopment on the edge of Guadalajara has recruited an all-star lineup of contemporary architects: a corporate headquarters by Jean Nouvel, an entertainment center by Coop Himmelb(l)au, a contemporary art museum by Toyo Ito, a sports arena by Thom Mayne, a hotel by Zaha Hadid and an educational and cultural institute by Daniel Libeskind. If completed, it will out-Bilbao Bilbao. "He wants to make it a competitive city in the network of cities," Norten says of his client. "He wants to build all this infrastructure and, by attracting conventions, culture and entertainment, make the city a world destination. It's about reinventing the city."
Vergara conceives of his development as a moneymaker. Most avant-garde architecture that gets built today is triggered by the profit motive. Even the nonprofit museums, which have taken the place of the Roman Catholic Church as the primary patrons of grand-scale architecture, are choosing ambitious designs in the hope of raising their profile and boosting attendance. (The church, of course, had a similar agenda.) It is perhaps instructive to contrast the Bilbao and Guadalajara schemes with the most celebrated conglomeration of cutting-edge architecture in the heroic age of Modernism: the Weissenhof Exhibition that Mies van der Rohe master-planned in Stuttgart in 1927. Apartment blocks and houses designed, among others, by Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Hans Scharoun, Bruno Taut and Mies himself -- the provocateurs of their day -- explored the capability of new technologies (steel frames, concrete slabs) to provide low-cost housing for working people. This was a distinctly other approach to reinventing the city, an approach that today seems even more dated and distant than the strip windows and flat roofs of the International Style. The goal then was to provide shelter and community; the aim now is to generate excitement or, maybe, to heighten awareness.
Although innovative architects still win commissions to create low-cost housing, the schemes are too often fatally compromised by budgetary or bureaucratic constraints. (Diller + Scofidio's Slither Building in Japan is a cautionary example; the final built product was stripped of many of their more interesting concepts.) High-cost housing faces other obstacles. "It's very expensive to build a curveball in New York," says Richard Born, who developed two 15-story residential towers designed by Richard Meier on the Greenwich Village waterfront. "When you build a courthouse or a museum, no one prices it per square foot. But when you build an office building or a condominium, you have to stay within the boundaries." Born says that in the West Village neighborhood of his project, condominiums were selling for an average of $700 a square foot -- which is about what it cost to construct the Meier-designed towers. Marketing the building as "a landmark property designed by one of the century's great architects," he says that he sold almost all the space within a couple of months, for an average of $1,500 to $1,600 a square foot. However, despite that triumph, when he investigated whether he could get bank financing to replicate the project on a neighboring lot, he found that the banks were still insisting on using market averages to determine loans. "Unfortunately, most bankers are not architecture aficionados," he says. 
Dubbeldam of Archi-Tectonics has designed another downtown New York condo, this one on the western fringe of SoHo, to be completed late this summer. Alongside and over a renovated warehouse, she has wrapped a glass-skinned tower that observes the zoning setback regulations -- not with the conventional steps, but with attention-grabbing bulges and undulations. "Codes and regulations don't have to be restrictions; they can be inspirations," she says. Like Meier's buildings, Dubbeldam's apartments are being marketed as architecture; without a Pritzker Prize-winning architect's name or the High Modernist correctness of the Greenwich Village project, they will be sold for less money to a more typically downtown clientele. (Among the buyers of the Meier-designed condos are Calvin Klein and Nicole Kidman.) "He's going to make more money than a normal developer would on a cheap building," Dubbeldam says of her client. That may be; but the larger point is that he is not a normal developer, he is an investment banker and architecture lover who is pursuing the project as an avocation. The typical developer will continue to build cheap, sell high and get out fast.
The progress of architecture depends as much on clients as on architects, and good clients are more plentiful in good economic times. The last decade was a boom period all around. "You're too late, it's dead in the water," Gehry said gloomily, when I called recently to sound him out on the Bilbao effect. "When people had money, they were adventuresome. When things tighten up, everybody pulls back." Gehry did manage to recently complete his performing-arts center for Bard College in the Hudson Valley (to great acclaim). But in the last few months, some of the more daring museum renovation plans have been scrapped. Koolhaas's brilliant, cantilevered concrete annex to the Whitney Museum of American Art has been abandoned, and his tear-down, start-over plan for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is halted indefinitely. Libeskind's Jewish Museum in San Francisco is being scaled back. Gehry's Guggenheim in Lower Manhattan is off, and his Corcoran Gallery annex in Washington is stalled. 
A curmudgeonly critic might also observe that inspiration is as exhaustible as financing. Gehry's rippling, tilting volumes would have seemed shopworn had they popped up on the East River; even worse, the jagged forms and acute-angled window slashes that were so disturbing and apposite in the Jewish Museum in Berlin turn outto be stylistic tics that have recurred in every Libeskind project since. 
But whatever the temporary setbacks in cash or creativity, the goalposts of the architectural game have shifted. The public has developed an appetite for new architecture, and Gehry, Koolhaas, Libeskind and Hadid have become establishment figures, even while clinging to their avant-garde credentials. Intriguingly, a project by Diller + Scofidio is being discussed for the East River site on which Gehry's Guggenheim would have risen. When the names under discussion for a large-scale project in New York are Frank Gehry and Diller + Scofidio, you know that, despite the economic downturn, things are looking up.
The new architecture at its best forces the user to notice or rethink conventional behavior: even in its quietest renditions, it insists that you enter a contemplative state. Naturally enough, this architecture tends to find form as museums, airports, libraries, convention centers, concert halls, stadiums -- places that people visit for a limited time. Even those who adore roller coasters wouldn't choose to live on the Cyclone. Cutting-edge residences are invariably one-family houses commissioned by cutting-edge clients. People with less rarefied taste often will insist that they "like modern architecture" yet find a particular building that they use daily to be hostile and ugly in its avant-garde design. 
That complaint was voiced recently by many of the Strasbourg commuters waiting for the tram at the Hoenheim-Nord station designed by Hadid. "Maybe it is not done?" more than one asked hopefully. Placing another sort of confidence in the future, a more sympathetic user predicted, "I think people will appreciate it in 20 years." Time, of course, provides the critical test. With its oversize dovecotes and sundials, Palladio's Villa Barbaro at Maser, Italy, designed for enlightened clients, would have struck most visitors in the mid-16th century as exceedingly bizarre; now it is generally regarded to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. Time, too, will judge whether a structure like the Guggenheim Bilbao is a gorgeous artifact of its time (the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper" in titanium) or a timeless classic (the Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds").
The appeal and the limitations of avant-garde architecture are illustrated by a remarkable structure that was erected in 2001 in Groningen, a small city in the Netherlands. Even in architecture-besotted Holland, Groningen is an unusual case. Under the influence of a design-conscious alderman, the city began in the early 90's to enlist the services of leading avant-garde practitioners. (Of the seven architects spotlighted in the 1988 Modern show, all but Gehry have built at least temporary structures in Groningen.) The intent was both to draw attention to a town that was isolated on the nation's northern periphery and to engage citizens in thinking about their urban environment. As part of the campaign, John Hejduk, the dean of the school of architecture at Cooper Union in New York, was invited to build a small tower in the city center. Well known for his explorations of architectural theory, Hejduk was the quintessential paper architect. Very little of what he designed was built, and the Groningen tower, which fell victim to local politics, was no exception. In a compensatory mood, the city donated land at the edge of a new housing development for the construction of one of Hejduk's early experimental investigations, the Wall House 2, from 1973. There was, however, a condition: that a buyer be found to shoulder the construction costs. For a decade, the developer sought unsuccessfully to find a patron for Wall House 2. Hejduk died in 2000. At that point, the city and the development company resolved to build the house on spec, as a tribute.
Once the house was finished, at a cost of about one million euros, it was obvious why a deal had been so elusive. A 45-foot-tall concrete wall cuts through the structure. "You could regard the house as being inverted, with the wall as a centerpiece," explains Olof van de Wal, the coordinator of the Center for Architecture in Groningen. "All volumes are attached to it. There is no way of passing from one volume to another without coming to the wall, which means climbing up or down a spiral stair." There are other challenges as well. "The entrance is at least 15 meters from the living space, because of the large hallway you have to walk through," van de Wal continues. "Also, there is the element of voyeurism. Each time you move from one part of the house to another, you are very visible to everyone on the outside. Even in private actions you take, there is this brief moment of visibility to the outside." As he sums it up: "The house doesn't make it easy to live in the house." A couple of elderly architecture devotees negotiated for eight or nine months, but in the end, probably discouraged by the cost and the spiral stairs, they backed out. Now the plan is to turn Wall House 2 into a cultural center. Each year, three or four artists, writers or architects will live there, then try to describe the experience. At certain times, the house will be open to the public. As a house, Wall House 2 is a nightmare; as a house-museum, it should succeed brilliantly. And as a guidepost to the route architecture has traveled over three decades, it is magnificent.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: F.H.A. Insurance Restriction; 
Limit Adopted On Fast Resales

 BODY:
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has adopted a rule aimed at limiting the sometimes predatory practice called "house flipping."
 Under the regulation, mortgages on homes resold within 90 days of their acquisition will not be eligible for insurance issued by the Federal Housing Administration. 
The F.H.A. insures about one million mortgages a year, about 15 percent of the entire market. 
 "The Bush administration is committed to maintaining a strong housing market in which consumers can feel confident that they are protected from unscrupulous practices," Housing Secretary Mel Martinez said in a press release.
Sarah Ludwig, executive director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Project, an antipredatory lending advocacy group based in Manhattan, said: "We've had a lot of scams in which unsuspecting first-time buyers purchase woefully overappraised homes. An investor buys a property and cosmetically fixes it up. Then, working with an appraiser, the seller gets the appraiser to value the home at a significantly higher number than it's worth." When the new buyer defaults, the seller receives full payment through the F.H.A. insurance.
Calling the rule "a good first step," Ms. Ludwig said, "There is some concern that 90 days might not be long enough; the bad guys could sit on a property for 90 days and then sell it."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Name ThatTune About Tax Cuts

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ONE of the most enduring political images of the last generation is the one of Arthur Laffer, an obscure economist from the University of Southern California, scribbling a parabola on a cocktail napkin one night in the late 1970's to illustrate how tax cuts would lead to more government revenue, not less.
 The Laffer Curve became the basis of a whole political movement. Prominent politicians like Jack F. Kemp, then a Republican congressman from Buffalo, bought the theory. Then Ronald Reagan adopted it, and it became the justification for the main plank of his 1980 campaign for president (in the face of the elder George Bush's ridicule that it was "voodoo economics"). After Mr. Reagan was elected, he rammed through Congress in 1981 a tax cut that was then the biggest ever, and his staff produced forecasts showing that within a few years, the budget would be balanced. 
 Of course, the budget deficits mushroomed. In economics circles, the idea that tax cuts would pay for themselves was never widely held and was mostly abandoned by the late 1980's. Supply-side economists, as they call themselves, argued instead the much less provocative point that budget forecasters should take into account the view, accepted by nearly all economists, that the revenue lost from $1 in tax cuts would be somewhat less than $1 because of economic growth generated by lower taxes.
But that is far too sophisticated for a political sound bite. To this day, either directly or indirectly, conservative Republican politicians leave the impression that taxes can be lowered with no effect on the deficit.
At almost every stop as he tours the country to promote his tax-cut plan, George W. Bush makes the two-step argument that the way to deal with the budget deficit is to make the economy grow, and that the way to make the economy grow is to cut taxes.
His staff is more direct. In a television interview last weekend, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow was asked about studies showing that the Bush plan would lead to a rising deficit. "Well, it's actually going to be lower," Mr. Snow declared, "because none of those studies have factored in the feedback cycle -- that is, as the economy grows and gets stronger, more people are at work; there are more government receipts."
George Stephanopoulos, the ABC News moderator, said, "That sounds like supply side."
Mr. Snow replied, "The truth is, a growing economy leads to more government revenues, not the other way around."
Over the years, the accepted practice at the Office of Management and Budget and in Congress has been to assume that the government's revenue loss from a tax cut would be equal to the size of the tax cut. It was not that the revenue estimators believed that there would be no revenue effect from the economic stimulus of a tax reduction. It was that the disagreement was so vast over how much the effect would be.
This galled the many Republicans and conservative economists who believe that lower taxes are the solution, whatever the problem. So, this year, Representative Bill Thomas of California, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, ordered the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's expert tax staff, to project how much additional revenue would be produced by the stimulus from the tax bill the House approved this month.
THE tax staff is highly professional. But it answers to the Republican majority, and Democrats braced for an extravagant projection that would put them on the defensive as the plan moved through Congress. Instead, the report now circulating around Congress estimates that the "revenue feedback" from the House bill would range from 5.8 to 27.5 percent in the first five years and from 2.6 to 23.4 percent over the full 10 years covered by the bill.
"Eventually," the staff found, "the effects of increasing the deficit will outweigh the positive effects of the tax policy."
In other words, the economic return would be so small that even in the short term, the deficit would grow by at least three-quarters of the size of the tax cut and probably more.
Mr. Thomas's reaction was surprising. The study proves that the bill "stimulates the economy, creates jobs, brings more revenue back to the federal government," he declared during the House debate. "That's what this bill is all about," he added.
Democrats were amused at his attempt to paint a pretty picture on a spoiled canvas. Actually, declared Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, the report "should dissipate the pie-in-sky mirage that tax cuts will dramatically grow the economy and pay for themselves."

HEADLINE: Argentina, Turning the Corner, Leans to Its Left 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
THE day after Nestor Kirchner qualified for a presidential runoff vote here late last month, the stock market plunged more than 8 percent. Investors who had been expecting a second round for a pair of more market-friendly candidates were disconcerted by the strength shown by Mr. Kirchner, the little-known Peronist governor from Patagonia with the populist image.
 Now, Mr. Kirchner, 53, is about to become president of this ravaged country, catapulted into power by the unexpected withdrawal on Wednesday of Carlos Saul Menem, Argentina's president during the 1990's. But on Thursday and Friday, the peso fell by a total of 5 percent against the dollar, reflecting the market's jitters about Mr. Kirchner's warning that "I will not be prey for corporations" and his attack on "groups and sectors of economic power that benefited from unacceptable privileges during the past decade." 
 When he takes office a week from today, Mr. Kirchner will inherit a situation that is alarming but nowhere near as desperate as it was a year ago. With the Argentine economy finally showing signs of bouncing back from the worst crisis in the country's history, the question on the minds of investors and economists is this: Will he make things better, or will he make them worse? 
American companies have a significant stake in any recovery here: in recent years they have consistently supplied a fifth of Argentina's imports, which fell to $8.9 billion in 2002 from $20.3 billion in 2001, as a result of the economic collapse last year. They also accounted for a fifth of all foreign investment. In addition, American banks, bondholders and pension funds are among the largest holders of the public debt on which Argentina defaulted in December 2001.
The challenges confronting Mr. Kirchner, whose administrative experience consists of 12 years as governor of a province of less than 200,000 people, are daunting. He must resolve disputes on compensating banks and utilities, force powerful provincial governors to reduce spending and begin negotiations on a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund -- all at once and all within a short time, without the benefit of a resounding election triumph.
"The timetable is important," said Rafael Ber of Argentine Research, a market analysis firm here. "He needs to get the economy growing again, and he is going to have a short, short, short honeymoon -- three months at the most. Everyone wants results in the shortest possible time."
The most pressing concern, of course, is the country's debt burden, which has risen to more than $170 billion, the equivalent of nearly 140 percent of gross domestic product, since a default was announced late in December 2001. A rollover agreement reached with the I.M.F. in January this year expires barely two months after Mr. Kirchner takes office, and the new administration is scheduled to pay about $9 billion back to multilateral lenders by year-end.
STILL, Argentina has already confounded pessimists who predicted that the country would collapse unless it moved quickly to reach an agreement with the I.M.F. In fact, the economy is expected to expand 4 to 6 percent this year. Tax receipts are zooming, consumer confidence is up, and inflation has leveled off at less than 20 percent.
"The economy is remarkably stabilized," Anne O. Krueger, deputy director of the I.M.F. and one of Argentina's most implacable critics last year, said in an interview this month with La Tribune, a French financial newspaper. The interview has been widely cited by government officials here as proof that they were correct to resist the fund's demands for sharper spending cuts. "To the surprise of everyone, including myself," she said, "Argentina has returned to growth, without falling into hyperinflation."
But what does Mr. Kirchner plan to do? In the wake of his cruise to victory, market analysts here and abroad are trying to decipher his record and his campaign talk. They have found some of it frankly alarming: he has hinted, for instance, that he might nationalize the country's railways and has also talked of repudiating that part of the foreign debt he considers "illegitimate."
"We are not disposed to do everything to continue paying international creditors at the expense of the hunger of Argentines," Mr. Kirchner said in a meeting with the foreign news media here late last month. "We are going to insist on a considerable reduction in the debt and interest rates and a rescheduling" that will "allow Argentina to rearrange its external accounts."
On the campaign trail, Mr. Kirchner has defined his economic philosophy as "neo Keynesian" without providing much in the way of specifics. But he has talked, of a huge public works effort to lift the country out of nearly fiveyears of recession, led by a program to build three million new homes, which he says will create five million jobs in a country where the unemployment rate has been running at record rates of more than 20 percent.
But most economists say it would be a mistake for the new government to try to spend its way back to growth and jeopardize the budget surpluses that the markets and the I.M.F. expect. "You need to have saved during the boom to be able to spend in the troughs," said Juan Luis Bour, director of the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research, based here. "But what happens when you start from a point where you're broke?"
As a candidate, Mr. Kirchner also declined to meet with an I.M.F. delegation, leaders of the country's main industrial federation and the United States ambassador here. But now that he is about to take office, business leaders are predicting that the man who ran as a left-of-center populist will take a cue from Brazil's new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
"The difference from Menem is not going to be that great because the degree of freedom available to him as president is going to be limited," said Carlos Perez, executive director of Fundacion Capital, an economic consulting firm here. "He is going to turn out being someone like Lula, who frightens people during the campaign but, once victorious, begins to moderate his discourse and ends up being more Catholic than the pope."
One sign of continuity is Mr. Kirchner's indication that both the economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, and the Central Bank president, Alfonso Prat Gay, will be retained in their posts. Both men are already in touch with the I.M.F. and other multilateral agencies as well as private creditors and have won their grudging respect with fiscal and monetary policies that are considered to be prudent.
As governor of an oil-rich province, Mr. Kirchner has also shown himself to be a fairly canny money manager. When the state oil company was privatized in the 1990's, the provincehad a choice of becoming a shareholder in the new company or taking a cash payment. He chose stock and then watched as the shares the province had obtained for less than $20 each rose to nearly $50, at which point he ordered the province to cash in. It earned a windfall of more than $500 million.
Then, rather than deposit those proceeds in an Argentine bank, he moved them abroad, fearing that in the crisis that everyone saw looming, the federal government might try to seize the money. He was proved correct in December 2001, when bank accounts here were frozen and then converted from dollars into devalued pesos. After Argentina defaulted on most of its $141 billion in public debt, he moved the money from the United States to Switzerland and Luxembourg to avoid creditors in New York who were trying to get compensation.
BUT until Mr. Kirchner shows his cards and makes his peace with the I.M.F., foreign investors here prefer to keep a safe distance and remain silent. American companies ranging from Johnson & Johnson and Dow Chemical to MetLife and Kimberly-Clark declined or did not respond to requests for interviews to discuss prospects for the Argentine economy under his administration.
Since the default and subsequent currency devaluation late in 2001, foreign investment, which had been running as high as 4.5 percent of G.D.P. in the 1990's, has virtually dried up. The only outside capital flowing into the country has come from bargain hunters making purchases at fire-sale prices: Canadian and South African interests buying up gold mines, and Brazilian conglomerates acquiring the country's largest oil company and brewery.
In that meltdown, American companies may have been hurt less than their European competitors. French, Spanish and Italian companies in particular had invested heavily in electricity, water, gas and telecommunications -- all sectors that were hit especially hard by the devaluation of the peso and the government's refusal to allow tariff increases to compensate for that change.
The financial sector was perhaps clobbered even more, thanks to the government's decision to convert debts and credits from dollars into pesos at significantly different exchange rates. Big players like Citibank and Bank of Boston were affected. But a higher portion of American investment appears to have been channeled into businesses related to agriculture, which rebounded quickly and accounted for most of Argentina's exports last year.
"It was a bumper year for them out there" in the countryside, said Jorge H. Forteza, a regional vice president for Booz Allen & Hamilton here, referring to wheat, soy and meat producers. 
Some foreign companies that were already here have also moved to take advantage of idle capacity and the much lower labor costs brought on by the devaluation of the peso. I.B.M. has moved its Latin American telemarketing operations here from Miami and has also stepped up its software development locally.
THE recent growth, though, is mainly a result of domestic investment. Argentines are estimated to have sent more than $100 billion abroad before bank accounts were frozen in December 2001 and to have placed an additional $30 billion under their mattresses, and some of that money is starting to trickle back into promising economic areas like textiles, shoes, auto parts and the processing of dairy products.
"The beginning of the recovery was mainly driven by export-oriented sectors and import substitution activities," said Fernando Losada, an Argentina market analyst at ABN Amro Bank in New York. "But fortunately that initial spark has passed over to the rest of the economy, and you are now beginning to see a more generalized recovery."
Exporters want to keep their own momentum, however, and have been pressing the departing government to brake the strengthening of the peso, which before last week's declines was up nearly 20 percent against the dollar this year. The exchange rate here at the end of last week was about 2.87 pesos to the dollar.
Because Mr. Kirchner is from a province that exports not just oil but also products like mutton, wool, fish and gold, analysts see him as sympathetic to a slightly weaker peso.
Mr. Kirchner has also declared that his foreign policy will be one of "no automatic alignments." That means he is more enthusiastic about strengthening trade ties with fellow members of Mercosur, the South American common market, especially Brazil, than about seeking a bilateral agreement with the United States or joining Washington's Free Trade Area of the Americas.
Even before taking office, Mr. Kirchner and other Argentine officials have begun preliminary talks with the Brazilian government about coordinating exchange rate policies. The Argentine peso and the Brazilian real have been trading recently at roughly the same level in relation to the dollar, and officials hope to maintain them within a fixed band as the first step toward creating a common Mercosur currency.
The first signals of Mr. Kirchner's direction will come this week, beginning with the naming of his cabinet, scheduled for tomorrow. The uncertainty will not last much longer than that, becausethe political chaos of the last 18 months has left those now in power eager to hand off the entire mess as quickly as possible to the fresh, but unfamiliar, new face from Patagonia.
"Kirchner could turn the country either way," Mr. Forteza said. "Yes, he is a gigantic unknown. But he is a gigantic promise as well."

HEADLINE: Surprise! The Fed Isn't Just Greenspan 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FROM his leather chair with the brass nameplate reading "Mr. Greenspan," the chairman of the Federal Reserve commands an institution that often seems to speak in a monolithic voice.
 The meetings of the committee that sets the Fed's benchmark interest rate are closed to the public, and its decisions tend to be unanimous, an unusual pattern in this city. Even the minutes of the meetings do not mention the opinions of individuals, instead describing the combined wisdom of "members," "many members" or "some members," despite the Fed's moves toward greater openness since Alan Greenspan became chairman in 1987. 
 In recent months, however, disagreements that are often expressed only around the Fed's two-ton mahogany table have begun to seep out of the high-ceilinged boardroom overlooking Constitution Avenue. They have added to the uncertainty hanging over the American economy and appear to have contributed to the dollar's recent fall. 
The question at the center of those debates is easily the most important one facing the economy today: After three years of weak growth, is a post-bubble hangover raising risks not seen in 70 years -- like deflation -- or is the country finally on the verge of escaping its long slump?
"The committee is divided," said Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Fed in the mid-1990's and now an economics professor at Princeton. "And you can see why. It's a tough call right now."
Mr. Greenspan is the Fed's most important optimist, marveling at the economy's ability to avoid a deep recession despite a series of economic shocks that have included accounting scandals, the pricking of a stock market bubble, two wars and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He has told Congress that the war with Iraq was the main reason that businesses began making big job cuts again this year, and he has tried to assure investors that there are no deep flaws in the nation's system of corporate governance. 
Some of his colleagues are sounding less sanguine notes, however. William J. McDonough, the departing president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has said that problems with accounting standards and executive pay continue to harm the economy -- and need solving. Anthony M. Santomero, the president of the Philadelphia Fed, recently went out of his way to refute the idea that the Iraq war was the sole cause for slow growth, noting that the recovery began losing momentum last summer.
The differences have also put a few cracks in the Fed's usual unanimity, which Mr. Greenspan is known to cherish as an important sign of stability. Late last year, for the first time since 1995, one of the Fed's seven governors, Edward M. Gramlich, voted against Mr. Greenspan on an interest rate decision, preferring to encourage spending with a new rate reduction sooner than most members did.
Regional Fed presidents, who vote on a rotating basis, have dissented much more often. Robert D. McTeer Jr., the president of the Dallas Fed, voted with Mr. Gramlich at the meeting last year. That was the first time two dissenting votes had occurred at the same meeting since before the economy began to weaken in 2000. 
And after the most recent meeting of the Fed's rate-setting committee, on May 6, it released an unusually detailed statement that was widely viewed as a compromise. While the group voted unanimously to hold short-term rates constant, it specifically warned of a further and substantial decline in inflation.
Reasons to worry about deflation -- a broad decline in prices that can happen when economic demand is weak for an extended period -- have only increased since the meeting. The Labor Department reported on Thursday that wholesale prices fell in April at the steepest rate since 1947, and the government said Friday that consumer prices declined at the sharpest rate in 18 months. Some of the declines are a result of a decrease in oil prices that is unlikely to continue.
"We've had a lot of people running around saying, 'Deflation -- it can't happen here,' " Harvey Rosenblum, the research director of the Dallas Fed, said in a telephone interview last week. "I think it can."
Mr. Greenspan has not been one of those people. In recent months, he has publicly discussed the risks of deflation, and Fed staff members here have been studying ways they can lift growth, and prices, if they lower their benchmark rate to zero. The rate is now at 1.25 percent, the lowest since 1961.
Indeed, the differences on the Fed are not ones of night and day. Mr. Greenspan and other optimists do not discount the problems that deflation could create.
"The Federal Reserve has to guard against further declines from the already low prevailing level of inflation. And we shall," Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, said Friday during a graduation ceremony at Washington University in St. Louis, according to a transcript. But "the United States has too many good things going for it to make a forecast of deflation credible," he added, citing the Fed's previous rate cuts, a drop in oil prices, the end of the war and an increase in consumers' and companies' net assets.
In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Santomero, the Philadelphia Fed president, said the weak labor market and a low level of business spending remained troublesome. During a three-week tour of local companies that he had just finished, however, he said he had heard early rumblings of confidence.
"People are saying things are flat to slightly up. 'Meandering' is a word people use," said Mr. Santomero, a longtime finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania before joining the Fed in 2000. "But there is also some good news. Some businessmen say they have been on the sidelines long enough."
Some Fed watchers wonder whether part of the debate has been engineered by Mr. Greenspan so that the Fed can present a nuanced view of the economy without unnerving investors.
"People at the Fed don't want to be too clear if being too clear would be discouraging," said Wayne D. Angell, a former Fed governor under Mr. Greenspan in the late 1980's. "The chairman naturally has to be much more careful in what he says because it is watched so carefully."
Mr. Angell added, "There's no use having all these people ifeverybody's going to follow the same line."
But nobody seems to doubt that at least some of the disagreement is real, and investors have noticed the results. After the Fed warned of deflation this month, although without using the word, the dollar fell and has generally continued dropping; a euro is now worth $1.1578. The dollar is now near the level when it became Europe's currency on Jan. 1, 1999.
The internal debate is particularly important now because Mr. Greenspan has lost the air of omniscience that he possessed during the boom. He is still considered one of the most effective chairmen in the Fed's history, in part because of his prescient view that the economy had become more efficient in the 90's and therefore could grow quickly without accelerating inflation. Economists also credit him with keeping the 2001 recession mild through aggressive rate-cutting. 
But he has been as surprised as most economists at the persistence of the current economic slowdown. In May 2001, he said that there was "ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations." That pause continues today.
In March of last year, he said that "the forces restraining the economy over the past year are starting to diminish" and that the job market seemed to be improving. The economy has lost an additional 353,000 jobs since then, according to the Labor Department.
At its core, the debate inside the Fed involves whether the risk of more economic weakness is now great enough that it should act even more aggressively by cutting rates further.
"There certainly have been some differences on when to go the last mile on the federal funds rate," said Alice M. Rivlin, a former vice chairwoman, referring to the official name of the Fed's benchmark rate, the interest rate on overnight loans between banks that directly affects the rate on many credit-card, automobile, business and other loans. "It's a very dicey situation."
If the economy continues to weaken and job cuts continue, consumers could eventually pull back their spending more sharply, setting off a vicious cycle that could include deflation. Deflation can cause people to wait for future discounts on products and make their loans harder to pay off because each dollar of their debt is worth more. 
Robert T. Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, said last month that "if this remains a jobless recovery, it can weigh on consumer confidence and lead people to pull back on spending."
"Frankly, the longer growth has to depend on the auto and housing sectors, the riskier the situation becomes," he added.
But if the Fed does cut the rate again, it would leave itself with less ammunition to fight an unexpected economic shock, like the overthrow of an important foreign government or the collapse of a big American company. Fed officials also want to avoid cutting rates excessively, and having to surprise the markets by raising rates later this year if the economy does strengthen quickly.
Disagreements within the Fed have been common, even during Mr. Greenspan's relatively tranquil tenure. Two things set recent months apart from the past few years: the number of officials who are more worried than Mr. Greenspan and the background of the skeptics.
William H. Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed, has long been considered an inflation hawk, dissenting to vote for a rate increase in 1998 and against a cut in 2001. In March, however, the board of the St. Louis Fed, along with the San Francisco board, requested that the Fed reduce one of its key rates, a symbol that it wanted a cut in the benchmark rate, according to minutes released Friday. 
"It's a hint that within the Federal Reserve system there was serious chitter-chatter going on" about cutting rates again, said Ethan S. Harris, a co-chief economist at Lehman Brothers. Regional Fed boards rarely ask for a cut if their president strongly disagrees, said Mr. Harris, who worked at the New York Fed for almost a decade.
The Fed last reduced its benchmark rate in November, for the 12th time since January 2001.
The dissent in September by Mr. Gramlich, a Fed governor and former economics professor at the University of Michigan, also turned heads. 
"I was astonished," said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a liberal research group in Philomont, Va. "He's the very epitome of a mild-mannered guy personally. Like every Clinton appointee, he has taken great pains to keep the face of unanimity."
Looking at the risks facing the economy, though, some officials seem to have decided that aggressiveness has become more important than unity.

HEADLINE: Sleight of Hand on Capitol Hill 

 BODY:
The tax-cutting frenzy inspired by President Bush earlier this year has produced a predictable result: two misguided, poorly timed tax bills from the House and Senate that will not provide the short-term stimulus the country needs but will almost surely cause economic problems in the future. The two bills now head for a conference committee. There is little to root for in these deliberations, although one very useful provision in the Senate bill must survive. It would give $20 billion in emergency fiscal aid to deficit-ridden states whose budget problems will inevitably be compounded by the federal tax cuts. The conferees should also resist White House pressures to deepen the tax relief for dividends, which would make a bad bill worse. 
 Any list of the flaws in these bills should begin with one that has received less notice than it deserves, namely their fundamental dishonesty. You'll recall that President Bush originally asked for $726 billion in cuts over 10 years to go with his $1.3 trillion cut of two years ago. Everyone said that was too much, so the House passed a $550 billion bill, the Senate a $350 billion bill. Both numbers, as it turns out, are fictitious. 
 The Senate bill, for example, calls for substantial dividend tax relief that will "sunset" in five years so that the overall cost of the bill will not exceed the $350 billion limit. However, if one assumes (as one must) that the promised sunset will never occur, and that the dividend relief will instead become a permanent part of the tax code, then the true cost of the bill becomes $660 billion. Similar sleight of hand disguises the true cost of the House bill, which sunsets everything in sight -- child tax credits, marriage penalty relief -- and whose true cost, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is $1.1 trillion.
The real numbers also mean that the economic impact of the eventual bill will be larger than advertised. Only two years after the original Bush tax cuts helped wipe out an expected $5 trillion surplus, the new cuts, combined with various spending increases, will add trillions more to a coming decade of red ink. This in turn will increase the need for federal borrowing, push interest rates upward and boost the cost of capital for private investment. For these reasons, a host of critics, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, believe that the measure's long-term negatives greatly outweigh its potential for short-term stimulus. 
Of course, as we have noted before, the bill's greatest flaw is its one-sidedness -- the fact that it will unfairly reward upper-income taxpayers while shortchanging lower-income groups and crippling the federal government's ability to meet vital needs in education, veterans' care, transportation and homeland security. Perhaps the conference committee will remedy some of these inequities, though we're not holding our breath. 
Meanwhile, a little over one million people have exhausted all their state and federal unemployment benefits, a number that will grow by another 700,000 this summer. In addition, 2.1 million workers will soon exhaust their state benefits. All these people need help from Congress. Such help would not only compensate in some small measure for these unfortunate tax bills but would give the economy a quicker, more certain shot in the arm.

HEADLINE: Bored With Baghdad -- Already 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
Last Wednesday two top U.S. generals in Iraq held a news conference in Baghdad's half-wrecked convention center. The subject was deteriorating security and the two officers, Lt. Gen. David McKiernan and Maj. Gen. Buford Blount III, were pummeled by the press about why they weren't doing more to make Baghdad safer. It was 102 degrees, and in the middle of the session all the lights went out. The two generals looked like they were enjoying this encounter about as much as a root canal. At one point General Blount, explaining why his men didn't just shoot looters, said: "They were not threatening soldiers. They were just stealing something."
 Frankly, my heart went out to the generals, both of whom distinguished themselves in this war. First, they were stuck explaining U.S. policy in Baghdad, because Jay Garner's hapless nation-building team rarely spoke to anyone, and his replacement, L. Paul Bremer, had just arrived. 
 But the generals were also miscast because they and their men are trained to kill people, not chase looters. Neither they nor their men want to be serving as the police, and they were not prepared to do that. They came to Baghdad with 1,800 military police officers. Saddam Hussein used 20,000 police officers to control this city of five million.
But when Saddam vanished, so did his police and government. This created a power vacuum that we were not ready to fill. This unleashed the looting, which Donald Rumsfeld blithely dismissed with his infamous line: "Freedom is untidy. Free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things." And so they did. Many pieces of Iraq's economic and governmental infrastructure -- which the U.S. Air Force carefully spared with its smart bombs -- were destroyed from the ground up by dumb looters or saboteurs, while we watched. Chaos is untidy. Freedom requires limits.
Drive around Basra and see what looters have done to just one institution: the 12,000-student Basra University. It looks like a tornado hit it. Looters have made off with all the desks and chairs, ransacked the library, and were last seen by my colleague Marc Santora ripping out window frames and digging up cables. Check out some of the factories around Baghdad, or many ministries, power plants, oil refineries, police stations, water systems. All have been hobbled by looting -- which is why power is in short supply, phones don't work, and gas lines are a mile long.
"There are no police in my neighborhood, no judge -- I can kill you right now and no one will say a thing," Hasanian Muallah, an engineer, said to me. "We're very happy to get rid of Saddam, but we're depressed by the situation on the street. People don't care who is going to be vice president. They just want a government."
I am sure things will improve. But after traveling around central Iraq, here's what worries me: The buildup to this war was so exhausting, the coverage of the dash to Baghdad so telegenic, and the climax of the toppling of Saddam's statue so dramatic, that everyone who went through it seems to prefer that the story just end there. The U.S. networks changed the subject after the fall of Baghdad as fast as you can say "Laci Peterson," and President Bush did the same as fast as you can say "tax cuts."
They are not only underestimating how hard nation building will be with this brutalized people, but how much the looting and power vacuum have put us into an even deeper hole. We need an emergency airlift of military police officers, a mobile telephone system so people can communicate, and a TV station. And we need, as one U.S. general said to me, to "take that $600 million of Saddam's money we found behind that wall, go up in a helicopter and spread it from one end of the country to the other." We have to get the economy going.
Iraqis are an exhausted people. Most seem ready to give us a chance, and we do have a shot at making this a decent place -- but not with nation building lite. That approach is coming unstuck in Afghanistan and it will never work in Iraq. We've wasted an important month. We must get our act together and our energy up. Why doesn't Mr. Rumsfeld brief reporters every day about rebuilding Iraq, the way he did about destroying Saddam?
America is in an imperial role here, now. Our security and standing in the world ride on our getting Iraq right.If the Bush team has something more important to do, I'd like to know about it. Iraq can still go wrong for a hundred Iraqi reasons, but let's make sure it's not because America got bored, tired or distracted.

Investors Hear Bad News but Buy Anyway

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Despite hints of slower economic growth, the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed for a fifth consecutive week and the Dow Jones industrial average finished higher for the fourth week in a row.
 Declines in retail sales and industrial production last month, coupled with falling consumer and producer prices in April, didn't deter investors. 
Neither did a falling dollar. 
 AT&T, SBC Communications, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo, Avaya and the Williams Companies helped lead the stock market higher. Among the worst performers for the week were Wal-Mart, General Motors, Brocade Communications Systems and Gateway.
 In its longest-running winning streak since the end of 2001, the Nasdaq gained 18.38 points, or 1.2 percent, to close the week at 1,538.53, while the S.& P. 500 index was up 10.89 points, or 1.2 percent, to 944.30. This has been the S.& P.'s best run since July and August of last year.
 The Dow rose 74.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,678.97.
 In the Treasury market, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 3.41 percent from 3.68 percent a week earlier. The yield is the lowest for a 10-year Treasury since July 1958. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

Is It Legal to Stop North Korea's Nuclear Exports?

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SOUTH KOREA'S new president and President Bush agreed last week that they "will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea." But tolerance is a relative thing, which is why they danced around what strategy is most likely to prevent North Korea from turning a suspected small nuclear arsenal into a big one.
 The most intriguing of those strategies appears to be straight out of another era of White House confrontations with Communist leaders intent on building nuclear arsenals: President John F. Kennedy's response to the Cuban missile crisis. 
 If negotiations with North Korea fail, the list of options kept in a White House safe, officials say, calls for a selective but escalating series of "interdictions" of cargo from the starving North. First, freighters suspected of carrying missiles would be stopped; then cargo ships that might have cocaine, counterfeit dollars or, the biggest nightmare, bomb-grade plutonium. 
At the Pentagon, officials talk of a more audacious quarantine: trying to convince the Chinese to cut off the country's oil. The idea, as developed in a classified memorandum that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld circulated last month, is to keep squeezing the North Korean leaders until they collapse. "You let in food," one senior Korea expert in the administration said, describing the memo, "but nothing else."
All this seems anathema to South Korea's president, Roh Moo Hyun, who said repeatedly that North Korea needs some grand bargain: security guarantees and the prospect of economic integration in return for the end of its nuclear program.
Both he and Mr. Bush, he said, seek a "peaceful solution." But their ideas of what makes a peaceful solution -- what mix of threats and incentives -- may conflict. 
Mr. Roh envisions months of flexibility, offering concessions to figure out the North's price for giving up its nukes. "The stronger party can afford to show some flexibility," he said on Monday, adding he was "very concerned" about the influence of the hawks in the Bush administration, who advocate aggressive measures.
The quarantine idea has become a favorite of those hawks, because it stops short of attacking North Korea's nuclear sites, and risking a counterattack on Seoul. Mr. Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney, among others, suspect that North Korea will never come clean about all its nuclear projects, and that it will respect a show of force on the open seas. They assert that even if the North agreed to stop making weapons, Washington would never be certain it found every facility. "How will we ever know that they have revealed every secret project, and opened every cave?" one senior aide asked last week. "We won't."
So the strategy for the next few months is to pursue negotiations with North Korea -- with Chinese officials in the room, and perhaps the South Koreans and Japanese as well. But no matter how big the table, many here doubt that North Korea will agree to dismantle their nuclear weapons.
Then come the "interdictions," some of which have already begun on a small scale. Spain, acting on American intelligence, used a pretext to board a North Korean ship carrying missiles last year -- but after protests from Yemen, which had paid millions for the missiles, Mr. Bush let the shipment through. (The Spanish were furious, having put their special forces at risk.)
Then, a few weeks ago, Australia seized a North Korean ship loaded with drugs.
But turning those interdictions into a strategy may prove difficult. The United States Navy carried out the Cuban quarantine itself; this one would require nervous South Korean and Japanese politicians risking a confrontation with an angry neighbor, as well as the cooperation of the Chinese. China, concerned that refugees would flood across the border, fears a collapse of the North Korean government.
"It's a very different strategy than what we pursued in Iraq, reflecting the fact that it is a very different kind of problem," one of Mr. Bush's senior aides said the other day.
The United States does not have the authority to board any ship suspected of carrying missiles. "If you had a Security Council resolution, it could give you rights to board a ship on the high seas, and search it and confiscate proscribed items," said Robert J. Einhorn, who served as the head of nonproliferation in the State Department under President Clinton. "On the other hand, if we were sure that Taepo-Dong missiles were on a North Korean ship headed to Iran," he said, referring to North Korea's long-range missile, "I'm sure that, in the current environment, we would board it and seize the cargo." 
Small bits of plutonium, however, are a more complex matter. They could be slipped out in a backpack, or on an ox. "If it is in a lead-lined box, it would be hard to pick up, unless you knew where to look," Mr. Einhorn said. The intelligence agencies have warned that tracking such shipments would be difficult.
In the end, it is the prospect that North Korea could sell its bomb-grade material that has Washington the most worried. It has sold just about every kind of weapon it ever produced. That is something no one thought the Cubans would do in 1962, and it is what makes this crisis, in many ways, just as tricky to handle.

In Latin America, the Cult of Revolution Wanes

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
MORE than 100 Latin American intellectuals published a vigorous protest last month after Cuba sentenced 75 dissidents to long prison terms and executed three men who had hijacked a ferry and tried to flee to the United States. 
 "We appeal to the conscience of the world to avoid a new trampling of the principles that guide" civilization, their manifesto read. 
 But the group, which included the writers Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Ariel Dorfman, Eduardo Galeano and Luisa Valenzuela, was not objecting to Mr. Castro's actions. Instead, citing "our moral authority," it supported Mr. Castro's argument that Cuba, like Iraq, "is the object of harassment that could be the pretext for an invasion" by the United States. 
It was a time-honored reaction. Since Mr. Castro came to power in 1959, intellectuals in this part of the world have reflexively accorded him and other revolutionary, anti-American leaders -- Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, Hugo Chavez in Venezuela -- immunity to the moral standards applied to other leaders. But if the politics of the signatories was old, the response to them marked the changes that are undermining the old orthodoxies of Latin American politics and culture. 
Another large, politically diverse group of intellectuals and artists -- including the Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, the Spanish writer Fernando Savater, the Brazilian songwriter Caetano Veloso and the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa -- responded with a countermanifesto.
"Injustices and crimes against humanity must be denounced, no matter where they originate or who commits them," reads one of their documents, published in Madrid late last month.
The dispute began about a month ago, when the American writer Susan Sontag, at a book fair in Bogota, criticized Mr. Garcia Marquez, a longtime friend of Mr. Castro's, for his silence after the recent jailings and executions. Mr. Garcia Marquez responded in El Tiempo, the main Bogota newspaper, citing his opposition to the death penalty. 
He also said, "I couldn't calculate the number of prisoners, dissidents or conspirators that I have helped, in absolute silence, get out of jail or emigrate from Cuba in no less than 20 years."
He did not, however, criticize Mr. Castro's long, dictatorial rule, as his critics pointed out, and the affair has since become the focus of a public debate being aired from Mexico City to Buenos Aires, filling the airwaves and the pages of newspapers and magazines. It's a debate that matters to people because of the central role that intellectuals still play in defining the political culture of Latin America.
"The prestige of the lettered over the unlettered is a tradition that can be traced back to the colonial period," when illiteracy in Ibero-America was much higher than in British colonies in North America, said Jean Franco, author of "The Decline and Fall of the Lettered City: Latin America in the Cold War." 
Intellectuals, she said, offered "a voice based on something that was not force and violence, that appealed to legality and reason and gave people a sense of what might be, a society based on the rule of law."
Initially, Latin American intellectuals were drawn to the Cuban revolution in part because Mr. Castro, unlike leaders of their own countries, was willing to stand up to the United States. He also promised an egalitarian society, in direct contrast to the seemingly ineradicable class divisions and social injustices that bedevil most Latin American societies.
That attitude was reinforced at prestigious university campuses, where largely middle- and upper-class students were exposed to a glamorous, seductive vision of the possibilities of revolution, in which the mystique of a Che Guevara merged admiration for past heroes like Simon Bolivar and Emiliano Zapata. To be of the left, and to see revolution as the hope for a better society became the default position of the bright, energetic and entitled youth of Latin America.
Of course, some intellectuals quickly came to see Mr. Castro as a dictator. As early as 1968, the Cuban poet Heberto Padilla was forced to make a degrading public self-criticism of his work, which led to his imprisonment three years later on charges that his poetry "supplied arguments to the enemies of the revolution."
At that point, distinguished figures, including Mr. Vargas Llosa, the Mexican poet and future Nobel laureate Octavio Paz and the novelist Carlos Fuentes, defended Mr. Padilla's right to self-expression and criticized Cuba's repressive actions. But Mr. Garcia Marquez, the Argentine novelist Julio Cortazar and many others remained loyal to Mr. Castro and his revolution.
In recent years, though, Mr. Castro, now 77, has seemed more and more of an anachronism -- someone mocked by comedians and caricatured by editorial cartoonists. Jose Saramago, the winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature, recently admitted that Mr. Castro "has lost my confidence, destroyed my hopes and deceived my illusions." 
If the Latin American left has an icon today, it is Brazil's new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Mr. da Silva comes from a poor rural family and was a factory worker and labor leader. But he, together with the writers and professors from the salons of Sao Paulo who helped him found the Workers' Party more than 20 years ago, claim to be searching for a "third way" between capitalism and Communism. 
Mr. Castro himself seems to sense that the tide is finally shifting. "It really pains us that they have not been able to understand a single word of the realities that Cuba and the world are living through," he said of his former allies and new critics in an interview published last week by Pagina/12, a leftist Argentine daily.
Still, the loyalty of many older intellectuals has not waned, even as evidence of the injustices and economic failure of the Castro regime has grown. 
"Ultimately, you may have to resort to a psychological explanation," suggests Paul Hollander, the author of "Political Pilgrims," a book about the fascination of Western intellectuals with Communist regimes. "It becomes very difficult for people to let go of these beliefs and commitments, especially when they were made at a young age. Their sense of identity derives from the political stance they have taken."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE ECONOMY; 
His Face Still Gives Fits As Saddam Dinar Soars

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 16 

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein may be out of power or even dead. But his maligned currency, the so-called Saddam dinar, has abruptly skyrocketed in value.
 In a display of what might be called Saddam's revenge, the discredited dinar soared by about one-third against the dollar on Thursday and is now at its highest value since 1996. Its remarkable comeback is likely to cause heartburn for American officials here, and not just because Iraq's currency of choice bears a portrait of the former dictator on every bill. 
 A potentially bigger problem is that the dinar's surge and the dollar's plunge have wiped out a big part of the purchasing power of the $20 emergency payments American administrators have been handing out to workers in lieu of their unpaid monthly salaries. 
Iraqis, from police officers and teachers to government officials, are grumbling that the $20 was a poor substitute for the pay they have not received since March. But now, taking account of the dinar's total rise over the past month, the payment, which used to equal 40,000 dinars, is now worth about half that much.
"Prices in the market have not changed a bit," grumbled Sadiq al-Hamoundi, as he contemplated the diminished value of the $10 remaining from his wife's emergency payment. "This isn't going to last another three days."
Iraqis have a great deal of experience with exchange rates, despite Mr. Hussein's effort to maintain an official exchange rate at the absurdly overvalued level of $3 per dinar.
On Kifah Street -- the gritty and occasionally violent open-air meeting place for hundreds of currency traders and cigarette smugglers -- the most prevalenttheory for the dinar's startling surge was that the Americans did it to themselves by flooding the market with more dollars than people wanted to spend. 
With the Americans handing out $20 payments to several million Iraqi workers and preparing to give $40 to about one million pensioners, traders said they were essentially speculating on a looming saturation of dollars. "If you have one million pensioners getting $40 apiece, that's $40 million coming onto the streets," said Ahmed Muhammad Ali, a trader on Kifah Street. "What did you expect would happen?"
Saddam dinars have defied expectations for some time. In the last days of Mr. Hussein's government, dinars sank to a low of more than 3,000 to the dollar, and American officials expected them to fade away into worthlessness. But after the war, defying expectations that Iraqis would want to dump dinars as fast they could, the dollar dropped back to 2,000 dinars and more recently to about 1,500.
On Thursday, the dinar suddenly exploded in value and dealers refused to offer anything more than 1,000 dinars to the dollar -- an increase of one-third in a single day -- and some dealers were not paying more than 900.
Iraqis' preference for the dinar comes despite the currency's inconvenience. The only denominations in use are the 250-dinar note, worth about 25 cents at current rates, and the 10,000-dinar note. Buying just a week's worth of groceries can require a three-inch-thick stack of 250-dinar notes, which is why upscale shops have bill-counting machines that flip through 100 bills in seconds.
Because the central bank has not been able or willing to print extra supplies, the number of dinars in circulation, and hence their value, has remained stable. Further, as the thousands of foreigners working here began realizing the currency's resilience, they have been buying up dinars in ever larger quantities, adding to the demand. 
Some traders suspected another force at play, saying the dollar's plunge may have been aided by a huge release into the markets of money that looters stole from Iraq's banks and government ministries.
There were also hints that one or another group of traders was trying to manipulate the system. Since Thursday, many currency exchange shops were refusing to sell dollars at anywhere near the prevalent rate of 1,000 to 1.
The soaring dinar was Topic A today at Alaa Hussein's barbershop on Kharada Street, one of Baghdad's big shopping areas.
"It's an attempt by coalition forces to reduce inflation," one customer theorized. Another said it was a sign that Iraqis wanted to run their own lives.
Still others recalled the last time Saddam dinars soared in value. That was in 1996, when a dollar was worth nearly 3,000 dinars. To prop up the dinar, Mr. Hussein ordered major government purchases of the currency as well as big sales of dollars. As a result, the exchange rate dropped to a mere 580 dinars per dollar.
No such intervention appears to be under way today. But traders and ordinary shoppers alike are anxious about potential big swings.
"It's all based on rumors," said Rasheed Taheir, another customer in the barbershop. "You had rumors when the currency collapsed, and rumors again now when it goes up. Nobody really knows what's going on."

HEADLINE: When Labor Bosses Were Boss; 
In '75, Beame Found Partners in Fiscal Crisis. Bloomberg Should Be So Lucky.

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In looking back to the 1975 fiscal crisis, when New York City teetered near bankruptcy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg must envy Mayor Abraham D. Beame about one thing above all else.
 Mr. Beame obtained huge, if sometimes grudging, cooperation from the powerful union titans who represented 300,000 municipal workers. To help the city stave off bankruptcy, these leaders, often defying angry union members, agreed to a pay freeze, to deferring wage increases and to lending the city billions of dollars from their pension funds. 
 Even as they helped Mr. Beame, the labor leaders of the time, led by Victor Gotbaum of the municipal workers' union and Albert Shanker of the teachers' union, were loud-mouthed and cantankerous and sometimes treated him like a 110-pound weakling. Mr. Gotbaum once even called Mr. Beame "a basket case." 
But despite the fiery words and theatrics, despite pressures from the rank and file to repudiate concessions, when it was crunch time, these union leaders made the tough deals that enabled the city to survive its worst financial crisis.
"Those were larger-than-life guys," said Ken Sunshine, a union consultant who was chief of staff for Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
Today's municipal labor leaders are a different lot from those of 1975, and not just because they have rejected the money-saving concessions demanded by Mr. Bloomberg to help close the city's $3.8 billion budget deficit. Back then, there was a dominant triumvirate: Mr. Gotbaum, executive director of District Council 37, which then, as now, represented 120,000 workers; Mr. Shanker, president of the United Federation of Teachers; and Barry Feinstein, president of Teamsters Local 237, representing more than 20,000 city workers. 
They all had firm control of their unions. They all stood up to politicians. They all were fiercely combative at the bargaining table and in front of microphones. In a time of crisis, they were willing to take big risks and cut big deals studded with concessions even when some union members were calling them sellouts -- and they still managed to be re-elected to lead their unions time and again.
"These leaders had dominating personalities," said Richard Steier, a longtime chronicler of municipal labor and editor of The Chief, a weekly newspaper for civil servants. "The people who are running the unions today don't have the same force of personality that the people of the 1970's projected."
Nowadays, there is only one municipal union leader who could be compared with the 1970's threesome: Randi Weingarten, chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee and president of the teachers' union. She shares their outspokenness and combativeness. 
Aside from her, most of today's municipal labor leaders seem tiny and timid compared with the giants of the 1970's.
Some are new and unseasoned and shy away from tough decisions.
Some have a weak hold on power, and they are in no mood to entertain the $600 million in concessions sought by Mr. Bloomberg because that would irk union members.
Lillian Roberts, District Council 37's executive director, could face a tough re-election battle and is under internal attack for doing too little to invigorate the once-mighty union and forfumbling negotiations on severance pay for laid-off workers. Carl Haynes, president of Teamsters Local 237, is far less visible and outspoken than his predecessor, Mr. Feinstein, and devotes much of his energy to fighting internal dissidents and challengers. 
Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, also faces a re-election battle and is railing against the idea of concessions. Stephen J. Cassidy, the first-term president of the Uniformed Fire Fighters Association, has also taken a hard line against concessions.
Mitchell L. Moss, an urban affairs professor at New York University and occasional adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said many of today's crop of municipal labor leaders "are not secure in their own capacity and are afraid of looking too weak to their members."
A longtime adviser to many union leaders, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was understandable that today's leaders were unwilling to take unpopular stands like their 1970's counterparts -- who used their power, prestige and persuasiveness to press the rank and file to accept painful concessions. "They have to be secure unto themselves before they can stick their necks out and advocate a policy that might not be popular with their members," this adviser said.
Many labor experts say there are two union presidents in the same league as the 1970's leaders, but they do not head municipal unions. They are Dennis Rivera, president of 1199/S.E.I.U., the 240,000-member health care union, and Roger Toussaint, president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, who tangled with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last December in tense negotiations for 34,000 subway and bus workers. 
Notwithstanding their outsized egos, Mr. Gotbaum, Mr. Shanker and Mr. Feinstein were able to work together in a time of crisis, forge a consensus, and cajole, persuade and pressure most other municipal unions to come along.
Left largely to her own devices, Ms. Weingarten has been unable to forge agreement among municipal unions on how to respond to Mr. Bloomberg's call for concessions. Some leaders seem willing to meet Mr. Bloomberg halfway, while the leaders of several uniformed unions are resisting even the smallest concession.
Today's labor leaders resist concessions partly because they feel the city's unions made many concessions in the 1990's, including three and a half years of wage freezes, although city officials argue that their wage gains still exceeded inflation over the decade. But leaders of the uniformed workers' unions argue all the more against concessions, saying that givebacks would be inappropriate for the heroes of ground zero.
"One of the big differences is that during the 1975 crisis, people like Gotbaum, Feinstein and Shanker, they were more unified, they were able to do a lot of stuff in concert," said William Lynch Jr., a political and labor consultant who was a deputy mayor in the Dinkins administration.
Today's fractured labor coalition has made numerous proposals, including just one that the Bloomberg administration considers serious -- cutting health care costs by $100 million -- and several that the administration consider ludicrous, most notably the unions' proposal to use union volunteers to make calls from labor's political phone banks to help collect more than $1 billion in uncollected taxes and fines. 
On Friday, when the unions and Mr. Bloomberg failed to agree to $600 million in savings, the mayor ordered city agencies to carry out 2,000 threatened layoffs. Layoffs may anger those who lose their jobs, but unionleaders recognize that layoffs do not upset the remaining workers nearly as much as concessions do. Mr. Bloomberg has proposed numerous concessions, including a longer work week and fewer vacation days.
Ms. Weingarten noted that the mayor's demands for $600 million in concessions would cost each union member at least $2,000 when workers already face higher taxes, transit fares, rents and college tuition. She asserted that the city's unions have made credible proposals that would save hundreds of millions of dollars.
"This notion of the unions' not trying to be responsive is ridiculous," Ms. Weingarten said. "At every turn we have tried to be responsive to what they said their savings needs were."
Raymond D. Horton, former president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said there was a method to the unions' muddle, in that they have thus far avoided making any concessions. "This year they've gotten through unscathed," he said. "They've done a better job for their members, but a worse job for the city."
The 1970's union leaders took some decisions that many workers fretted, even hated. They consented to the state's setting up an Emergency Financial Control Board on which business executives have a large say over the city's finances and government. It had extraordinary powers over the city's finances and government. They also agreed to lend $2.5 billion in union pension money to the city when other investors were too scared. 
With such steps, union leaders enabled the city to escape bankruptcy and for that they were hailed as saviors, more by the captains of industry than by union members, who often said their leaders capitulated to business executives intent on squeezing municipal workers and city services. "They were considered labor statesmen because they helped the city avoid bankruptcy," said Joshua B. Freeman, a Queens College labor historian. "But from the point of view of many union members, they didn't do a very good job at all. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs. Signed contracts were abrogated. People gave up wage benefits that had been bargained for."
There was one huge difference between today's fiscal crisis and that of 1975. Back then, Mr. Beame and the business community warned that unless the union leaders agreed to concessions, the city would plunge into bankruptcy. That terrified labor leaders because they were convinced that bankruptcy would scar the city for decades, as well as endanger workers' pensions, cause union contracts to be scrapped, and persuade the state legislature to take away the right of municipal workers to form unions.
"The guys in the past saw they had a larger responsibility," said Norman Steisel, who was deputy budget director under Mr. Beame and a deputy mayor under Mr. Dinkins. "They tended to step up and be more responsible and responsive to what was needed to help the city out of its fiscal crisis than the current cast of characters seems willing to be."
Today's union leaders respond to this criticism by noting that, yes, the labor leaders of the 1970's gave painful concessions, and so did labor leaders a decade ago. With all these concessions made in decades past, today's union leaders say it's someone else's turn to give.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: SOVEREIGNTY; 
Iraqi Political Leaders Warn of Rising Hostility if Allies Don't Support an Interim Government

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 17 

 BODY:
Leaders of Iraqi political groups warned today that American and British forces could find themselves ruling a hostile nation if they do not support the creation of an interim Iraqi government.
 "Unless we have an interim government that is truly representative, the people will not be happy," said Hoshyar Zebari, a spokesman for the Kurdish leader, Massoud Barzani. 
 Mr. Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, was so distressed at plans by the United States and Britain to delay forming a national assembly and an interim government that he abruptly left Baghdad today to return to his base in northern Iraq. 
The northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk experienced different aftershocks of the war today, as long-simmering tensions between Kurds and Arabs led to street fighting that left at least five people dead. 
Also today, another senior member of Saddam Hussein's inner circle was taken into custody by American forces, the United States Central Command said. Kamal Mustafa Abdullah al-Tikriti, described as the secretary of the Republic Guard, was No. 10 on a revised list of wanted Iraqis issued by the United States. He is also the brother of one of Mr. Hussein's sons-in-law. Last month, Pentagon officials said intelligence reports indicated he had fled to Syria, although the State Department never confirmed that.
One month after the collapse of Mr. Hussein's government, American forces have yet to account for the former Iraqi leader or his immediate family.
Iraqi university students and teachers returned to their campuses today for the first time since the war. Like the rest of the country, they faced the painful task of identifying and purging Baath Party members who had supported Mr. Hussein's government. 
At Baghdad University, the nation's largest, professors gathered to vote for a temporary president and faculty deans. American soldiers stood guard at the school gates and the auditorium where the voting took place. A State Department official who will have the final say on all Iraqi university appointments also monitored the meeting.
The campus scene reflected the increasingly direct control that American civilian and military administrators are imposing, on a larger scale, on the politics of postwar Iraq. The leaders of the country's main political groups said they learned at a tense meeting on Friday that the United States and Britain had withdrawn their support for the formation of an interim Iraqi government to help run the country until national elections can be held.
Instead, in a draft resolution presented to the United Nations Security Council, the two countries demanded expansive powers to run Iraq and manage its oil revenues once economic sanctions are lifted. 
"President Bush said he wanted to liberate Iraq, not occupy Iraq, and that was the basis for our supporting military action," said one Iraqi who took part in the leadership consultations. "This puts all the political leadership in a very difficult situation and gives fuel to all those extremists who said the U.S. had a secret agenda to occupy Iraq and exploit its oil resources." 
A group of former Iraqi exiles, whose return was encouraged by the Bush administration, had been working for weeks on a plan to convene an assembly that would give Iraqis a say in reconstruction and would represent the country in international forums like the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
But officials in Washington and London apparently considered the situation in Iraq, where government agencies have ground to a halt and most people feel unsafe, too unsettled to be left to people who are inexperienced at running a government.
The opposition leaders said they were considering sending a delegation to the United States to state their case. They also said they would go ahead with creating an interim national assembly of some kind by the end of the month, even though its powers and relationship with the occupation forces remained unsettled. 
The American and British message was especially vexing for Mr. Barzani and the other main Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani. They have been running their own government in northern Iraq for nearly 12 years under American protection. 
Ceding all power over the day-to-day lives of their people to the occupation forces would negate their autonomy. Mr. Talabani declined to comment today.
At Baghdad University, students hung banners calling for the banning of Baath Party activists from administrative and teaching positions. 
Andrew Erdmann, a State Department official, said that allied forces would make the final decision about who would run the university for the rest of the term. They will scrutinize the Iraqis' choices to ensure that none were involved in weapons programs or political crimes, he said. "We are not going to have Dr. Germ put forward for university president," he added.
But some professors said the purging process could go too far, replacing corrupt deans with incompetent ones whose only qualification was their lack of Baathist links. 
"We're a scientific community here," said Riyad Khazaridji, a professor of engineering who walked out of the elections. "You don't mix politics with science or you end up with a bad combination."

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING; 
Johnson Is Nascar Star of Stars, And He's Also $1 Million Richer

BYLINE:  By VIV BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.C., May 17 

 BODY:
The Goo Goo Dolls and Gov. Mike Easley played to the crowd gathered today for Nascar's annual all-star race at Lowe's Motor Speedway.
 But when the prerace music and politician-in-uniform photo opportunity were over, 150,000 fans who withstood windy, cool temperatures saw Jimmie Johnson survive bumper-car racing to take home a record payoff of just over $1 million in the Winston. Kurt Busch was second. 
 Unlike the weekly races in the Nascar Winston Cup series, the Winston is a pure money run with no points awarded. Drivers compete in a set of races with the field whittled to the top 14 drivers who reach the final 20-lap sprint for the money. That kind of cash provides a certain singular motivation, with drivers taking unusual gambles and cars taking plenty of knocks.
Last year, Busch admitted that he deliberately forced Robby Gordon's car to spin out late in the race to force a yellow flag. That slowed the field and gave Busch a chance to catch the leaders. The strategy failed; Ryan Newman won the race and last year's winner's share of $750,000.
This year's race was no less contentious. Tony Stewart, the defending Winston Cup points champion, won the 40-lap first leg of the Winston, when the field was cut from 24 cars to 20. But Stewart never made it to the final. His was among eight cars that crashed in the 30-lap second leg won by Busch.
None other than Jeff Gordon, a three-time winner of the Winston, put Sterling Marlin and Ward Burton into spins in that second section. Marlin stayed in the race; Burton did not. And later in that leg, Newman crashed into the wall after bumping Mark Martin. 
That sent Newman out of the race before the final sprint. Newman was so miffed, he walked down the track waiting for the drivers to come around so he could approach Stewart, who Newman thought bumped him.
Stewart was not to blame for that wreck, but he was gone shortly after that anyway. In the final laps of the second leg, with the racecars in a pack, Stewart hit Terry Labonte's car, creating a chain reaction that knocked six cars out, including those of Labonte, Stewart, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Martin, Dale Jarrett and Bill Elliott. Elliott broke three bones in his left foot in the crash.
"It's part of being in the Winston," Stewart said of the pileup. "That's what makes it exciting for everybody.'
By the final 20-lap sprint, only 12 of the 14 cars eligible to advance from the second leg were in one piece. After the top 10 cars were restarted in inverse order, Johnson took the lead from Gordon with 16 laps remaining and held off the field for the victory and a check for $1,017,604. 
The victory made up for Johnson's performance in the Winston last year, when he won the first two legs of the race before finishing fifth in the final leg in his rookie year.
"Jimmy's been extremely smart," his team owner, Rick Hendrick, said. "Everyone was amazed last year with what he was able to do. This year he has just added on to the experience he gained this year. I've never seen anyone with less experience doing the job he's done and handling the pressure he's handled."
Among others who handled the pressure well tonight was Easley, who drove three laps for charity before the main event and made it around the speedway without a dent.
The governor, who earlier declared May Motorsports Month in North Carolina, was here to make a pitch for Nascar to keep the Winston at Lowe's instead of moving it to tracks around the country, the way other sports shift their all-star games from year to year. The Winston has been run in Concord for 18 of its 19 years in the heart of Nascar country, where most of the race teams are based.
Still, Nascar is considering moving the race, creating a significant loss to the local economy. Combined with next weekend's Winston Cup points race, the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's, the back-to-back events bring thousands of RV's filled with fans to the area for more than a week of activities.
Easley's goal was to complete three laps while driving faster than 160 miles an hour, raising $100,000 for education in the state in the process. Wearing a royal blue driver's firesuit and crash helmet, Easley reached his speed and kept Labonte's No. 5 car away from the wall through three laps. That was an improvement over last week, when the governor crashed into the wall at over 160 m.p.h. while running practice laps at Lowe's and destroyed Johnson's car.
How much Easley's clean run will impress Nascar officials remains to be seen. But a more important figure -- in Nascar and in North Carolina -- backed the governor.
It was Earnhardt Jr. who told the cheering crowd at Lowe's, "I think the Winston needs to stay in Charlotte."

PIT STOPS
JOE GIBBS, the racecar owner and former Washington Redskins coach, is joining with the former All-Pro defensive lineman REGGIE WHITE to help promote members of minorities in racing. Gibbs and White are searching for young minority drivers to train and develop into Nascar drivers.

HEADLINE: Democrats Say Bush Is Weak On Terrorism 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, May 17 

 BODY:
Democratic presidential candidates challenged President Bush today on his handling of the war on terrorism, questioning the administration's failure to find Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein and asserting that Mr. Bush had failed to protect the nation adequately against further terrorist attacks.
 The candidates, appearing at a labor forum here this morning, repeatedly castigated Mr. Bush, their presumptive opponent in November 2004, for what the White House has portrayed as one of Mr. Bush's chief strengths: his record in battling terrorism abroad and protecting Americans at home. 
 The criticisms came in a week when terrorists killed dozens of people in bombings in Saudi Arabia and Morocco, attacks that officials have said bear the trademark of Al Qaeda. The bombings have stirred concerns about the terrorist group's persistence, even after many of its leaders have been detained or killed. They have also reignited questions about whether the war on Iraq might have inflamed suicidal terrorists.
Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who has been among the most persistently critical members of Congress of Mr. Bush's antiterror policies before and after the attacks of Sept. 11, said that the White House had neglected the threat of Al Qaeda and instead focused on Baghdad.
"We have let Al Qaeda off the hook," Mr. Graham said, as members of the municipal workers union here rose in applause. "We had them on the ropes close to dismantlement, and then we we moved resources out of Afghanistan and Pakistan to fight the war in Iraq. We let them regenerate."
Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, called the war in Iraq a diversion that had not left the United States any safer. "We have a president who talks tough on homeland security but is strangling the city and the towns and not giving them the money that is necessary to protect them," Dr. Dean said.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said, "We are vulnerable to future attacks because this administration has not done its job and has not increased our ability to have homeland security." 
The union audience was sympathetic to the Democrats' contentions, because its members would benefit if, as many Democrats have recommended, spending for security measures such as police, firefighting, rescue squads and medical care were increased more rapidly than the administration has recommended.
The remarks by the candidates came at a forum here organized by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to press the Democrats to talk about issues of concern to the union. It was an early step in their courtship of a union whose endorsement is sought by all the Democratic candidates.
The candidates used the forum in front of 1,000 union members here to emphasize their commitment to health care coverage and increasing financing to state and local governments staggering under federal budget cuts and a tough economy.
But the spirited attack on Mr. Bush's terrorist credentials served as a reminder of how prominent that issue would be in the election, no matter how much Democrats talk about domestic issues. It united the Democrats on the stage, and drew cheers from the audience and shouts of "hear, hear!" from the union's leader, Gerald W. McEntee.
Municipal workers have watched as state governments, struggling with the mounting cost of terrorist protection and with falling revenues, have cut their budgets. The Democrats repeatedly criticized the Bush administration for failing to allocate promised money to help defray the security costs required by federal laws enacted since Sept. 11, 2001.
At one point, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina noted that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a Republican, had been forced to push through deep layoffs in his municipal work force, an observation that drew shouts of angry recognition from the crowd.
"The Republicans are planning to have their convention in New York City to showcase the leadership of George Bush," Mr. Edwards said. "I think it's a great place to showcase the leadership of George Bush." 
Mr. Bush, in a radio address today that was taped before the forum, said the Saudi bombings "provide a stark reminder that the war on terror continues," but he added, "Our government is taking unprecedented measures to defend the homeland."
The meeting was nothing like the debate in South Carolina two weeks ago, when the candidates argued with one another about the war in Iraq and other issues. This time, only seven of the nine announced Democrats attended. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was observing the Jewish Sabbath, while Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was delivering a commencement address in New Hampshire.
The other two candidates who were here were Carol Moseley Braun, the former senator from Illinois, and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio.
The subject turned to terrorism in response to a question by Joseph Conzo, an emergency medical technician with New York City's fire department, who was dispatched to the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Upon his introduction, first the crowd and then the candidates rose to their feet in tribute to the officer.
"I was one of the lucky ones; I survived," Mr. Conzo said.
Some Democrats have argued that Mr. Bush is vulnerable on the issue of domestic terrorism. They have attacked the White House for withholding financing for emergency services, and for failing to set up a system to block the smuggling of nuclear or biological weapons through the nation's porous port system.
And even as Mr. Bush was portraying the victory in Baghdad as a defeat of terrorism, some of the Democrats here were raising questions about it.
"Mr. Bush, the question you have not answered is, where is bin Laden?" proclaimed the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York. "You keep going after everything but who went after us. Mr. Bush will not be, in a Sharpton administration, the head of missing persons. He can't find bin Laden. We don't know if Hussein is living or dead. And we can't find the weapons of mass destruction."

HEADLINE: Retail Space: Solid Demand, Firm Rents 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
MODELL'S sporting goods store was a fixture on the north side of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues from 1924 until the block was cleared for renovation in 1995. On May 1, a new Modell's store opened on the south side of the street, and executives of the company said several hundred people lined up shortly before midnight recently to buy a new edition of a Michael Jordan sneaker.
 "We couldn't sell it until after 12:01, so people had to line up," said Mitchell Modell, the president of the family-owned company. 
 Not everybody has merchandise with a famed basketball player's name on it, but real estate executives say the retail business in New York has held up relatively well, despite the loss of jobs in the city and general economic uncertainty.
While there is 40 million square feet of vacant office space in Manhattan, brokers report that demand for retail space remains solid, particularly in prime shopping locations, including Times Square. As a result, they said, retail rents have largely remained firm while office landlords areoffering periods of free rent and other concessions to prospective tenants. 
Nevertheless, retail space has not been immune from the general slowdown in the real estate market. More stores are available and the number of square feet of space on the market has risen significantly since last year.
"The overall market in New York is relatively healthy," said Benjamin Fox, an executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail, a brokerage company. "You do not see vacant stores on the main streets and corners here, where you might in other cities. There is just very little availability in the prime areas."
Mr. Fox's observations are generally supported by other brokers who specialize in leasing retail spaces. There are few citywide statistics available comparable to the detailed, if sometimes differing, figures kept on office space by many of the large brokerage companies.
A report prepared for the Real Estate Board of New York by a group of retail specialists from several brokerage concerns said that rents rose in Midtown during the six months that ended on March 31, while rents in the downtown area declined. The report said the average rent in Midtown rose by 9 percent, to $298 a square foot, while rents downtown fell 3 percent, to $98 a square foot.
But the report also noted that the number of stores available for rent had risen 6 percent, from 2,118 a year ago to 2,253 at the end of March, and the number of square feet of space had risen to 14.5 million square feet from 11.2 million square feet. Vacant properties also seem to be staying on the market longer, brokers say. 
The rent figures are broad averages, which tend to smooth out the wide variation because of location, real estate executives say.
For example, asking rents for midblock stores on Madison Avenue between 57th Street and 72nd Street average $650 to $700 a square foot, said James S. Downey, director of national retail accounts for Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company. But rents near the key intersections of 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenues are in the $800 to $900 a square foot range, Mr. Downey added.
But what goes up can come back down. Rents in SoHo, which went from $60 to $70 a square foot to as high as $350 a square foot in the 10 years ended in 2001 have dropped off sharply, in part because of the reduction in tourist traffic as a result of the Sept. 11 attack, Mr. Fox said. Space there is now available for about $170 a square foot, brokers report.
"There is opportunity there now, and people who could not afford it there before are coming back for a second look," Mr. Downey said. "There are some great spaces there with lots of ambient light."
Another neighborhood that could see an upgrading of its stores because of its relatively affordable rents is Chelsea and its main crosstown artery, 23rd Street, said Faith H. Consolo, vice chairman of Garrick-Aug Associates, a brokerage specializing in retail leasing. "The area is like the Upper West Side, with a large residential population and seven-day-a-week foot traffic," she said. "But the rents here are $100 to $150 a square foot compared to $250 a square foot up there."

Times Square and Beyond
Sneakers and Banks And National Chains
One neighborhood that has made a complete transition is Times Square, where new and renovated buildings on both sides of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues house offices, movie theaters, restaurants and clothing stores that are a far cry from the rundown structures and seedy businesses that characterized the area before it was largely razed and redeveloped.
The incursion of different kinds of stores throughout Times Square continues, with a Swatch store a recent addition at 45th Street and Broadway, next to Toys "R" Us, whose large interior Ferris wheel has become an attraction for some visitors. In addition to all its busy stores, the area has become a media center, with Conde Nast, Reuters, MTV and ABC joining The New York Times Company in the neighborhood.
The tourists are here in force as well, and that stream of out-of-towners attracted Modell's to the space previously occupied by an HMV music store. "We are the largest team licensing store in New York," Mitchell Modell said. "We have every league and every team." Indeed, the shelves and walls are covered with team jerseys, shirts, caps and jackets. He said the comprehensive display means the visitors who can buy apparel of only local teams in their hometowns can select from any teams or sport they prefer. "The people who are in Times Square are our kind of customers," he said.
The sports-themed merchandise is a far cry from the stock offered in 1924, when Modell's Army-Navy store opened in 1934 about where a New York Yankee theme store now stands, said William Modell, the company's chairman and Mitchell's father. "In those days Army-Navy meant sporting goods, unless you went to Abercrombie & Fitch," he said. "We had things like men's and ladies' riding apparel. Now people wear dungarees when they go riding."
Since that 42nd Street store was one of the first in a chain that now numbers 100 in the region from New York to Washington, D.C., the company was eager to re-establish its presence on the block, Mitchell Modell said. As a result, he said, the company decided to work with the unusual layout of the store, which has about 8,000 square feet at street level and 11,000 square feet at a below-grade level reached by a long staircase.
He said the company had a history of working with unconventional spaces. "We go up and we go down," he said. "We have a store on 34th Street with no selling space at all at the street level."
Elsewhere in Manhattan, much retail leasing activity has been driven by the effort by retail banks to establish outposts in just about every neighborhood, brokers report. The expansion has been led by Fleet Bank, Washington Mutual and Commerce Bank, but others are also expanding.
According to the Real Estate Board report, 17 new bank leases were signed in the six months ended in March, for spaces as large as 5,268 square feet for Hudson United Bank at 90 Broad Street down to 400 square feet for Fleet Bank at 3575 Broadway at 146th Street.
Drugstores, notably Duane Reade, and stores selling wireless telephones have also been expanding, brokers reported. "The banks, wireless and drugstores are significant, but we have also seen a fair number of sporting goods and sneaker stores," said David A. Green, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, the New York-based brokerage and services company.
Mr. Green said Third Avenue between 57th and 72nd Street continues to be a destination for national retailers seeking to enter the Manhattan market. "Third Avenue has been the avenue of choice for national players," he said. "The rent is lower than Madison Avenue."
According to Ms. Consolo, retailers who have opened stores on Third Avenue include Gracious Home, Maurice Villency, the Door Store and KA International in the furniture and home decoration category. Others include Lucky Brand Jeans, Ann Taylor Loft, Arden B and Zales. "This avenue is an affordable oasis," she said, "for despite the change, the rents have remained stable."
Rents on Third Avenue, she said, are about $300 a square foot annually on 57th to 60th Street and about $225 a square foot farther north near 72nd Street.
Some residents have complained that the influx of national brands has made the avenue seem like a suburban shopping mall, but Mr. Fox said the change from local service retail to national companies is inevitable in a high-income area. "Local entrepreneurs can't compete with national chains that have better credit," he said. "That has been happening in New York since about 1700, with the big guy pushing out the little guy." 
And while locally owned stores may be charming, many shoppers want the larger selection of merchandise and lower prices that national chains can often provide, he said.
Demand for retail space in Midtown is sometimes driven more by a need to establish a brand in the nation's premier market than by simple economics, executives say. "There are companies who feel they have to have their flagship store in Manhattan," Mr. Green said. "Things happen here that might not happen elsewhere."

Boroughs and Downtown
Turning to Areas Rather Underserved
The large populations of the boroughs other than Manhattan are also drawing the attention of national retailers who recognize that markets there are underserved. An Aerosoles shoe store recently opened on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, and Bally Total Fitness moved into a location on Fordham Road in the Bronx. Atlantic Terminal Mall in Brooklyn is into its second stage of development and Queens Center Mall is expanding by 400,000 square feet.
Retail projects are in favor by investors nationally, as the office and industrial markets have softened, said Andrew J. Merin, an executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield. This is particularly so since it has become clear that "retail has withstood the challenge of the Internet." He said the failure of Web-based shopping services like Webvan showed that "consumers still want to check the lettuce and try on sweaters."
The strength of the retail sector is demonstrated, he said, by the way expanding chains have quickly replaced those that have run into trouble. "We saw Kmart, Bradlees and Caldor go bankrupt, but we also see the expansion of Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Target." He said shopping malls with food supermarkets as the anchor store have been the recent investment favorite of real estate investment trusts.
Prospects for retail development in Lower Manhattan appear to be mixed, according to real estate executives. Low rents and government-financed incentive programs mean there are bargains to be found downtown, some say. But the disruptions caused by the Sept. 11 attack and the uncertainty about how the area will be rebuilt are causing many retail companies to hesitate about making commitments, others argue.
According to the Real Estate Board's report, asking rents along Broadway, one of the major downtown shopping corridors, declined 7.4 percent in the six months that ended in March. In the broader area of Midtown South and downtown, rents declined 1.5 percent in the same period.
Retailers need to remember that despite the losses on Sept. 11, downtown Manhattan remains the third largest office market in the country -- larger than downtown Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and St. Louis combined -- said Richard B. Hodos, the president of Madison HGCD, a brokerage specializing in retail property. The tens of thousands of workers in those offices are potential customers for stores in the area, he added.
Despite the continuing discussions about what should be built at the World Trade Center site and the realignment of rail links, progress is under way in the area, he said. The PATH connection to New Jersey is expected to reopen in November, and other improvements to ease pedestrian traffic are due as well. "Our challenge is to explain this to retailers," he said.
There are three major shopping districts downtown, Mr. Hodos said. One is Broadway itself, from Fulton Street down to the building at 2 Broadway at Beaver Street. The second is the World Financial Center, to the west of the West Side Highway, where the damage from the Sept. 11 attack has been repaired. The third is the site of the World Trade Center, which held a major enclosed mall before the attack. "We probably won't see retail there until '08 or '09," he said.
But others say the uncertainties about how the rebuilding will proceed are causing retailers to hesitate to make commitments. "Downtown is a work in progress," said Mr. Fox. "Without the World Trade Center, only Broadway is a shopping area. The side streets have a lot of fast food and discount stores, but until the trade center is replaced, it is not clear where the retail areas will be and when it will be."

Expo Design Center
New Kind of Store At Alexander's Site
Retail brokers say one interesting experiment will be a 100,000-square-foot Home Depot subsidiary store in the basement of the complex being developed by Vornado Realty Trust at the old Alexander's site on the block bounded by Lexington and Third Avenues and 58th and 59th Streets.
"It is going to be an upscale kind of store, more urban than the typical Home Depot," said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, another retail brokerage. Those expecting to see smartly dressed Upper East Side women walking out of the store with two-by-fours on their shoulders are going to be disappointed.
According to company literature, the Expo Design Center, as the stores are called, will focus on home furnishings and improvements done by contractors, rather then do-it-yourself projects. Glittery displays will take the place of the warehouse environment of Home Depot itself.
Retail brokers say that while their market segment has remained firm in comparison to office leasing, the pace so far this year has been slower than a year ago. "The primary markets are strong, but there is availability in the secondary areas," Mr. Victor said. "The deals are not being made as quickly, and some of the rents are not what the landlords would like."
A strong indicator of the current market is the length of time attractive retail space stands empty, said Mr. Downey of Cushman & Wakefield. "If it sat there for three to five months before, it will probably be there for seven to nine months today."

HEADLINE: Meeting Energy Needs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "An Empty Energy Bill" (editorial, May 12) misses the mark with its criticism of the energy legislation making its way through Congress. 
As chief sponsor of the bill passed by the House, I disagree wholeheartedly that it is a "compendium of tired ideas." On the contrary, our bill is filled with innovative initiatives that will provide stability to the economy, encourage production and conservation, help the job market and strengthen national security -- all while protecting the environment. 
 You're off base that the energy bill does "next to nothing" to ease America's dependence on foreign oil. The bill takes bold steps to decrease our dangerous dependence on foreign oil by modernizing conservation, increasing energy efficiency and seeking alternative power sources. The bill expands the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's capacity to one billion barrels, encourages more nuclear and hydropower production and advances domestic oil and gas exploration.
With America's energy demands expected to double over the next 20 years, this legislation is absolutely critical to our security and economy.

HEADLINE: Get a Job 

BYLINE:  By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, former secretary of labor, is professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University.

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass. 

 BODY:
This spring's college graduates are entering the worst job market in 20 years. With few good jobs on the horizon, many graduating seniors think it is time to get an advanced degree. They should think again. 
 Applications to both medical and law schools increased this year, while more people than ever are taking the standardized tests for graduate school. Those who can borrow or whose parents can afford it probably figure another degree is worth the cost and will win them a better-paying job when the economy turns up. 
 But the market value of advanced degrees is unlikely to rise enough to make the investments worth it, especially after the supply of people with such degrees expands. Even before the economy foundered, the median take-home pay of lawyers and doctors was dropping, and many newly minted Ph.D.'s couldn't find university appointments.
Many college graduates would do better to lower their sights in the short term and take a "go-for" job (as in "go for coffee") in an industry or profession that interests them. Even if the job doesn't pay much, it can provide a window on to that particular world of work. Alternatively, with few responsibilities anchoring them to one place, they can pick a city with relatively low unemployment (say, Portland, Me., or Lincoln, Neb.), get a job with better pay and more responsibility, and see a part of the country they might otherwise miss.
If they can afford to go without a paycheck for six months or a year, they might consider taking an internship or volunteering -- thereby gaining some useful experience while doing some good. Teaching in a poor rural or inner-city school, for example, offers more hard-won lessons about planning, leadership and marketing (persuading students to give their attention, or administrators to give more books) than any business school. And more teachers will be needed in the next decade than in the last.
In all these respects, the major benefit is not academic or professional knowledge so much as self-knowledge. Do you thrive in a hard-charging atmosphere or need quiet and stability? How important is it for you to believe passionately in a cause? Or to have a lot of authority over what you do?
College graduates are more likely to discover these sorts of things by working full time than by getting another degree. Once they learn them, they will have a better chance of finding work they love when the economy rebounds.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
No One Standout and Few Big Risks in the Fall Lineup

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG and STUART ELLIOT 

 BODY:
ABC played Radio City Music Hall. CBS took the stage at Carnegie Hall. NBC starred at Lincoln Center. And the Fox network held its celebration at City Center.
 But the major networks did not generate much excitement to go with all of the stagecraft they mustered in presenting their new fall shows to packed houses of advertisers last week, many Madison Avenue executives said. The crucial question, of course, is whether viewers will react the same way. 
 In contrast to past years, no show emerged as the one to watch, the way "C.S.I. Miami" from CBS did last year and "24" from Fox did the year before. 
What did emerge was a picture of a new television season that, despite some pockets of originality, will not break much ground. Network executives for the most part refrained from spiels like those of recent years when they claimed to have the broadcast television equivalents of "The Sopranos" or a whole new twist on comedy. 
Instead, the fall season will be filled with traditional-looking sitcoms and crime dramas. There will be several shows redolent of "Romeo and Juliet." And there will be plenty of shows revolving around African-American and Latino families. 
"I didn't see anything drastically new," said Bob Riordan, senior vice president and director for national broadcast at MPG in New York, part of the Media Planning Group division of Havas. "The networks are going for the tried and true."
There were several programs that did receive, if not buzz, at least a low hum of positive attention. Among them were "The O.C." on Fox, about the secret lives of rich teenagers in Orange County, Calif., to be shown in the 9 p.m. slot on Thursdays. Another was the CBS comedy "Two and a Half Men," with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer, set for Mondays at 9:30 p.m.
Some writers and producers blamed network executives for increased timidity in their programming choices in the face of economic and corporate pressures. "I don't know what it is, whether it's just nervousness or fear," said Peter Mehlman, a former "Seinfeld" producer whose sitcom offering for next season, about a couple that does not age and has been married for 4,000 years, was not picked up by a network. "The process has gotten so arduous, it's like running for president now -- it essentially weeds out anything that's, like, really good."
Others said the relatively conservative programming was a result of the early success last fall of traditional-looking sitcoms like "8 Simple Rules," with John Ritter on ABC. It signaled to programmers, at a time when networks were already lining up shows for the following year, that audiences were looking for the television equivalent of "comfort food" in a seemingly more dangerous world.
Stacey Lynn Koerner, executive vice president and director for global research integration at Initiative Media in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, said one of the few shows she was able to cite as "pushing the envelope" was "The Ortegas." Seeking to blend elements of sitcoms, reality programs and talk shows, "The Ortegas," to be shown Sundays at 8:30 p.m. on Fox, is an improvisational sitcom about a Mexican-American family with a son who is the host of a talk show and interviews celebrities as his overbearing parents and grandmother chime in from the couch.
"The Ortegas" also typifies several trends that are apparent across the schedules of the four major networks, as well as WB and UPN. One is what Ms. Koerner called "family comedies in nontraditional settings," offering the networks a way to freshen oft-told tales in a new setting.
And after the success of "Bernie Mac" on Fox and "My Wife and Kids" on ABC, there will be new shows with multi-ethnic casts on NBC, Fox, UPN and WB.
In addition to "The Ortegas," other such shows include "Like Family" on WB, appearing Fridays at 8:30 p.m.; the show centers on two families, one white and one black, living under thesame roof. Another is "Whoopi" from NBC, with Whoopi Goldberg as the star, to be shown at 8 p.m. on Tuesdays. Other examples of so-called multiculti shows include "Luis," at 8:30 p.m. Friday on Fox; "10-8," on ABC at 8 p.m. Sunday; and "All About the Andersons" at 9:30 p.m. Friday on WB.
The new crop of shows also includes a curious string of "Romeo and Juliet" plot lines. "Skin," a drama from Fox at 9 p.m. Monday, is about a teenager whose boyfriend's father, a prosecutor, is investigating the girl's father, the top pornography producer in Los Angeles. In "It's All Relative" on ABC, a working-class young man with an Irish Catholic background falls for a highly cultured young woman whose parents are two gay men.
The new show that WB expects to get the most attention is "Tarzan and Jane," to appear Sundays at 9 p.m. The show is partly about the forbidden love between a female New York detective and a man raised in the wild (who happens to be played by the underwear model Travis Fimmel).
With the continued success of the "Law and Order" programs on NBC and "C.S.I." programs on CBS, the television crime rate is headed for an increase, too. CBS is adding three crime shows, "The Handler," "Cold Case," and "Navy C.I.S.," which is a combination of "J.A.G." and "C.S.I." ABC is adding three -- "10-8," "Karen Sisco" and "Threat Matrix." WB is adding one, "Fearless," about an agent who does not have the gene for fear. And UPN is introducing "Jake 2.0" about a federal agent with superpowers.
"You know what, there's a lot of crime, but crime is still working," said Leslie Moonves, chairman and chief executive of CBS, part of Viacom, in a breakfast briefing with reporters last week.
Ms. Koerner at Initiative Media said that the popularity of crime reflected "a combination of post-9/11 tragedy and "C.S.I." 's success."
But there are some new shows that deviate from the norm. Three dramas feature young women who communicate either with dead people ("Tru Calling" on Fox), inanimate objects ("Wonderfalls" on Fox) or God ("Joan of Arcadia" on CBS).
And Fox, which more than the other big networks is scheduling riskier fare for the fall, has included "Arrested Development" in its lineup, to be shown Sundays at 9:30 p.m. The show has a complicated plot line about a young man who takes over the family business when his father is arrested for fraud. It is filmed with a single camera, a style that mimics the look of a movie but does not traditionally do well with sitcom audiences. 
"I think that if you don't try to get out of that box you can't expand the form," said Gail Berman, the president of Fox Entertainment.
Although the excitement about the new shows for the fall is muted, network executives do not seem too worried.
Jordan Levin, the president of WB Entertainment, said "advertisers had simply seen too many sure things" from the spring presentations collapse in the fall, and were loath to get too excited about anything. "I do think it's fair to suggest that there's more cynicism in looking at the collective networks' declarations of confidence in the new shows," he said.
To be fair, the early assessments have been based mostly on a series of program excerpts shown last week as part of the yearly four-day ritual known as the upfront. Judgments were not made based on full screenings of 39 new shows.
For that reason, others warned against relying too heavily on network television's early betting lines.
Despite many instances in which early predictions of success have been accurate, many of television's biggest sensations were not initially cited as potential blockbusters, including "Seinfeld" and "C.S.I."
"Generally it's easier to pick the real stinkers than it is to pick the shows that are going to be long term," said David Nevins, executive producer of "Arrested Development." 
Regardless of the content issues, advertisers seem primed to spend big. According to industry forecasts, this buying season could bring the networks $9 billion, up from the record of $8.1 billion last year.
In the meantime, executives said, their new programs still have plenty of time to build some positive preseason attention.
"I think it's just going to take people time to actually look at the shows and really see what emerged," Mr. Levin of WB said. "They just didn't emerge as quickly this year."

HEADLINE: Disney in Plan To Beam Films To TV Viewers 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company is betting that demand by consumers for movies in their homes is strong enough to support a new technology that beams films through the air to boxes atop their television sets.
 This fall, Disney will start a service called MovieBeam in Salt Lake City and two other markets yet to be determined. It will require viewers to rent set-top boxes available at electronics stores that plug into a television like a DVD player. 
 The prices will be similar to a rental at a video store. Viewers will be able to watch a rented film as many times as they wish in a 24-hour period.
MovieBeam uses a technology called datacasting that sends a stream of data over the same broadcast signal used to transmit television programs. The data stream can be received only through the MovieBeam box.
It is intended to offer another alternative for movie fans who can now get video-on-demand from cable companies and over the Internet. But with so many households already wired with cable or satellite boxes, VCR's and DVD players, Disney could have a tough time convincing consumers to try its new service.
"It's very hard to see how consumers will make room for that alongside what they've already got," said Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Disney will not rely entirely on MovieBeam. It intends to keep distributing its films through a number of platforms, including the Internet, cable and video rental stores.
MovieBeam could increase Disney's bottom line because it would cut out the intermediary. "Unlike cable video-on-demand, where the customer gets V.O.D. from his or her cable operator and the studios get paid a wholesale fee, this is a direct-to-consumer retail service where the consumer builds a relationship with us," said Peter E. Murphy, Disney's chief strategic officer.
MovieBeam could allow Disney to reach nearly every home in the country with its signal, giving it an advantage over Web-based systems that work only with high-speed Internet access and cable that works only on digital systems.

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Diary 

BYLINE:  By Joe Rogers 

 BODY:
DEAR DIARY:
For longer than just about anybody can remember there has been a full-size mock-up of a tractor-trailer on top of a building on 12th Avenue between 39th and 40th Streets. Way back when the West Side Highway was still around, the truck was at eye level as I rode by in my parents' car on the way downtown. And without fail, the figure in the driver's seat -- Joe to all of us -- was there. Such behavior caused a young boy to wonder when Joe went to the bathroom. 
 The trailer had the name Yale painted on its side -- presumably the name of the trucking company, not the university. For the Bicentennial in 1976, the truck was proudly repainted in red, white and blue. And that's the way it stayed for the next 27 years, as the West Side Highway was eventually replaced by a ground-level street. Each year, the paint grew fainter, the colors fading much like the memory of the Bicentennial itself. And still Joe sat there, unmoving, steady as a rock. 
 Then, some weeks ago, a work crew appeared and Joe's truck was totally repainted, now bearing the logo of United Rental. Most tellingly, the cab received a heavy tint job on its windows, so you really can't tell if Joe is still in there.
But for that boy, now a grown man who passes the truck every day on his way to work, there is no uncertainty at all: Joe is still there, at the wheel and on the job -- amazingly, still without a single bathroom break. Warren Shoulberg

Dear Diary:
A few weeks ago I was downtown at Houston and Varick Streets when a panhandler asked for money. In these days of MetroCards and A.T.M. cards, I sometimes walk around with no cash at all. I had no money with me, and told him so.
"You want a quarter?" he asked with some concern. "You might need it for the phone."
Embarrassed, I declined. Myra Alperson
Overheard by Monica Sands, an exhausted tourist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as she plopped into a chair next to her companion: "The art looks so much better when you're sitting down."
Baruch Shemtov witnessed the following encounter between two elderly women on a street on the Upper East Side:
Woman No. 1: "How are you?"
Woman No. 2: "Fine. How are you?"
Woman No. 1: "Fine."
Woman No. 2: "So, what's wrong?"

Dear Diary:
On a recent trip to New York I happened to be walking along Broadway with some girlfriends when we heard a man yelling. He had just gotten out of a taxi and was pounding on the car with his hand trying to get the driver's attention, all the while swearing at the cabbie.
As he continued to follow the taxi, we became aware that we would undoubtedly cross paths with him, and we braced ourselves for what we thought would be an onslaught of insults from this man.
Just as we were about to bump into him, however, he stopped, touched his forehead as though removing a cap, flashed us a smile, said, "Good evening, ladies," in the most amiable tone imaginable, and continued on his way.
A perfect example of New York cordiality. Martha Swann

Dear Diary:
It was a sluggish weekday afternoon on the Uptown No. 3 train.
Suddenly, a particularly grumpy-looking man turned toward two chatting people (who had been having a private conversation, not particularly loudly, at the end of the car) and yelled, "Shut up!"
They were startled, as were the rest of us. Even by New York City standards, the man seemed rude.
Just then, the chatterers stood up and started singing opera, in defiance of their orders to "shut up."
At first, the grumpy man protested and mocked the singers. But soon enough, he -- and the rest of the riders -- grew to enjoy the free impromptu performance.
Just before the grumpy guy stood up to leave the train, he walked over to the singers and apologized to them. He then asked where their next performance would be, for the benefit of the passengers who had just boarded the train.
One of the singers replied, "Carnegie Hall." Kris Belden

Dear Diary:
This sounds like a conversation you might hear in Florida, but I overheard it on Long Island, eavesdropping on an elderly couple evidently discussing plans for dining out:
She (assertively): "You know, I really would like a full order of mussels for myself this time."
He: "Well, then what am I going to eat?"
She: "You could order something that you like for yourself."
He (plaintively): "Then all we are going to share is the bread?" Melba Tarakan

Dear Diary:
My leisurely walk down Broadway on a sun-drenched late morning was suddenly threatened by an approaching (metaphorical) storm.
As I neared a half-dozen men taking a cigarette break outside a building, I saw a highly attractive young blonde approaching from the opposite direction.
I waited for the inevitable: rude noises, suggestive gestures, double -- or more likely, single -- entendre remarks and offers, a woman punished for the sin of being good-looking.
Happily, my fears were misplaced. As the young woman walked by, the men did not growl, whistle or yawp; instead, they began applauding!
The only comment came when one of them called out, "Thank you for making my day!" As the woman walked by, her face broke out in a huge smile.
In a season of war, terror alerts and economic meltdown, it may not seem like much, but what a nice way to welcome the spring -- this small demonstration of a kinder, gentler testosterone outburst. Jeff Greenfield

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Hot Market for a Magazine Not Yet for Sale

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Media executives all over New York are hungrily circling a magazine that is barely profitable, has low recognition outside Manhattan, and oh, by the way, is currently not for sale. 
 But when the property is New York magazine, the practical realities of the media business count for little. The psychic allure of New York -- the weekly magazine that rose out of the ashes of The New York Herald Tribune in 1968 and created a pantheon of literary stars, not to mention a new genre of city magazines -- is intense and durable. So much so that prospective suitors have convinced themselves that they can take a magazine that has been in slow decline as a business and magically transform it into a shiny, new version of its old self. 
 Jann S. Wenner, the owner of Rolling Stone, Us Weekly and Men's Journal, has said he is interested in taking a look at New York, which is owned by Primedia. So has David J. Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, which publishes The National Enquirer and Star, along with magazines like Shape and Men's Fitness. Mortimer B. Zuckerman, an owner of The Daily News of New York and U.S. News & World Report, is considering an acquisition, according to an executive who has talked to him about a possible purchase. The Tribune Company and The New York Times Company, two companies that previously disposed of their magazine divisions, are nonetheless said by others interested in purchasing New York to be considering the magazine. (Mr. Zuckerman, the Tribune and the Times Company all declined to comment.) 
Then there is serious interest from William F. Reilly, the former chief executive of Primedia who is now chairman of Aurelian Communications, the owner of a group of hobbyist magazines. And even Michael Wolff, New York magazine's acid-flinging media columnist, is trying to line up backers, which would make him a player in a business he covers.
The passionate interest in New York is a lot of fuss over a magazine with a circulation of 433,000 and business trend lines that are not very promising. Last year, New York had profit of $1 million to $2 million on revenue of slightly more than $43 million, according to an executive at the company. In 1995, profit was more than $7.8 million on much higher revenue, according to an executive at the company then.
Yet, while typical valuations given media properties would make a magazine like New York worth $20 million to $30 million, it could sell for more than $50 million, perhaps much more. The general principle of pricing media properties on a multiple of earnings could be replaced by an equation based on the size of the buyer's ego. 
Normally hard-bitten businessmen seem to be getting in touch with their inner poet when the subject of New York magazine comes up.
"I have not seen the books, but it looks like it is running out of steam," said Mr. Wenner, the chairman of Wenner Media. "But I would have to think about it if it were available because it occupies a very important position in a very important place. It is a magazine about ideas."
New York was founded by Clay Felker, a well-known figure in New York media who now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley. Beginning with $1 million and the belief that the city was ready for a different sort of journalism, Mr. Felker recruited a roster of contributors who sound like the literary equivalent of a fantasy baseball team: Tom Wolfe, Norman Mailer, Nicholas Pileggi, Gloria Steinem, Gail Sheehy, Jimmy Breslin, Ken Auletta, Richard Reeves, among many others. 
The financial and advertising businesses, industries that had been covered elsewhere with a mixture of reverence and ignorance, frequently found themselves on the wrong end of New York's very sharp pencil. Its feature articles were often snarky -- Tom Wolfe's essay on radical chic redefined protest as fashion -- and other times blazingly earnest, its response to the city's fiscal crisis in 1975 was a cover suggesting "We've Got to Help Ourselves." 
New York's graphic approach, developed by the designer Milton Glaser, created a new template for modern magazines. The city's best illustrators scrambled to contribute to the magazine. Rules about type placement on the cover were broken willy-nilly and a bold photographic approach frequently carried much of the message. Its combination of cheeky and cheery consumer-friendly articles about the best take-out food and dry cleaners became, for better or worse, a building block of most magazines. And its influence was not restricted to the five boroughs: when it put the newly elected president, Gerald R. Ford, on the cover as Bozo the Clown, many political commentators say he never recovered.
"The statement that magazine made when it came out was amazing," said Peter W. Kaplan, the editor of The New York Observer. "The look was revolutionary, the brio was staggering, and for five or six years, Clay Felker's version of New York magazine did something revolutionary. It not only invented the city magazine, it restated the city around it. And that is a great thing."
"Clay Felker used New York magazine to make this city the center of the world, an Athens with good pastrami," Mr. Kaplan added. "And he did it every week. It doesn't get any better than that."
Of course, the passage of time has burnished the memory of the magazine's quality to such a high sheen that some of its flaws are overlooked. New York's unpredictability, a marvel when compared with today's more formulaic magazines, could also result in inconsistency in the quality of writing and choice of topics. An overwrought portrait of a street hustler could be juxtaposed with a serious column on city politics.
Nonetheless, the intrigued buyers are not deterred. Beyond trying to recapture the published magic of a bygone era, there are other more practical, if not necessarily enriching reasons, that publishers covet the magazine. New York magazine may not circulate much in Cincinnati, but in the hothouse of Manhattan's media culture, owning it can get you a great table at Michael's, the Midtown canteen for the media elite, and plenty of invitations to A-list parties. More substantially, any owner will be a player in the civic and cultural dialogue of the city.
For some of the interested parties like Mr. Zuckerman, who timed his sale of Fast Company to the peak of the Internet bubble and came away with about $360 million, the addition of New York could be a door opener to advertising agencies. With such a dazzling property, a media company could gain a new sort of cachet and, maybe, more ads for its more pedestrian titles. (Unfortunately, New York has not had this effect for Primedia's other magazines, like Bowhunter and Automobile.) 
Other would-be suitors have fewer means, but no less ardor. Mr. Wolff would not be specific, beyond saying that, "I love this magazine and I love writing for it, and I know something about how media properties are bought and sold, so I am sitting on the sidelines and watching with great interest." Executives in investment banking said that Mr. Wolff was investigating putting together a deal.
Yet if Primedia does sell New York -- and although it has divested itself of plenty of properties over the last few years, it says it is in no special hurry with this magazine -- the new owner will face obstacles that did not exist in the glory days. The New York Observer speaks to many of the elites the magazine once catered to, and the magazine's listings have been challenged by the growing threat of Time Out New York, which has steadily increased its circulation and ad pages since it began publishing in 1996. The writing excellence that distinguished New York in its golden era has been unleashed into magazines and newspapers everywhere.
More problematic, city magazines, by their nature, can get only so big, imprisoned by the economic cycle of their cities. And the city of New York has been slumping. As a result, New York magazine, which lost more than 9 percent of its ad pages last year, is down even more through April 2003, off 11.8 percent, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. 
Some of the glitter may be dimmed, but it is still a weekly magazine in a profoundly interesting city. "I think I have one of the best jobs in the business," said Caroline Miller, the magazine's current editor in chief. "The DNA of New York, and our readers' expectations, dictate that this magazine should have attitude, be provocative, be highly opinionated, take risks."
The magazine still publishes long articles on the cultural and political life of the city, but under Primedia, there has been increased emphasis on putting consumer-oriented topics on the cover, telling readers where to find the best doctor or hamburger. 
Mr. Kaplan of The New York Observer said he believed that Ms. Miller was a talented editor, but that the publication was less ambitious than it once was. "I think the boundaries of the magazine are not limited by anything other than the short-sightedness of their ownership," he said. Mr. Kaplan, along many others in publishing, is betting that the magazine is just one transaction away from going back to its future.
"The time for Son of New York, a new generation of a great magazine, is upon us," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about potential suitors for New York magazine referred incorrectly to the presidency of Gerald R. Ford, whom the magazine once portrayed on the cover as Bozo the Clown. He was not elected; he took office after the resignation of Richard Nixon.
The article also misstated the founding year of Time Out New York. It was 1995, not 1996.

HEADLINE: Lenders to Those Who Sue Are Challenged on Rates 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
Roberta Rancman was having trouble making ends meet after a car accident with a drunken driver sent her to the hospital five years ago. So she borrowed $7,000 for living expenses from two companies that lend money to people whose only asset is a personal injury lawsuit.
 The companies charged Ms. Rancman rates that would make a loan shark blush. On the other hand, they agreed that she would have to repay them only if she won or settled her injury suit. 
 In 2001, an Ohio appeals court declared the contracts that Ms. Rancman had signed void because the interest was so high. It noted that the lowest possible rate on the larger of the two loans, for $6,000, was at least 280 percent. The Ohio Supreme Court will soon decide the companies' appeal.
The case is the first significant legal challenge to the practices of a flourishing new industry. More than 100 companies nationwide have emerged in the last few years to lend money to people with personal injury lawsuits pending, at rates of 2 percent to 15 percent a month. 
At any given time, executives of the loan companies said, the industry has more than $50 million in outstanding loans.
Many legal experts defend the industry. They say these lenders level the playing field between individual plaintiffs and corporate defendants, allowing plaintiffs to outlast their adversaries' delaying tactics and obtain bigger settlements or jury awards.
Other experts say the companies exploit vulnerable people and encourage or prolong litigation in violation of centuries-old but eroding judicial prohibitions against investing in others' lawsuits.
Ms. Rancman eventually received a $100,000 settlement from an insurance company in her injury suit. But she had second thoughts about repaying the two companies and sued to cancel the contracts she had signed with them. She declined to comment on her suit. Her lawyer did not return a call seeking comment.
Robert M. Stefancin, a lawyer for the Interim Settlement Funding Corporation, one of the companies that lent money to Ms. Rancman, declined to say whether the fee was justified.
"I don't know, and I can't answer that question," Mr. Stefancin said.
But he said the courts should not interfere with the company's contract. He noted that because Ms. Rancman's injury case was complicated and uncertain, the company had taken a substantial risk that its money would never be repaid. That risk, he said, means the transaction should not be considered a loan for purposes of the usury laws, which prohibit excessive interest, but only when the borrower's obligation to repay is absolute.
Susan Lorde Martin, who teaches business law at Hofstra University, said many objections to such loans were unfounded. Borrowers are seldom exploited, Ms. Martin said, because they are typically represented by lawyers as a consequence of their injury suits. And such loans do not encourage frivolous litigation, because lenders screen out claims that are unlikely to result in recoveries.
"Who doesn't want these firms?" Ms. Martin asked. "Corporate defendants. Without these firms, corporate defendants have these poor consumers just where they want them."
Thirteen finance companies filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Ohio Supreme Court defending the industry's practices, if not the interest rates at issue in the case, as "individualized tort reform" that "helps plaintiffs resolve their cases solely on the merits, not on the respective financial conditions of the parties."
Some lenders acknowledge that the fees charged in some cases are excessive and that not every firm is perfectly ethical.
"There are some charlatans," said Michael Blum, the chief executive of LawFinance Group, a San Francisco firm active in the related field of investing in court judgments subject to appeal. "Charging exorbitant rates -- 15, 20 percent a month -- isn't fair and isn't justified."
The loans are for living and medical expenses, which lawyers are generally prohibited from advancing to their clients. They must be repaid only if the borrower wins or settles the lawsuit, and only if money remains after legal fees and expenses.
Most plaintiffs do not need such loans to finance their lawsuits, because lawyers are allowed to charge contingency fees, being paid only if the case is won. As an economic matter, such a fee structure is similar to the loans made to Ms. Rancman. Both are seen as investments in lawsuits.
The prohibition on allowing lawyers to advance living expenses, coupled with an erosion of the prohibition on investing in others' lawsuits, or champerty, has helped create the industry.
There are some satisfied customers. Jerome Brown, 51, is an automobile mechanic and carpenter in St. Petersburg, Fla., who has not been able to work since suffering back injuries in a car accident in 1999. Mr. Brown sued not long after, but the lawsuit progressed slowly.
By the time he turned to a New York company called LawCash in 2001, his family was in dire need of money, he said.
"We were running such a bad streak of luck," Mr. Brown said. "We were running behind in the mortgage, the car payments, the lights, the water, the phone. A couple of times our lights were out. They were literally going to take the house."
He borrowed $15,000 at about 2.75 percent a month. He said it meant that he did not have to choose between an insufficient settlement and paying his bills. He repaid the loan last month and voices no regrets. 
"The interest rate is high," Mr. Brown said. "But what do I care if I can save my house?"
LawCash says it has provided more than $10 million to more than 1,300 people since it was established in late 2000. The average loan is $7,800, and fees are 2 to 4 percent monthly. It has been paid back in about a third of the cases, making $4.3 million on a $3.5 million investment. It says its clients have lost only three cases, involving loans totaling $12,500. The rest of the cases are pending.
Sherry L. Foley, the chief executive of American Asset Finance, a New Jersey firm, said rates had been falling.
"Competition serves to regulate the industry," Ms. Foley said. "Not long ago, 15 percent a month was standard. On the East Coast now, you're looking at 3 percent to 6 percent."
She said those rates were justified.
"In some of these cases, you're going to get zero, and you have to allow for that," she said. "Maybe you're making an 18 to 20 percent return after overhead, the cost of money and the cases you lose. It's not the windfall it seems to be."

HEADLINE: Wrinkle That Brow 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Worried about having nothing new to worry about? Upset that Baghdad turned out to be a cakewalk and SARS didn't lay everybody low? Relax; I've got three piping-hot economic worries to satisfy our lust for fresh anxiety.
 First, deflation, which is more newsworthy than the other two possibilities, inflation and stagnation, because few brokers alive today sold apples on Wall Street for a nickel. 
 This much-needed nail-nibbler was offered by the Federal Reserve last week as it held out "the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation," adding with characteristic pusillanimity, "though minor."
Deflation occurs when too few customers chase too many goods, which drops prices and profits, causing more layoffs and less ability for workers to buy, lowering prices even more and encouraging consumers to wait until everything costs nothing (except college tuition, which will charge a bundle for a course in "deflationary expectations"). 
Is this a worthy worry? Not only is unemployment rising as wholesale prices decline, but Time magazine's cover warns that "Paychecks are shrinking for millions of Americans." Newsweek's Robert Samuelson, who rightly warned about the 90's bubble, urges us this week to heed the lesson of Japan, drooping for a decade because "its countermeasures were too little, too late." Surely deflation, generating its sinking feeling, deserves a place on America's A-list of angst.
Second, to paraphrase Henny Penny -- the dollar is falling! Americans are proud of "the strong dollar," assuming that means a strong economy. But the dollar has been nosediving against the euro, which means the average out-of-work or raiseless American worker will be hard put to afford a bottle of French perfume. 
Can you imagine a politician saying "I'm for a weak dollar"? It is the whimper of a wimp, and when Treasury Secretary John Snow failed to make the usual strong-dollar noises for a brief but memorable moment last week, President Bush's top money man was roundly castigated by every stouthearted jingo journalist. As importers blanched, Andrew Jackson's face on the new $20 bill turned the color of peach.
Deflation together with dollar-in-the-dumps may unnerve our troubadours of trouble, but the worrywart's most worrisome worry is that the federal budget deficit will grow more humongous as far as the eye can see.
We're told that the president's tax cuts will raise the crimson tide of ink by some $650 billion in the next decade, assuming that no other Congress or president is elected in the meantime. According to no fewer than nine White House aspirants, this plunge into profligacy will result in a multi-trillion-dollar overhang that will bankrupt government services, strip away our security and impoverish our grandchildren -- surely cause for prudent pessimists to furrow their brows.
The reader is cautioned not to indulge in all three worries at once. Beware their interaction, for each diminishes the baneful effect of the others.
Deflation? In an economy that employs most workers in services, salaries would buy more. Modest deflation for a time is better for the burger-flipper than the executive. As Jodie Allen observes in U.S. News & World Report, fear of falling prices induces the Fed to keep interest rates very low. That makes home ownership more affordable. 
A weak dollar? That means that the goods we export cost foreigners less, helping U.S. manufacturers sell products abroad. At the same time, it raises the price of imports, encouraging consumers here to buy American, creating more U.S. jobs. Although some foreign investors sell greenbacks (or peachbacks) as the dollar drops, most hold their U.S. stocks and bonds because we're the safest investment climate in the world.
That horrendous deficit? To avert long-term deflation, and to increase the demand that helps coax the business cycle upward, we belong in the red for now. Comes the animal-spirited upturn, company profits and personal incomes will rise and greater tax revenues based on lower rates will flow to Washington and statehouses. That will turn deflation to inflation, strengthen the dollar, balance budgets and cause interest rates to rise again.
Economic worrywarts face the grim need to cheer up. As long as we learn to deal with the right mix of worries, we hardly have a worry in the world.

HEADLINE: No Smoking in New York. See Ya. 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am sorry that Joe Jackson is thinking about leaving the country because of New York's smoking ban (Op-Ed, May 16). Mr. 
Jackson should keep in mind that the main reason for this ban was to protect the workers, not just the patrons.
 As he stated, there are many compromises that can be made to allow smokers to smoke in establishments without bothering the nonsmoking patrons, but the workers would still be affected. Given the high rate of unemployment, you can't argue that if you don't want to work in a smoking environment, you should get another job. All people should have equal access to employment, which I believe overrides equal access to smoking environments. 
 Good luck to Mr. Jackson in his search for a new home. I will welcome him back to New York when he finds that any other place he chooses to live in will eventually come up with its own type of smoking regulations that don't suit him.

HEADLINE: Bermuda Shorts Among Stevedores? Cruise Line Looks to Brooklyn Piers 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Carnival Legend steamed out of New York on Tuesday with 2,300 passengers bound for the Caribbean. On Saturday, the Norwegian Dawn docked at the West Side piers, the first cruise ship in at least 20 years to be based in New York year round.
 Cruise ships have become so popular that Carnival, the largest operator in the world, says that the industry has outgrown the once somnolent West Side piers, and is proposing to build a new $100 million passenger terminal with the city to handle new business on, of all places, the hard-bitten Brooklyn waterfront. 
 The Carnival proposal comes amid tension between the remaining maritime industries in South Brooklyn and proposals to develop waterfront parks and residential projects. Meanwhile, a study by the city on the future of South Brooklyn maritime industries is under way, and the city's position on whether the proposal goes forward is by no means clear. 
The terminal would sit at the foot of Atlantic Avenue, where burlap bags of cocoa beans are now stacked to the ceiling of a blue shed that runs down Pier 7. Pacing the 1,300-foot length of the pier on a recent morning was Giora Israel, Carnival's vice president for strategic planning. He said that unlike the city's West Side piers, Pier 7 could easily accommodate the company's 1,150-foot Queen Mary II, the first trans-Atlantic passenger ship under construction in 35 years, which is to sail next year.
"As an industry, we want to really increase the number of passengers we carry out of New York," Mr. Israel said. "We're getting a new ship every 47 days. But we need to add capacity."
City officials said they were considering the proposal, but stopped short of embracing it.
"It's exciting to see the growth of New York tourism," Joshua J. Sirefman, chief operating officer of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said of Carnival's proposal. "But we have to assess it in the context of how to ensure the industry has a capacity for growth, the transformation of Brooklyn Bridge Park and the long-term future of the Brooklyn waterfront."
Even before the attacks of Sept. 11 prompted many people to avoid jet travel, vacationers were flocking to cruise ships, once the province of retirees and faded celebrities. In the last five years, according to the Cruise Lines International Association, the number of passengersembarking from North American ports has climbed 47 percent to about 8 million, while the number leaving from New York alone has risen 157 percent to an estimated 448,000.
"Your grandmother's cruise line is no more," said Jeffrey Kivet, chairman of Cruise Value Centers in East Brunswick, N.J., a large travel agency. "You eat when you want, with whom you want. You don't have to dress in a tuxedo. There are spas, restaurants, shows, casinos and things for the kids to do."
Rather than waiting for travelers to fly to Miami or San Juan to get on a ship, ships now sail out of Baltimore; Philadelphia; Norfolk, Va.; Charleston, S.C.; New Orleans; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Los Angeles; and San Francisco.
"The cruise business post-9/11 is a business of drive-to ports," said John Tercek, vice president for commercial development of Royal Caribbean Cruises. 
It is anyone's guess whether the cruise ship business will continue to expand so quickly. The cruise lines have had to offer sometimes steep discounts to keep their berths full during the recession and the war in Iraq. But they have fared better than other elements of the tourism industry.
"The cruise industry has held up relatively well when compared with the travel industry as a whole," said Glen Reid, an analyst with Bear Stearns. "To the extent there's port capacity, I think you'll see more and more ships leaving New York, Baltimore, Jacksonville and New Orleans."
Given the size of its metropolitan market, the cruise lines all want to expand in New York.
"The West Side terminals are jammed and outmoded," Mr. Tercek said. "We have a similar need as Carnival, though it's not as pressing. But we'd love to grow in New York, and we are cramped."
It is a sharp turnabout for the West Side piers, between 46th and 50th Streets, which underwent a $40 million renovation in the 1970's as part of a deal between the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to build the World Trade Center. But many economists saw the project as a white elephant, because cruise ships were rapidly becoming relics of the past.
Gone were the days when crowds would line the docks as the Queen Mary, Lusitania and the Mauretania slid into the Chelsea Piers, or soldiers mounted the gangplanks of warships bound for battle in Europe. The ships later moved north to the West Side docks, nicknamed Luxury Liner Row. But the industry nearly sank after daily plane service to Europe began in 1958.
The number of passengers traveling from New York piers fell to fewer than 200,000 from the 1970's through the early 1990's.
But with business suddenly booming four years ago, the cruise lines explored ways to renovate and expand on the West Side. Executives said the piers were outmoded and ill-equipped. At times the terminal area is gridlocked, with five ships in the harbor, 7,500 passengers trying to disembark, even as 7,500 others are trying to get on board.
The industry concluded it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to renovate the terminal, and they wanted much of it to come from public coffers. Still, Mr. Israel of Carnival said, there is little room to expand, which led the company to look in Brooklyn.
Carnival is proposing to knock down the storage shed on Pier 7 and build two terminals, a conference center and a 1,000-car garage, which, Mr. Israel said, would not rise higher than the current structure and block the views of nearby residents. One person involved in the talks between Carnival and the city said the company has signaled that it would be willing to pay about three-quarters of the $100 million cost, providing it could get tax-free financing.
Mr. Israel said the cruise ship industry spends an estimated $800 million a year on provisions and services in New York.
The Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, has applauded the proposal. "I have no doubt it'll be successful," he said. "It represents jobs. We're reclaiming the waterfront, and it'll promote tourism."
But Brooklyn's piers are in the midst of change. The Port Authority is giving Piers 1 through 5 to the city for the creation of a waterfront park. Sal Catucci, chief executive of American Stevedoring, operates Piers 6 through 12 under a lease with the Port Authority. Mr. Catucci, who employs 1,000 workers, has built up a thriving business, handling cocoa, lumber and containers headed for Brooklyn, Manhattan and Long Island.
Mr. Catucci said he could move the cocoa operation, the largest in the country, to another pier to make room for the passenger terminal. 
"It would be great for the area to have passenger ships," he said. "It'd bring a lot to the neighborhood."
Mr. Catucci is more worried about the fact that the Port Authority has refused to extend his lease beyond 2004, while the city engages in a study about maritime uses on the Brooklyn waterfront. Bette Stoltz, executive director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, which works with waterfront businesses, is also concerned about what happens next.
"How can you give away the last piece of the port we've got?" she asked. "We generally think maritime use of the waterfront is good. We also think Carnival's proposal makes sense in that it's consistent with the kind of tourism development that the Brooklyn Bridge Park will bring."

HEADLINE: Views Differ About Aides In Classrooms 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
When the New York City teachers' union sued the Bloomberg administration this month to halt the layoffs of 864 classroom aides, emotional union leaders described aides as integral to the education of children and the sanity of teachers.
 Yet some education experts and children's advocates say classroom aides are not as crucial as the union, the United Federation of Teachers, would have it seem. They say that the $568 million spent on their salaries and benefits each year supports what is primarily a jobs program for residents of poor neighborhoods that New York can no longer afford. 
 Almost four decades after the school system began hiring classroom aides, the city's nearly 17,000 aides have formed a distinct subculture -- below teachers in the hierarchical chain, but with advantages that most teachers lack. The aides -- also called paraprofessionals -- are not in charge of classrooms and are not formally evaluated, so they do not face nearly the same pressures that teachers do. 
Supporters say one reason aides are valuable is that many live in the neighborhoods where they work, so they know the local culture and residents better than teachers, who tend to commute to their schools from other areas. That is one reason why Congress began allotting school districts money to hire aides as part of the War on Poverty in the 1960's.
But New York principals and teachers say that the academic contributions of classroom aides vary widely in a system where they are not formally trained, are often poorly educated and have few contractual duties. Many are godsends, teachers say -- especially in overcrowded classrooms or among children with chronic behavior problems. Others, they say, are an annoyance or worse.
"You have some who will just sit there unless you tell them what to do, then after they do it, they just go back and sit again," said one veteran teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. "They're not paid very well, so there's not a lot of motivation."
New York is not alone in hiring classroom aides in large numbers. There are more than 10 times as many nationwide as there were 30 years ago: 642,294 in 2000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, compared with 57,418 in 1970. Most work in urban schools with large numbers of poor children, partly because those schools receive federal Title I funds that help pay the aides' salaries.
Research suggests that classroom aides make little difference in student achievement, even though one of their chief roles is to work with children who are lagging behind. The main reason, according to the research, is because most aides are poorly educated -- only about 20 percent of those paid for with federal Title I funds have bachelor's degrees, according to a United States Department of Education study released in 2000. The study found that in the poorest schools, the number is even lower: about 10 percent.
In New York, 11,800 classroom aides -- about 70 percent of the total -- work with disabled students, who are required by the courts to have full-time aides. An additional 4,000 work in elementary school classrooms, either assigned to a small group of low-performing students or helping the teacher supervise the entire class.
The remaining 900 are high school paraprofessionals, who are supposed to work with special-education or low-performing students but who often end up doing office work, teachers say.
"The dirty little secret is that there are many paraprofessionals who work in school offices, mainly doing secretarial-type work," said one veteran teacher at a Brooklyn high school. "This is definitely outside their job description."
Classroom aides are separate from school aides, who monitor lunchrooms, hallways and playgrounds and do office work. The city's 13,000 school aides belong to a different union, District Council 37, and many work part time. The city intends to lay off about 1,300 school aides, but that plan has provoked less outcry.
The latest teachers' contract requires aides to have at least six credits toward a college degree by the end of their first year on the job, and guarantees raises for those who keep earning credits. But only 2,000 at most are enrolled in college classes now, a union spokesman estimated. Many have weak English skills and poor grammar, teachers and principals say.
"The children who have the greatest instructional needs get help from paras with the least preparation," said Noreen Connell, executive director of the Education Priorities Panel, which monitors schools. "A school that relies on a lot of educational services by paraprofessionals is not going to do very well by its students."
Stanley S. Litow, a former deputy schools chancellor, looked for a correlation between the number of classroom aides in each of the community school districts and overall student performance in the early 1990's.
"We uncovered that the districts with the highest spending on paras had lowest achievement levels," Mr. Litow said. "Those who spent their discretionary dollars on extra teachers and professional development did better, regardless of socioeconomics."
Yet many teachers say the mere presence of aides is invaluable in overcrowded classrooms, or any classroom with disruptive students. Many city classrooms have more than 30 students, which teachers say is too many for one adult to handle.
"At some point it becomes an exercise in herding cats," said one kindergarten teacher in Brooklyn who has an aide for two hours a day to help with 28 students.
In flusher economic times, many more early-childhood classrooms had aides. But as cuts have chipped away at school budgets, most of those classrooms have lost them.
The planned layoff of the 864 classroom aides, due to take place at the end of June, would save the city $22 million a year, the Education Department said.
Some teachers consider themselves better off without aides. The class, race and cultural divides that are common between teachers and aides sometimes create tensions that make it difficult for them to work together. Unlike teachers, the majority of aides are black or Hispanic and poor -- they earn an average of $23,000 a year, compared with a national average of $18,000 for classroom aides -- and many are single mothers whose families depend on their incomes.
A Brooklyn teacher infuriated her aide by calling her an aide -- the correct title is "educational assistant," according to the union contract -- and many aides consider the term derogatory. The two barely spoke for months.
Other problems arise when aides are not given specific, consistent duties. One teacher recalled how her aide used to talk on her cellphone during class, while another said her aide would fall asleep during lessons. Yet another teacher watched an aide peruse a catalog for two hours.
Principals have little say in the hiring of aides, and usually cannot even interview them. They are hired and assigned by the community school district offices, and since they are unionized, those with seniority can transfer into desirable schools, regardless of their qualifications.
A Queens principal said he recently lost an aide and wanted to replace her, but "the one on deck from the district office is supposed to be bad, so I'd rather keep the slot empty."
The new federal education law, No Child Left Behind, recognizes that many classroom aides lack sufficient training. In schools that receive federal Title I funds -- including most of New York City's 1,200 -- all classroom aides will have to complete at least two years of college or pass a qualifying exam by 2006.
In the city, the Education Department already pays for any classroom aide lacking a bachelor's degree to take college classes. Under the union contract, aides taking at least five credits per semester can get two and a half hours off from work every week to attend classes, which can get them a higher salary -- up to $27,000 a year, depending on seniority -- and help them eventually become teachers.
The Education Department could not provide the program's cost. About 7,000 aides have become teachers through the program since its inception in 1970, according to the department. 
Yet there are signs that many aides are ill-equipped to become teachers. The New York City Teaching Fellows program, which provides fast-track training for people with no teaching experience and has them teach while they pursue a master's degree, accepts classroom aides. But so many of them fail the state certification exam and do poorly on a writing sample, both prerequisites for the program, that few have been accepted, one person familiar with the statistics said.
Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a Washington group that works as an advocate for poor children, said that while aides do bring more diversity to school staffs and provide a link between schools and neighborhoods, they are expendable in times of budget crisis.
"It always feels like a really heartless thing to lay off paras," Ms. Haycock said, "but if you ask the question, 'Are these folks making a major contribution to student achievement?' the research in general on that says no."
But Daria Rigney, principal of Public School 126 in Chinatown, said that aides need only be well-trained to make a powerful difference in classrooms. Her school's nine classroom aides work with small groups of students on carefully planned lessons and attend training workshops along with teachers.
"They really are working every minute because they, like our teachers, know there is not a moment to waste," Ms. Rigney said. "The culture of the paras needs to be very much the culture of the whole school."

HEADLINE: Even as Executives Scorn the Genre, TV Networks Still Rely on Reality 

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
With a cloud of ratings dust, reality programming rode to the rescue of an increasingly besieged network television business several years ago. But network executives have not turned to each other in relief to say: "Who was that masked man? We wanted to thank him."
 Instead, the message last week during the networks' fall-season program previews seemed to be: "Thanks a lot. Now get lost." 
 A reality backlash seems to have hit network television, even as many of the programs remain among the most popular prime-time shows. One issue is wariness by advertisers regarding the questionable taste of programs like "Married by America." But some producers of reality programming say their genre is meeting resistance from network television's entrenched system of program creation, in which big production studios, talent agencies and networks all conspire to see that scripted comedies and dramas, in which all those groups have a vested financial interest, continue to dominate network prime-time schedules. 
In New York last week, as representatives of the networks addressed advertisers during what is known as the upfront sales presentations, the network officials pointedly disavowed future reliance on reality shows, even though the roster of new series -- heavily dependent on comedies about blended families of one form or another -- left many advertising executives wondering where all the fresh new ideas were.
"Ultimately, having a reality-laden network is not a great business," Susan Lyne, the president of ABC Entertainment, said in a news conference preceding ABC's presentation to advertisers.
The other networks clearly agree. As recently as February, networks were predicting as many as 12 reality shows could be on their fall schedules, but now the total will be only 6.
The established hits of the genre, "Survivor," "American Idol" and to a lesser extent, "The Bachelor," are still enthusiastically supported. And network officials and advertising executives acknowledge that new reality shows are likely to find their way onto schedules as midseason replacements.
But for the most part last week, the network executives put down reality shows as no better than schedule fillers, bad for the image of a network, bad for the business in general and even, according to the late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel, who spoke at ABC's presentation, something truly unworthy and dismissible. Mr. Kimmel summed up the genre with a vulgarism. 
Creators of reality television cannot help but feel jilted.
"It makes absolutely no sense that this genre is now getting dumped on this way," said Michael Davies, the producer who started the trend in 1999 with the ABC game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."
"How do they think this makes the people who put these shows on feel?" Mr. Davies said. "These people have done something pretty incredible for these networks, and now they're out there insulting them."
The sudden cooling of the ardor for reality would seem to fly in the face of the genre's impressive ratings record. The reality shows "Joe Millionaire," "American Idol" and "Survivor" occupy 5 of the top 10 places in this season's prime-time ratings standings. And of the seven shows that could be labeled phenomenal hits in the last four years, all but one -- CBS's "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" -- have been reality shows. Perhaps most significant, reality shows have proved especially popular with teenagers and young adult viewers, an audience that had been drifting away to cable channels before reality came along.
Mr. Davies and the other big producers in the reality genre -- Mark Burnett of "Survivor," Mike Fleiss of "The Bachelor" and Ben Silverman, the former William Morris agent who imported the first phalanx of reality shows from European television -- now plan to meet to, as Mr. Davies put it, "see what we can do to stick up for these shows."
Why are the networks now so eager to disparage the very programming that has been saving their bacon?
Mainly, network executives point to advertisers who they say have asserted their desire to place commercials in "quality" scripted shows, while avoiding the unpredictable content of reality shows. "The advertisers have spoken," Jeff Zucker, president of NBC Entertainment, said in a telephone interview after the upfront presentations. "They just don't want to take this kind of show sight-unseen anymore."
Many advertising executives acknowledged they had discussions with the networks this spring, in the wake of a spate of less successful reality entries like "Are You Hot?" on ABC and "Married By America" on Fox.
The demonization of reality heard last week stemmed partly from the fact that network executives were "responding to what a lot of advertisers had asked them to respond to," said Stacey Shepatin, vice president and director for national broadcast at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"The fact that some of these shows have been so successful means viewers are willing to take a risk and try them," Ms. Shepatin said, "but it's a bit different with advertisers because you have to be careful what you want your brand associated with."
Mr. Davies conceded that reality producers "have to take some responsibility" for turning off some advertisers. "We're cannibalizing ourselves," he said. "We're doing 15 versions of the same idea."
That, of course, is nothing new to television, which always mass-produces copies of hit shows.
But Mr. Davies disputed the idea that all advertisers had cooled to reality ideas, pointing to his own dealings with one big reality backer, Pepsi. And Mr. Burnett said he had never had trouble selling advertisers on his reality concepts, whether "Survivor" or the coming summer NBC series "The Restaurant" (which is partly owned by the companies advertising in it). "Everybody at the CBS presentation went wild," he said, when he introduced his plan for a new "Survivor" featuring some of the most memorable contestants from previous editions.
And certainly the high points of enthusiasm at the Fox and ABC presentations seemed to center on announcements about "American Idol" and "The Bachelor."
"There's just huge buzz around good reality shows that you don't get with scripted shows, unless it's a finale or something," Mr. Burnett said.
But for advertising executives, popularity and buzz may be secondary to concerns about the content of reality programming.
"Even when advertisers have questions about content on a scripted show, they're less concerned because it's part of the plot," said Steve Sternberg, the senior vice president of Global Media, a media buying company. "Watching a torture scene on a show like '24' is O.K. because you expect it there," Mr. Sternberg said, referring to the scripted series on Fox. But watching a real person forced to eat worms on the reality show "Fear Factor" makes advertisers much more squeamish, he said.
Not many months ago, reality shows were seen as offering special opportunities to advertisers because of the potential for product placement within the programs -- an alluring prospect as new recording technologies like TiVo are helping viewers avoid conventional commercials. And yet, last week every network reported hearing the message that advertisers might pay a premium for a new high-quality comedy or drama, but not for a new reality show.
Other forces are at work in elbowing reality shows off fall schedules, beginning with the basic fact that the upfront presentations are about pilots -- first looks at series that can be trotted out before advertisers who will pay in advance to buy time in them, based on a formula of audience estimates set by the networks. Reality shows do not shoot pilots, which forces networks to make commitments, or not, based solely on the concepts.
"You can't justify an upfront season without pilots," Mr. Davies said.
The pilots, of course, are filled with stars backed by talent agencies, which want the program cycle to continue so their commissions will continue. The pilots are produced by studios, and, as Mr. Burnett pointed out, increasingly the networks themselves are aligned with those studios under a parent company. In other cases the networks take financial stakes in the shows by becoming the studios' profit partners. Such relationships make the networks just as interested as the studios in creating shows whose reruns can be sold many times over in the future.
Except for "Fear Factor," reality shows almost never appear as reruns. That leaves them outside the basic economic structure of the business, which is based on selling repeats for profit, first on the network itself and then in syndication. "Networks make money on repeats," Mr. Sternberg said. "The system doesn't like reality shows."
But Mr. Davies noted what he called an amazing sameness to the networks' schedules. "I come at this from a foreign, British, standpoint," he said, "but it seems to me there's just a remarkable amount of drama and comedy on these schedules. There's not enough comedy on the planet to fill that much time. There's just not that much to laugh at."
Mr. Zucker of NBC emphasized that reality was not going to disappear just because it was not as evident on the fall schedules. In fact, he, like other network programmers, plans to flood the airwaves with reality over the summer, hoping to find a show or two that might break through as a regular-season entry.
A ready reserve of reality shows will be important, said Bob Riordan, senior vice president and director for national broadcast at MPG in New York, part of the Media Planning Group agency owned by Havas.
"We all know that well over 50 percent of the new programs will not make the grade," Mr. Riordan said. "And what's waiting in the wings when those shows fail in the fourth quarter? Reality."

HEADLINE: Foundations Roiled By Measure to Spur Increase in Charity 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The House is considering a bill that could force the nation's foundations to give away more of their money to charity each year, creating a potential windfall of billions of dollars for nonprofit groups.
 The bill has created a furor in the philanthropic world, with foundations warning that they could be forced to squander their assets and spend themselves out of existence. Its supporters, however, say it will actually rein in wasteful spending -- on salaries and overhead -- as it gives charities needed help in a time of withering government budgets and growing economic pain. 
 The legislation is the House version of a bill passed last month in the Senate intended to create incentives to charitable giving. The House bill, unlike the Senate one, would modify an existing law that requires foundations to give at least 5 percent of their assets to charities every year in order to maintain their tax-exempt status. 
The current law allows foundations to include administrative expenses like rent, accounting fees and salaries in that 5 percent target. The new bill would require that all 5 percent go to charity.
Hence the uproar. "If we are consistently required to pay out more than we already do, it will eat into capital and the country will lose these resources, these public assets for the common good," said Susan V. Berresford, the president of the Ford Foundation, who is one of the most vocal opponents of the proposed changes to the tax law.
Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican who introduced the bill with Harold E. Ford Jr., a Tennessee Democrat, said he was surprised at its hostile reception in the foundation world. "Frankly, I'm concerned about that, and as a matter of fact, that convinces me there may be even more of a need for this than I thought there was," Mr. Blunt said.
Mr. Blunt, the House majority whip, said he and other representatives had added the provision to the House bill because they thought some foundations were spending too much on compensation, rent and other expenses. Several foundations have recently come under scrutiny for spending lavishly on offices and payments to board members, even as the economy has soured.
Last month, for instance, The San Jose Mercury News reported that the James Irvine Foundation's assets had fallen 25 percent, to $1.2 billion, since June 2000. That is not surprising, given the fall in the stock market. But during that decline, the newspaper reported, Dennis Collins, the foundation's president until early last year, received compensation totaling about $600,000 annually. The foundation's offices have a wrap-around view of the San Francisco Bay.
Mr. Blunt noted that foundations were required to pay out at least 6 percent of their assets until the early 1980's. "I'm told that their average cost of administration is four-tenths of one percent," he said, citing a widely accepted figure, "so all this bill does is increase the amount they would have to spend to 5.4 percent." 
The bill would also give foundations a tax break, since it includes a provision that would lower the excise taxes they pay to 1 percent from 2 percent.
Rick Cohen, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, said that according to data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics at the Urban Institute, the country's roughly 64,000 foundations paid out $27.3 billion in 2001, $4.3 billion of which went to cover operating and administrative expenses.
Foundation leaders and others insist that the new bill, by effectively forcing them to increase spending, could put an end to foundations that have endured across generations.
"It's a legitimate concern," said Michael Klausner, a professor at the Stanford Law School who teaches nonprofit law. "They would still be around over a longer time than you or I will exist, but they will with reasonable certainty spend themselves out of business eventually."
The only alternative, Dr. Klausner said, would be to try to increase their endowments through riskier investments, which would probably also incite criticism. The Council on Foundations, a trade group, estimates that foundations must make a 9.5 percent return on their investments just to maintain their endowments.
The Senate considered adding similar provisions about foundation giving to its version of the bill, known as the CARE Act (the letters stand for Charity, Aid, Recovery and Empowerment), but did not include it in the end. Mr. Blunt conceded that he did not know how the provisions would fare in the House.
How much of their assets foundations should be required to spend has long been a contentious issue in the philanthropic world. But the debate has become increasingly heated in the last two years, as academics and business consultants have joined it.
McKinsey & Company's Institute on the Nonprofit Sector raised hackles last year with an analysis suggesting that foundation assets spent to address today's problems had more value than assets held for future use. That argument was recently rebutted by Dr. Klausner.
While some foundations spend more than the required minimum, the vast majority pay out no more than 5 percent of their assets each year -- although Congress set that rate as a minimum, not a ceiling.
"Foundations are acting like investment bankers and not grant makers," said Pablo Eisenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Volunteer Organizations and Service at Georgetown University and a longtime advocate of raising foundation payout rates. "They have no sense of responsibility to communities at a time when government funding and private funding are being cut."
Dorothy S. Ridings, president of the Council on Foundations, said that examples of wasteful spending, while embarrassing, were few and far between. Mr. Blunt and other members of Congress "are concerned about allegations of excess in salaries and rents and so forth, and we know we have problems in that area," she said. "But unfortunately, this legislation is taking a baseball bat to kill a bee."
Ms. Ridings, other foundation leaders and even some regulators said they were concerned that the bill would shift too much focus to expenses and discourage foundations from spending on things like accounting, oversight and legal matters at a time when the public is demanding greater transparency.
"This unfairly punishes the institutional, established foundations that have professional staff and management and with whom we don't have compliance problems, and it supports smaller foundations, which tend not to have that infrastructure and where we find many of the problems," said William Josephson, the assistant New York State attorney general in charge of charity oversight.
Karl Stauber, president of the Northwest Area Foundation in St. Paul, said that in its current form, the proposed legislation would increase the foundation's payout in some years to as much as 8 percent, depending on fluctuations in staff and other expenses.
That would almost certainly put the $420 million Northwest Area Foundation out of business over time, he said, which would violate the intentions expressed by its founder, Louis W. Hill, who directed that it exist in perpetuity.
Mr. Stauber and others said the proposed legislation might even reduce income at smaller, grass-roots nonprofit organizations. One way foundations could cut costs is by funneling contributions through larger, more established organizations like the March of Dimes or the Red Cross, which have more sophisticated infrastructures and thus require less oversight by donors.
Another way to escape the provisions of the bill would be to change into a so-called operating foundation, which directly runs its own programs and services rather than making grants to third parties. Operating foundations are excluded from the bill's provisions relating to private foundations and are required to spend only 3.5 percent of their assets annually.
Mr. Stauber said Northwest Area would consider such a move. Ms. Ridings said she had talked to "quite a few, but not a bunch" of other foundations that had raised the same possibility. 
Mr. Stauber added, "The perverse effect of this attempt to increase charitable giving could be to actually decrease charitable giving to nonprofits." 
Mr. Blunt dismissed the possibility of a potential negative impact on the nonprofit sector as bluster. 
"I think that's what I call the Washington Monument strategy," he said. "You see it typically when the government tries to cut something and those opposed to the cut find the biggest and most visible thing people will be offended by and affected by the most and say it's threatened -- something the size of the Washington Monument."

HEADLINE: Hard-Pressed States Try Sunday Liquor Sales 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: REHOBOTH BEACH, Del., May 18 

 BODY:
At the stroke of noon today, Sunday, the old day of rest, Alvin and Rose Mary Harper, retirees from Lewes, Del., pulled into Atlantic Liquors on Route 1 in a Ford S.U.V. Big black letters on the marquee in front of the store said, "Now Open Sundays."
 They looked around. "We haven't seen any pickets," Mr. Harper said. They loaded a shopping cart with a bottle of creme de cacao and a case of Smirnoff. With that, the Harpers became Atlantic Liquors' first-ever Sunday liquor store shoppers, and among Delaware's first. 
 "We drink martinis," Mrs. Harper said. "We ran out of vodka." 
With barely a whimper from temperance interests, bans on Sunday liquor sales, the most durable of the nation's old blue laws, are tumbling. Pressed to trim their worst budget deficits in 50 years, state legislatures find that by letting liquor stores open on Sundays, the stores will sell more liquor. The states can then collect more revenues from excise taxes on liquor, on sales taxes and on liquor store profits.
So on Thursday, Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, a Democrat, signed a law allowing Sunday liquor store sales from noon to 8 p.m. With little public notice last week, the New York State Legislature allowed Sunday sales, provided the stores close another day of the week. They can begin opening on Sundays in a few weeks, after the state liquor authority prepares regulations.
Oregon, with one of the nation's deepest deficits, allowed Sunday liquor sales last year. Early this year, Pennsylvania began allowing Sunday sales by 61 of its 600-some state-owned stores and might let them all open on Sundays in two years. The laws could be dropped or relaxed soon in Kansas, Rhode Island and Washington State. Except for Texas, four of the five most populous states now allow liquor stores to open on Sundays.
"We're chipping away at the pedestal," said Frank Coleman, senior vice president and spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a lobbying group in Washington for the hard-liquor companies. "When Pennsylvania went, hence went New York and Delaware. New York was a big win. No doubt about that. It's rolling up the coast."
Dale Lomas, co-owner of Atlantic Liquors, across an eight-lane highway from a Presbyterian church, is adding two or three sales clerks to manage traffic on Sunday, the nation's second-largest sale day for most everything else and now, presumably liquor. "From now on in any advertising we do," Mr. Lomas said, "we will promote the Sunday thing."
Within minutes of the store's opening, cars were stopping in its parking lot in the same numbers they were visiting other stores. A high-volume discount store, it specializes in cases and boxes of bottles -- 30-can packs of Bud Light for $14.99, half-gallon bottles of whiskey and gin, two-magnum shrink-wrapped parcels of wine for $12.99 -- and the pricier items, like a bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne for $119.99.
With Sunday sales and low prices, Mr. Lomas is now a contender for vital weekend business that Pennsylvania and Maryland were taking from Delaware, the reason that persuaded the Delaware Legislature to abolish the Sunday ban. 
 "If we run out, we don't have to run to Ocean City in Maryland to get it," said Joe DeLellis of Pottsville, Pa., who was picking up two 30-can boxes of Coors Light. Ocean City can be an hour's drive away, a long time to break away from a liquor-short Sunday barbecue. 
 Maria Spinelli, his companion, said: "We were always having to get it Saturday night. Now we're getting it Sunday." Delaware stores, with no sales tax, undercut other states. Ms. Spinelli and Mr. DeLellis paid $14 for their 30-packs. "They're $20 in Pennsylvania, Ms. Spinelli said.
 Carole Burkholder of Newark, Del., who has a second home in Bethany Beach, Del., stopped in with her mother, Vivian Cox. "This is more convenient," Mrs. Burkholder said. Mrs. Cox added, "I don't believe in the government telling what you can do and can't do, like on Sunday."
 In Delaware, most opposition to Sunday liquor sales arose from the Delaware Asian-American Business Association, made up largely of about 140 package store owners, mostly of Indian origin. Most of the stores are small, with little or no staff, so to compete, the owners would have to work Sundays. Owners of big stores who promoted the change have large and flexible staffs. Atlantic Liquors has 16 employees.
Saturday evening in the poor, largely black community of Georgetown, Del., about 20 miles west of Rehoboth Beach, J. R. Patel was ringing up single-bottle sales of beer and wine to a steady stream of customers from the neighborhood.
"I've got no choice but to open Sundays to stay in the business," Mr. Patel said. "There are four stores in this town. It's not going to help me." If he hires someone to work Sundays, Mr. Patel said, "it will cost me $100. I can lose money on it."
Proponents of the new law said they had heard little from religious or temperance groups. Nor did they hear from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which lobbies for laws to keep drinkers off the road. "We haven't taken a position on" Sunday sales laws, Wendy Hamilton, president of MADD, said.
Still, Ms. Hamilton said, MADD gives Delaware a C-minus, compared with a national average of C, for laws to control drunken driving and fatal, alcohol-related accidents. "We would be concerned that the state Legislature look at this from a safety perspective," she said. "They've got some holes they need to plug."
 But the fiscal economics of liquor consumption have been bringing legislatures along. Consumption of liquor in the 24 states without Sunday sales is 1.65 gallons per capita a year, the Distilled Spirits Council says, compared with 2.02 gallons per capita in states with Sunday sales. 
 For Delaware, a small state, Sunday sales would raise the state's annual alcoholic beverage tax revenues $960,000 to $1.2 million, William R. Latham, an economist at the University of Delaware, reported in a study that the big stores commissioned. Mr. Latham also concluded that the sales would raise all state and local tax revenues $1.7 million to $2.1 million. 
 New York has been wrestling with the same issues of out-of-state competition and budget deficits that plague Delaware. Steven Glamuzina, president of the Empire Liquor Store Association and owner of a 9,000-square-foot wine and liquor store in Buffalo, said upstate liquor store sales had been hurt by the loss of Sunday customers to Canada, and now Pennsylvania.
 "We've been pushing for seven years straight," Mr. Glamuzina said. "We've got the Buffalo Bills. If you're having a party for them on Sunday and run out of something," Mr. Glamuzina added, "you're out of luck." And so, he said, is his store.
 By letting New York stores open six days a week, including Sunday, the Distilled Spirits Council estimated that New York would collect $26.7 million in additional state tax revenue, or about 7 percent more than currently and $36 million more if it allowed them all seven days.
 Such calculations also helped bring along both houses of the New York Legislature. In overriding Gov. George E. Pataki's budget vetoes last week, they enacted a bill permitting the sales any six days including Sunday.
 Mr. Glamuzina will keep pressing for seven days. "Some old-timers are against it," he said. "But I've had nobody call me from any churches."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Monday about the legalizing of Sunday liquor sales in some states misstated the racial makeup of Georgetown, Del., where one businessman, J. R. Patel, said he had to open his store on Sundays to stay competitive. It is about 21 percent black, not largely black.

HEADLINE: Legislature's Second Fiddles Take Lead Roles in Budget Fight 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 18 

 BODY:
In a political system in which the majority party rules, being the leader of the minority party is a lot like being the second-string quarterback, the understudy in a Broadway show or the sous-chef in a celebrated kitchen.
 There is usually hard work involved, for not much money and even less glory, and too many hours spent waiting around for the right moment to shine. 
 For Albany's two minority leaders -- Senator David A. Paterson and Assemblyman Charles H. Nesbitt -- that moment has finally arrived. In the midst of a fractious budget battle between Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and the Democratic-led Assembly and Republican-controlled Senate, the minority leaders suddenly found themselves thrust center stage last week, in perhaps the most important political drama playing out in the state. 
After months of deadlock, Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans passed a $92.8 billion budget in early May over Governor Pataki's objections. The governor retaliated by vetoing the budget, calling it fiscally irresponsible. On Thursday, legislative leaders moved to override the governor's budget vetoes, the first such action in more than two decades. 
But because legislative politics is essentially a numbers game, the fate of the override hinged on the cooperation of Mr. Paterson, who controlled four of the votes needed in the Senate. A budget override requires the support of two-thirds of the 62 senators, or 42 votes, and there are only 38 Republicans.
In the Assembly, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than two to one, the minority never had enough votes to change the outcome. Yet Mr. Nesbitt steadfastly backed Governor Pataki even when some of his minority members balked, becoming the sharpest voice of opposition to the majority leaders in an otherwise muted debate.
"It's a rare opportunity when the minority leaders can actually influence public policy in a big way," said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. "In a normal debate, the only role they have is the bully pulpit and their ability to gum up the process with procedural roadblocks."
Though Mr. Paterson and Mr. Nesbitt are hardly newcomers to Albany, they have never been in a better position to raise their public profiles. Skilled politicians who each orchestrated his own rise to leadership last year -- Mr. Paterson by leading a coup against his predecessor, and Mr. Nesbitt by beating out a heavily favored rival -- the two are hungry for a larger role in the political process.
Even so, they could not be more different. 
Mr. Paterson, 48, is a charming, energetic lawyer who is legally blind. He wears sharply tailored suits, gives eloquent speeches on liberal causes, and is the son of a Harlem political legend, Basil A. Paterson, the former secretary of state and deputy mayor of New York. 
Mr. Nesbitt, 55, enlisted in the Army after high school and became a decorated helicopter pilot in Vietnam before returning to Albion, N.Y., west of Rochester, to run the family auto dealership. He comes across as reserved and conservative. "He has a kind of quiet, but methodical tenacity," explained Senator George D. Maziarz, a Republican who has known Mr. Nesbitt for a decade. "He's a combat soldier. He's got a goal, he knows what it is, and he gets there."
Each in his own way, the minority leaders are fighting a political system that is stacked against them. The conventional wisdom in Albany is that all political matters of import are decided by Governor Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno -- the so-called "three men in a room." 
Indeed, such is the power of the majority leaders that they control the very minutiae of governing, down to who gets what office and which lawmakers are listed on bills as sponsors. Even more important, the majority leaders are the ones who dispense the discretionary funds, known as member items, that legislators bring home to their districts.
The minority party, in contrast, has to struggle to be relevant. Its members complain that the majority will steal their ideas for legislation and then take the credit. Stanley Fink, who was Assembly speaker in the early 1980's, used to say that the only way for a minority member to attract attention was to set himself on fire on the steps of the Capitol. 
Mr. Paterson has so far managed to foster cordial relations with the Senate Republicans. He said he had gone directly to Mr. Bruno to offer the four votes needed for the Senate override, and had not bargained for anything in return.
"I could have said, 'Oh, I guess you're stuck, looks like you need four votes and to get them you're going to have to come to me,' " Mr. Paterson said. "He knows I could have played games with him. He knows that. I thought that I would get more out of him by demonstrating integrity."
Mr. Bruno said that he would not have been willing to negotiate, and that he respected Mr. Paterson more for not trying.
"I think he's a very responsible individual, and he wants to get things done rather than just be confrontational," Mr. Bruno said. "That takes a lot because some people would rather fight and embarrass someone in the opposing party."
Meanwhile, Mr. Nesbitt had the far more difficult job of marshaling his party's 46 other Assembly members to oppose the majority on the override. Mr. Nesbitt, who is a vocal supporter of Mr. Pataki, said he was particularly concerned about the higher spending and taxes in the Legislature's budget. 
"It's not reasonable for us to just restore money without doing reform," he said. "In the end, if we just keep raising taxes, it's going to severely damage the New York economy." 
Assemblyman Pat M. Casale, a Republican who openly defied Mr. Nesbitt on this issue, was summarily stripped of a $9,000-a-year committee stipend this month. In a widely circulated letter, Mr. Casale accused the minority leader of acting like a dictator. Mr. Nesbitt declined to discuss Mr. Casale, saying only that other factors had been behind his decision. The Assembly speaker, Mr. Silver, said that Mr. Nesbitt had made his point without needlessly tying up the legislation. "They made a couple of speeches," Mr. Silver said. "They could have debated every line, and they didn't. I think he's committed to ultimately governing, and seeing that the process moves forward."
But now that the budget battle is finally winding down, some critics are already questioning whether Mr. Nesbitt can maintain control over the Assembly's Republicans, given the defections last week of as many as 11 of them on the overrides. Other critics say that Mr. Paterson tries to be so agreeable that he may seem indecisive at times.
As proof that they can make a difference outside the budget crisis, both minority leaders point to changes that they have helped bring about. One of Mr. Paterson's first accomplishments, in December, was to push through a gay rights bill that had been blocked for decades by Senate Republicans. Mr. Nesbitt, with the governor's support, has been leading efforts to extend a package of financial and other benefits to state residents called to active military service.
"It's just another example that we're being effective," Mr. Nesbitt said. "I think that too often people aren't aware that it's the minority driving the discussion that gets the issue out in the first place."
Mr. Paterson said he learned at an early age that more can be achieved by working with people than can be accomplished by working without them. Because of his blindness, he said, he has come to rely on family and friends for help with the most personal of tasks, from reading his income-tax filings to buying presents for his wife. 
"My disability, which has been a hindrance in my life in some respects, was actually a benefit in this case," he said. "In my opinion, the best way to lead people is to walk behind them."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: RECONSTRUCTION POLICY; 
LOOTING DISRUPTS DETAILED U.S. PLAN TO RESTORE IRAQ

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
Long before President Bush ordered the attack against Iraq, the White House and the Pentagon drew up a plan for rebuilding and running the country after the war that was nearly as meticulous as the battle plan.
 But over the past two to three weeks, the wheels have threatened to come off their vehicle for establishing the peace. 
 The looting, lawlessness and violence that planners thought would mar only the first few weeks has proved more widespread and enduring than Mr. Bush and his aides expected and is threatening to undermine the American plan.
Five weeks after Baghdad fell, Mr. Bush finds himself exactly where he did not want to be: forced to impose control with a larger number of troops and to delay the start of efforts to turn power over to Iraqis. 
The message that reached the White House from two recent meetings with potential Iraqi leaders, officials say, was that it would be foolish to start experimenting with democracy without making people feel secure enough to go back to work or school, and without giving them back at least the basic services they received during Saddam Hussein's brutal rule.
Senior administration officials said they had foreseen some problems, but not all. "You couldn't know how it would end," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said in a telephone conversation on Friday that he initiated. "When it did end, you take it as you found it and get at it, knowing the single most important thing is security."
Another senior administration official said the White House was surprised to learn how badly broken Iraq's prewar infrastructure was. "From the outside it looked like Baghdad was a city that works," the official said. "It isn't."
Mr. Bush's aides cautioned reporters before the war that even the best plans would have to be rewritten on the ground.
Those plans called for quickly returning Baghdad police officers to duty to maintain a semblance of order, and having Iraqi soldiers build roads and clear rubble. They envisioned cheering crowds and a swift restoration of electricity and other utilities. The quick establishment of a civilian Iraqi interim authority, officials said, would help demonstrate to a suspicious Arab world that America would not act as an occupier, as in Japan and Germany.
"We will in fact be greeted as liberators," Vice President Dick Cheney said on March 16, three days before the war started.
But many of Baghdad's 10,000 police officers are just now trickling back. The Iraqi soldiers disappeared. No one in Washington anticipated the degree to which the chaos would undermine that central goal of presenting the United States as a liberator, senior officials said.
In fact, that instinct may have worsened the problem, senior officials said in interviews. Inside the White House, officials feared that if the looters were shot -- the fastest way to send the message that the United States was intent on restoring order -- the pictures on Al Jazeera would reinforce the worst images of America in the Arab world.
Within the administration, the backbiting has intensified. Some say Jay Garner, the retired Army lieutenant general initially charged with the physical and political rebuilding of Iraq, moved too slowly.
The sense that General Garner's team got off to a slow start was reinforced when he and a small team of aides finally arrived in Baghdad in late April to discover that they had no functioning e-mail, no way for outsiders to reach them by telephone, no cars and drivers to get them around the city and no interpreters. Aides say those problems have since eased.
Moreover, General Garner clashed with his top administrator for Baghdad, Barbara Bodine, a former ambassador to Yemen who has since left. "They were two very strong personalities, and they never came together as a team," said one senior official here.
But even critics of General Garner, who was replaced on May 7 by a career diplomat, L. Paul Bremer III, say he has been a victim of fierce infighting between the Pentagon and State Department over running postwar operations, and of a security environment he does not control. 
They also say that he was forced by events to take on a role broader than the one originally envisioned. "We always knew that we would need" a chief operating officer, said one senior official, "someone who would make the trains run on time."
But until Mr. Bremer's arrival, General Garner also had to play the role of chief executive officer, the public face of the American authority. It was a role to which he sometimes seemed less than perfectly suited.
At a moment that the White House was seeking to quash any thought that the United States was an occupying power, Mr. Garner chastised reporters for dwelling on the shortcomings of the Iraq postwar efforts, saying, "We ought to look in a mirror and get proud, and stick out our chests and suck in our bellies and say, 'Damn, we're Americans!' "
He acknowledged in videotaped testimony to Congress last Tuesday that his Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance was just now -- after three weeks on the ground -- getting its arms around a set of immensely complex issues, and making headway on problems like salary payments and gasoline distribution.
"This is an ad hoc operation, glued together over about four or five weeks' time," he told the House International Relations Committee, adding that his team "didn't really have enough time to plan."
General Garner was referring to a side effect of the war's unexpectedly quick end. That resulted in other unanticipated surprises. One administration official noted that because the Special Republican Guard soldiers inside Baghdad melted away without facing off against the allied forces, "you have a lot more guys with guns" in the city today.
In his testimony, General Garner implicitly sought lawmakers' help to ensure that 11 major goals -- from restoring order in Baghdad to distributing food efficiently nationwide to addressing outbreaks of cholera and dysentery -- were achieved by about June 15, his projected departure date from Iraq. 
"The next 30 to 40 days is probably the critical period," he said. "If we make headway on a lot of major things, we will put ourselves in a marvelous up-ramp where things can begin happening. If we don't do that, we're on a negative ramp."
Success will hinge on security, officials said, one reason about 20,000 troops and military police are headed to the Baghdad area to join the 49,000 already there. Troops will be allocated where needed, officials said.
The seeds of the troubled reconstruction effort date to late January, when Mr. Rumsfeld coaxed General Garner away from a top post at a defense contractor to lead perhaps the most ambitious postwar effort since World War II.
His mission was to oversee relief, reconstruction and civil administration, with a goal of turning over control in stages to Iraqis. He reported to Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander of allied forces in Iraq, who was responsible for security.
General Garner, 65, won acclaim for protecting Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, a much smaller job.
Within a month of his appointment, he assembled a team of about 200 specialists from across the government. On Feb. 21, nearly a month before the war started, he held a two-day rehearsal in Washington to review plans for everything from communications to creating a new Iraqi currency.
But problems were already cropping up. Critics complained that he failed to build support on Capitol Hill. He sent lower-level officials to meet with aid groups, who complained to the White House that their efforts to help were being stymied. "The humanitarian community made repeated efforts to meet with Garner to express our concerns," said Sandra Mitchell, vice president of the International Rescue Committee. "He was always unavailable."
General Garner and a cadre of top aides, includingLarry Di Rita, Mr. Rumsfeld's chief of staff, left Washington in mid-March. By early April, General Garner had been able to make only day visits into Iraq, and was chafing at being cooped up in a Kuwait hotel until the military's Central Command deemed it safe enough for him to begin operations in Iraq, officials said.
But even as he sat and waited, General Garner was caught in bureaucratic crossfire here and in allied capitals. British officials expressed concern that General Garner would look too much like a military proconsul overseeing an American protectorate in Iraq, stirring distrust in the Arab world.
In Washington, a bitter fight between the Pentagon and State Department over control of postwar operations escalated as reports of unrest in Baghdad caught American officials by surprise.
"Garner and the U.S. were unprepared to deal with the security vacuum," said Kenneth H. Bacon, a former Pentagon spokesman who is president of Refugees International.
A critical set of events happened the week of April 21, when General Garner arrived in Baghdad. The administration planned a four-day coming-out trip for General Garner through northern Iraq and Baghdad. There was no hint, however, that big changes were in the works 6,000 miles away in Washington.
The administration adopted a new policy to accelerate the transfer to an Iraqi civilian authority. The move, favored by the Pentagon and opposed by the State Department and C.I.A., was aimed at countering Iranian meddling in Iraqi politics.
But that recalibration required a new kind of chief executive for Iraq, and it took the White House longer than anticipated to settle on Mr. Bremer as the man for the job.
Mr. Rumsfeld said in the interview that the plan had always envisioned someone like Mr. Bremer to fill the role of overall civilian administrator for Iraq. He said that he and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, went through a list of about 50 candidates before ultimately selecting Mr. Bremer, a 23-year diplomat. Mr. Rumsfeld said he consulted with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence; and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, who all concurred on the choice.
Mr. Bremer met with Mr. Bush at the White House on April 25. It would take someone of his skills, they concluded, to deal with the postwar allied coalition, the complexities of civilian Iraqi politics and the uneasy dealings with the United Nations. Complex economic issues were also moving to the fore, including how to deal with Iraq's foreign debt and whether to replace the nation's currency, the dinar, which still bears the likeness of Mr. Hussein.
Last week, Mr. Rumsfeld praised General Garner for doing "a spectacular job for this country," and said in the interview that Mr. Bremer's appointment was a natural progression of the plan. "It seemed increasingly like there was going to be a set of issues that would demand the attention of -- and benefit from the attention of -- someone like Jerry Bremer," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "It was the evolution of where we'd come and where we were."

HEADLINE: Willing to Look Foolish For Fallen Firefighters

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN

 BODY:
Around City Hall, she is known as the Flag Lady.
 Everyone has seen her, with Old Glory hanging from her like a floor-length curtain and a towering red, white and blue Uncle Sam hat atop her head.
But few know the Flag Lady's name, Victoria Stong, or why she shows up five days a week, shortly after 3 p.m., and stands like a lone statue just past the steps of City Hall.
 Part of the answer is stretched across the big white double-sided poster board Ms. Stong, 39, hauls with her every day, hoping that some City Hall official, preferably Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, will stop for a closer look. 
 ''Mr. Mayor: Please don't close engine 261 or any engine because you can negotiate with people, but not with fire,'' the sign reads. ''Respectfully and sincerely, Victoria Stong.''
 Clearly, Ms. Stong, who hopes to draw attention to the Bloomberg administration's plan to close her local firehouse, Engine 261 in Queens, and seven others, is a different kind of protester. She is so polite and so quiet (she speaks only when spoken to) that she might, if not for the flag she bought for $19.95 at Home Depot, be lost amid the more vocal protesters who arrive at the steps, seemingly on the hour, ranting and raving. 
 ''Let everybody else do the screaming and yelling,'' Ms. Stong, who is unemployed and lives in the Queensbridge Houses, said on Thursday as she prepared to conclude the fourth week of her City Hall stand. ''I'm trying to find a respectful way to say, 'Hey, could you please rethink this plan before anyone gets hurt because a firehouse got closed.' ''
 Those who have stopped to talk with Ms. Stong say they admire her approach. ''I've seen her out there in the rain, in cold weather,'' said Eric Gioia, a Queens city councilman who represents her neighborhood but met Ms. Stong for the first time only recently when he stopped for a brief chat. ''She's a constant presence, and in her own quiet way, she's a modern day reminder of the silent protest of people like Gandhi.''
 In truth, Ms. Stong is out to send a much louder message than outrage over Mr. Bloomberg's plan for the firehouses. Ms. Stong, who volunteered at ground zero after Sept. 11, 2001, says she is protesting to honor New York City firefighters, especially the hundreds who died in the terrorist attack. 
 ''I only make a fool of myself for the Fire Department, for their bravery,'' she said as two tourists approached to read her sign. ''I know it's a broken record, but they really are our everyday heroes. How many people do you know who would walk into a fire? They're not a luxury that we can afford to get rid of because it cost too much.''
 By closing the eight firehouses, the Bloomberg administration, which does not plan to lay off firefighters, estimates that the city will save more than $10 million. It's a calculation Ms. Stong finds troubling. ''I saw the sacrifices they made for 9/11,'' she said. ''We shouldn't have to lose any of them after what they did. Is there no respect left for them?''
 Though the city appears to be pressing ahead with its plan for the firehouses, Ms. Stong insists she is not wasting her time. ''I'm keeping the issue alive,'' she said. ''I have so many politicians give me thumbs up.''
 So far, Mr. Bloomberg has not spoken with her, though she says he has waved to her once or twice. ''He knows I'm here.''
 And if the mayor were ever to stop over for a chat, she says he would find more of a fan than an enemy. ''I'd probably hug him for the smoking ban he created,'' she said, ''but I'd also tell him, in a nice way, keep the firehouses open so the city can put out all its fires.''

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Future as Prologue In Two New Dramas

BYLINE:  By BEN BRANTLEY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 16 

 BODY:
Two very different sets of people, found on separate stages here, are squinting hard at what lies ahead. While their social and economic circumstances are anything but identical, the landscape that consumes their attention is the same. As bright and mysterious as a mountain range in morning haze, it's the 20th century that sprawls before them. It promises to be treacherous territory.
 These current takes on past visions of the future come from two of this country's most exciting playwrights, August Wilson, whose "Gem of the Ocean" recently opened at the Goodman Theater, and Richard Greenberg, whose "Violet Hour" has been staged by the Steppenwolf Theater Company. 
 Mr. Wilson, who is celebrated for his operatic dramas of African-Americans struggling to survive, and Mr. Greenberg, best known for brittle comedies of neurosis among the privileged and pampered, would seem to have little in common. Yet to see in one day, as I did, "The Gem of the Ocean," set in Pittsburgh in 1904, and "The Violet Hour," which takes place in Manhattan in 1919, is to discover shared strengths that make the work of both writers so compelling. 
As the onetime slaves of "Gem" and the Ivy League literati of "Violet" try to imagine their destinies, it becomes clear how much each dramatist is possessed by an intoxicated love of words, a musical ear for language and a willingness to break through the boundaries of naturalism to explore the inexplicable.
They are both men of the theater in the noblest sense. The more high-reaching "Gem" is less fully realized than the seriously whimsical "Violet," the most satisfyingly sustained work to date from the author of "Take Me Out." But both plays offer rich evidence of their creators' distinctive gifts.
Considering the dawn of the previous century from the perspective of this one, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Greenberg turn out to share a fundamental sense that history, to borrow from James Joyce, is a nightmare from which no one wakes. Or as Eugene O'Neill puts it in "Long Day's Journey Into Night," which is enjoying a glorious revival on Broadway: "The past is the present, isn't it? It's the future, too."
It's a convergence that in these plays assumes fantastical forms. In "The Violet Hour," directed by Terry Kinney, a patrician young publisher is bedeviled by a printing press that spews out pages written in the future. In "Gem of the Ocean," staged by Marion McClinton, the spirit of African-American history is embodied by an earthy grandmotherly figure whose birth, some 280 years prior to the play's beginning, coincides with the first shipment of slaves to the English colonies. 
Her name and her improbable age have been enticingly mentioned in earlier works by Mr. Wilson. Now, Aunt Ester has finally stepped onto the stage.
It is appropriate that this character, portrayed by Greta Oglesby, should make her debut in the chapter that comes first chronologically in Mr. Wilson's projected 10-play cycle. (With the completion of "Gem," the 1990's is the only decade of the century to remain uncovered.) "Gem" is the Genesis of Mr. Wilson's chronicle, laying out the cycle's terms of spiritual and artistic creation.
The tone is accordingly oracular; the characters, despite their tasty use of Mr. Wilson's poeticized vernacular, are more historical prototypes than full-bodied individuals. The play centers on Ester's relationship with a young fellow burdened with the name of Citizen (Kenny Leon), who believes he has killed a man and is searching for redemption.
Ester, who dispenses healing wisdom from the majestic, shabby parlor of her house (the sea-tone set is by David Gallo), leads Citizen through a ceremony in which his mind travels on a slave ship to a place called the City of Bones. The kind of man he might become is neatly represented by two other characters. The fascistic police officer Caesar (Peter Jay Fernandez) has taken on the white man's role of oppressor. In contrast Ester's suitor, Solly Two Kings (Anthony Chisholm), is a subversive freedom fighter and one of the vagabond sages who regularly show up in Mr. Wilson's work.
Mr. Wilson's matter-of-fact acceptance of the mythic in everyday life has always been one of his strengths. And there are moments in "Gem" that beautifully balance the magical and the mundane, especially the scene that introduces the mighty Ester with sly offhandedness. Yet the big spiritual set pieces are anticlimactic. The journey to the City of Bones, for example, feels like a waning echo of a similar, more powerful scene in Mr. Wilson's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone."
Though the production is acted with in-the-moment authenticity (Paul Butler, Yvette Ganier and Raynor Scheine round out the solid ensemble), and its plot steeped in brutal historical detail, theme overwhelms credible character. The sermon ultimately drowns out the story.
On the surface "The Violet Hour" looks like a mere trinket compared with "Gem of the Ocean." But if the presentation is breezy, Mr. Greenberg has some solemn things on his mind. In examining a coterie of bright young men emerging from the shadow of World War I, he is thinking about how the future inevitably betrays the idealism of youth.
Oh, that, you may say with a shrug. But in forcing the present and the future into direct collision, Mr. Greenberg brings to the theme a clarity of vision that is equally horrified and amused. If the device of the clairvoyant press sounds like something out of those fantasy sitcoms of the 1960's, the play's lancing humor and haunted melancholy more than justify the contrivance.
Josh Hamilton plays John Pace Seavering, a well-mannered maverick from a rich family who is starting his own publishing house. For his maiden effort he must choose between a novel by his best friend from college, Denis McCleary (Kevin Stark), and the memoirs of Jessie Brewster (Ora Jones), a black singer who has become the darling of white cafe society.
John's relationships with both writers are more complicated than they seem, as are the authors' motives for wanting to publish. "I want to fix myself in people's minds," Jessie declares. But once that ungodly press starts spitting out its books from the future, it becomes clear to Jessie, John and his eccentric assistant, Gidger (Tim Hopper), that time allows nothing to stay fixed.
As usual Mr. Greenberg has steeped himself in the styles and voices of the period he is writing about, relishing period locutions that seem to age before your ears. And if John vaguely brings to mind Maxwell Perkins, the untidy, romantically cynical Denis definitely recalls F. Scott Fitzgerald, that prime example of shining youth just waiting to be tarnished. He even has a Zelda-like fiancee, a charming manic-depressive heiress (Kate Arrington).
To reveal much more would be to spoil the play's artfully delivered surprises. But it seems fair to say that the most surprising element of all is that Mr. Greenberg finds something to cheer about in life's fatalism, even as his characters' unhappy futures are spelled out.
As directed by Mr. Kinney, and acted with judiciously measured glee, the production achieves a fine blend of wit and wistfulness, of philosophical darkness and bright social satire. It's a complicated mixture that Mr. Greenberg has been trying to get right for years, in works like "Everett Beekin" and "The Dazzle." To realize he has now come up with the perfect recipe makes "The Violet Hour" especially gratifying.
Both "Gem" and "Violet" will eventually make their way to Manhattan, in one form or another. Mr. Greenberg's play has already been scheduled for the Manhattan Theater Club next season in a different production, though it's hard to imagine improving on this one. Mr. Wilson will no doubt make many revisions in the meantime, as he always does.
In whatever shape the plays arrive, they will both be welcome. There are, after all, only a few American playwrights who scour this country's history so probingly and imaginatively, and who find the abidingly resonant music in prophecies murmured long ago.

HEADLINE: Why Japanese Don't Flinch Over a Bank Bailout 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 19 

 BODY:
In many a country, if the fifth-largest bank were to beg the government for a bailout, depositors would rush to pull out their cash, stock prices would slump and anyone with any money would ask, "Which bank is next?"
 Not in Japan, evidently. News over the weekend that Resona Holdings, one of the country's five big bank groups, would ask for an infusion of up to 2 trillion yen ($17.3 billion) in tax money barely created a ripple. The reason is simple: The government is prepared to use its power to print money and rewrite regulations to guarantee that Resona's depositors and borrowers lose little if any money. 
 Resona's offices were operating normally today, and most customers shrugged off the news that the bank had one-third less capital than it had previously reported. "I am not planning to move my account from Resona," said Kunio Ishizaki, an office worker visiting the bank's Shimbashi branch. "Since the bank is nationalized, it gets a total guarantee from the government."
While comforting to Resona's clients, the government's strategy of maintaining the status quo comes at a cost greater than any bailout. By repeatedly supporting the weakest players in the economy, economists and analysts say, the government has created a moral hazard: Managers are free to go on making mistakes because they know the government will ultimately come to the rescue. Consumers, too, are spared the need to judge which institutions are strong or to avoid weak banks because their deposits are protected in any case. 
The political imperatives at work are not difficult to understand. Lawmakers see their primary task as looking out for their constituents' interests, whether by protecting their nest eggs or by making sure companies in their districts can get loans. Some policy makers also believe that it is cheaper to prop up a weak bank than to clean up a failed one.
But the effect, analysts say, is to inflict greater economic pain on the economy as a whole, though it is spread across the entire population and hurts few interest groups directly. The safety net protecting the weakest players leaves the strongest with little incentive to improve.
This moral hazard has slowly eroded Japan's international competitiveness, and pushed the nation's best companies to move overseas in search of growth. Most of Japan's leading car and electronics makers, for instance, earn the vast bulk of their profits in the United States, not at home. By keeping losers afloat, Japan has also made it harder for new ideas and new capital to make their way into the country and help revive the economy.
"When there is no risk, there is also no return," said Rieko McCarthy, a credit analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo. "If the government carelessly puts its political interests ahead of the market's, this country's attractiveness as an investment destination will decline."
Indeed, Japan has been slipping for years. In its 2003 survey of international competitiveness, the European business school IMD ranked Japan lower than Malaysia or Thailand.
Government bailouts do hurt some people directly. Shareholders in Resona will have their stakes in the company diluted because the government will get new shares in return for the cash infusion. Knowing this, investors bid Resona's stock down by 17 percent today. Other bank stocks also fell, though not as sharply.
But over all, Japanese stocks fell just 1 percent for the day, suggesting that few investors fear a wider meltdown or any significant losses in the short term.
The government's efforts at damage control are not limited to the banking industry. Lawmakers will soon vote on a bill that would allow life insurers to unilaterally reduce the guaranteed yields paid to policyholders.
Regulators hope that by allowing the insurers to break their contracts, bankruptcies will be averted. 
The Financial Services Agency, the chief financial regulator, estimates that trimming up to three percentage points off the guaranteed yield on existing insurance policies would reduce payouts to policyholders by up to 40 percent.
But allowing insurers to wriggle out of the guarantees comes with a risk.
"If an insurance company applies for this cut, it will provide a very powerful message to the market that they had made bad decisions in the past and that their situation is bad," said Hideki Takayama, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors in Tokyo. "So maybe they will apply for it only right before their death."
Despite the implications of the proposed law and the weakened state of the insurance industry, Japanese seem as calm as ever. Television programs have covered the issue in a matter-of-fact way, and few lobby groups have tried to organize letter-writing campaigns.
The only outward protest so far came today outside the parliamentary offices in Nagatacho. There, three members of the Life Insurance Ratings Association stood in the rain with leaflets and a bullhorn, questioning the need for such a bailout if, as the government claims, all the major insurers are still solvent. They also urged the public to look more closely at their insurers' financial condition and to question reassurances from the government.
"People believe the government will save the insurers with public funds even if they fail, just like Resona," said Koichi Nonaka, the head of the group, which claims 461 members nationwide. "Consumers are too dependent on the government."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
In Brazil, All May Not Be as Relaxed as It Seems

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
When Telefonica of Spain took over Sao Paulo's creaky, state-run telephone monopoly in 1998, it installed millions of phone lines in record time and for a fraction of the price customers once had to pay.
 Yet instead of kudos, all the Spanish executives seemed to hear from their Brazilian clients were complaints that the company could not even spell its own logo properly. In Spanish, it might be Telefonica, the Brazilians said, but in Portuguese it should be Telefonica. 
 A mere question of style? To some, maybe. But popular disapproval of what the news media viewed as orthographic arrogance soon ran so high that Telefonica made a public mea culpa and had the logo reworked to change the accent mark. 
"I don't think it was intentional, but it certainly wounded Brazilians' pride," said Newton Campos, a former marketing manager at Telefonica who now represents Instituto de Empresas, a Spanish business school. "There are still many, many people out there who believe we speak Spanish."
Although Brazil's 175 million people make up half South America's population and half the continent's economic output, foreign visitors frequently find -- and show -- they know precious little about the country beyond the stereotypes of sun, samba and soccer.
And as Telefonica's faux pas showed, perceived insensitivity can be costly.
Brazil's business culture is firmly anchored in the West. More than 400 of the Fortune 500 companies have operated here for years. Sao Paulo, the vibrant business capital, is just as much a melting pot as New York.
In addition, Brazilians, famed for their warmth and relaxed attitude, usually go out of their way to put outsiders at ease.
A visiting businessman, therefore, can easily be lulled into a false sense of security, believing that because everything seems to be just like it is at home, it is -- or that, because Brazilians are Latins, doing business here must be just like doing business in Florida, Southern California or Mexico.
That is far from the truth, according to Richard Hayes, who has been an American banker and financial consultant in Brazil since 1964.
"It's not like doing business in the Far East or Saudi Arabia, but there are cultural differences," he said. "Spotting them depends largely on how sophisticated the visitor is."
As a rule, he said, Brazilians do not like to be lumped in one basket with the rest of Latin America; neither do they share many of their Latin cousins' anti-gringo sentiments.
"Because this is a big country, it doesn't have an inferiority complex like many smaller Latin American countries," Mr. Hayes said.
However, assuming a Brazilian will want to negotiate a deal in Spanish if his potential partner speaks no Portuguese is a no-no, as is the classic mistake of believing Buenos Aires is the country's capital.
While most gaffes are not deal killers, they can be more damaging than you think. Kirstin Myers, chief executive of Globond, a global business networking community, says it is perhaps easier for foreigners to stumble than it would be in more formal societies like China or Japan because the locals seem so laid back and unlikely to bear a grudge.
She recalls that, when working in Brazil for Internet Securities Inc., a business-information provider, she got the idea that punctuality did not matter. She found out that it did after turning up 10 minutes late for meetings with executives a few times and being kept waiting for 40 minutes or told she would have to reschedule.
"I soon learned I was being punished for not showing respect," she said. "A lot of this casualness and informality can be misleading."
Foreign executives are often bowled over by Brazilians' spontaneous friendliness and informality, only to be frustrated later by just how long it can take to close a deal, thanks to cumbersome bureaucracy or simple delaying tactics. Enrolar, literally meaning "to roll up," or entangle someone to win time, is a common tactic, but it will always be done with a smile.
"In the U.S., negotiations are done with a good deal of tension on both sides of the table," said Erwin Russel, director of Advent International, a private equity firm in Sao Paulo. "In Brazil, you need to invest more time and you need to be tough without losing a sense of elegance or even tenderness."
Some Americans and northern Europeans feel overwhelmed by what he called "this steamroller of human warmth" that rumbles through even the most preliminary meetings.
"Within five minutes, you find yourself talking about stuff that would be considered, if not exactly intimate, at least quite personal in the Northern Hemisphere," Mr. Russel said. "Setting the scene for a deal here is all about affinity."
Visitors should try not to recoil if they are suddenly embraced or feel an arm creeping around their shoulder, said Carlos Heckmann, head of Enterprise Florida Inc., Florida's trade office in Brazil.
"Brazilians are very physical," he said. "We love to hug. It's a gesture of sympathy, nothing more. In the states, you would only ever hug a really good friend."
A common mistake made by businessmen coming from more developed countries is to underestimate the sophistication of Brazil's business elite.
Peter Stern, a New York-born management consultant who has lived in Brazil since 1980, said foreigners often forgot that before Brazil adopted the inflation-slaying real in 1994, decades of erratic economic policies, a series of stabilization plans and a succession of new currencies had made Brazilian executives some of the world's most flexible in making profits in the most adverse circumstances.
"The rules of the game would change every 6 to 12 months," he said, "making this place the best possible training ground for executives."
Brazil's business elite are probably "the most flexible, the most versatile, the most imaginative and the most nonrigid in the world," Mr. Stern said.
The Brazilians themselves call this apparently innate flexibility jogo de cintura, which literally means "the waist game," but which perhaps would be best interpreted as the talent to keep the economic Hula-Hoop turning.
In the past, that would frequently include resorting to the jeitinho, or "little way of doing things," a synonym for anything ranging from using personal contacts to outright bribery to get things done.
With a gradual but constant fall in corruption levels over the past decade, the jeitinho today involves more personal charm, and even some outsiders are finding it has its benefits.
Brazil is the only country in the world, for example, where shoppers at Wal-Mart can buy large-ticket items with a series of post-dated checks, a habit dating from Brazil's inflationary years, when consumer credit was virtually nonexistent.
"It's all about not having to say 'no,' " Mr. Russel said. "It's all about finding a solution that works."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Post Their Biggest Losses in Almost Two Months

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks had their biggest losses in almost two months yesterday amid concern that drug companies might be forced to give discounts to the uninsured and that a sales shortfall at Lowe's signaled a slump in consumer spending.
 "The consumer's been slowing," said Jack Ablin, who manages $40 billion as chief investment officer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "It's not positive for stocks." 
 Pfizer and Merck led the stock decline. Genentech, meanwhile, had its biggest rally ever as it said a trial found its cancer drug helped patients live longer. 
Home Depot, Lowe's larger home-improvement retailing rival, fell $1.12, to $28.07, in advance of its earnings report scheduled for today.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.53 points, or 2.5 percent, to 920.77. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 185.58 points, or 2.1 percent, to 8,493.39, with 28 of the 30 companies in the index dropping. The Nasdaq composite index shed 45.76 points, or 3 percent, to 1,492.77. Each benchmark recorded its biggest decline since March 24.
About seven stocks fell for every three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Some 1.38 billion shares traded on the Big Board.
Stocks also declined as the dollar sank to its lowest level against the euro in more than four years after Treasury Secretary John W. Snow indicated that he would not act to stem the currency's 22 percent slide over the last year.
The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in April, suggesting that the economy would be slow to strengthen after the war with Iraq, economists said. It was the first gain this year for the gauge of how the economy will perform over the next three to six months.
The drop in pharmaceutical stocks contributed almost a fifth of the decline in the S.& P. 500. The Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 to let Maine institute a plan that forces drug makers to finance discounts for the uninsured. About 20 other states enacted similar laws or are considering doing so, Maine officials said.
Pfizer lost $1.81, to $31.80; Merck fell $2.80, to $56.65; Johnson & Johnson shed $1.41, to $54.63; and Bristol-Myers Squibb declined $1.37, to $24.45.
Genentech climbed $16.95, or 45 percent, to $54.85. 
Lowe's fell $4, or 9 percent, to $40.30, its biggest drop since September 2001. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.1 percent last quarter, missing the retailer's estimate of a 2 percent to 4 percent increase. 
Toys "R" Us slid 78 cents, to $11.12. The company said first-quarter sales at United States stores open at least a year dropped 1.5 percent. It reported a loss of 3 cents a share.
Bond prices fell yesterday. The 10-year note dropped 16/32, to 101 7/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.48 percent from 3.41 percent on Friday. 
The 30-year bond fell 12/32, to 114 5/32. Its yield climbed to 4.48 percent from 4.41 percent.
The Bush administration said yesterday that Congress must raise the government's $6.4 trillion limit on borrowing or risk delaying an announcement Thursday of a Treasury note auction.
"An immediate, permanent increase in the debt limit is crucial to preserve the confidence in the U.S. government and to prevent uncertainty that would adversely effect our economic recovery," Mr. Snow said in a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert.
The Senate could begin debating a debt-limit extension as early as today, said Nick Smith, a spokesman for Bill Frist, the majority leader.
The announcement scheduled for Thursday is expected to give details of a May 28 auction of two-year notes.
The Treasury said yesterday that it would resume bill auctions this week after turning up an additional $20 billion in borrowing authority. Last week, the Treasury postponed its weekly offering of three- and six-month bills.
The Treasury said it would sell today $16 billion in three-month bills, $16 billion in six-month bills and $4 billion in six-day cash management bills. Tomorrow, the Treasury will auction $22 billion in four-week bills.

HEADLINE: Consumer Optimism Lifts Economic Indicators 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose in April for the first time this year, the group reported today.
 The Conference Board, a private research group, said its gauge of how the economy would perform over the next three to six months edged up 0.1 percent last month after declines of 0.2 percent in March and 0.5 percent in February. 
 The gain was led by the highest consumer expectations in four months and by rising stock prices, as it became clear that there would be a quick conclusion to the war in Iraq. Retail sales need to accelerate, however, before companies start hiring more people and increase spending for new equipment. 
"While the economy is still growing and not losing momentum, growth is very slow and will be that way for at least a few more months," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board in New York.
Economists had projected the small increase in the index.
Half of the 10 indicators the Conference Board uses to derive the index contributed to the rise and four had a negative effect. One, new orders for consumer goods, had no effect on the April change.
In addition to the rising consumer expectations and stock prices, increases in the money supply, building permits and a larger spread in the yield between the Treasury's 10-year note and the overnight bank lending rate accounted for the increase. The widening of the spread signaled investors became more optimistic last month that economic growth would accelerate, pushing up the yield on the 10-year note.
The improvement in these financial indicators "presage an improving economy," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Banc of America Securities in New York. "But the improvement may take more time than first expected."
Vendor performance (down 0.22 percent), the average workweek (down 0.14 percent), orders for business equipment (down 0.02 percent) and average initial weekly claims for unemployment (down 0.15 percent) weighed on the index.
"It is these miserable employment data -- from higher jobless claims to the contracting workweek -- that concern us most about the near-term outlook," said Joseph Abate, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: Ethics Lacking in Business School Curriculum, Students Say in Survey 

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
Ethical conduct in the workplace has become increasingly important to students at leading business schools, according to a new survey, but students are worried that their study programs might teach questionable values that may later contribute to mismanagement or corporate fraud.
 The study, commissioned by the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit organization in Aspen, Colo., that does widely noted research on business issues, polled 1,693 students last November at a dozen leading schools offering master's degrees in business administration. Participants included Columbia Business School, Yale School of Management, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and London Business School. 
 In what appears to be a shift in attitude, the study found that 73.9 percent of respondents considered meeting customers' needs to be the No. 1 priority of a company. In second place was maximizing shareholder value, cited by 70.6 percent of those polled. 
By contrast, a similar Aspen Institute study done in February through April 2001 found that M.B.A. students considered increasing shareholder value to be a company's primary task (cited by 75 percent of respondents), ahead of meeting customer needs (71.1 percent). That the 2001 poll did not survey the same students does not affect the validity of the comparison, said Nancy J. McGaw, the deputy director of the institute's Business and Society Program in New York.
"It appears to us from the data that students are now more interested in values-based decision-making," Ms. McGaw said yesterday in a telephone interview. 
She said the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the declining economy, the conflict-of-interest scandals on Wall Street and accounting and management fraud at companies like Enron, Tyco and WorldCom have all been factors in the increased interest in responsible behavior by executives toward investors, employees, the environment and the community.
The study, titled "Where Will They Lead? M.B.A. Student Attitudes About Business & Society 2003," was done for the institute via the Internet by Universum Communications, a consulting and communications company based in Stockholm that specializes in surveys of corporations and graduate students. The institute expected to release the results of the study by today.
Despite a perception among M.B.A. students that ethics and values are increasingly important in the workplace, only 22 percent of respondents said their schools were doing "a lot" to prepare them to handle workplace conflicts involving mismanagement or fraud. "There could have been even more emphasis at Wharton on ethics and social responsibility," said Jordan E. Silvergleid, 33, who graduated from Wharton on Sunday. Mr. Silvergleid will begin working at the Advisory Board, a health care consulting company based in Washington.
One in five respondents did not feel they were receiving any ethics training. About half said the messages and priorities taught in M.B.A. programs might have contributed to the recent scandals. The 2001 study did not provide any comparable data.
"The priorities taught in business schools affect the way students think," said Carolyn Y. Woo, dean of the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, which participated in the latest survey. Professors and M.B.A. students tend to use what she called "a cold language," with terms like transaction costs, profit maximization, rationalization and right-sizing, the current favored term for layoffs. "Professors need to use more human language," Ms. Woo said.
In another shift that could signal the readiness of tomorrow's corporate leaders to tackle, rather than ignore, corporate fraud, only 35 percent of respondents said they would look for another job if they encountered mismanagement by their employer, rather than confront the problem. By contrast, 53 percent polled in 2001 said that they would move on to another job.
About 100,000 students graduate from business schools in the United States each year, filling the ranks of corporate America.
But the current economic downturn has made M.B.A. students more pessimistic about their employment prospects. Only 24 percent of respondents thought their job opportunities were "very good," compared with 67 percent in 2001. Just over half the respondents in the recent poll were in the second year of two-year programs, mostly due to graduate this spring and enter the work force, while the others were in their first year of study. 
Respondents cited a lack of investor confidence, corporate scandals and the economic downturn as, in order of priority, the biggest challenges for executives.
Women, who made up 35 percent of those surveyed, were more likely to consider it "very important" that a well-run company operate "according to its values and a strong code of ethics" (82 percent) than were men (72 percent).

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: UNITED NATIONS; 
New Revisions Are Offered For Draft Of U.N. Plan

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 19 

 BODY:
The United States, Britain and Spain presented new modifications today to the draft resolution for lifting sanctions on Iraq, easing the reservations of some Security Council members and making it increasingly likely that the measure will pass without much difficulty, perhaps before the end of the week.
 German diplomats, in particular, welcomed the changes, which included increasing the stature of a proposed United Nations representative in Iraq and abandoning the open-ended grant of authority in favor of a requirement that the United States and Britain cede power when "an internationally recognized, representative government is established." 
 But the Russian envoy, Sergey Lavrov, responded with more caution, saying that there were some "welcome changes" in the broader international power to oversee the expenditure of Iraqi oil money by Britain and the United States, but that experts in various capitals would need to study the draft.
The revisions would also free the United Nations secretary general to honor many more of the billions of dollars worth of contracts for goods -- bulldozers and pipeline equipment -- held by companies from Russia, Syria, India and other countries. 
Over all, the changes seemed designed to quell persistent concerns in Moscow, Berlin and Paris about the original resolution's extraordinarily broad grant of authority over Iraq's money and the formation of its future government. The French ambassador, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, had no comment this afternoon on the new draft.
This second round of revisions was far more extensive than the first, although it was unclear if the United States and Britain had explicitly ceded any real control to the United Nations.
But it specifically refers to United Nations weapons inspectors, underlining "the intention of the Council to revisit the mandates" of both inspection teams, and limits the proposed grant of immunity shielding the sale of Iraqi oil from any legal actions or attachments. These changes, diplomats said, were directly responsive to concerns raised in the 10 days since the original resolution was introduced.
The United Nations special representative, in the original draft, carried the lesser title of special coordinator. Under the current wording, the representative would be able to collaborate in the process of the formation of new governmental and civic institutions. The rewording of this section still leaves the special representative's actual authority vague, but opens the door for the person to play a more integral and independent role in the nation-building process than originally envisioned.
As before, the oil revenues would be deposited in the Iraqi Central Bank, in the account of the Development Fund for Iraq. But now the international advisory board to be named in the resolution would have the ability not only to appoint auditors but also to monitor the workings of the fund on an ongoing basis.
The clearest concession came in an area that had been of particular concern to Russia: the plans for phasing out the oil-for-food program and sending to the development fund any unspent portion of the $10 billion currently approved and allocated for contracts.
The original draft allowed the secretary general authority only over contracts directly related to relief aid -- food, water purification devices and the like.
The current version allows the secretary general "in coordination with the authority and the Iraqi interim administration" to review all contracts including those for heavy industrial goods, many of which were made with Russian suppliers, and to pay out those containing "items required to meet the needs of the people or Iraq, both now and during reconstruction."
It also stretches the phase-out period for the program to six months from four.
Modifying the wording in this way allows far more leeway for payment to Russian suppliers, but falls short of guaranteeing all of them that their contracts will be honored.
John D. Negroponte, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that a vote on the resolution could come as early as Wednesday, and indicated that passage was highly likely. 
"I would say that we believe that this draft resolution deserves strong support from the Council as I whole, and I believe it will receive it," he said. 
The British envoy, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, also told reporters that passage seemed sure.

HEADLINE: G.E. Union Warns of Strike Over Health Care Increases 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
General Electric's largest union, which staged a two-day walkout over health benefits in January, threatened to go on strike again next month as it began negotiations yesterday for a new contract covering 14,000 workers.
 With General Electric pushing to increase employee contributions toward health coverage, union leaders said they might call a strike if G.E., one of the world's most profitable companies, pressed too hard on the issue. 
 "The significance of these negotiations is the health care issue," said Ed Fire, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers-Communications Workers of America. "People are watching whether one of the very richest corporations on earth will force its workers to pay higher health care costs." 
In an interview, Mr. Fire said many unions and companies were closely following how his union and G.E. resolved the issue of fast-rising health care costs, widely viewed as the principal issue in labor negotiations nationwide.
Officials with the company and with the union said the other main issues in the talks, which began yesterday at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan, were pensions and job security. Mr. Fire said the union wanted a substantial raise, higher pensions and several measures that would preserve union jobs while making it easier for the union to organize nonunion G.E. workers. The union's membership at the company has fallen from 88,500 in 1969, a result of automation, downsizing and moving operations abroad.
The contract for the union and a second one, the United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers of America, representing nearly 3,000 employees, expires on June 25.
Gary Sheffer, G.E.'s chief spokesman, acknowledging that this round of negotiations could be difficult, said the union should dampen its expectations.
"We're in the worst economy in about 10 years," Mr. Sheffer said in a telephone interview. "This is not a time for unreasonable expectations or demands or breakthroughs on either side."
What worries the unions most is the company's demand for concessions on health coverage. Differences over that issue caused a two-day strike at 48 locations in 23 states in January when the two unions protested G.E.'s decision to exercise its option in midcontract to raise co-payments for doctors, hospitals and drugs. The company said the increased costs came to $200 a year per employee, with employees averaging $22 an hour.
G.E. officials said the company's health costs increased to $1.4 billion last year, from $965 million in 1999, an increase of 45 percent. The cost of health care per worker will rise to $6,500 this year, from $4,140 in 1999, the company said.
"The company has absorbed more than 90 percent of that increase," Mr. Sheffer said. "We ask our employees to share a modest part of that."
Union leaders say it is unfair for the company to ask its workers to shoulder 30 percent of health care costs, up from 19 percent at present. Mr. Fire said that G.E., which had $15.1 billion in profits last year, could easily pay the increased costs itself because its profits last year exceeded $45,000 per worker.
"If General Electric continues to insist that I.U.E.-C.W.A. members accept the massive concessions in health care cost shifting G.E. has talked about, our members are prepared and will strike," Mr. Fire said at the bargaining session. "Forcing our active and retired members to absorb 30 percent of the cost of health care is pie in the sky. That won't happen. Not without Armageddon."
Mr. Fire said it was unfair for G.E. to demand higher health contributions when its top five officials earned a total of $62.5 million last year.
But Mr. Sheffer said: "I think all G.E. employees recognize that they're going to have to pay more for health care. It's what we and many other companies are facing."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; 
Court to Decide if Constitution May Sometimes Require Taxpayer Subsidies to Religion

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
Barely a year after ruling that the Constitution does not ban the use of taxpayer money for religious school tuition, the Supreme Court today agreed to take the next step and decide whether a public subsidy for religious instruction may under some circumstances be constitutionally required.
 This potentially explosive issue reached the court in an appeal by the State of Washington, which like many other states has a provision in its Constitution that prohibits the use of public money for religious instruction. The state turned down an application for a scholarship from an otherwise eligible student who sought a theology degree at a private Christian college. 
 The student sued and won a ruling from the federal appeals court in San Francisco that the state policy amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against religion.
As supporters of tuition vouchers were quick to point out, the case opens the next front in their long-running effort to establish what they describe as a neutral playing field on which explicitly religious activities can stake a constitutional claim to public support on the same basis as secular activities. State constitutions have stood as an obstacle to that goal. 
Thirty-seven state constitutions contain a proscription against public financial support for religion. These provisions are generally referred to as Blaine amendments, after the sponsor of a failed effort to attach such an amendment to the federal Constitution in 1875. 
They have come under increasing scrutiny in light of recent Supreme Court decisions that have invoked a general principle of equal access to expand the space for religion in public life.
There is no religion case on the court's docket for the current term, which will end in about six weeks. This new case, Locke v. Davey, No. 02-1315, will be argued next fall, and could mark the court's next term as an extremely important one for religion even without the prospect of the Pledge of Allegiance case that the Bush administration has recently appealed to the court. That is the case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit -- the same court that ruled in the Washington State case -- found a violation of the separation of church and state in the phrase "under God." The Supreme Court has not yet said whether it will hear the case.
Washington makes state scholarships available for use at accredited religious colleges, as long as the money is not used to pursue a degree in theology. The policy, embodied in a state law as well as the Washington Constitution, was challenged in 1999 by Joshua Davey, a student at Northwest College, in Kirkland, near Seattle, where he was seeking a degree in pastoral ministries. 
Mr. Davey, represented by the American Center for Law and Justice, a law firm affiliated with the Rev. Pat Robertson, lost in Federal District Court in Seattle, which held that while the state could not prevent Mr. Davey from pursuing religious studies, it was under no obligation to finance those studies.
Last July, the Ninth Circuit overturned that decision, ruling 2 to 1 that the state scholarship program had established a "fiscal forum," much as a government might establish a public forum for free speech. Just as religious speech may not be excluded from a public forum, the benefits of a fiscal forum "may not be denied on account of religion," the appeals court said.
In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Washington said the ruling placed the state in an "intolerable situation." Its own State Supreme Court has upheld the limitation, a part of the state's Constitution since Washington's admission to the Union in 1889, while the federal appeals court has in effect declared the provision unconstitutional. The issue was one of national significance, the state said.
The Institute for Justice, a leader in the movement to expand the use of vouchers for religious school tuition, also urged the justices to take the case, but to affirm rather than reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision. The institute, a public policy and litigating organization based here, has filed lawsuits around the country attacking Blaine amendments, which stand as significant obstacles to expansion of the Ohio voucher program that the Supreme Court upheld last June. Clark Neily, a lawyer with the group, said that the case the court accepted today would "resolve all these cases under one unified theme."
There were also these other developments at the court today.

Interrogation
The next term is also emerging as an important one for the law of police interrogation, with the justices today accepting a third case on that subject. In an appeal filed by the State of Missouri, the court agreed to clarify a 1985 decision on the prosecution's use of statements made by a suspect who was initially questioned without receiving the required Miranda warnings and who then waived his Miranda rights and continued to talk.
In the 1985 decision, Oregon v. Elstad, the court held that the initial violation did not taint statements given by suspects who agreed to talk after eventually receiving the advice that they could remain silent and consult a lawyer. 
But in that case, the police officers' initial failure to give the warnings had been inadvertent. In the new case, Missouri v. Seibert, No. 02-1371, the police had deliberately deferred giving the warnings to a woman they were questioning after a suspicious fire that had killed a man who was living in her mobile home. 
One of the officers later testified that he had received specific training in this technique, in which suspects who have been encouraged to make incriminating statements are likely to keep talking after they receive the warnings. The woman, Patrice Seibert, was convicted of second-degree murder.
The Missouri Supreme Court overturned the conviction in a 4-to-3 decision holding that an intentional Miranda violation tainted the subsequent statements by depriving suspects of the ability to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of their Miranda rights. Missouri told the justices in its appeal that there was considerable confusion about the scope of the 1985 decision.

Punitive Damages
The court vacated two substantial punitive damage awards against the Ford Motor Company. In one case, a California jury awarded $290 million to the family of three people killed when a Ford Bronco rolled over. In the other, the family of a Kentucky man whose Ford pickup truck went into reverse and crushed him won $18 million.
In both the first case, Ford v. Romo, No. 02-1097, and the second, Ford v. Smith, No. 02-1096, the justices ordered the state courts to reconsider the awards in light of a punitive damages case, State Farm v. Campbell, that the Supreme Court decided last month in favor of the defendant. The interest in the cases today lay in the fact that while the State Farm case involved a purely economic injury, the Ford cases were lawsuits alleging that a defective product had caused death. 
The State Farm decision last month set stringent limits on punitive damages but left open the prospect that more pro-plaintiff rules might apply to product liability cases involving severe injury and death. The action today was still not the final word, and the Ford cases might well return to the Supreme Court eventually.

Guantanamo Case
Without comment, the court let stand a ruling that a coalition of clergy members, lawyers and law professors lacked standing to sue on behalf of those held in detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Ninth Circuit had earlier rejected the case, Coalition of Clergy v. Bush, No. 02-1155.

Supreme Court Approves Maine's Prescription Plan
Maine's effort to cut prescription drug costs for uninsured state residents by pressuring manufacturers to grant price rebates received the Supreme Court's qualified approval.
 The 6-to-3 decision lifted an injunction that has kept the Maine Rx Program from taking effect since the State Legislature enacted it in 2000. The court's action is likely to shift the drug pricing debate back to the executive branch and to the states. Page A1. 

Maine's drug program calls for using the buying power of the state under Medicaid to negotiate bulk discounts from drug companies, which fear that the program could lead to a government-sponsored list of approved drugs and lower profits. A22.

HEADLINE: THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE: THE OVERVIEW; 
Calculatingly, U.S. Tolerates Dollar's Fall

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT with JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
By signaling that he was comfortable with the recent decline in the dollar's value, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow became the latest policy maker to try to talk up the sagging economy while stopping short of major policy action.
 Speaking to reporters after a meeting of finance ministers in France over the weekend, Mr. Snow called the dollar's 20 percent decline against the euro over the last year "fairly modest." Currency traders said they understood the remarks to mean that the Bush administration, reversing a policy adopted by the Clinton administration, did not plan to buy dollars on the open market to halt the decline. 
 After falling sharply on Sunday night against the euro, the dollar rebounded somewhat and ended today down 0.6 percent. The euro was trading at $1.1643 in late afternoon trading, close to a four-year high, up from $1.1578 on Friday.
Mr. Snow's comments were the latest example of jawboning about the sluggish economy by officials in the administration and at the Federal Reserve. Fed officials recently said they were concerned about deflation, helping cause a decline in the dollar and in long-term interest rates, which both tend to encourage economic activity. White House officials often speak about the economic benefits that come from merely the expectation of future tax cuts.
Although forecasters and policy makers expect growth to improve this year, many have become concerned that the economy is uncomfortably close to a spiral of weakness that would be extremely difficult to reverse. Job cuts have accelerated this spring, consumer spending has slowed and some measures of inflation have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, raising fears of a sustained fall in prices, known as deflation, in which weak economic demand causes profits and salaries to fall. 
"It is now more urgent for them to try to get growth," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics here, referring to policy makers. "I think there is real worry."
Larry Kantor, the global head of market strategy at Barclays Capital, added, "They want to do anything to stimulate the economy, including weakening the dollar."
A lower dollar can help the economy by reducing the cost of American goods exported to other countries. By raising the price of imports to the United States, it can also benefit American companies that are competing against foreign rivals in this country and give them room to raise prices and increase profits.
At its last meeting, the Fed did not cut its benchmark short-term interest rate, but officials signaled in a statement that they were worried about inflation falling further. Investors took the announcement as a sign that the Fed would not raise rates for months to come, and mortgage and other long-term interest rates fell, allowing the Fed to stimulate the economy without moving its benchmark rate even closer to zero.
Besides discussing the dollar in a newly detailed way, Mr. Snow and other Bush administration officials have also lauded the lift that they say stocks will receive from a cut in dividend taxes. As long as investors consider a reduction likely, they will bid up stock prices even before Congress passes a bill, making households and businesses wealthier, economists say.
The House approved legislation last week that would reduce the tax on dividends, which are regular payments that companies make to their shareholders, while the Senate passed a plan that would temporarily eliminate the tax. The two chambers are expected to negotiate a compromise in coming weeks.
Officials at the Fed and in the administration say they are working individually to devise the most effective set of policies, and analysts say they have no reason to believe there is a coordinated economic plan. The Fed is independent and does not answer to the president.
But analysts said they were also struck by the similarity in the current efforts of the two branches of government, particularly compared with the disagreement among policy makers in Europe. A lower dollar and lower interest rates both tend to increase inflation. 
"What's notable about the United States is that there's a lot more coherence between the Treasury and the Fed," said Desmond Lachman, a currency expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "They're not talking at cross-purposes."
Discussing the dollar has often been a minefield for government officials, and Mr. Snow's predecessor, Paul H. O'Neill, was criticized by investors and other officials for making comments that sometimes roiled currency markets. 
Mr. Snow has not shied away from offering more detail about the dollar than many of his predecessors, however. He has affirmed that the government has a strong-dollar policy, but he also noted last week that a decline in the dollar helps many manufacturers. Speaking in France on Saturday, he said that a strong dollar was one in which investors had confidence, but he excluded any mention of the dollar's value from his definition, even after being pressed by reporters.
Rob Nichols, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, said today that Mr. Snow's remarks represented "no change in policy."
But as traders tried to determine whether Mr. Snow simply erred for the second time in two weeks, many said they took a clear message from the comments. If they sell dollars, they said, they will not worry that the administration would soon drive up the value by buying them, as the Clinton administration did numerous times.
"Mr. Snow is giving the market a green light and saying the administration will not get in the way of dollar weakness in the near future," said Peter C. Gerhard, managing director in charge of currency and rate trading at Goldman, Sachs.
The dollar's fall gives immediate help to American companies, many of which reported surprisingly good profits in the first quarter, and even some foreign companies with large operations in this country. 
Robert Wilkins, president of Danfoss, the American arm of a Danish manufacturer of industrial products, said that when company executives meet next week, they would discuss increasing manufacturing in North America and in China, which manages its currency to keep its value steady against the dollar.
Traders speculated today that the Japanese central bank, worried that the dollar's fall would hurt companies in its country, was trying to prop up its value by buying dollars with yen. The dollar rose nearly 1.3 percent, to 117.40 yen today, from 115.91 on Friday.
A falling dollar does have risks for the United States, though. If foreign investors think it will continue to fall, they are likely to sell some of their American assets, causing those assets to lose value and creating a new problem for the economy, said John G. Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service.

HEADLINE: THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE: EUROPE; 
EuroComes Alive As Shock Absorber For Tumbling Dollar

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 19 

 BODY:
Two days after John W. Snow, the United States Treasury secretary, rewrote the script for currency traders around the world with a few well chosen words about the dollar, the euro showed today how thoroughly it has taken on its latest role: shock absorber for the world's leading currency.
 On its first day of trading since Mr. Snow's remarks, the euro traded as high as $1.1737, before settling back to $1.1643 in New York. It has been a remarkable rebound for a currency that began life in 1999 at a rate of $1.168, before slipping into a long, politically embarrassing decline. 
 Even more remarkable is how little this recovery had to do with the euro itself. The currency's resurgence is less a reflection of Europe's strength than of a perceived weakness in the United States.
The euro has also been favored by investors because of the economic troubles in Japan, and the resolve of Japanese and other Asian banks to defend their currency from strengthening too much against the dollar.
"We have plenty of our own bad economic news," said Michael Schubert, a currency analyst with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "But you have to compare it to the problems in the U.S. and Japan. The problem we have is that the euro has become the one-eyed man among the blind."
Today's jump was set off by Mr. Snow's comment that the recent decline in the dollar "really is a fairly modest realignment of currencies." Speaking after a meeting of finance ministers of the leading industrial countries in France, he listed several attributes of a strong dollar. The exchange rate was not one of them.
Analysts here spent the day parsing Mr. Snow's meaning, some noting that one of his aides scrambled to assure reporters afterward that the official Washington policy of a strong dollar had not changed.
But the verdict in the currency markets was immediate and unambiguous: the euro sprang upward, as investors from Sydney to Tokyo to London dumped dollars and bought euros by the billions. 
"I am optimistic that Mr. Snow was simply saying what he thought about the dollar," Mr. Schubert of Commerzbank said. 'But sometimes, silence is golden."
The danger, Mr. Schubert said, is that the market will overreact to Mr. Snow's remarks, driving the euro above $1.25. Some analysts warn that if the dollar enters a long-term downturn, as it did from 1985 to 1995, the euro could trade as high as $1.40 by next year.
Such projections have fanned fears in Germany, France and other countries that a strong euro will hobble exports, one of the few cylinders still sparking in their sputtering economies. Stock markets tumbled by more than 4 percent in Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam as investors reacted to Mr. Snow's comments.
Some people in the markets even spied a political motive, saying a weak dollar could be used by the White House as retribution against Germany and France for their opposition to the war in Iraq.
Most analysts here, however, dismissed that as a conspiracy theory. They said Europeans had to come to grips with the fact that American policy toward the dollar was driven by a single goal: to help the American economy. At times, that may clash with the interests of Europe.
"We have had no change in U.S. policy toward its exchange rate," said Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank. "The policy has always been 'the dollar is our currency and your problem.' "
At a time of burgeoning domestic demand and productivity gains in the United States, Mr. Walter said, a strong dollar made sense. Now, with domestic consumption weak and the risk of inflation minimal, a cheaper currency could fuel growth by making American exports cheaper.
"We should not think of what the U.S. wants to do, good or bad, to other countries," Mr. Walter said. "'We should think, 'what is in their interest?' and then figure out the right remedy."
The obvious remedy, he said, is for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates. The bank has resisted such a step for months, because it remains intent on curbing inflation. 
It has become clear, however, that rising prices are not a risk in Europe. The bigger danger, at least in Germany, is from falling prices, or deflation. The International Monetary Fund said in a report that Germany faced a considerable risk of deflation because of near-zero growth, soaring unemployment, and limited scope for fiscal or monetary policy.
The report noted that Germany's situation had been aggravated by the rise of the euro, and the European bank's strict policies, which are devised to suit all 12 countries in the monetary union. 
The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, denied his country was in danger of deflation. But other officials, including Finance Minister Hans Eichel, have been applying pressure for a cut in rates.
What frustrates people here, aside from the bad timing of a weak dollar, is that the euro has been more affected than other major currencies. The euro rose 27.6 percent against the dollar in the last year, while the Japanese yen rose 8.4 percent, and other Asian currencies even less.
Part of this is because the Japanese central bank has intervened in the market to prevent the yen from strengthening too much. Asian countries that export to the United States have piled up huge dollar reserves to prevent their currencies from rising too much against the dollar.
They, too, worry that strong currencies could hurt their exports. And they fear losing their competitive edge to China, which has a booming, low-cost industrial sector and a currency that is pegged to the dollar.
"For the Asians, it is great," said Marc Faber, a money manager in Hong Kong. "They can have huge increases in exports to Europe."
Europeans note, with some chagrin, that their economies are hardly world-beaters. But compared with Japan, which is in a decade-long downturn that shows no sign of ending, or the United States, with its corporate scandals and yawning current-account deficit, Europe looks safe and reliable.

HEADLINE: THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE: THE EFFECT; 
A Falling Dollar: Some Lose, Some Win, Some Break Even

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN and SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The dollar's plunge in value against the euro and other currencies has captured the attention of the financial markets this week. But its effect on the economy may boil down to a murky mix of pluses and minuses for consumers, businesses and investors.
 Consumers may face higher prices, but at a time when deflation is the more dominant fear. Importers' margins may narrow, but exporters could reap the benefits of newfound competitiveness. A disorganized unraveling of the dollar might squeeze capital markets, but a controlled decline could help the economy to perform better in the long term. 
 "It's a very unusual confluence of events," concluded John K. Nelson, a managing director in charge of global foreign exchange at ABN Amro Bank in Chicago. 
If the dollar fails to reverse its slide, consumers can expect to face higher prices for a variety of imported goods and services. In some cases, the importers themselves may also suffer.
Louis Vuitton North America, a subsidiary of the French luxury giant, imports its high-end purses and bags from France and other parts of Europe and then sells them in the United States. The company last raised prices on its goods in February and will probably do so again if the euro continues to appreciate, said Claus-Dietrich Lahrs, the president of Louis Vuitton North America.
"We certainly have to buy them at more expensive rates than before," Mr. Lahrs said of the leather bags and accessories his company sells. "From time to time, the movement is too strong, and we adjust the prices here in the United States."
On the other side of the dollar coin, some companies that do most of their business abroad have not been above a little polite exulting in the changing exchange rate. Heinz Krogner, chief executive for Europe at Esprit Holdings (which is based in Hong Kong), said his company would save money on clothing bought in Asia, where several currencies' values are linked to the dollar.
The competition, Mr. Krogner said, might fare worse. "For companies that buy in the euro area -- say American clothiers who buy their suits in Italy -- they got problems."
Some exporters are looking forward to becoming more competitive.
Diamond of California, a leading supplier of nuts, exports about 30 percent of its production to Europe. "Most of that is a big produce business that we do in the fall," said Michael J. Mendes, the company's chief executive. "If the exchange rate remains at its current status, it's going to make us much, much more competitive against our French and Italian competitors."
The Dole Food Company also exports from the United States, but much of its produce originates in Latin America and elsewhere abroad -- the same areas where many European businesses buy. As a result, said Richard J. Dahl, the company's chief financial officer, the positive effect of the change in exchange rates was not huge. "You don't always see it come through in the way you might expect," he said.
For some of the biggest American businesses, like the Coca-Cola Company, though, the dollar's fluctuations may have little effect.
"It's important to note that you can't look at any one currency in isolation and draw conclusions," said Ben Deutsch, a Coca-Cola spokesman.
"Given that we operate in more than 200 countries, we take a portfolio approach to currency management and we must look at the overall basket of currencies as we manage our business," Mr. Deutsch said.
In a conference call last month, the company's executives said that they expected currency fluctuations to have a "slightly positive" effect on its annual results.
The muted reaction was echoed at the clothing seller Perry Ellis International, where executives are taking the long view.
"If this is an extended phenomenon for a couple of years it may have an impact, but we haven't seen anything yet," said Timothy B. Page, the chief financial officer. "The market's a difficult market right now for everybody. This is just another factor that we all have to pay attention to."
For companies whose products are relatively inexpensive to make but expensive to advertise and promote, the relative strength of various currencies can cause gnat-like annoyances, but rarely have major strategic impacts.
That is certainly true for the Alberto-Culver Company, a $2.65 billion company based in Melrose Park, Ill. It makes and sells its own line of shampoos, lotions and other personal-care products under brands including St. Ives and Alberto VO5, but also handles professional distribution for Procter & Gamble, Wella, L'Oreal and other manufacturers.
"Our kind of business is not capital intensive, and the cost of our goods is low," said Howard B. Bernick, the chief executive. "Our major investments are not in bricks and mortar, but in marketing and promotion to grow our brands. And those are things you do in local currencies."
In addition to making imports more expensive, a falling dollar can also cause jumps in the prices of domestic goods and services. Companies that buy raw materials from abroad may have to raise the prices on their final products, and American businesses may gain pricing power as imports become less competitive.
In the 1980's, the prospect of higher prices worried the capital markets when the dollar experienced a rapid depreciation, said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief economist of Salomon Smith Barney. Investors then feared that the Federal Reserve Board would have to raise interest rates while the economy was performing well.
But this time, Mr. Schoenholtz said, the circumstances are extremely different. With the threat of deflation receiving increasing attention, the possibility of tighter credit seems a long way off.
"Here you have this sizable correction of the dollar, and capital markets have behaved as if nothing has happened," Mr. Schoenholtz said.
That stock markets have remained fairly steady during the dollar's long decline, notwithstanding yesterday's activity, may also hint that investors see the depreciation as, on balance, a useful development.
Making American exports more attractive could provide a reasonable amount of economic stimulus, said Mr. Nelson of ABN Amro. "The current administration is under enormous pressure to reflate the U.S. economy, and doing that through exports is not necessarily a bad strategy right now."
From a longer perspective, though, the falling dollar has still given investors reason for pause. If the dollar's value stays low relative to other currencies, in terms of what it can actually buy, returns on investments in the United States will look less attractive. An unwillingness of overseas investors to buy up in dollar-denominated assets could lead to financing problems for American companies and the federal government. 
"Certainly, for portfolio investors who might be putting their money in the United States from abroad, it might be of some concern if they saw a substantial period ahead of a declining dollar," said Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, a global association of financial firms.
Mr. Dallara did not see cause for alarm yet, but Mr. Nelson was somewhat less sanguine.
"The rate of decline and the political rhetoric we've been seeing will be unsettling to people who are examining alternatives amongst U.S. dollar assets," Mr. Nelson said. "The real issue isn't the exchange rate, it's the uncertainty around the decline."
With more uncertainty surrounding the dollar, Mr. Nelson predicted, foreign central banks would begin to consider diversifying their reserves away from dollar-denominated assets and toward euro- and yen-denominated assets. In that event, he said, "you're talking about billions and billions of dollars being sold."
Some economists already see foreign governments' bonds as more attractive than Treasury securities. Mr. Schoenholtz said he did not think Treasury yields would continue to undercut yields on the bonds of governments in the euro area. As a result, a bet on the prices of the German government's bonds, for example, might offer better value for institutional investors than a bet on Treasuries.
Mr. Dallara warned against taking the reversal in the dollar's fortunes as a more general verdict on the economy, though.
"There is a tendency that we all have to look at the dollar first vis-a-vis the headline exchange rates versus the euro and the yen," he said. "The fall is nowhere near as substantial as it might appear, because there are a number of major partners with which the U.S. trades -- Canada, Mexico, in Asia, around the world -- where the exchange rate moves are more moderated."

HEADLINE: Assaults on Teachers Are Increasing, Union Says 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Violent attacks on teachers in New York City's public schools have increased by more than 20 percent over the last year, the president of the teachers' union said yesterday. 
 The union president, Randi Weingarten, said that assaults of teachers by students climbed by 26 percent to 869 cases so far this school year, up from 690 cases in the same period last year, Ms. Weingarten said. Over all, violent acts against teachers rose nearly 23 percent, to 2,655 from 2,164, she said. 
 The union tallied the violence in an array of categories, including assaults, sexual assaults, robberies, reckless endangerment and others.
The union's numbers also showed that assaults on teachers by elementary school students increased nearly 53 percent, to 388 from 254.
As an example, Ms. Weingarten described an attack in December at Public School 18 in the Bronx. A 6-year-old first grader choked a classmate and then attacked two teachers and a school social worker with a chair, making a gash in the social worker's head.
"The bottom line is, we need to improve the tone in schools," Ms. Weingarten said. "We need to make it very clear that if a child or a teacher is assaulted, there will be a swift consequence to that action." 
The union study did not attempt to determine why violent acts were increasing, but Ms. Weingarten said that possible causes included a weak economy, tensions over world affairs and the failure of the schools to enforce the discipline code.
But the union's numbers also underscore the fact that there are many different ways to characterize and count the numbers of violent misbehavior in the schools. 
At a news conference last week after a graduation ceremony for 133 school safety agents, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that overall crime in schools had fallen by 6 percent and that major crimes in the schools had declined by 8 percent.
City officials said the mayor spoke specifically about cases in the schools that are designated as crimes, as defined in the penal code, and require a response by the police. Every student who pushes a teacher would not face an assault charge, they said. 
The city's Department of Education keeps records of violent acts that are not crimes, but officials would not release those statistics yesterday.
Ms. Weingarten acknowledged that many of the attacks reflected in her statistics would not result in the filing of criminal charges. The first grader at P.S. 18, for example, is too young to be charged with a criminal offense, she said. 
Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said that there was zero tolerance for violence in schools and that the increase in attacks on teachers was "unacceptable."
"I have made clear we will not tolerate any assaults on any teachers in our system," he said. "I have sent out the word that there has to be appropriate disciplinary actions taken."

HEADLINE: NYC; 
It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's a Horse?

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
GENUINE New York heroes have been in short supply lately, whether in government, politics, business, law enforcement, sports or -- need it be mentioned? -- journalism. So wouldn't you know that when a hero finally does come along, it's a horse.
 Well, why not? Humans, for the moment anyway, are not exactly providing great role models. 
 The animal in question is a 3-year-old gelding with the funny name of Funny Cide. Two and a half weeks ago, he became the first horse bred in New York to win the Kentucky Derby. On Saturday, in Baltimore, he won the Preakness Stakes by so many lengths that the rest of the field looked as if it were in a different time zone. 
Now Funny Cide is back at his home track, Belmont Park, on the border of Queens and Nassau Counties, getting ready for the Belmont Stakes on June 7. If he can win that grueling race, too, he will become the first horse from New York to win racing's coveted Triple Crown, and the first horse from anywhere to do so since Affirmed in 1978.
In racing, for those of you who think a furlong is a winter-coat size, the Triple Crown is the holy grail. It's the World Series, Super Bowl and Stanley Cup rolled into one. It's an O'Neill drama, it's Whistler's mama, it's Camembert. It's the top.
For many New Yorkers who follow the horses -- and whose horses may follow the horses, to steal from Joe E. Lewis -- the prospect of having a homeboy reach such heights is dizzying.
It may strike some as fatuous to invest so much emotional energy in a horse. But it has happened before.
A similar phenomenon occurred when the incomparable Secretariat captured the Triple Crown in 1973. As with Funny Cide's race with destiny, that feat had not been accomplished in 25 years. Secretariat simply blew away the competition, winning the Belmont Stakes by an unbelievable 31 lengths. If he'd gone any faster, they would have had to name a NASA rocket after him.
America in 1973 was a nation in trauma. The Watergate scandal had reached full bloom. The Vietnam War lurched toward an inglorious end. The economy stumbled. One national institution after another came under fire.
Then Secretariat showed up, a tonic on four legs. One woman told the sports commentator Heywood Hale Broun that after all the turmoil, this horse was what restored her faith in mankind.
New York could use a little restoring itself right now. These are not days of glory for the city.
The police, lionized with firefighters for their Sept. 11 valor and pain, have been tarnished by a disastrously flawed drug raid in Harlem a few days ago that appears to have scared an innocent woman, literally, to death.
The politicians in Albany spend more time fighting among themselves and posturing for the cameras than producing a budget that is genuinely balanced, not flimsily held together with more than $4 billion in borrowing that will leave their grandchildren to pay for the mess.
The civic nobility displayed after the attack on the World Trade Center has yielded to squabbling over government compensation for the victims' families, with everyone saying it isn't about money even as they demand more money.
SOME of the city's leading business executives are accused of criminal behavior or, at the least, sordid finagling.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is found by a judge to have misled New Yorkers about its finances, the result being an extraordinary court order to rescind new fare increases on subways and buses.
On New York sports teams, the two-legged athletes look far more ragged than heroic. Even the supposedly invincible Yankees seem suddenly, if perhaps temporarily, frail.
As for journalism, is there anyone in town unfamiliar with the crisis at this newspaper, brought on by the fabrications and plagiarism of a rogue reporter?
To the rescue, piercing the gloom, comes Funny Cide.
Winning the Belmont Stakes will not be easy. It is a long race, a mile and a half, and it has a history of making losers of sure winners. Indeed, Funny Cide is the fifth horse in the last seven years to approach the Belmont as a Triple Crown contender. None of the others made it all the way.
But many knowledgeable racing people believe Funny Cide has a good chance.
In the Preakness, by the way, he ran in a field that included an entry called New York Hero. That horse finished sixth.
The lesson, perhaps, is that it is not enough merely to be called hero. This is one label that you have to go out and earn.

HEADLINE: McGreevey's Miscues Feed Criticism of His Leadership 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 19 

 BODY:
As he travels incessantly around New Jersey, Gov. James E. McGreevey often talks like a man on a victory tour.
 He delights in telling audiences about his grand ambitions for New Jersey and the tough decisions he has made: revamping the Department of Motor Vehicles, reorganizing the state university system, enacting tough environmental regulations, fighting suburban sprawl, starting a literacy program. All of it, Mr. McGreevey invariably points out, accomplished while closing a mammoth budget deficit. 
 But back in the state capital, Mr. McGreevey frequently seems less a master of the machinery of state government than an earnest novice whose necktie keeps getting caught in the gears. Rarely does a week pass without his having to respond to headlines about a fresh political fiasco: taking junkets and personal helicopter trips at taxpayer expense, advocating pet projects and appointments for political patrons, or making a succession of high-profile nominations that turned into public relations disasters. 
Sixteen months into his term, even his supporters no longer write these off as a beginner's mistakes. Pollsters say the fits and starts have prevented the governor from clearly defining himself and raised questions about his judgment. That wobbly image, and the frustration caused by the state's fiscal problems, have led a surprising number of Mr. McGreevey's fellow Democrats to challenge him publicly, even though he led the party to power after a decade in exile.
Mr. McGreevey acknowledges that he has occasionally stumbled during his initiation to the job, but remains resolutely unfazed by the criticism and the recent polls that show his approval ratings in the 30's and low 40's. Incumbents generally get uneasy if those ratings dip below 50 percent.
The governor points out that many elected officials are suffering bad poll numbers because of the tough economic times, and insists his ratings will rebound with the economy.
"I've just got to keep getting my message out," he said during a recent interview in his office. "If you keep doing things that affect people's lives, with the D.M.V., with education, the environment, fighting sprawl, in the end, I think they realize that you made the hard decisions and did the right thing."
For now, the state's most powerful Democratic leaders say they fully expect that Mr. McGreevey will repair his image problem, but there is also a sense that they are eagerly awaiting the day when he will seem to have grown into the job.
"It's not likepeople hate McGreevey -- they want to see him more as a leader, defining himself more," said Richard J. Codey, the Democratic co-president of the State Senate. "We started to see that recently, and I think we'll see it more in the months to come."
While only ideologues and alarmists suggest that Mr. McGreevey's stature gap is approaching a crisis point, it has undeniably left him short of allies at a time when he must win approval of another austerity budget, negotiate a new contract with state workers and prepare for midterm elections that could weaken the Democrats' control of the Legislature.
Part of the problem is the timing: While Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York were incumbents who had built up good will before their poll numbers dipped as low as his, Mr. McGreevey has struggled while trying to establish himself.
Mr. McGreevey's blunders have also surprised many political analysts, because many of them involve the insider's game of New Jersey politics -- something he appeared to master while preparing himself for the job.
He was elected as a state senator in 1990, then as mayor of Woodbridge in 1991, and used his seat in the Legislature to establish himself in statewide politics. He ran against Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997, portraying her as too elite to understand how issues like high auto insurance rates were burdening New Jerseyans. When Mr. McGreevey narrowly lost, he kept right on running, winning the support of an unlikely assortment of groups: environmentalists and construction firms, labor unions and big business, civil rights leaders and members of the union that represents state troopers, who were accused of discriminating against blacks and Hispanics.
Because the state's Democratic Party is a kind of feudal system, he also courted the handful of Democratic bosses who control New Jersey fiefs, and who helped him fend off Senator Robert G. Torricelli's bid for the nomination for governor in 2000.
But by the time Mr. McGreevey defeated the Republican nominee, Bret D. Schundler, and was inaugurated in January 2002, the economy had soured, and the unwieldy coalition he had built during the boom became unmanageable during lean fiscal times.
Democratic lawmakers were frustrated that the governor said the state was too broke to finance their projects, and grew enraged when he used state money to pay for a hockey arena in Pennsauken, where George E. Norcross III, the Camden County Democratic power broker, owns a hockey team. Republicans howled when Mr. McGreevey signed a law that forced the state to use union contracting firms on construction projects, and increased the cost of building by tens of millions per year. 
The governor's handling of several key appointments has created dissension among Democrats, who say that he has repeatedly promised the same job to two candidates and infuriated different factions of the party in the process.
Although many of his high-level appointees have been solid, Mr. McGreevey has also floated a number of curious choices. He unsuccessfully pushed for a homeland security adviser who could not get a security clearance, and insisted on naming a poet laureate whose writings suggested that Jews had been forewarned about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The latest furor surrounded Zulima Farber, a candidate Mr. McGreevey had been considering for State Supreme Court justice. The governor withdrew his support after learning that she had a history of traffic violations and was the subject of a bench warrant for failing to appear in court on charges of unsafe driving. His about-face infuriated New Jersey's Hispanic political leaders.
Even the administration's most impressive achievement, winning approval of last year's budget without raising sales or income taxes, turned into a headache. Sharpe James, a state senator and the mayor of Newark, accused Mr. McGreevey of reneging on his financial support for a downtown sports arena and forced him to call a special session of the Legislature to pass the budget.
"Jim McGreevey has more personal relationships than any political figure I know, which provides a certain amount of support when you're going through a hard time, because these people think they're his friends," said Orin Kramer, a Democratic fund-raiser. "The flip side is that out of all those personal relationships come expectations that no governor can meet."
Republicans interpret the governor's weak poll numbers as a sign that voters resent having to pay for his mistakes and cozy relationships with political bosses and contributors. "Voters don't disapprove of the governor because of a bad economy," said State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., the Republican chairman. "Voters are angry because Governor McGreevey's questionable judgment, missteps and misplaced priorities continue to exacerbate our state's problems."
But Mr. McGreevey says that his decisions regarding state projects and appointments have been based on merit rather than favoritism. His administration has also sought to portray him as moving away from party bosses -- a move that will be severely tested next month, when Mr. McGreevey faces a difficult battle to approve his budget.
Even in casual conversation, however, it is clear that Mr. McGreevey aspires to be more than just a New Jersey machine politician. His mind races -- discussing military history, quoting Shakespeare, analyzing various theories on management. He can discuss, in soporific detail, the most mundane nuances of tax law or health-care policy.
He also keeps an ambitious schedule. In his first year in office, he made 1,500 public appearances; because he and his wife, Dina Matos McGreevey, have an infant daughter, he also held occasional meetings in Drumthwacket, the governor's mansion, where he took breaks to rock the baby. "My wife says I don't change enough diapers," he admitted.
He has curtailed his public schedule this year, but during an interview last month, the cuff of a thermal undershirt could be seen beneath his business shirt, even though the temperature was in the mid-50's. "I get in and out of the car so many times every day, it's easier than taking my coat on and off," he explained. "A trooper taught me that. It's good."
His hyperkinetic energy level has at times served him well. Early this year, when a shocking case of child torture in Newark focused national attention on New Jersey's troubled child welfare system, Mr. McGreevey was swift and decisive in ordering an overhaul. After raising corporate taxes to close last year's budget gap, he made special efforts to reach out to the business community and prevent an exodus of jobs, and several other states have instituted similar tax increases this year.
But Mr. McGreevey's zeal has also had its downside. Lawmakers complain that he spends more time on the road than tending to legislative leaders. He has at times overextended himself -- becoming involved in local elections like this year's Newark school board race, which left Mr. McGreevey humbled when the candidates he backed were defeated.
On other occasions his administration has made hasty, ill-considered decisions like floating a proposal that would direct school boards in low-income areas to raise property taxes -- a politically incendiary issue with New Jersey voters. The plan was quickly withdrawn, but only after Mr. McGreevey was lambasted by Republicans as a tax-and-spend liberal and appeared wishy-washy for reversing course.
Some of the governor's advisers are urging him to restrict his public appearances, arguing that his eagerness to please makes it perilous to expose himself to so many people seeking favors. "He needs to know that at the end of the day, it's more important for him to be respected than liked," said former State Senator John Lynch, the Middlesex County power broker who has long been his mentor.
Still, anyone eager to write Mr. McGreevey's political obituary would do well to speak to one of his predecessors, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. Mr. Kean, a Republican, was hobbled by a weak economy in his first term and when he imposed a broad tax increase, many political experts pronounced his career over. Once the economy rebounded, he found his footing, was re-elected and is now one of the state's most fondly regarded elected officials.
"A strong economy can cure an awful lot of problems," said Mr. Kean, whose son, State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., is frequently mentioned as a possible challenger to Mr. McGreevey in 2005.
Even if the economy continues to sputter, Mr. McGreevey can take comfort in the fact that New Jersey's Republican Party is dispirited, underfinanced and in disarray. Mr. Schundler, the conservative Republican whom McGreevey easily defeated in 2001, is believed to be gearing up for another race. Cliff Zukin, director of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll, said that New Jersey's demographics lean heavily in favor of Democrats, and that despite the governor's sputtering approval ratings, many of his problems have not resonated beyond the limited segment of the population that follows politics closely.
For now, Mr. McGreevey intends to pray for an economic recovery, try to learn from his miscues (he repaid taxpayers for the helicopter rides and the junket to Ireland) and press ahead on his most sweeping plans.
To sell his ideas, and himself, Mr. McGreevey will also continue doing what he did in Woodbridge -- trying to shake as many hands as possible. While that strategy may seem far more feasible in a population of 60,000 than a state with 9 million residents, Mr. McGreevey is convinced that, over time, it can achieve the same results.
"In Woodbridge, I didn't care what people said or wrote, because everyone knew me, so they didn't have to guess my motives," he said. "You just have to let people know that you're trying. You're working hard and you're trying."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 22, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the leadership of Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey misstated the timing of the appointment of Amiri Baraka as poet laureate of the state and the governor's role in it. Mr. Baraka was appointed before, not after, he read a poem at a festival that suggested that Israelis had been forewarned about the 9/11 attacks. While Mr. McGreevey signed a proclamation in August 2002 appointing Mr. Baraka to the $10,000-a-year post, for which a state arts commmittee had recommended him, the governor did not insist on the appointment. He later called for Mr. Baraka to resign.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Germany: Thyssenkrupp To Sell Assets 

BYLINE:  By Petra Kappl (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp plans to divest more noncore businesses, the company said after its supervisory board met. 
By focusing on its core divisions -- steel, capital goods and services -- ThyssenKrupp hopes to increase productivity 2 to 3 percent and sales to 40 billion euros ($46.35 billion) to 46 billion euros ($53.30 billion) in the midterm. In a step to avoid economic damage resulting from legislation in the United States, ThyssenKrupp repurchased 16.9 million shares for about 406 million euros from IFIC Holding, a state-owned Iranian company, thus decreasing IFIC's stake by 3.3 percent, to less than 5 percent. ThyssenKrupp said it would hold the shares for only a short period. Petra Kappl (NYT)

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Telecommunications:U.S. To Develop Rural Broadband Service 

BYLINE:  The New York Times 

 BODY:
 The Department of Agriculture said yesterday that it would spend $20 million on grants to develop broadband services in 40 rural communities in 17 states. About $8 million of the grants will go to more than a dozen Native American communities in Utah, Washington, Alaska, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho and Oregon, officials said. 
"Through these grants," the department said, "the communities will be able to participate and take advantage of the high-speed telecommunications tools needed to be a part of the global digital community." While some of the money will go toward putting computers into homes, the grants were intended for small communities that do not have high-speed computer and Internet access for their police and fire departments, hospitals, libraries and schools. "Expanding the reach of information technology brings to the homes and businesses of America's most remote rural communities new opportunities for accessing education, health and economic resources," said Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman.

HEADLINE: Toys 'R' Us Reports Wider Loss in Period 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 19 

 BODY:
Toys "R" Us Inc. reported a wider fiscal first-quarter loss today as a small increase in revenue was more than offset by higher sales and administrative costs.
 The toy retailer reported a net loss of $7 million, or 3 cents a share, for the quarter, which ended May 3. 
 A year earlier, Toys "R" Us, which has 1,605 stores worldwide, had a net loss of $4 million, or 2 cents a share.
Excluding a $9 million after-tax adjustment for an accounting change, the company would have had net income of $2 million, or 1 cent a share. That beat by a nickel the estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
Revenues rose 3.8 percent to $2.17 billion, from $2.09 billion a year earlier.
Stock in Toys "R" Us fell 78 cents, or nearly 7 percent, to $11.12 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
John Eyler, the chief executive, said that excluding the special adjustments, the first-quarter would have brought a return to profitability in the early part of the year; the company last had a profitable first nine months in 1999. The fourth quarter is often regarded separately since the holiday season traditionally provides most of the company's sales and profits. 
"Although the early part of the quarter was negatively impacted by the soft retail economy and the war, the tone of business improved as the quarter progressed," Mr. Eyler said. 
Sales at the biggest unit, the United States toy business, were down 2.7 percent, to $1.17 billion, with comparable-store sales down 1.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Senator Clinton Addresses Students at Pace 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y., May 19 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton told graduating seniors at Pace University's Westchester campus here today that America must continue to make sacrifices to ensure a better future. 
 A foundation of the nation, she said, was what philosophers call "future preference." 
 "It is what in large measure brings this class here today -- families who sacrifice so that their children can have better opportunities, people who do a good day's work in order to build something, to make their job mean something, people who start businesses in order to employ and create profit that can be recycled back into the society. People who understand that if we don't keep the future in mind, we impoverish the present and we dishonor our past." 
But, Mrs. Clinton said, "We are moving away from that understanding" of future preference, giving today's graduates substantial environmental, educational and economic concerns in a world where America must learn to balance military might with the ability to get along with others. 
After Mrs. Clinton spoke of the challenges facing the nation, an honors student, Nicholas M. Esposito, spoke of the personal challenge that he overcame.
When Mr. Esposito started college in 1997, his vision was so good that he did not need glasses. But in his third semester, Mr. Esposito, a City Island resident, was in a writing class, straining to see the print on his partner's paper when the professor asked where his glasses were. 
"I told him, 'I don't wear glasses,' " Mr. Esposito told his classmates in an address he delivered with the help of a tape and earphone, a guide dog by his side. "But if I didn't wear glasses," Mr. Esposito continued, "why couldn't I see the page?" 
Mr. Esposito said that his drive home that day was harrowing as he was forced to guess whether each traffic light was red or green. It would be the last time he drove, and he was also forced to leave college. 
Mr. Esposito learned that he had Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, a rare genetic disorder that causes blindness that settles in quickly. 
Mr. Esposito told the graduates that he missed both the visual world and the college he had left behind. "I thought of the students I had met and the classes I had taken," he said, "the professors who had taught me and the knowledge I had gained. All of this was gone, lost in the clouds that blocked my sight."
In those first months after learning the diagnosis, Mr. Esposito asked people to read to him, catching up on thebooks he had been studying when he left school. In 1999, using Braille, software that helped him in reading and typing, and independent travel skills he developed, Mr. Esposito returned to college. 
In addition to graduating from the honors program, Mr. Esposito, now 24, served as a student teacher of middle and high school students in Hartsdale. 
He plans to earn a master's degree at Lehman College in the Bronx, and he wants to be an English teacher who will use assistive technology -- similar to what he used as an undergraduate -- to read and grade his student's papers.
"Returning to school," Mr. Esposito said, his voice cracking, "was a rebirth for me."

HEADLINE: Legislature Overrides Veto of $1.79 Billion City Aid Package 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 19 

 BODY:
Acting with continued unity, the State Legislature handed Gov. George E. Pataki yet another resounding defeat today, voting overwhelmingly to override his veto of the Legislature's aid package for New York City.
 Without debate, lawmakers in the Assembly adopted the legislation, worth $1.79 billion, by a vote of 102 to 45, more than the two-thirds majority needed. Immediately afterward, the Senate passed the same package unanimously. 
 The aid for the city came about after negotiations among Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the state's two top legislative leaders and the City Council, which earlier this month officially asked the state to pass the bill. Legislation must now be enacted by the Council for parts of the bill to become law, said Chris Policano, a spokesman for the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller.
What the Legislature approved would let the city increase taxes on sales and income to help solve a $3.8 billion deficit and stave off the severe layoffs the mayor had threatened under a so-called doomsday budget. But the new city income-tax surcharge on those earning at least six figures contains a provision in its fine print that will cost many high-income taxpayers perhaps even more money than they first expected.
Under the city's current income tax structure, in which tax rates rise along with income levels, the higher rates are applied only to portions of earnings, those above a certain point. But under the new income tax structure, the higher tax rates would be applied to all earnings for some filers.
In a statement issued after the veto-override votes today, Mayor Bloomberg thanked Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, and Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker in the Assembly.
"The State Senate and Assembly have done a service for the people of New York City," Mayor Bloomberg said in the statement.
Mr. Miller said, "I am very disappointed that the governor vetoed this in the first place. And I'm glad that his attempt to divide the rest of the state from New York City didn't work."
The Legislature's override vote came after lawmakers in both parties last Thursday defiantly imposed their own state budget over Mr. Pataki's objections, handing the three-term Republican governor one of the most resounding defeats of his political career. Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver said it was now time to move on with other business of the state.
"I don't think this has to be seen as a defeat," said Mr. Bruno, when asked about future relations with the governor. "This is the legislative process working as it's supposed to, according to our Constitution and the laws of New York State, so I don't see any ramifications other than going forward."
But Mr. Pataki denounced the Legislature for raising taxes even further on New York City residents than it had on taxpayers in the rest of the state, saying it would drive jobs to neighboring states where the income taxes were lower. He said the lawmakers should have passed his aid package for the city, one that he proposed on May 13.
The governor's package did not include any tax increases, relying instead on gambling, selling city assets, leasing a water tunnel, raising a tax on absentee landlords and selling taxi medallions to radio-dispatched limousines.
"This is an unfortunate day for the residents of New York City and all the residents of New York State, because again the Legislature has made the wrong decision," the governor said. "What is doubly unfortunate is there was a better way."
The legislative budget restored billions of dollars in state spending on schools, hospitals, nursing homes and localities, including more than $1 billion for New York City.
The city aid package would allow the sales tax to rise three-eighths of a percentage point inside New York City. It also would allow for the refinancing of about $2.5 billion in debt from bonds that were used to help keep the city from going bankrupt in the 1970's, with the state picking up the debt-service payments.
Since the state fiscal year began on April 1, personal income-tax collections have declined, along with other prime tax revenues for New York, compared with the same period last year, according to Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller.
He said an analysis showed that personal income tax receipts had fallen by $99.7 million, or about 3 percent, compared with the same period last year, and that revenue from business and other taxes was also on the decline.
"Although one month in the new fiscal year has passed, this report shows that revenues continue to show weakness and that the economy has not fully recovered," Mr. Hevesi said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Mayor Spares 2 Threatened Firehouses After All 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
After the State Legislature passed a New York City aid package yesterday over the veto of Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg reversed course and said that the city would be able to save two of the eight city firehouses that were scheduled to close. 
 The mayor's turnaround came after he and his aides insisted for months that the closing of the firehouses was politically difficult, but necessary, and that the firehouses would have to be closed even if Albany came up with the help they sought. 
 It came after he had already fought off entreaties from the City Council, which wanted to keep the firehouses open, and an ad campaign by the unions representing firefighters. 
But last night, the mayor reversed course, issuing a written statement saying that he would spare two firehouses "because of the assistance we have gotten today from Albany, and in the interests of exercising the maximum caution allowable."
The firehouses he spared were Engine 293 in Woodhaven, Queens, and Squad 252 in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Six more firehouses -- four of them in Brooklyn, one in Queens and one in Manhattan -- could still close by the end of the week.
The City Council, which has been trying for months to persuade the mayor to keep the firehouses open, was ecstatic at the mayor's change of heart. "I think it's a step in the right direction," Council Speaker Gifford Miller said. "I'm pleased that he's being responsive to the concerns that the Council and others have raised. Now we're going to keep talking to him about those other six firehouses." 
The reprieve came on the eve of the first scheduled court hearing of a lawsuit brought by city and state officials seeking to save the firehouses. Some city officials suggested it could be a strategic move on the mayor's part to strengthen his court case. 
But Councilman Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn, who is one of the plaintiffs in the case, said that he thought it would ultimately weaken the city's case.
"I think it's basically an admission by the administration that closing firehouses can compromise public safety," Mr. de Blasio said.
Until last night, the administration had maintained that all eight firehouses could be closed without jeopardizing public safety. In his statement, the mayor said, "the response times in the areas served by Engine 293 would have risen above the citywide average, something we would like to avoid."
But the mayor's statement held open the possibility that the firehouses still might have to close if the economy does not improve or the unions do not agree to concessions that could save the city money.
Pressure grew yesterday to gain those concessions.
A new report by the Citizens Budget Commission said the average cost of a city worker will top $82,000 next year, counting salary and benefits. The report said that represents a 30 percent increase in cost since 2000, nearly three times the inflation rate.
The budget commission, a business-backed group, found that the increased cost of the work force was driven by steep increases in the cost of pension benefits and health insurance. In the year 2000, the report said, the city paid an average pension contribution of $2,263 per worker. In 2004, the report said, the average pension contribution per worker will rise to $11,005. The rising pension costs are caused in part by the stumbling stock market, which has caused the city's pension fund investments to lose money, and by a state law that was passed over the objection of the city increasing benefits to retirees.
The report urged the city to require its workers to share in the cost of their health insurance premiums, which could save the city hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and to create a new, less expensive pension system for future workers. The Bloomberg administration has sought both measures as part of its efforts to win $600 million in concessions from the city's unions, but has met with no success so far.
Union officials criticized the budget commission report, saying that it was flawed in several respects, and arguing that the city's health insurance payments were still low compared with other plans in the region. 
Even with the state aid package, and the reprieve of one-quarter of the threatened firehouses, New York City is still planning the most layoffs and some of the most severe budget cuts seen in more than a decade to close a $3.8 billion shortfall in the budget, which takes effect July 1.
From foster care programs to zoos, the proposed cuts would reduce spending in almost every city department. And in a move that has sparked widespread outrage in many neighborhoods, the city wants to reduce garbage pickups outside Manhattan.
The administration said that the decision to spare Manhattan was made on the merits, arguing that it is so densely populated and produces so much garbage that fewer pickups would be impractical and save little money. But, the plan has revived interborough rivalry.
"It stinks," said Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum. "I smell a rat," added Councilman Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn. Councilman David Yassky, also of Brooklyn, complained that the proposal would "create a mountain of trash for a molehill of savings." And Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens said that it was the single biggest issue in his district.

HEADLINE: THE MIDEAST TURMOIL: WHITE HOUSE; 
Bush Insists Mideast Peace Plan Will Move Forward, Despite Bombings

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
President Bush defended the administration's peace plan for the Middle East today as his aides scrambled to revive Israeli-Palestinian discussions in the face of five bomb attacks on Israelis in three days.
 "I've got confidence we can move the peace process forward," Mr. Bush's said at a meeting with President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines, adding that the administration's plan, known as the road map, "still stands." 
 "We're still on the road to peace," he said. "It's just going to be a bumpy road." 
Despite the president's hopeful words, some administration officials conceded that little could be done to sustain the delicate momentum of the peace effort if the suicide bombings of the last few days continue.
Administration officials said that as a first priority, they would keep pressing the Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, to take action against Hamas, the Aksa Martyrs Brigades and other groups that have taken responsibility for the bombing attacks against Israel.
But the officials also said there was room for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, whose visit to Washington this week was deferred because of the latest violence, to improve conditions for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, perhaps by easing some closures and checkpoints, without jeopardizing Israeli security.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell talked by telephone over the weekend with both Mr. Sharon and Mr. Abbas, the State Department said. 
On Saturday night, while the attacks were going on, Mr. Sharon and Mr. Abbas, who is also known as Abu Mazen, held the first high-level Israeli-Palestinian meeting since the current conflict began 31 months ago.
In Israel, Mr. Sharon was coming under pressure from conservatives in his cabinet to act against Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. But administration officials said it was still American policy to discourage Israel from expelling Mr. Arafat from the West Bank.
State Department officials conceded that a carefully orchestrated timetable for Israeli and Palestinian concessions, proceeding according to a schedule Mr. Powell negotiated when he visited Israel a week ago, was thrown into chaos by the bombing attacks.
Some in the administration say that the attacks were indeed intended to accomplish that objective, perhaps by Mr. Arafat, who has been sidelined as the United States maneuvers to replace him with Mr. Abbas.
Mr. Sharon was to have traveled to Washington by now for a meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House. Administration officials have hinted that Israel had been prepared to ease up on closures, checkpoints, work permits and other onerous restrictions that have badly damaged the Palestinian economy in the West Bank and Gaza.
In addition, Israel had talked of releasing large numbers of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, held since the beginning of the recent wave of suicide bomb attacks.
The administration had hoped that these steps would make it easier for Mr. Abbas, in turn, to start arresting members of militant groups -- a step that he and other Palestinians have said they could not carry out without an improvement in living conditions for ordinary Palestinians.
Meanwhile, the administration's strategy of following the step-by-step "road map" -- a seven-page document that lays out a timetable for creation of a Palestinian state in three years -- has begun to draw increasing fire in the United States and Israel.
Some Israelis are openly disdainful of the timetable, arguing that it requires too many unilateral concessions by Israel in return for amorphous Palestinian promises to end the violence.
Today, two dozen Christian conservatives led by Gary Bauer, a former Republican presidential candidate, urged the Bush administration to "go back to the drawing board" in the Middle East and abandon the current peace plan, saying that it "could lead to a disaster" for Israel and the United States.
On the other side, two former Middle East negotiators said in interviews that the administration's approach could be salvaged only by a more direct intervention in the negotiating process by Mr. Bush himself.
"We've been extremely sensitive about Israel's security needs," said Aaron David Miller, president of Seeds of Peace and a former Middle East specialist under Mr. Bush. "What we need is a full-time Middle East negotiator who is a political figure, who has some Middle East experience and is clearly empowered by the White House."
Martin Indyk, a negotiator under President Bill Clinton, said that because peace efforts were nearly derailed by a spasm of violence, an investment of time and energy by Mr. Bush was needed to restore momentum.
"If the president doesn't intervene now, the road map will be lost," Mr. Indyk said. "We went through these situations time and time and time again. If the president's efforts are focused on getting Abu Mazen to act, and getting Sharon to exercise continued restraint, he can create some momentum here."

In Chelsea, Mexican Is in the Details

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
MOST restaurants have their ups and downs. Chefs leave, the economy escalates and dives, inspiration wavers. I'm sad when a restaurant I like loses its vitality, but I'm excited if it rebounds.
 Case in point is Rocking Horse Cafe in Chelsea. In the mid-1990's, Rocking Horse was one of the most exciting Mexican restaurants in New York, offering contemporary dishes that remained true to the Mexican spirit. But Sue Torres, the chef, who was instrumental in Rocking Horse's ascension, left and the restaurant seemed to lose its way. Dishes that were once unmistakably Mexican became muddied, the source of their inspiration no longer clear. 
 Happily, in the last year, Rocking Horse has regained its footing. The chef, Jan Mendelson, has sharpened the flavors and restored the clear tie to Mexican regional cooking while slowly integrating his own dishes. 
The small, bright bar and dining room exude energy and liveliness without descending to the tequila-fueled rowdiness typical of many Mexican restaurants. Yes, Rocking Horse offers an excellent list of tequilas and makes a particularly good margarita (I recommend the Chinaco blanco, straight up, no salt), but it does not make a sport of drinking. It also has an appealing wine list.
Beginning with the basket of salty house-made chips and chipotle-cilantro salsa, starters are a high point. Little tamales imbued with subtly earthy huitlacoche ($6.95), a funky corn fungus, are a wonderful counterpoint to a spicy poblano chili sauce. Skewers of pork, a special, were served with a fruity salsa of grilled jalapenos and charred tomatoes ($8.95) that was so complex I wanted to deconstruct it right away. 
Little, rich lobster turnovers ($9.95) go beautifully with a sweet corn sauce, while duck confit with epazote, wrapped in blue corn tortillas ($8.95), is deep and earthy. I was not so fond of shrimp, marinated in chili-spiked citrus juices like a ceviche and served in a cocktail glass with mango and sweet corn ($9.95). The sum total of the diverse ingredients still added up to bland. But a salad of crisp cornmeal-swathed calamari, with frisee, tart orange sections and cubes of chorizo ($8.95) is a superb combination of flavors.
Mr. Mendelson's main courses are more mellow than striking. He builds layers of flavors that sneak up without overwhelming, offering quiet pleasures. Mixiote ($17.95), a slow-roasted pork stew, practically falls apart with the touch of a fork. Despite its chili rub, it is more soothing than spicy, served with a sweet plantain mash and collard greens. Birria de pollo ($15.95), another traditional stew, is made with flavorful chicken thighs, which stay moist through prolonged marinating and braising, stand up to the mild spice and go well with the tangentially related ball of creamy polenta. Chicken breasts served as a good vehicle for a coarse pipian sauce ($15.95), which, with pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and chipotle chilies, had a nutty, smoky flavor.
A special of salmon flavored with avocado leaves ($18.95) was unpleasantly metallic. Much better are shrimp with papaya and poblano chilies ($18.95) in a light chipotle sauce, served with spelt tortillas, an odd option with a pleasing nutlike flavor. Chicken enchiladas ($14.95), wrapped in the more traditional corn tortillas, are the most familiar dish on the menu, yet, with their balance of fruit and spice flavors, are far better than the usual messy, cheese-dripping version. 
Not all the desserts ($6.95) work, but I give Rocking Horse points for creativity. Bunuelos, airy little doughnuts, come alongside a coffee cup of chocolate pot au creme, just right for dunking, while flan has a pronounced coconut flavor that is delicious with thick caramel sauce and candied pistachios.
Like some other restaurants in Chelsea, the Rocking Horse doubles as an art gallery. Currently the walls are hung with the abstract works of Steven Miller, which look like nothing so much as a series of Rorschach blots. Given the ascendant state of the kitchen, they lend themselves to bright interpretations.

Where Coming Attractions Are the Show

BYLINE:  By William Grimes 

 BODY:
GENERALLY, it's not a good sign when a restaurant starts fiddling and fussing with its format, and few restaurants have done more fiddling and fussing in recent years than the Tonic, now reborn as Amuse. Every few months, it seemed, a press release would announce a new chef, a new concept and a new dawn. The place seemed to be caught in a rolling identity crisis. Was it a glorified saloon? A hip lounge? A music club? A fine-dining destination? All of the above, and so much more, according to its publicists.
 Improbably, the Tonic maintained high culinary standards through it all, earning two stars in its last incarnation. Inevitably, good reviews led to yet another makeover. Gerry Hayden, formerly the chef at Aureole, took over the restaurant, renamed it Amuse, installed some insipid abstract art in the vast dining room and rolled the dice with yet another change in format. No rational person would bet on a favorable outcome. But Amuse somehow beats the odds. 
 Amuse is short for amuse-bouche, the French term for the bite-size preappetizers intended to titillate the palate. They serve multiple functions. They help keep hunger at bay, but they also inspire the chef to create an eye-catching bit of whimsy that can serve as a preview of coming attractions. Mr. Hayden has elevated the status of the amuse-bouche and designed an entire menu around small tastes, doing away with the appetizer-entree dichotomy.
His menu offers a half dozen choices in four price categories, $5, $10, $15, and $20. With each increase in price, the preparations become more complex and the ingredients more expensive. The portion size increases, too, so the more expensive dishes look like abbreviated entrees. Five dollars buys a silver julep cup filled with herbed French fries. Twenty dollars earns an upgrade to peppered duck breast with endive marmalade and a sweet, syrupy reduction of black mission figs. 
Cheap can be good, like the golden puff-pastry gougeres, filled with melted Gruyere and tiny nuggets of smoked ham. This is finger food at its finest. Marinated calamari and good Ligurian olives, an unbeatable combination, get a fresh green note from a few sparingly arranged celery leaves. At the low end of the scale, Mr. Hayden deploys his effects economically. He knows that the last thing an appetizer can afford to do is bore. Hence the peanut sabayon with his veloute of roasted shiitake mushrooms, a thrilling flavor matchup. The Amuse fries, alas, are thuddingly average, with an eggless Bearnaise dip undermined by far too much tarragon.
Given the tight constraints of the lower price categories, Mr. Hayden puts on quite a show. At the $10 level, marinated fluke could get along quite nicely with nothing more than red grapefruit segments and crunchy grains of salt. Slivers of piquillo pepper and spicy ginger cracklings give this appetizer-size dish the complexity and interest of an entree. Plump cod cakes, crisp and golden, rest on a fresh celery-root slaw, creamy and not harshly vinegared, with a lavish truffled tartar sauce. The random international influences on the menu tend to be Asian and Mediterranean, but Mr. Hayden throws a nifty curve with a pulled-pork tortilla. The meat, slow-cooked to the melting point, throws off a heady, cumin-tinged incense, and black-eyed peas add a down-home touch. Asparagus risotto, topped with a shaving of Parmesan and sweet-pea leaves, makes an appealing springtime dish, but the risotto could be creamier. 
Mr. Hayden manages to conceal the class differences between his categories ingeniously. The $5 dishes do not feel like economy class, and the $20 dishes do not upstage their humbler colleagues. Lacquered squab, a $15 dish, seems more like a superappetizer than an entree, with one succulent, brick-red squab surrounded by curried couscous and a lush salad of sweet peppers and spiced almonds. Butter-poached lobster, at $20, seems in its own way rather modest, despite the deluxe main ingredient, perfectly complemented by a rich coconut curry broth, hot and sweet. As a small crisp indulgence, Mr. Hayden adds a tempura onion to the broth. He plays ingeniously with fruit and salt flavors in his sauteed salmon, served with poached baby leeks, which he surrounds with warm citrus fruit and caviar nage. 
Even the big-gun dish, a surf-and-turf combination of braised short ribs and caramelized scallops, maintains decorum. The scallops are large, but there are only two of them. Braised beef is a neat block of manageable size. As sleight of hand, the presentation is brilliant. The flavors are intense and all-American, with a juicy, puck-size disk of honey-glazed turnip, and a heap of truly fiery spiced mustard greens.
The desserts, all $5, come through with distinction. Rosemary sabayon brings a spicy, musky note that intensifies the flavor of grapefruit, expressed two ways, in a cold, clean granita and in grapefruit segments bathed in honey.
Instead of the regulation molten chocolate cake, Mr. Hayden presents an elegant napoleon of bitter-chocolate pastry leaves and bitter-chocolate filling. The Granny Smith apple beignet should be regarded primarily as a way of getting to the maple-walnut ice cream in the side. Even the creme brulee manages not to bore. It's a deep-dish brulee, nearly three inches tall, with a layer of orange and lavender cream on top. Like much on the menu, it is clever, pleasing and bargain-priced. Let's hope it survives the next makeover.

BYLINE:  By MELISSA CLARK 

DATELINE: QUESTA, N.M. 

 BODY:
AS the sun sets on the Sangre de Cristo Mountains here in north central New Mexico, the dun-colored topsoil turns as red as blood itself. Long black shadows creep down the slopes in varying shapes: low and gnarly from thorny sagebrush, tall and majestic from oak and pinyon trees, and squat, shaggy and handlebar-horned from roaming yaks.
 Yes, yaks. These woolly animals, originally from the Himalayas, have been turning up on ranches in the western United States and Canada. And although their numbers are still minuscule compared with those of bison and cattle (North America counts about 2,000 yaks, 350,000 bison and over 100 million head of cattle), ranchers are increasingly betting that, like such low-fat red meats as venison and bison, yak burgers, stews and sirloins will soon be on menus all over the continent. 
 That may be a long shot, but the quality of the meat makes it a possibility. Yak is as lean as venison or bison (about 5 percent fat, compared to about 15 percent for beef), and, to some, tastes juicier, sweeter and more delicate. Certainly the people of Tibet and Nepal think so. There, yaks have been an integral part of the culture for 5,000 years, used not only as pack animals and for milk but also as a source of meat. Originally brought to the Western Hemisphere for zoos a century ago, yaks have been bred commercially here for only about 15 years. North America now has more than 30 yak ranches.
Tom Worrell, who grazes 125 yaks on his 3,300-acre Latir Ranch here, estimates that he is the third-largest yak rancher in North America. Mr. Worrell, an entrepreneur who also owns Dharma Properties, which builds environmentally friendly resorts, is a solidly built man with blue eyes, a leathery tan and eyebrows as dark and bushy as a yak hide. He delights in the merits of his hairy, humpbacked beasts.
"They only eat about a third of what a cow eats and can forage for food without damaging the environment," he said. "They have small hooves and are nimble, so they can move over rough mountainous terrain. They don't need much attention. Unlike cows, you don't have to get up in the middle of the night and calve them. They are pretty disease-resistant, so they don't need any hormones or antibiotics. And unlike bison, they are docile and easy to maintain."
Since yaks thrive in forbidding, rocky landscapes at elevations up to 14,000 feet, they can easily forage in places that most cattle could never even reach. Ranchers generally leave them alone to search out grasses, weeds and wildflowers. In winter, the yaks are in their element, cavorting in the snow without the need for shelter and eating ice instead of drinking water.
"Yaks are what you'd call free-range animals," Mr. Worrell said. While they are never put on feedlots, some ranchers -- though not Mr. Worrell -- add grain to their diet a few weeks before slaughter to whiten their fat. Meat from exclusively grass-fed animals has a yellow tint from the carotene in the grasses.
"It's just for looks -- American consumers aren't used to yellowish fat," said Bob Hasse, president of the International Yak Association and the owner of Desert End Yaks in Montrose, Colo.
The grain fed to yaks has no hormones or antibiotics, because it's not necessary. Much of the meat, Mr. Hasse pointed out, would satisfy the Agriculture Department's definition of organic, though no rancher but Mr. Worrell has filed the paperwork required to label it organic. All yak meat sold today is inspected by the department.
Mr. Worrell's yaks are raised by the ranch manager, Chuck Kuchta. With his worn Levi's, 10-gallon hat and bowlegged gait, Mr. Kuchta is the very picture of the cowboy he once was. But don't call him a cowboy. And definitely not "yakboy."
"We like to say Chuck's a recovering cowboy," Mr. Worrell said. "You've got to be careful about what you call him. For a while we were saying yakeroo, but I think Chuck prefers yakalero."
Mr. Kuchta is among a small group who have made the switch from cattle to yak, some going by way of bison, or American buffalo. But why should yak succeed where other exotic meats like ostrich and emu have failed? And the bison market is suffering from a huge oversupply after a decade of speculation (despite Ted Turner's best intentions). At the height of the bison bubble, the animals were selling for as much as $3,000. Now the price is less than a tenth of that. Yaks, which are about two-thirds the size of bison, are selling for an average of $2,500.
"The bottom fell out of the bison market because ranching bison doesn't make sense economically," Mr. Hasse said. "You need more capital to start out with. You have to put in a lot of sturdy fencing, and bison are much harder and more expensive to handle and feed than yaks. People wanted to raise bison because they have good eye appeal. They look good on the plains, and there's a romance to having this native animal on your land. But they just aren't feasible."
That is because at their core, bison are wild, ornery creatures that don't take to fences or, for that matter, to people who try to lock them up. As a result, a ranch needs more hands to manage the same number of bison as yaks or cattle. "You can never turn your back on bison," Mr. Hasse warned. "They're too aggressive."
Mr. Kuchta, who also raised bison in his post-cattle days, agreed that yaks require much lower maintenance. Domesticated yaks, he said, are so tame they are often considered family pets in Tibet. "You even hear stories about them sleeping inside the huts of their owners," he said. "I wouldn't try this with a buffalo."
Yaks are efficient eaters, needing less food pound for pound than either bison or cattle. To gain one pound, yaks need only 6 pounds of forage, as against 8 pounds for cattle and 12 for bison.
But even if yaks are more environmentally friendly than cattle and easier to handle than bison, finding a market for their meat has been is a challenge.
"Most people don't know what a yak is -- that it's a Himalayan bovine related to a cow," said Jerry McRoberts, who has been raising yaks for 15 years at the McRoberts Game Farm in the Nebraska panhandle near Sidney. "But if you get them to try it, they love it."
There is indeed a lot to love about yak meat. Although it is low in fat, it is very succulent, with a deep crimson color and a mild, rather than gamy, flavor.
"It's sweeter than even farmed venison and more tender than buffalo," said Joseph Wrede, the chef and owner of Joseph's Table, a restaurant in Taos, N.M., that is in the process of moving elsewhere in town. He serves cubed yak meat in a savory stew with aromatic vegetables, and "yakballs" in a heady red-wine sauce, atop pappardelle pasta or simmered in a chili. "We sell a lot of it," he said. "The people who are brave enough to try it really get into yak."
About a dozen restaurants in the United States regularly offer yak. They include De la Tierra at the Sundy House in Delray Beach, Fla., where Johnny Vinczencz coats yak tenderloin in a mustard crust, and the Cosmopolitan in Telluride, Colo., where Chad Scothorn serves yak steaks as a special, using the same kinds of sauces he would with beef.
De La Tierra, which is owed by Dharma Properties, gets its yak from Mr. Worrell's ranch. Mr. Scothorn buys his from Mr. Hasse, who also sells the meat retail, as does Mr. McRoberts. In the western United States, yak meat occasionally shows up in supermarkets and health food stores, where, at about two and a half times the price of beef and one and a half times that of bison, it remains a tough sell.
"A lot of people are turned off by the word," Mr. McRoberts said. "They think yak? Yuck."
"We wanted to change the name to woolly Himalayan beef," he added, "but I don't think the U.S.D.A. will ever approve it. Someone suggested we send it to David Letterman and have them come up with 10 alternate names for a yak. Who knows, it just might help."

HERB- AND DIJON-CRUSTED YAK TENDERLOIN
Adapted from De la Tierra at the Sundy House in Delray Beach, Fla.
Time: About 45 minutes
1 yak tenderloin, trimmed (about 20 ounces)
 1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons chopped mixed fresh herbs (including thyme, basil and rosemary)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 3/4 cup dried bread crumbs
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard.
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Brush tenderloin with 1 tablespoon oil, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon herbs and season with salt and pepper.
2. Heat a large saute pan over high heat, and sear tenderloin on all sides until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large roasting pan, and roast to desired doneness (10 to 12 minutes for medium rare). Remove from oven, and let rest 3 minutes.
3. In a bowl, combine remaining herbs with bread crumbs, and season with a little salt and pepper. Spread mustard over top of tenderloin, and press seasoned bread crumbs onto mustard to form a crust.
4. Heat remaining oil in a saute pan over high heat. Place tenderloin crust side down in pan, and cook until crust is golden brown. Transfer to a board, and let rest until ready to carve.
Yield: 3 to 4 servings.

CHIPOTLE YAK CHILI
Time: 2 hours
 1/4 cup olive oil
1 large Spanish onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 pounds yak meat, ground
1 28-ounce can peeled plum tomatoes
2 chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, chopped
1 tablespoon kosher or coarse sea salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons dried crumbled oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 bay leaf
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
Saltines or corn chips (optional)
1. In a heavy 6-quart pot over high heat, warm olive oil and add onion. Cook over medium heat until onion is pale golden, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, and cook, stirring, 1 minute longer. Add meat, and sear it, stirring constantly, until it turns brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Add tomatoes, chilies, salt, oregano, cumin, bay leaf and black pepper. Simmer, partly covered, until tomatoes break down and chili thickens slightly, about 45 minutes. Stir chili occasionally.
3. Stir in cilantro, and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. Taste, and season with more salt and pepper if necessary. Serve with crackers or corn chips, if desired.
Yield: 6 servings.

YAK STEW WITH GREEN OLIVES AND LEMON

HEADLINE: Prime Beef Is in Short Supply 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
JUST when restaurants are doing everything to attract customers, Peter Luger Steak House in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is purposely turning them away.
 The owners are serving only people with advance reservations, not drop-ins; they are taking nobody after 9:45 p.m.; and, for the first time, the restaurant, which is open 364 days a year, may close on Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. 
 The problem is that the supply of prime beef has plummeted over the past month or so. Restaurants and butchers are scrambling to stock up, or are making do with lesser cuts, and, some say, are not always telling the truth about what they are serving. It is a nationwide problem, felt most keenly in New York, which gobbles a huge proportion of this country's prime beef. 
"We could easily turn more tables," said Marilyn Spiera, the president of Peter Luger. "But we are not getting enough of the kind of prime beef we serve. The real crunch in top-quality beef started a few weeks ago. We refuse to dilute our quality. The only solution is to ration what we have and cut business."
Dealers say a rough winter out West meant that fewer cattle went to pasture, reducing the supply. And with the economy bad and money tight, ranchers are sending the animals to the slaughterhouse sooner so that they can get their money faster and spend less on grain. Fewer animals that might yield a big, thick, juicy, well-marbled, sublimely tender porterhouse are going to market. 
"They're brought forward as much as 40 days now," said Bobby Hatoff, president of Allen Brothers, a Chicago wholesaler. "They're lighter." Usually, a steer is slaughtered at 18 months, after six months in the feedlot for corn-fed beef, the kind most steakhouses serve. 
The shortage comes as demand has been steadily rising. Richard Abeles, an owner of Milton Abeles, a Mineola, N.Y., wholesaler that handles only prime beef, says his business has grown 30 percent a year over the past five years as more steakhouses have opened and attracted more than hungry men with cigars, and as more people have been trying the Atkins diet. But his supplies are tight, too. "I've never seen it like this," he said. "It's the scarcest it's been in more than 30 years."
Even when conditions are good, only about 3 percent of the graded beef sold in the United States qualifies as prime. Today, most experts say, less than 1 percent is prime. Since within the grade there are different quality levels, depending on marbling and the size of the steer when it becomes steaks and roasts, only a fraction of the prime grade will satisfy places like Peter Luger. 
Though steakhouse owners and meat buyers complain that prime beef has been much harder to obtain and that the price has gone up, most are not sacrificing business. Unlike Peter Luger, which serves only dry-aged porterhouse and bone-in short loin cuts -- and buys 10 tons a week -- other places also offer filet mignon, rib-eye and T-bone steaks. 
Instead of reducing the number of servings, some may be compromising. Or cheating. It's easy to substitute choice for prime, especially with naturally tender cuts like filet mignon.
Chris Gachot, co-owner of Gachot & Gachot, a New York wholesaler whose customers include Peter Luger, said his company was allocating prime beef to its best accounts. "Some high-end restaurants have switched to dry-aged top choice from prime," he said.
Wholesale prices are up 15 to 25 percent in the past week, depending on the cut. The major steakhouses have not yet raised their prices, though some are considering it. They hope the situation will ease soon. 
Bryan Dierlam, director of legislative affairs for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group, said the situation was not extreme. He said there were usually fewer cattle available for slaughter in the spring before they have fattened up in the feedlots. "In the next few weeks, the numbers should be up," he said. "There should be recovery as we get into summer."
At Fairway Market, Ray Venezia, the meat buyer, said the producers had not anticipated a crunch. "The shortage of prime has affected choice, and you'll see more and more of the big chains advertising select now," he said, referring to the grade below choice. Fairway has raised prices for prime beef by about 20 cents a pound, and Mr. Venezia said that it was now letting the cost cut into profits.
Stephen Jones, owner of the Knickerbocker Bar and Grill, said the price he paid for choice had gone up about 25 percent, to more than $5 a pound wholesale, and would probably force him to consider increasing the menu price for a T-bone from $29.95 to around $32. "This is a bad time to raise prices," he added. 
Grain-fed beef from heavier animals, which is usually the best, is scarcest of all. Ken Aretsky, the owner of Patroon, said his friends in the industry were all complaining that quality had been off lately.
"The situation is complicated because there's no meat coming in from Argentina because of hoof-and-mouth, and none from Australia because they've had a drought," said Charles Gagliardo, the buyer for Citarella stores, "so all the pressure is on American beef." 
The discovery of mad cow disease in Canada is a further complication.
Like a number of buyers, Mr. Gagliardo said he had been well taken care of by suppliers because of longstanding relationships, but he's not sure how long the situation will last. "I don't know how the little guys are managing, unless they're cutting standards," he said.
Some of the larger steakhouse chains have been cushioned. The Morton's of Chicago chain, with 65 restaurants around the world, contracted for all its 2003 beef last December. "Our cutters gave us the heads-up," said John Bettin, the president. The Smith & Wollensky chain also pre-ordered its beef, as did the Palm restaurants.
Stanley Lobel, an owner of Lobel's, the fancy butcher on the Upper East Side, said his clientele would not cut their standards as grilling season began. "My customers will only accept prime, and they don't ask the price," he said. If he cannot obtain enough prime beef, Mr. Lobel said, he will sell wagyu, or Kobe-style beef from American cattle, for the same price as prime, $32.98 a pound, trimmed, for porterhouse steak.
Mrs. Spiera of Peter Luger said she was first told the situation might improve in a few weeks. That may be optimistic. It's anyone's guess how soon supplies will rebound.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
San Francisco Emporium to Get New Life as Mall

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Designed by the first San Francisco architect to be trained in Paris, the century-old Emporium store near Union Square once stood as a proud symbol of this city's sophistication, with its colonnade of 18 columns and its oval rotunda topped by a 102-foot-wide green glass-and-steel dome. 
But after years of decline, the Emporium, the first department store here, closed in 1996. The building itself was shuttered in 1999, leaving an unwelcoming dead zone in the midst of the Market Street retail district.
 This fall, however, two publicly traded real estate companies, Forest City Enterprises and Westfield America, hope to break ground on an unusual $380 million project to connect the Emporium building on five floors to its much younger neighbor, the San Francisco Shopping Center. The plans call for creating one of the largest indoor malls in the country, with 1.5 million square feet of space and the largest Bloomingdale's store outside New York. 
 The project is also expected to serve as a link between Union Square, a few blocks to the north -- whose park has recently been refurbished as part of an effort to spruce up the neighborhood -- and Yerba Buena, a developing cultural and residential neighborhood to the south that is now home to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
Completed in 1898, the Emporium was designed by Albert Pissis, San Francisco's pre-eminent architect at the time. Mr. Pissis modeled the building after the Parisian stores he saw while studying at the L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts, said Norman M. Garden, a partner at RTKL Associates and one of the architects on the current project. The store had to be rebuilt after it was destroyed in a fire that resulted from the 1906 earthquake, but the elegant facade remained intact and will be restored. The dome will be raised 54 feet so that it will form part of the city's skyline.
The building's interior does not meet current seismic or merchandising standards, however, and will be gutted to make way for the five-level Bloomingdale's that will face Mission Street. It will be the chain's first store here.
The store is being designed as a brightly illuminated glass box so that passers-by will be able to view the activity within, bringing new life to a blighted street that many residents now avoid, said the store's architect, A. Eugene Kohn, the chairman of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.
Opened in 1988, the eight-story (including a below-grade level) vertical mall next door to the Emporium is anchored by a five-level Nordstrom department store on its highest levels and currently has 68 shops. The expanded San Francisco Shopping Center will have room for 200 stores, said Richard E. Green, Westfield's vice chairman for operations. A nine-screen movie theater operated by a Western chain, Century Theaters, will sit on top of the Bloomingdale's store, and three floors of offices will be above the retail concourse. No parking is included in the project, but it is near a little-used municipal parking building with more than 2,600 spaces.
It has been more than five years since the owners of the Emporium, Federated Department Stores, selected Forest City to develop a Bloomingdale's in the old store. James A. Ratner, the chief executive of Forest City Commercial Group, said the company discussed a joint venture with the shopping center's previous owner, Rodamco, a Dutch company, in order to make the project economically feasible.
But the talks went nowhere until Westfield acquired the mall last year and quickly agreed to a joint venture. "The properties together make sense," Mr. Green said. The project was delayed because of a lawsuit that sought to block it on environmental and other grounds. The litigation was resolved in the developers' favor in December.
Under their agreement, the two companies will share ownership in the mall but it will be managed, leased and marketed by Westfield, the largest retail owner in California.
For Forest City, bringing a Bloomingdale's to Market Street is not quite the gamble it might have been had the San Francisco Shopping Center not gotten there first, Mr. Ratner said.
Building a mall on a street that borders the city's industrial area seemed like an outlandish idea when it was proposed in the 1980's, said Jim Chappell, the president of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, a nonprofit research organization. "Even the week it opened," he said, "people said it will never work on the south side of Market, that they would never get anyone to cross that line." Then, too, San Francisco had never had a vertical mall, a format that is not always popular with shoppers, who often tend to avoid the upper floors.
But from the outset, the San Francisco Shopping Center, which is housed in a neo-Classical-style building that seems to echo the Emporium, has done well. Sales last year (not counting the Nordstrom store) averaged $529 a square foot, according to Westfield, far above the national average for major malls of $330, as calculated by the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group. 
Brokers cite several reasons for the mall's success -- among them its location on top of the Bay Area Rapid Transit's Powell Street station, one of the busiest in the system, and the fact that Nordstrom occupies the top five levels rather than the lower floors, making it more likely that customers will explore the entire store.
But that configuration has made it harder to drum up business for the third floor, the one below the Nordstrom floors, said Mr. Garden, the architect who is in charge of restoring the Emporium facade and linking the two buildings. "If your destination was Nordstrom, you went quickly past it," Mr. Garden said, referring to the third floor.
In 1998, Mr. Garden and other members of Forest City's development team toured Asia, where vertical retailing is commonplace, in search of inspiration for improving circulation on the upper floors. "Vertical retail still scares everybody," Mr. Garden said. "We're all confident about the ground level, the BART level and the second floor. But what spells success for Levels 3 and 4?" Annual rents reflect the preference for the lower floors, with ground-floor space commanding about $150 to $175 a square foot and rent dropping to $75 to $125 on the second floor, local brokers said.
Rents in Union Square vary widely, from $60 a square foot per year on the side streets to as much as $450 a square foot for small spaces directly on Union Square, said Rhonda Diaz, a vice president of Terranomics Retail Services, a division of BT Commercial Real Estate, a company based in Northern California.
Once known as a shopping district for the carriage trade, Union Square still has its share of fancy stores, including a glassy Nieman-Marcus, where the City of Paris department store used to be. But these days, Union Square also has stores with more mass appeal like Armani Exchange and Benetton. The retail vacancy rate is about 13 percent, Ms. Diaz said.
Kazuko Y. Morgan, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, said Union Square draws heavily from visitors to San Francisco, who are evenly divided among business travelers, tourists and conventioneers. Only this last category has remained strong, she said, but "conventioneers don't spend as much money." 
Naturally, the developers hope that the downturn will be long over in 2006, when the expansion of the San Francisco Shopping Center is expected to be completed. The shopping center will remain open during the construction, they said.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Manhattan; 
Some Best-Priced Space Isn't Even on the Market

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The space was not officially on the market, but executives at Julien J. Studley, a tenants' broker, learned that whole floors in the Bertelsmann Building at Broadway and 45th Street might be available. In short order they negotiated a 15-year lease for 180,000 square feet for the law firm of Pillsbury Winthrop, which will move from 1 Battery Park Plaza downtown to six floors in Times Square after July 1.
 Space that could be available for rent but has not been officially offered to the market is known as "shadow space." There are always companies that have vacant space to lease if the right potential tenant asks. But in the current economy, with the number of jobs shrinking, this unofficial space is becoming a major factor in the market, brokers say. 
 In a recent report, Cresa Partners, another brokerage firm that specializes in representing tenants, reported that if shadow space were counted, vacancies in some submarkets in Manhattan would be 20 percent to 37 percent higher than the reported rates. Since most of the shadow space is available for sublease, it is having a depressing effect on rents for spaces being offered for direct lease by landlords.
The gap between asking rents for direct and sublet space is as much as 40 percentage points in some areas, according to the Cresa report.
This excess space and downward pressure on rents could be a drag on a recovery in the real estate market, even if the overall economy begins to rebound, the report said.
Brokers say many corporations are reluctant to put unused space on the market because they fear it will send a signal that their business is ailing. But they say that tougher accounting rules are forcing corporations to take write-downs for empty space, making them more receptive to sublease deals, even at rents below what they are paying their landlords.
Gregg Lorberbaum, a managing principal at the Staubach Company, a tenants' broker, said his company estimated that most financial services companies in New York had at least 10 percent of their space potentially available for rent to third parties. "The space is not on the market, but it is there," he said.
Brokers who are doing their jobs properly know where empty space is, even if it is not reported on CoStar, the computerized real estate data service, said Peter G. Riguardi, the New York area president of Jones Lang LaSalle, the brokerage and services company. "Most sophisticated transactions people know where all the space is, including the shadow space," he said.
But because this information is not published, it is hard to know just how big a factor it is. "Some people say it is 10 percent," Mr. Riguardi said. "Some say it is 5 percent. But what is clear is that it tends to balloon in times like these." 
The good side of the situation, he added, is that if a client is interested in a certain part of Manhattan, it is likely that brokers will be able to find office space to meet the prospective renter's needs.
"Companies do not want to give the wrong impression to their employees or to external observers by putting space on the market," said Robert B. Emden, vice chairman of USI Real Estate Advisors, a brokerage firm. "But if you call the right person in a company, you will often find they are willing to give up space."
The space in the Times Square building owned by Bertelsmann that was leased to Pillsbury Winthrop was not on the market when negotiations on behalf of the law firm began last November, said Mitchell S. Steir, the chairman of the Studley company. The deal was not announced until March.
Although the law firm had been close to signing a lease for space at Times Square Tower, which is on 42nd Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, "as a tenant's broker, we have a responsibility to monitor the market for better opportunities," Mr. Steir said. Because Bertelsmann, the German media company, owns the building at 1540 Broadway, the law firm has a direct lease, eliminating the complications that can come with subleases.
Shadow space makes the real estate market less efficient because other landlords have trouble getting information on the terms of leases for space that was never offered to the market, Mr. Steir said.
When companies decide to sublease space, they typically want to move it off their books quickly and do not always hold out for the highest rent, he added. Because the deals are private, they often have a psychological impact on the market greater than the amount of square feet involved would ordinarily have. "The myth of excess corporate space then becomes a reality," Mr. Steir said.

HEADLINE: Fear of SARS, Fear of Strangers 

BYLINE:  By Iris Chang; Iris Chang is author of "The Rape of Nanking" and, most recently, of "The Chinese in America: A Narrative History."

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Earlier this month, the University of California at Berkeley banned from its summer programs all students from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, out of fear that some might be infected by the SARS virus. The university's response to the epidemic illustrates how easily the fear of SARS can degenerate into a generalized antipathy toward Asians, even on college campuses.
 After facing sharp criticism for its decision, Berkeley modified its policy, announcing that it would permit some students from the banned countries to enroll, though not nearly as many as it had originally expected. It also said it would reserve special rooms on campus to isolate or quarantine people if any should fall ill, and that the Asian students would be closely monitored by campus health authorities. 
 There is no question that precautions should be taken to protect people from SARS: after all, scientists have not yet found a cure for the disease or a vaccination to prevent it. But without the mitigating influence of sound thinking, excessive fear of this new disease can lead to discrimination against Asians, something that is not without precedent in this country. 
In the late 19th century, anti-Chinese sentiment arose, fueled by a bad economy and workers threatened by an influx of cheap Chinese labor. Anti-Chinese propaganda tended to focus on issues of health and disease. In 1875, the American Medical Association sponsored a study to investigate assertions that Chinese women were spreading a unique, "Chinese" strain of syphilis. Though the study found no evidence to support the claim, one medical publication, The Medico-Literary Journal, nevertheless accused the Chinese of "infusing a poison in the Anglo-Saxon blood."
Elements of the American press helped fan the flames, portraying the Chinese as an unsanitary and dangerous race. An editorial in The Santa Cruz Sentinel in 1879, for example, described the Chinese as "half-human, half-devil, rat-eating, rag-wearing, law-ignoring, Christian-civilization-hating, opium-smoking, labor-degrading, entrail-sucking Celestials."
Another California newspaper, The Dutch Flat Forum, struck a similar chord at the time. "Women of California," it asked, "why do you persist in having your dirty linen fouled by unclean hands, under the pretense of having it cleansed? Do you not know that (in these exciting times when the Chinese are losing employment, and naturally mad at the white race) you are taking desperate chances of having disease introduced among us that will render desolate our firesides? And in fact we don't know but that the diseases among our children during the past year, which have baffled the skill of our most eminent physicians, and depopulated many households, have emanated from the Chinese."
Sensational news accounts of Chinese men luring innocent young white women into opium dens were complemented by advertising. For instance, ads for "Rough on Rats," a pest control product, featured a picture of a pigtailed Chinese man with his head tilted back, devouring a live rodent. The image was accompanied, not so subtly, by the anti-Chinese slogan of the era: "They must go."
Some Chinese-Americans found profit in perpetuating these stereotypes. Up through the 1930's, white and Chinese tour guides alike invented stories about a mysterious, labyrinthine world under Chinatown streets, filled with narcotics and brothels. In San Francisco, they ushered white tourists into fake leper colonies and fake opium dens and staged elaborate fights in which residents posing as opium-crazed gangsters dueled with knives in the streets.
Anti-Chinese sentiment was met with sympathy in Washington, where Democrats and Republicans adopted discriminatory platforms in order to win votes in California. Under pressure from the Workingmen's Party in California, Congress in 1882 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which specifically barred laborers and permitted only certain classes of Chinese, like scholars, diplomats and merchants, to enter. 
Consequently, Chinese immigrants endured much greater scrutiny than their European counterparts. To make sure no Chinese were using false identification papers to gain entrance under one of the permitted categories, immigration officers detained all new arrivals from China and interrogated them intensely about their identity, sometimes for months.
In 1910, the government set up a new immigration center at Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, formerly the site of a quarantine station that fumigated foreign ships and inspected passengers for signs of contagious diseases. Officials claimed that the physical isolation would stop the epidemics that they had been led to believe were "prevalent among aliens from Oriental countries." 
Although Angel Island was meant to contain disease, it produced the opposite effect by cramming healthy and sick Chinese immigrants together into close quarters. Hospitals in San Francisco refused to admit patients from Angel Island -- even though there were no medical facilities on the island to treat the critically ill. When one detainee came down with cerebral spinal meningitis, immigration officials moved him into a tent, where he was kept until he died.
Perhaps the most severe example of medical panic transforming itself into racial prejudice took place in 1899, when bubonic plague broke out in Hawaii. Though the disease hit whites as well as Chinese, the local board of health focused its efforts on the Chinese alone, placing them under quarantine, preventing them from sailing to the continental United States and burning down parts of Honolulu's Chinatown.
In 1900, officials in San Francisco followed Hawaii's example, closing Chinatown businesses, forcing Chinese residents to submit to inoculation and cordoning off the neighborhood with a nine-foot-tall fence -- a quarantine that a federal court later ruled unconstitutional. San Francisco authorities also tried to raze and burn down Chinese neighborhoods; it took the combined efforts of the ethnic San Francisco Chinese community, their lawyers and China's ambassador to the United States to save the community from complete destruction.
Suspicion of Chinese-Americans has waxed and waned over the 20th century, but it has never completely gone away. It is no wonder, then, that given this not-so-distant history Chinese-Americans are uneasy about the way in which people have responded to the threat of SARS. While we are right to expect the government to take all necessary steps to slow the spread of the disease, we are also right to demand more careful reasoning from American institutions. 
Though Berkeley's desire to protect its campus from SARS is understandable, its willingness tobar Asian students admitted to summer school was unfortunate. (According to the school's Web site, hundreds of other students from Asian countries -- those who had hoped to take English as a Second Language classes -- will not be able to come this summer.) 
The university's actions have had particular force for many Asians, in large measure because California has historically been home to the oldest and most virulent strains of anti-Chinese sentiment. As long as the university maintains criteria for exclusion based on nationality, not sound medical diagnosis, it will continue to face charges of anti-Asian prejudice. After all, SARS is a global disease. A blanket ban on Asians isn't protection against the virus -- it is simply discrimination under a different name.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles County Weighs Cost of Illegal Immigration 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 20 

 BODY:
In these wobbling economic times, it was only a question of when public officials would turn toward illegal immigrants and ask how much of a burden they pose to taxpayers.
 Nowhere is the question more sensitive than in Los Angeles County, where an estimated 1.1 million illegal immigrants reside. Even so, with the state's budget shortfall calculated at as much as $38 billion in the next 13 months and the county's at more than $400 million, it had to come. 
 Today, a Los Angeles County supervisor, Michael D. Antonovich, a Republican, introduced a symbolic proposal that would require illegal immigrants to obtain work permits and their employers to post bonds to pay for their health care costs. 
The proposal, which would require the county to work with federal authorities to draft such legislation, was defeated without comment in a 3-to-2 vote along party lines.
His proposal was not an attack on immigrants, Mr. Antonovich said, but an effort to address two serious problems for the county: unfettered immigration and financing the $350 million the county pays to provide health care to indigent workers, who are mostly Mexican.
"We're running an H.M.O. for illegal immigrants," Mr. Antonovich said, "and if we keep it up, we're going to bankrupt the county." 
"This is not a backlash against immigrants," he added. "This is also a way to give those people some legitimacy, to take them out of the dark, give them legal protections and tax them for the services they use."
Immigration lawyers said Mr. Antonovich's proposal was flawed, because only Congress has the ability to make immigration law. They cited Proposition 187, the statewide referendum that voters approved in 1994 barring illegal immigrants and their children from receiving public money. A federal court ruled the proposition unconstitutional because it conflicted with Congressional authority in immigration law.
These lawyers also said Mr. Antonovich's proposal would do nothing to address the situation of millions of immigrants without valid working papers who have settled and made new lives in the United States.
"The problem with proposals like Antonovich's are that they are effectively guest worker programs," said Thomas A. Saenz, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "You're here for a short period of time and you're required to leave. At a certain point, people have earned the right to stay here with their families."
The county's health system is the largest safety net for the uninsured in the nation, and more than 2.5 million people receive treatment from it every year. It is estimated by county health officials that about 800,000 of those are illegal immigrants.
State law requires that counties provide medical care for uninsured people, but the financial obligation has proved so burdensome that the county shut 16 clinics last year. 
Earlier this month, a federal judge barred the county from closing a rehabilitation hospital and from cutting 100 beds at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, which would have saved an estimated $75 million in the first year alone. The judge ruled that such cutbacks would create dangerous delays in medical treatment and contribute to the spread of communicable diseases.
Things have gotten so dire, county officials are threatening to stop accepting the transfer of uninsured or indigent patients from private hospitals, a practice that lets the private hospitals avoid paying for the patients' care.
Illegal immigrants cost in other areas, officials and economists say, including education and law enforcement. The state requires that every child age 6 to 18 attend school, regardless of residency status. The number of undocumented children in the public school system is impossible to determine, though, since it is illegal for officials to collect information on immigration status.
And the Los Angeles County sheriff, Lee Baca, has had to close facilities and release nonviolent offenders from jail early to close a two-year, $170 million budget gap. A large part of that deficit, the sheriff said, comes from housing illegal immigrants who make up a quarter of the county's inmate population.
"The feds keep dreaming about controlling the borders," Sheriff Baca said. "But is it a reality or a myth? It doesn't look like a reality and the local taxpayer suffers."
Whether immigrants cost citizens money remains a point of debate. A 1997 study by the National Academy of Sciences -- regarded by economists as the most comprehensive, if flawed, review of the subject -- concluded that immigrants, over their lifetimes, provide an economic benefit to the country in terms of taxes versus expenditures.
But it also found that the fiscal impact of an immigrant with less than a high school education drains the economy of $13,000 over his lifetime, and most illegal immigrants tend to fall into this category. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the cost of health care for illegal immigrants in Los Angeles misstated the number of people who receive treatment each year from the county's health system and the number who are illegal immigrants. The county treats about 800,000 people each year, not 2.5 million. It estimates that 200,000, not 800,000, are illegal immigrants.

HEADLINE: Lifeguard Recruits Are Tested; 'Baywatch' It Isn't 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
They travel in packs, following an endless summer sun. Primarily of South American extraction, they are professionals versed in nautical operations, emergency trauma medicine, endurance and hand-to-hand combat. They are already prepared for life-or-death situations, a responsibility that comes with the job.
 That was the profile that city officials pieced together last year when they first started looking far afield for recruits to patrol the city's beaches and swimming pools. Instead, the 37 foreign guards came from Eastern Europe, mostly Poland, Russia and Ukraine. 
 "It's the vestiges of communist sporting culture," Adrian Benepe, the city parks commissioner, said yesterday in a telephone interview. Mr. Benepe said he had a lead on a group of 15 or so lifeguards from the Netherlands. Still, he said, "we'd rather be giving these jobs to New York City kids."
That has not been easy in recent years. The city started advertising overseas last year, and in immigrant neighborhoods in Queens the year before that, but it has consistently fallen short of finding the 1,100 lifeguards it needs to patrol its 53 outdoor pools and 14 miles of beach.
So far this year, 115 new recruits, an uncounted mix of New Yorkers and others, have passed a test to qualify for the training course required to become a lifeguard, an improvement on the 100 new recruits mustered by this time last year.
"Each year," Mr. Benepe said, "we're doing slightly better locally."
The job pays $10.08 an hour in the first year. "A $10 job might seem better in this economy," Mr. Benepe said. "It beats not having a job."
That logic drew in Juliana Mercurio, 19, of Staten Island, who took the initial battery of tests at the West 59th Street Recreation Center yesterday afternoon. Though she has experience keeping an eye on swimmers upstate at Harriman State Park, she expected the city job to be more taxing. "I have to go through actual training," Ms. Mercurio said.
She took a vision test, demonstrated that she had been on earth for more than 16 years and swam three laps in 34 seconds.
Now she will train to accomplish feats like swimming a full lap underwater, swimming 440 yards, rescuing people who are pretending to be drowning, treading water and performing something called breaks.
Breaks, said Richard Sher, a lifeguard coordinator for the Parks and Recreation Department, can be defined thus: "Somebody grabs you; how do you defend yourself?"
After the initial training, she must pass another, even harder swimming test. Mr. Sher spent yesterday afternoon overseeing that harder test, given annually to the old standbys, the veteran lifeguards who grew up near the city's beaches and who come back every year. The standards are higher for the beach lifeguards, and the need for them is more urgent. Beaches open on Saturday; pools not until June 28.
In the humid indoor pool at the West 59th Street center yesterday, veteran guards lined up to do laps.
T. J. Mahoney, 19, from Rockaway Beach, Queens, was snapping his fingers violently, getting the blood flowing. Next to him, Meghan Proscio was putting on her goggles and cap. She has been a city lifeguard for the past four summers, but she had not been in the water for nine months.
They dived in, swimming hard toward spotters holding plastic signs counting their laps. They did not pace themselves. They splashed as they turned, their spotters recoiling as if the 80-degree water were lava.
Out of the pool, Mr. Mahoney said the job had been good for one New York City kid.
"Responsibility is the main thing," Mr. Mahoney said. "You kind of need it, and it teaches you a little more."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: ASIAN ARENA; 
North Korea Is Said to Export Drugs to Get Foreign Currency

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
The North Korean government has been overseeing the production and export of thousands of pounds of heroin and methamphetamine each month to bolster the country's foreign currency reserves, a North Korean defector told a Senate subcommittee today.
 The defector, who was led into the hearing room wearing a black hood and who testified from behind a screen to shield his identity, told lawmakers that in 1997 the cash-short central government ordered all collective farms to dedicate 25 acres each to poppy cultivation. He also said that the government hired experts from Thailand to supervise the refining of those poppies into heroin. 
 "The only way to bring in large sums of foreign currency was to sell drugs to other countries," the defector told members of the subcommittee on financial management, budget and international security. 
The testimony comes at a time when the Bush administration is weighing tougher measures to isolate North Korea and press it to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
Among the ideas favored by administration hard-liners is a naval "quarantine" to seize shipments of missiles, drugs and counterfeit money bound from North Korea to foreign markets. 
American intelligence officials have believed for many years that the North Korean government has sanctioned and perhaps supervised the production and export of illegal drugs. 
But today's hearing represented the first time a defector claiming first-hand knowledge of the drug enterprise testified before Congress, Senate officials said. 
The defector's testimony could not be independently corroborated today. But Senate officials said he had been interviewed by South Korean intelligence officials who have vouched for his identity as a former high-ranking official in the North Korean government who defected to South Korea in late 1998. 
Republican lawmakers said today's testimony raised two national security concerns that went well beyond North Korea's drug smuggling. First, they say the North may be using profits from drug trafficking to finance the production of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. 
Second, the Republicans assert that North Korea could use its drug trafficking network -- which may include global crime syndicates like Chinese triads and Japanese yakuza -- to sell nuclear and other prohibited weapons to terrorists. 
"I think the proceeds of the drug ventures are in part funding their weapons programs," said Senator Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican from Illinois who was chairman of today's hearing. "Therefore, their drug trafficking needs to be stopped in order to protect our own national security."
Some Democrats, however, have argued that the United States should pursue a strategy of trying to negotiate with North Korea to get it to abandon its nuclear program before using military force to seize weapons or drug shipments, which the North has said it would consider an act of war.
"If we do not engage North Korea seriously, we will never know if such an agreement could be reached," said Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat from Hawaii. 
The State Department has also raised concerns that North Korea may start selling nuclear bomb-building material to emerging nuclear powers or terrorist groups. In February, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage predicted that North Korea could soon have sufficient bomb-grade plutonium to sell or trade to "a nonstate actor or a rogue state." 
In April, after Australian authorities arrested the crew of a North Korean freighter on charges of smuggling $80 million in heroin, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell accused the North Korean government of being "a regime that thrives on criminality."
North Korea has denied any involvement in drug smuggling. 
During today's hearing, a State Department official asserted that because of the tight central government control over all enterprises in North Korea, there was "probable state involvement" in drug manufacturing and trafficking. 
"One wonders how any entity other than the state itself could be responsible for this high-volume drug trafficking," said the State Department official, William Bach, the director of African, Asian and European affairs in the bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs. 
However, Mr. Bach said efforts by American intelligence officials to photograph North Korean poppy fields had not provided conclusive evidence about the extent of the poppy cultivation.
The subcommittee also heard testimony today from a second North Korean defector who supervised the production of mobile missile guidance systems. The defector, who also testified from behind the screen, said he witnessed the apparent sale of one of those systems to a Middle Eastern country in 1989, though he did not say which nation. 
American intelligence officials say they believe North Korea has been selling missile technology to Syria, Iran and Yemen for years. 
Nicholas Eberstadt, a Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group in Washington, told the lawmakers that North Korea's trade deficit had risen sharply in recent years. He said he considered it likely that the North was financing its imports in part through the export of drugs, counterfeit money and missile technology. 
"Drugs and counterfeiting are part and parcel of North Korean diplomacy," he said, "not an aberration."

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM AFRICA; 
Liberia Seen as Icon of World's Neglect of Africa

BYLINE:  By Somini Sengupta 

DATELINE: FREETOWN, Sierra Leone, May 16 

 BODY:
At a popular restaurant here on the water's edge, the dinner menu offers a rare item: a vegetarian version of the traditional West African groundnut stew. Vegetarianism is anathema in this part of the world. But adjustments have had to be made in Sierra Leone because the world is here.
 Tens of thousands of foreigners have come to help restore peace in this tiny West African country. Pakistani peacekeepers patrol the streets. Norwegians are putting up houses for amputees (the most compelling casualties of Sierra Leone's decade-long war). The Bangladeshis have built a "friendship school." 
 War criminals are to be tried in a new courthouse, under construction now, courtesy of foreign donors. Already, 17,000 United Nations peacekeepers, the largest such force in the world, have disarmed the warlords and drug-addled child soldiers who carried on this country's decade-long war. Some people call this the United Nations of Sierra Leone. 
Today, Sierra Leone makes a strong case for international intervention. What makes it all the more remarkable -- and fragile -- is what stands next door: a portrait of neglect, an American invention called Liberia. 
The contrast is striking. The World Food Program can no longer deliver food aid to much of Liberia because its workers keep coming under attack by armed thugs. Liberian refugees have rushed by the hundreds of thousands into neighboring countries. Liberian mercenaries have ranged across West Africa, in search of new conflicts and attendant looting opportunities.
Liberian enemy factions -- the government of President Charles Taylor in one corner and rebels in another -- have made deadly alliances with rebel leaders and heads of state in next-door Guinea and Ivory Coast.
These are foul wars of revenge and greed. The misery they produce cannot be healed without ending the carnage in Liberia, analysts of the region agree.
But Liberia gets scant international attention. That negligence is a product of Liberia's peculiar history. The British took the lead in corralling international intervention for Sierra Leone, its former colony on this patch. The French have had 4,000 soldiers planted in Ivory Coast, its former colony. Liberia does not have a conventional colonial history. It was founded by freed American slaves in 1847; "the love of liberty brought us here," the Liberian coat of arms reads. 
For nearly 150 years, Liberia remained a virtual American colony, and during the cold war it ranked among Washington's most useful allies. The memory of that strategic alliance sits on the outskirts of the capital. It is called the V.O.A. refugee camp, named after the Voice of America radio transmitter that once stood there.
The United States has never recognized itself as an imperial power, let alone a colonial one. Even the title of "occupying power" is worn uncomfortably today in Iraq, where the now frayed term "liberator" has been the label of choice.
So America's former virtual colony seems to be nowhere near the top of Washington's priority list; in fact, not even on the Africa list.
"The end of the cold war produced a strategic disengagement, and Liberia is Exhibit A in terms of the consequences," said Chester A. Crocker, the Reagan administration's point man on African affairs. "There isn't a sense of strategic interest or a sense of historic responsibility that makes us take a more forceful stand."
The International Crisis Group, a research and advocacy organization, calls Liberia "the eye of the regional storm." The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, on a swing through the region last week, called it the "epicenter" of the human crisis in West Africa. Mr. Lubbers described Liberia's predicament as an emblem of the world's inattention to the continent. "It is an icon of the problem," Mr. Lubbers said of Liberia, "the violence, the gross negligence of the international community."
The United States has been reluctant to endorse peacekeeping missions in Africa. But it has quietly supported the Sierra Leone war crimes court, which is investigating the role of the Liberian president in the conflict and suggests that it may indict him.
The United States also gives military aid to Guinea, an ally of the rebel group now gunning for control of the Liberian capital. Rebels are said to control some 60 percent of Liberian territory. Fighting continues unabated.
The Liberian war's backdrop is international neglect. The relationship between Africa and the outside world has almost always been an unhappy one. A little more than 100 years ago, in the scramble for Africa, as it was called, the European powers sat down together to bargain and parcel out the continent's riches.
Today, a mixture of self-interest and historic ties compels the British and French to re-engage in their former colonies. Perhaps they and the other traditional power in West Africa, the United States, should follow the lead of the 19th-century imperialists and sit down to bargain again. Only this time the object should not be to divide the spoils but to bring a measure of peace to this ravaged place.
The Security Council was scheduled to send a mission to the region last week, but other matters, namely the debate over sanctions on Iraq, detained them. The mission has been postponed for next month, or the month after.

HEADLINE: W.H.O. Expresses Optimism China Can Control SARS 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Although China has reported the overwhelming majority of the world's SARS cases, the number of cases is dropping rapidly in many areas of the country, the World Health Organization said yesterday as it expressed wary optimism that China could contain the respiratory disease, although it might take as long as a year.
 Dr. Henk Bekedam said he was encouraged by the trend in China, where he is the W.H.O.'s representative in Beijing, and by that government's political commitment and mobilization of health workers to fight the new respiratory disease. 
 China has reported 5,248 of the world's 7,919 probable SARS cases. Of those, 3,273 are current cases. 
Beijing has reported the largest cumulative number of probable cases in the country, 2,444. But Beijing is now reporting fewer than 20 new cases a day, down from 100 cases earlier in the epidemic. Guangdong Province, where SARS first appeared last November, has reported the second-largest cumulative total, 1,514 probable cases. For last seven days, Guangdong has reported fewer than five new cases each day.
Four other provinces (Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin) have each reported more than 100 cases.
The experience of carrying out measures to detect SARS and control the infection in areas with large numbers of cases shows that "you can contain" SARS, Dr. Bekedam told reporters by telephone from Geneva where the W.H.O. is holding its annual meeting.
Dr. Bekedam said that after listening to scientists brief delegates from the W.H.O.'s 192 member countries he "did not believe that SARS should become endemic" in China.
"We are going for elimination and China will be the battleground," Dr. Bekedam said.
But Tommy G. Thompson, the United States secretary of health and human services, seemed to take the view that SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, was endemic when he told reporters in Brussels earlier in the day that he believed that SARS would probably reappear and cause deaths in the United States and Europe in the fall.
Despite the best efforts of health workers to contain the disease, Mr. Thompson said that he "did not think SARS is going to go away," according to The Associated Press.
Mr. Thompson's statement implied that he believed that SARS is becoming one more on the long list of endemic diseases that are permanent fixtures in many regions of the world, although a spokesman for Mr. Thompson said he did not use the word in talking to reporters.
Dr. Bekedam said he expected new SARS cases to appear in China for six months, maybe even a year. He also cautioned that experience had shown that if vigilance slipped, one case could lead to scores of others.
The most urgent need is improved infection control, Dr. Bekedam said. "If your hospital infection control is not in order, then instead of controlling it, you are spreading the disease," he said.
But to prevent spread, China needs donations of medical equipment like masks and other protective gear for health workers as well as mechanical ventilators, Dr. Bekedam said.
Other urgent needs include improving the infrastructure of the Chinese health system, which has been weakened over the last 10 to 20 years as the Chinese government has focused on economic development and invested less in public health.
Dr. Bekedam said that a poor system for detecting and monitoring diseases was one reason health workers had not found the contacts for more than 50 percent of recent SARS cases in Beijing. Also, health workers may not be asking enough questions to trace a new case to an older one.
Yet another possibility is that the definition of a case of SARS may be too broad and is detecting different respiratory ailments that happen to be occurring by coincidence at the same time.
Lastly, Dr. Bekedam said, epidemiologists need to investigate a possibility that the SARS virus is being spread in a different way in Beijing than elsewhere.
Ma Xiaowei, the Chinese vice minister of health, told the meeting delegates that there was a distinct age pattern to SARS cases in China. For unknown reasons, SARS has generally spared children; 2.8 percent of the country's cases were in children younger than 14. The percentages for other ages were: 29 percent for ages 20 to 29; 23 percent for 30 to 39; 18 percent for 40 to 49; 11 percent for 50 to 59; and 10 percent in those 60 and older. 
Seventy percent of the deaths occurred among people with heart disease or diabetes, he said.
Dr. Bekedam said the W.H.O. and Chinese officials were making a major effort to determine the original source of the SARS virus in nature. If SARS jumped species, health officials need to find the source so they can develop strategies to deal with such animal reservoirs to prevent similar introductions in the future, he said.
Dr. Bekedam did not speak about the spread of SARS in Taiwan, which has reported 383 cases, because Taiwan does not come under his jurisdiction. The W.H.O., a United Nations agency, rejected Taiwan's request to be an observer at the meeting because the United Nations considers Taiwan a province of China.
The Philippine secretary of health, Manuel M. Dayril, criticized the W.H.O. for confusing the public by using terms like probable case. Many people believed that if the case was probable, it was confirmed, he said.
Mr. Dayril also said that the W.H.O. had created unnecessary public anxiety and economic chaos by issuing travel advisories before the agency had consulted affected countries, an action that made his government fight both SARS and hysteria.

An article on Wednesday about the declining number of SARS cases in China referred incorrectly to Tianjin, which still had more than 100. It is a city, not a province.

HEADLINE: Shareholders Ask Hollinger to InvestigateExecutive Pay 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Shareholders frustrated by the way Hollinger International, the newspaper publisher, is managed and governed are turning to Hollinger's high-powered outside directors for help.
 Tweedy, Browne, a money management firm that owns 17.7 percent of the outstanding shares of Hollinger, asked the company's board to investigate $73.7 million in payments to Conrad M. Black, the chairman and chief executive, and other senior executives. The demand came in a letter to the board that was dated Monday and filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Tweedy, Browne officials are trying to get the attention of the company's outside directors, who include Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Richard N. Perle, former chairman of the Defense Policy Board. A representative of Tweedy, Browne is expected to try to raise the issue at Hollinger's annual meeting in Manhattan tomorrow, though the compensation of the executives is not on the agenda. 
The complaints of shareholders center on the management fees and other payments that Lord Black, who is an English lord, and his management team have received from Hollinger. Tweedy, Browne said those payments had exceeded $200 million since 1995.
In its letter to the board, Tweedy, Browne concentrated on $73.7 million paid to the executives since Jan. 1, 2000, under agreements not to compete with the buyers of assets sold by Hollinger, which publishes The Chicago Sun-Times, The Daily Telegraph of London and The Jerusalem Post. Those payments should have gone to Hollinger and the executives breached their fiduciary duty and their duty of loyalty in accepting them, the letter said.
Paul B. Healy, vice president for corporate development and investor relations at Hollinger's offices in New York, did not return calls seeking comment. Bloomberg News reported yesterday that Lord Black said in a phone interview that he would discuss the fees at the annual meeting and might change the way they are paid.
But that response did not appease Tweedy, Browne. Robert E. Curry Jr., a partner in Kirby, McInerney & Squire, a New York law firm that represents the investors, said they wanted the fees returned.
"What we're asking for is disgorgement," Mr. Curry said. "We're asking the board to claw back what's already been paid to them."
Mr. Curry cited corporate law in Delaware, where Hollinger is incorporated, in his demand letter. He argued that the board had a duty to investigate what he said amounted to "misappropriation of corporate opportunity."
The investors would need help from the directors or the courts in a dispute with Hollinger's management because Lord Black has effective control of the company. More than 70 percent of the voting control of Hollinger is held, either directly or indirectly, by the Ravelston Corporation, a company owned by Lord Black and several other men.
But Hollinger International, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is subject to the same corporate governance rules as other public American companies. A majority of its directors must be independent.
At its annual meeting, 12 people are standing for election to the board, including Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel Black, who is a vice president of the company. Along with Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Perle, the independent nominees include Richard R. Burt, the former ambassador to Germany; James R. Thompson, former governor of Illinois; and Marie-Josee Kravis, an economist married to the financier Henry Kravis. A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's Holdings who was released from federal prison last week, is not up for re-election.
Hollinger has sold newspapers in Canada and the United States over the last three years. In each deal, Hollinger, Lord Black and other executives signed agreements not to compete with the newspapers sold, according to Tweedy, Browne.
In November 2000, Hollinger sold Canadian newspapers to CanWest for $2.1 billion. As part of the deal, Ravelston received $25 million in noncompetition payments and another $27 million went to Lord Black and three other executives, according to Tweedy, Browne.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE CONTRACTORS; 
Feeding Frenzy Under Way, as Companies From All Over Seek a Piece of the Action

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
The pitch from Egyptian and Jordanian companies is that since their workers speak Arabic, they are best suited for jobs rebuilding Iraq.
 The Filipino companies emphasize that they have a well-educated, English-speaking labor force that has worked around the world with American construction companies. 
 And the British, though their appeals are understated, offer what some Bush administration officials argue is the most convincing case: that they shed blood in Iraq as the United States' military ally and remain the most important partner in the occupation of Iraq. 
Governments around the world -- and the companies whose causes they support -- have besieged Washington in a campaign to win a piece of the reconstruction action in Iraq, according to administration officials and lobbyists and companies vying for work. 
Like prospectors rushing to California, thousands of companies have rushed here to compete for roles in what could become the biggest reconstruction effort since the Marshall Plan rebuilt Europe after World War II.
The pleas are being lavished mainly on the Bechtel Corporation, which as the lead contractor in the United States-financed rebuilding effort will be dispensing subcontracts for everything from bridge building to port repairs to restoring water supplies.
In less than three weeks, Bechtel, based in San Francisco and the largest construction company in the country, has been flooded with more than 20,000 e-mail messages, resumes and applications from people and companies around the globe hoping for a chance to win a subcontract, according to Howard Menaker, Bechtel's Washington spokesman. The Web site explaining the subcontracting process says it has had 71,000 hits. 
"This response is huge," Mr. Menaker said. "Is this normal? Not at all. This is a project that has garnered world attention, and this is extraordinary for us."
The would-be subcontractors are not deterred by the fact that Bechtel will only begin setting up makeshift offices in Iraq this week, that security in the country is tenuous and that electricity and running water may be nonexistent.
Moreover, the available money is far short of what reconstruction officials say will be needed. Bechtel's original contract is for no more than $680 million. But independent estimates are that the final cost for an effort of the extent outlined in Bechtel's contract with the United States Agency for International Development will be $20 billion.
Bechtel's Washington office has been visited by official delegations from Bulgaria, Romania, the United Arab Emirates, Lithuania, Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, the Philippines, Poland, Hungary, South Korea, the Czech Republic, Thailand, Portugal, Denmark, Turkey, Spain and Germany.
Among other pitches, these countries are variously promoting their companies' low labor costs, Arabic speakers and sophisticated technology.
"An elaborate courting scene is going on all over Washington with official delegations and corporate officers walking around advertising themselves at public events," said a lobbyist representing some of the companies. "In private they're pulling out their hair because they can't get the right information, and they're afraid they'll miss out on the biggest deal in decades."
Bechtel, which expects to subcontract 75 percent of the reconstruction work, is holding meetings in Washington, London and Kuwait City to help would-be partners apply for the work. The first session is planned for Wednesday at the headquarters here of the United States Agency for International Development.
Of all the competitors, British politicians have publicly complained that their companies deserve special treatment because of Britain's involvement in the war. 
During a visit to Washington in search of subcontracts late last week, Baroness Symons, the British minister of state for trade and investment, said there were no hard feelings about the United States' dispensing the prime contracts only to American companies. The Bush administration cited security considerations and a desire to give out the contracts quickly.
Lady Symons said that she had no objection to the requirement that the British compete on an equal basis with other foreign companies for the subcontracts being given out by Bechtel and others that have won contracts from the Pentagon.
"We're not looking for specialized treatment, because we don't feel we need to ask for special treatment," she said. "We're the natural partners."
Still, Lady Symons, who is the deputy leader of the House of Lords, said she wanted to make sure the Bush administration's top officials heard the message that the British are excellent partners in peace as well as war, as good at rebuilding nations as they are at fighting terrorists. She met not just with important officials at Bechtel but also with officials close to the company at the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon. 
"We believed in the war and gave our expertise," she said. "We believe in the reconstruction and offer our expertise." 
At all the stops, she and the four leaders of British industry who accompanied her made the case that British companies had a long and close relationship with Iraq and Iraqi businesses, from the imperial days in the early 20th century until international sanctions were imposed in the 1990's.
"Our companies built many of the plants in Iraq and know how they operate," said Anthony K. Allum, chairman of the Halcrow Group, a British contractor specializing in transportation and water infrastructures. Mr. Allum is also the head of a new Iraq working group to promote British subcontractors.
At the British group's meeting with Bechtel, Mr. Allum slipped officials what he called a select list of some 18 British companies that he considered the top candidates for work in Iraq.
Among those listed were Black & Veatch, a firm of consulting engineers that worked on the Karkh water project for western Baghdad and the Basra water supply; Hyder Consulting, which worked on Iraq's port, roads, sewerage and bridges in the 1970s and 1980s, and Vector, consultants and project managers who worked on airports in Baghdad, Basra and Mosul.
Something clicked. In its first announcement of subcontracts, Bechtel gave Mr. Allum's company a subcontract to provide civil engineering support in Iraq.

 BODY:
Yonda Lies da Castle Of My Foddah-in-Law
We don't know why it is, but we are fascinated by the DUKE OF LUGO'S fan. He was using the fan -- which is neither large nor small and is black and white -- when we saw him a few weeks ago, at a benefit at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and then again last week at the New York City Ballet spring gala. And it wasn't hot on either occasion, so you figure it out. 
 The Duke, who is very tall, is married to the INFANTA ELENA, daughter of KING JUAN CARLOS of Spain. We asked the Infanta, who was wearing a diamond necklace and matching earring, who designed her gown. She did not know and walked with us to her husband. 
 He gave us a look that suggested he likes his reporters poached.
"You are asking about her clothes," the Duke asked, disdainfully. "It comes from her closet."
Yes, we can believe that.
"You should know who it is," he said.
Well, perhaps, but we don't.
"I could tell you who is -- every single dress the woman is wearing. It is from her closet. Is that true or not?"
You know the freshen-the-drink moment we speak of from time to time? 
It is right now.
Also attending were ROB MARSHALL, the director and choreographer of the film "Chicago," and CANDACE BUSHNELL, who is married to the New York City ballet dancer CHARLES ASKEGARD. They met last year, at this very event, and married eight weeks later, which might be why they were drinking Champagne and flirting with each other like two kids at a prom. 
We also spoke with JOHN LITHGOW, the actor and children's book writer who wrote the narration for one of the evening's ballets, "Carnival of the Animals," and danced in the ballet as a lady elephant. 
Mr. Lithgow had become involved in the project through CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON, the company's resident choreographer. Mr. Lithgow and Mr. Wheeldon became friends when Mr. Lithgow starred in the Broadway show "Sweet Smell of Success." Mr. Wheeldon was the choreographer for the musical. 
"Once it was all written, he asked me to play the elephant," said Mr. Lithgow, who is more than six feet tall and solidly built. "I said yes instantly. Who would say no to that?" 
The role Mr. Lithgow dances is that of Nurse Mabel Buntz, who performs a dainty waltz at the Elephant Ball. He wears a chiffon dress with a hem of marabou feathers over a fat suit, which gives him an enormous bust and hips.
"I started taking ballet classes in February," Mr. Lithgow said. "Just put me in my dress and back me up by four dancing boys." 
Did he adapt a ballet dancer's diet? 
"No," Mr. Lithgow said. "I was supposed to be an elephant."

We're Sorry Already
Y'know our little headline higher up? The one that is a line often attributed to the Bronx-born TONY CURTIS? 
We're having second thoughts. 
The Duke of Lugo, JAIME DE MARICHALAR, comes from a titled family himself and was trained as an economist. 
So the following headline might have been better: Yonder Lies the Castle of My Father-in-Law, the King.

Yonda Lies My House in Umbria
Once we start mingling with titled people, we become so giddy we just cannot stop, so on to DAME MAGGIE SMITH. She will be starring this Sunday evening in the HBO movie "My House in Umbria," adapted from the WILLIAM TREVOR novella about a writer who experiences a terrorist attack on a train and her relationship with her fellow travelers. 
Among those attending the party for the film at the Four Seasons restaurant last week were MARISA BERENSON, whose sister, BERRY BERENSON, had been a passenger on one of the planes in the Sept. 11 attack; ARNOLD SCAASI and his partner PARKER LADD, the host of "Open Book" on the A & E network; PRINCESS BENEDETTA PIGNATELLI, a freelance writer who tells us she rarely uses her title; and Dame Smith. Or Ms. Smith. She has grande dame posture, but smiled warmly.
Any perks with the title, we asked? 
"It's just an honor," she said, "but it makes you feel old."
A gender issue: 
"When someone becomes a sir, or knight, his wife becomes a lady," Ms. Smith said. "But when you become a dame, your husband does not receive a title."
Ms. Pignatelli, a New York University graduate, writes for Italian magazines and newspapers.
Does she like New York?
"Yes, I like strange places," she said.
Which would be?
"Places like Harlem, the Bronx. It was not easy to sell a story to my editors in Italy about the Bronx. By then they agreed. Because of the J. LO mystique." 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Boldface Names column on Wednesday about a party for the film "My House in Umbria" misstated the background of Princess Benedetta Pignatelli, a freelance writer who was a guest. She did not attend New York University.

HEADLINE: Case of Mad Cow in Canada Prompts U.S. to Ban Its Beef 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS with SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 20 

 BODY:
Mad cow disease was diagnosed in a cow in Canada today, and United States health authorities immediately placed a ban on imports of beef, cattle and animal feed from Canada.
 The report shocked ranchers through much of western Canada, where trading in livestock was immediately halted because of plummeting cattle prices. The shock waves spread through the financial markets, where prices in many Canadian and American meat and restaurant companies fell sharply. 
 Canadian authorities stressed that only one cow out of Canada's total cattle population of 3.6 million was found to be sick and there was no immediate evidence that the disease had spread among livestock or humans. 
But authorities had trouble explaining the source of the disease, or reassuring the public that there was no possibility of other cases.
Officials said they were not sure whether the sick 8-year-old cow was imported and whether -- if so -- it had the disease already, or contracted it here. Should the cow have contracted the disease in Canada, from locally produced feed, today's news would be considered far more threatening.
Canada is the world's 10th largest beef producer, representing 2.5 percent of total world output. The United States accounts for 78 percent of Canada's beef exports, but last year's total -- 1.1 billion pounds of beef -- represented only 4 percent of American beef production, according to Cattle Buyers Weekly, an American industry newsletter.
The cow, from an unidentified ranch in Alberta, was to be slaughtered in January when a provincial veterinarian noticed that the animal was unusually thin. Suspecting pneumonia, he took its head for routine testing and sent its remains to a rendering plant. The rendering process yields beef protein that is sometimes used in pet food, but the destination of the material from this cow is unknown.
Veterinary personnel did not suspect mad cow disease, so the head was tested only Friday in a provincial laboratory. When the test came up positive, tissues went to a federal laboratory and samples were sent to Britain over the weekend.
"I want to stress the cow did not go into the food chain," said Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief. "I want to stress from the beginning this is one cow."
It was the first case of mad cow disease in Canada since a single cow was reported infected in 1993.
The uncertainties surrounding the cow amplified the threat to the Canadian economy, which had already stumbled in recent weeks from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in Toronto in March and April.
The interruption of Canadian beef exports, although still temporary, will almost certainly increase beef prices for American consumers and restaurants. Since Canadian cattle pass south every day -- last year more than a half a million live head of cattle came across the border from Alberta alone -- any significant spread in Canada would almost certainly threaten American herds.
The United States imported $1.1 billion of cattle from Canada last year, amounting to one third of all American cattle imports, according to the Agriculture Department. 
Mad cow disease wreaked great hardship on Britain after it was first diagnosed in 1986, spreading through 180,000 livestock and causing more than 100 human deaths around Europe. It has changed diets and culinary practices in much of Europe, and raised new questions about the health benefits of eating beef for many consumers around the world.
The affected animal came from a herd put together from different dealers in northern Alberta three years ago by a breeder who has not been identified. 
The Alberta herd has been impounded. The animals will be held in quarantine, tested and killed. The rancher recently sold 211 calves in Alberta. "We know where they are," said Dr. Francine Lord, national manager of import and export for animal health at the food inspection agency in Ottawa.
"We're very concerned about it," said Gary Little, a veterinarian with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Referring to the acronym of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the technical name of the disease, he added, "Canada has had a reputation for being B.S.E.-free. We'll take whatever measures are required."
The disease first appeared in England in the mid-1980's when hundreds of cattle began staggering and losing weight before dying. Autopsies showed that their brains were riddled with holes and contained clumps of a sticky plaquelike substance.
The disorder was soon found to be related to a class of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies caused when brain proteins deform and become highly toxic. While the disease can occur sporadically -- in humans it is called Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease -- most of the time it is transmitted when an animal eats tissues from an infected animal. Human victims, who can suffer a variant of the disease from eating tainted beef, incur memory loss, dementia and eventually paralysis.
News of the ban on imports of Canadian beef prompted sharp falls in the stock prices of companies like McDonald's, the world's largest buyer of beef, and Tyson Foods, the world's largest beef processor. McDonald's shares fell 6.7 percent to $16.95 a share, Tyson Foods Class A shares fell 4.9 percent to $9.01, and Wendy's International shares fell 6.6 percent to $28.55 a share.
A report by Merrill Lynch today suggested most of the economic impact in Canada would be psychological, noting that total annual exports of beef products are equivalent to two weeks of Canadian auto exports. "We cannot rule out a 'fear-induced' setback in the Canadian dollar," it said, "especially in light of the massive recent runup."
Ben Thorlakson, chairman of the Canada Beef Export Federation in Calgary, told the Canadian Press news service that "we will leave no stone unturned until we have returned Canada to B.S.E.-free status."
Canadian officials immediately faced questions about why it took so long to test the infected cow. Mr. Vanclief said cattle that enter the food chain are given priority in testing. "Don't try to leave the impression that this animal went into the feed chain," he told reporters.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Indonesia: Economy Slows A Bit 

BYLINE:  By Wayne Arnold (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Indonesian economic growth slowed less than economists had expected in the first quarter, as strong agricultural output offset weaker growth in consumer spending. 
The economy expanded 3.43 percent compared with the same quarter of 2002 after growing 3.82 percent in the three months before. While the government has said its new campaign against rebels in Aceh province will have little effect on its budget, some investors believe it will further discourage foreign investment. Currency traders appeared to believe otherwise yesterday, and drove the Indonesian rupiah to its highest level against the United States dollar in 21 months on expectations that government asset sales would lure funds from overseas.

HEADLINE: Man Charged With Stalking 

 BODY:
A 27-year-old Queens man who was arrested Monday at Shea Stadium was arraigned yesterday on charges that he has been stalking Mets General Manager Steve Phillips since January.
 The man, Matthew Barnes, "repeatedly acted with intent to harass, annoy or alarm" Phillips and "acted in a manner that caused him to be fearful and concerned for his safety," District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens said in a statement. 
 Barnes "yelled, cursed and demanded to see Mr. Phillips," and refused to leave stadium property, the statement said.
 Barnes, according to the police, is unemployed and homeless and last resided on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. He was arrested outside the team's offices at the stadium.
 Barnes is facing charges of stalking, harassment, menacing and criminal trespassing.
 If convicted he could be sentenced to up to a year in jail. He is being held without bail until a psychiatric test can be administered.
 Ana Ferrin, a Legal Aid lawyer representing Barnes, said the charges were ridiculous. She said last night that Barnes was "homeless and down on his luck" and was at the stadium seeking employment as a vendor.
 Phillips has been under siege from fans and the media for his handling of a team with a large payroll that has won only 19 of 45 games this season.
 Before the Mets' home game last night, Phillips declined to answer questions about the arrest.

A Broken Foot Won't Stop Elliott

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
Bill Elliott will race in Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600 in Concord, N.C., with a broken left foot. It is up to his crew to figure out how to keep him comfortable through the longest race of the season. 
 Elliott broke his foot last Saturday in a six-car accident during Nascar's all-star race. He went to Indianapolis yesterday to meet with Dr. Terry Trammell. He was fitted for a carbon fiber foot protector and a brace to use when he races. Elliott, 47, broke three bones on the top of his left foot.

NO END TO FEUD: CART and the Indy Racing League have found something new to fight about. Three of five CART panelists withdrew from a two-day open-wheel racing summit yesterday after questioning the forum's objectivity. CART officials were also put off by the location, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is owned by Tony George's family. George was the founder of the Indy Racing League and the key player in the CART-I.R.L. split in 1996.
 The two-day discussion was focused on improving the image of open-wheel racing amid a poor economy and the rapid growth in popularity of Nascar.
