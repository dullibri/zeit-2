HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Declines 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing fell in November for a second consecutive month, the first back-to-back monthly declines in more than 13 years. 
 The Federal Reserve reported Monday that borrowing declined at an annual rate of $648.8 million in November after a record rate of decline of $8.4 billion in October.
 The weakness in November caught analysts by surprise. They expected a rebound in borrowing based on a revival of consumer spending and consumer confidence in November. 
 The $8.4 billion rate of decline in October was a record for a single month and reflected lower auto sales, which soared during the summer as automakers offered attractive sales incentives. 
 Expressed in percentage terms, consumer credit crept down at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in November after having fallen at a 4.7 percent rate in October. 
 Consumer credit posted gains of more than 6 percent in July and August, reflecting the surge in auto sales. In September, consumer credit rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent. 
 By category, credit card debt and revolving loans edged up 0.5 percent in November at an annual rate after a 2.8 percent drop in October. 
 Nonrevolving debt, the category that includes auto loans, fell for a third consecutive month, dropping 0.9 percent after declines of 5.8 percent in October and 0.3 percent in September. 
 The decline in overall borrowing pushed consumer debt in the categories tracked by the Fed down to $2.156 trillion in November, slightly below the record high of $2.165 trillion set in September.

HEADLINE: Six Women At Dresdner File Bias Suit

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Six women who are senior bankers at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Services have sued the investment bank, contending that they were denied equal bonuses and promotions that went to men with less experience. 
 The complaint, brought by three directors and three vice presidents -- all still working at the bank -- also cites instances of lewd behavior toward the women, entertainment of clients at a strip club and repeated examples of scaled-back opportunities for women after they returned from maternity leave.
In one case, Katherine Smith, a director in equity sales trading in London who has worked at the bank or at its predecessors since 1996, was referred to as the ''Pamela Anderson of sales/trading'' by her supervisor, according to the lawsuit. And while Ms. Smith has been among the group's top producers in terms of commissions generated for stock sales, she was awarded progressively lower bonuses and denied a promotion to managing director, the most senior ranking on Wall Street, ''because she is a woman and because she has a child,'' the suit contends. 
 One woman complained of a male managing director who routinely took prostitutes to the office during his lunch hour, according to the lawsuit.
 The lawsuit, which was filed yesterday in United States District Court in Manhattan, seeks class-action status on behalf of 500 women who work at Dresdner Kleinwort, the American investment bank of Dresdner Bank of Germany. The lawsuit seeks $1.4 billion for economic damages, emotional distress, harm to reputation and punitive damages.
 An employee of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London, who asked to be identified only as a spokeswoman, disputed the claims and said the bank would fight the suit.
 ''It is not our policy to comment on pending or threatened litigation,'' she said. Dresdner Kleinwort ''fully complies with all applicable employment-related laws and is confident that any claims to the contrary are without merit,'' she said. 
 In recent years, sexual harassment cases have plagued Wall Street, which has yet to shake its reputation as something of a boys' club. Saleswomen and female traders, investment bankers and private wealth managers at firms like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Smith Barney have sued, claiming discriminatory treatment, unequal pay and promotion, and demeaning work conditions. 
 In July 2004, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $54 million to settle a sex discrimination case covering as many as 340 women. The settlement awarded Allison K. Schieffelin, a successful bond saleswoman who brought the case, $12 million. Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney have paid more than $200 million combined to women who worked in their brokerage operations.
 Like many banks on Wall Street, Dresdner Kleinwort has a low percentage of women in senior positions. According to May 2005 data cited in the lawsuit, women account for less than 2 percent of managing directors in Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's worldwide capital markets division. Only 13 percent of directors, the next level down, are women. Of the 500 women in the capital markets division, about 60 percent are associates, the second-lowest rank, or below. 
 The six plaintiffs have been at Dresdner ''for a total of 50 years,'' said their lawyer, Douglas H. Wigdor of Thompson Wigdor & Gilly in New York.
 One plaintiff, Jyoti Ruta, a director in structured finance who has worked with the firm since 1994, said: ''I have heard so many women at DrKW who tell me the things that their male managers and colleagues have done to them. It saddens me.
 ''They love their work, they are building their careers and they believe in the firm, but they are treated in such a way that they will never advance.'' 
 According to the suit, Ms. Ruta was stripped of revenue-generating opportunities, left out of critical client events and generally relegated to the sidelines after she returned from maternity leave in 2003. She is currently pregnant with her second child. She said the firm had retaliated against her for taking action against it by issuing false performance reports and scrutinizing activities like lunch breaks.
 In addition to Dresdner Kleinwort, the lawsuit names 12 supervisors, one of them a woman, as defendants.

HEADLINE: Iran, Defiant, Insists It Plans to Restart Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Defying its European partners and the United States, Iran plans to reopen its vast uranium enrichment complex to resume nuclear activities that it suspended 14 months ago, officials involved in negotiations with Iran said Monday.
 Iran told the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency last week that it was planning to restart nuclear research and development, without specifying what type of activities it would resume, or where.
But in messages and letters to the agency in recent days, Iran said it planned to reopen the enrichment complex, in Natanz in central Iran, and perhaps an unspecified number of other sites, said the officials, who declined to be identified by name because they lack authorization to discuss the matter for attribution. 
 The Iranian move came in defiance of unusual separate messages delivered to the Tehran government over the weekend by Russia and China, as well as the United States, Britain and France. The messages warned Iran not to embark on further uranium activities. 
 Britain, France and the United States tried to have the five countries submit one joint declaration to Iran, but China, not wanting such a move to look like an attempt to gang up on Tehran, insisted that five separate messages be delivered. All said much the same thing.
 European and American diplomats said enlisting China and Russia amounted to a further ratcheting up of pressure on Iran, because the five countries possess nuclear weapons and are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The United States wants the Council to impose sanctions on Iran if it does not abandon its suspected nuclear ambitions.
 The stated plan by Iran to reopen its uranium enrichment plant reflects a high-stakes gamble by Iran to test its legal right to conduct certain nuclear activities under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the main treaty governing the spread of nuclear technology.
 The United States, and to an increasing extent European governments, say they believe that Natanz is part of a long-suspected nuclear weapons program that they contend is more advanced than the Iraqi program was at its height under Saddam Hussein's rule. 
 The operations at the Natanz site were kept secret from the atomic energy agency and were not confirmed by its inspectors until February 2003. The inspectors found preparations for the construction of more than 50,000 centrifuges -- tall, thin machines that spin at supersonic speed to enrich uranium so that it can be used in nuclear reactors. 
 When uranium is enriched to a very high degree, it can be used in a nuclear weapon. The fast-spinning centrifuges could make fuel for up to 20 nuclear weapons a year, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
 For Iran's clerical leadership and even much of its population, Natanz is synonymous with modernity and power.
 Iran insists that its goal at Natanz is to conduct research and produce fuel for a civilian nuclear power program. Some of Iran's most experienced nuclear scientists used to work there, and Iran described the closing of the complex -- under an agreement with France, Britain and Germany in November 2004 to freeze most of its nuclear activities -- as voluntary and temporary.
 In Tehran, Gholam Hossein Elham, a government spokesman, said Monday at a news conference that Iran would resume nuclear research and development, as announced last week to the International Atomic Energy Agency. ''Iran will today resume nuclear fuel research as scheduled,'' he said, without giving any details.
 Agency officials in Vienna and their inspectors in Iran struggled without success throughout the day to wring information from the government about its plans, as Tehran had asked that the activities be carried out under the watchful eyes of the inspectors.
 By day's end the agency said the research at Natanz had not yet restarted. ''Our inspectors who were at the scene today reported that there was no new activity or breaking of seals,'' said Melissa Fleming, an agency spokeswoman.
 The sticking point appears to be Iran's indecision about whether to merely test its equipment or go further and conduct experiments with nuclear fuel, which Mohamed ElBaradei, the international agency's director, called ''a red line for the international community'' in an interview on Monday with the BBC.
 He urged Iran to ''exercise maximum restraint,'' and predicted that the impasse with Iran ''could turn into a major crisis,'' because of Iran's lack of full cooperation with his agency and its plans to restart nuclear research.
 The international nuclear agency has failed to persuade Iran to turn over some important information about its nuclear history and to give agency inspectors access to certain sites. But Iran's lack of openness is a separate issue from whether it has a legal right to conduct nuclear research.
 Dr. ElBaradei acknowledged that a wide array of nuclear activities were permitted under the nonproliferation treaty. ''As a matter of law, Iran has the right to do all the nuclear activities, including enriching uranium,'' he told James P. Rubin in an interview on Monday with the London-based Sky News.
 Iran's announcement that it planned to resume its nuclear research brought a new flurry of international condemnation.
 ''Very, very disastrous signals'' are coming from Iran, Germany's new foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told reporters before a cabinet meeting outside Berlin. 
 The White House on Monday warned Iran that it might be referred to the United Nations Security Council for possible censure or sanctions. The international community has already warned Iran that ''the next step would be a referral to the Security Council,'' said the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan.
 Late last year, the 35-country board of the international nuclear agency voted to refer Iran's case for consideration by the Security Council if it did not meet its international obligations. But Russia, China and some other important countries are still resistant to Council action.
 Marking the start of Austria's six-month presidency of the European Union on Monday, Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel said sanctions were always a ''possibility,'' adding that the 25-country union had always considered them ''a last resort.''
 Germany, France and Britain are concerned that Iran's newest move could shatter the agreement they reached in November 2004 under which Iran agreed to freeze most of its nuclear activities, including nuclear research, in exchange for a broad package of political and economic incentives.

Military Jet Crash Kills 13 in Iran
 TEHRAN, Jan. 9 (AP) -- A small military passenger jet crashed Monday in northwestern Iran, killing at least 13 people, including Gen. Ahmad Kazemi, the commander of the ground forces of the elite Revolutionary Guards, state media reported.
 Gen. Masoud Jazayeri, spokesman for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, told state radio that both of the plane's engines had failed, its landing gear had jammed, and there was snow and poor visibility at the time.

HEADLINE: More and More, Women Risk All to Enter U.S. 

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: TUCSON 

 BODY:
It took years for Normaeli Gallardo, a single mother from Acapulco, to drum up the courage to join the growing stream of Mexican women illegally crossing the border on the promise of a job, in her case working in a Kansas meatpacking plant for $5.15 an hour.
 First, she had to grapple with the idea of landing in an unfamiliar country, all alone, with no grasp of English and no place to live.
Then she had to imagine crossing the Arizona desert, where immigrants face heat exhaustion by day, frostbite by night and the cunning of the ''coyotes'' -- smugglers who charge as much as $1,500 to guide people into the United States and who make a habit of robbing and sexually assaulting them. 
 And finally, Ms. Gallardo, 38, who earned $50 a week at an Acapulco hotel, had to contemplate life without her two vivacious daughters, Isabel, 7, and Fernanda, 5. That once unimaginable trade-off -- leaving her children behind so they could one day leave poverty behind -- had suddenly become her only option. 
 She simply did not earn enough money, she said. If she paid the electric bill, she fell behind on rent; if she paid the water bill, she could forget about new clothes for the children.
 ''My heart broke, my heart broke,'' said Ms. Gallardo, who crumbled as she recounted her decision to leave her girls with her sister and make the uncertain journey across the border. ''But I had to give them a better life. I told them I would go and work, and we could buy a small plot of land and build a little house and have a dog.''
 Undaunted by a backlash against illegal immigrants here, Ms. Gallardo is part of what some experts say is a largely unnoticed phenomenon: the increasing number of women, many without male companions, enduring danger and the risk of capture to come to the United States to work and to settle. 
 As many as 11 million illegal immigrants are thought to be living and working in the United States, though estimates vary.
 No one knows how many people illegally cross the Mexico-United States border, trekking through the desert, hiding in cars and trucks, or walking through points of entry with false papers. But academics, immigration advocates and Border Patrol agents all agree that the number of women making the trip is on the rise.
 Katharine Donato, an associate professor of sociology at Rice University in Houston who studies Mexican migration to the United States, estimates that as many as 35 percent to 45 percent of those crossing the border illegally today are women. Twenty years ago, fewer than 20 percent of the people crossing illegally were women, she said.
 The increase, which has occurred gradually, comes at a time when anger over illegal immigration is on the upswing, especially in states near the border. Some of that anger is directed at women who have babies in American hospitals and send their children to public schools. 
 The House recently passed a hard-hitting bill that seeks to beef up border enforcement and make it a federal crime to live in the United States illegally. 
 But to most of the women who cross the border, the debate over illegal immigration and the ire of taxpayers has little bearing, if any, on the difficult decision they make to undertake the journey. '' 'Vale la pena,' '' said Kat Rodriguez, an organizer for the Human Rights Coalition in Tucson, echoing a refrain among the women. '' 'It's worth it.' '' 
 Some women cross simply to keep their families together and join their husbands after long separations, a situation that has grown more pronounced since the Border Patrol agency began stepping up enforcement 10 years ago. With the border more secure in California and Texas, many people are now being funneled into the rugged territory of Arizona -- an effort that virtually requires the help of an expensive coyote to cross successfully. 
 Yet a growing number of single women, like Ms. Gallardo, are coming not to join husbands, but to find jobs, send money home and escape a bleak future in Mexico. They come to find work in the booming underground economy, through a vast network of friends and relatives already employed here as maids, cooks, kitchen helpers, factory workers and baby sitters. In these jobs, they can earn double or triple their Mexican salaries. 
 ''It remains a story about family reunification, but the proportion of women coming to the U.S. who are not married and working full time has gone up substantially,'' Professor Donato said. ''So we see the single migrant woman motivated by economic reasons coming to the United States that we saw very little of 30 years ago.'' 
 Still, the promise of a sweeter future often goes unfulfilled. 
 Ms. Gallardo never made it to Kansas. She never made it beyond the desert. After walking eight hours at night and committing $500 to a coyote, she stumbled down a rocky hill near Tucson and broke her ankle. The coyote left her sitting on a nearby highway in the desert, where the Border Patrol eventually found her, took her to a local emergency room and deported her to Nogales, Mexico, the next day. 
 A Mexican immigrant group, Grupo Beta, took her to a Mexican hospital where she was told she needed surgery on her ankle at a cost of 3,000 pesos, or seven weeks' salary. She also owes the friends who gave the coyote $500. 
 A month and a half earlier, Margarita Ximil Lopez, 20, had her hopes dashed, too. She sat in a dismal holding cell at the United States Border Patrol station in Nogales in October and tried to hide her tears from her son, Edel, who is about to turn 6.
 It was for his sake, she said, that she illegally crossed the border, only to be abandoned by the coyote and picked up at a motel by American immigration officers. Ms. Ximil, from Puebla, a large city southeast of Mexico City, had hoped to join her sister, who had lined up a job for her as a waitress in Los Angeles.
 Here in Arizona, a tide of anti-immigrant sentiment has swelled along with the number of border crossers, some of it directed particularly at women. Many taxpayers say they resent that their tax dollars are being spent to educate these women's children and pay for their delivery costs at local hospitals. 
 Reacting to the surge in illegal border crossings, voters in Arizona passed Proposition 200 in November 2004, which, among other things, requires people applying for some public benefits to show proof of citizenship. 
 The economic reality of illegal immigration is complex. Whether these workers cost taxpayers more than they contribute has been debated for years, factoring in the taxes collected, the unclaimed Social Security funds and the undesirable jobs filled at low wages. 
 Pregnant women who are already in the United States illegally invariably use hospitals to give birth, though statistics are unreliable because emergency room patients are not asked their legal status. Children born in America are automatically granted citizenship, and some critics accuse the mothers of exploiting that guarantee. 
 But advocates for illegal immigrants maintain that the women's reasons for coming here reach far beyond citizenship for their children; few women come to the United States expressly to have babies, collect benefits and visit the emergency room, the advocates say. Jim Hawkins, a Tucson sector Border Patrol agent, said such instances were rare but not unheard of.
 ''I had a woman sit on the south side of the fence until she went into labor, then jumped the fence,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''She was coached well: she immediately asked for an ambulance.'' 
 After she gave birth, the woman was ordered to return to Mexico. Rather than have her baby put up for adoption, Mr. Hawkins said, she took the baby back to Mexico with her. 
 The nation's roiling immigration debate weighs little on the minds of the women who cross here. Nor do the dangers of the crossing itself, which they know routinely include sexual harassment or assault. As the borders have become tighter, the coyotes have become more violent and desperate, law enforcement officials and immigration advocates say. 
 ''These poor aliens are nothing but product to these animals,'' said Mr. Hawkins, adding that many women are raped, robbed and abandoned at the first sign of trouble and are given amphetamines to keep them moving faster at night. 
 Since most women do not come forward to report the crimes -- because they do not speak the language and are illegal, ashamed and scared of deportation -- few hard numbers exist. But there is ample anecdotal information to bolster the claim.
 Maria Jimenez, 29, who is from Oaxaca and came here to work and join her husband, has experienced most of what can go wrong. The first time she crossed into Arizona three years ago, she was told by a coyote to expect a three-hour evening walk across the desert. She packed no water. The journey took two nights and three days, and Ms. Jimenez grew desperately dizzy and disoriented. 
 Then the coyote, an American, tried to sexually assault her and her sister-in-law, she said. ''I told him no,'' Ms. Jimenez said. ''I started to cry.'' He left her alone, but robbed her of the $300 in her pocket. Then just as they neared a highway, the Border Patrol arrested the group.
 She tried again a month later carrying drinks with electrolytes but no money in her pocket. She made it, joining her husband in Tucson, where she got a job at a restaurant and had a baby, Stephanie. A family emergency in Oaxaca forced her to return home last year. But in November, she came back into the country, this time with a group of eight people -- four of them women she met in Nogales. 
 During the trip, Ms. Jimenez slipped and fell, spraining her ankle. She wrapped it in discarded clothes strewn across the desert by other immigrants, and she hobbled on. 
 After a night of walking, they reached the railroad tracks and hopped a freight train to Tucson. Her husband paid the coyote $1,000.
 Ms. Jimenez, her husband and baby now share a house with another family. She found work quickly in a restaurant kitchen for $5.25 an hour, no breaks, no sick days. 
 ''We are all scared when we cross,'' she said. ''But the thought that we can help people back home makes it worth it.''

HEADLINE: Dow Tops 11,000; First Time Since '01

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 11,000 yesterday for the first time since June 2001, pointing to the renewed confidence of investors who have long been waiting for the market to return to one of its more elusive touchstones.
 The gains yesterday also highlight a modest new year's rally that has come amid optimism about corporate earnings and hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon end an 18-month campaign to push interest rates higher.
''Dow 11,000 is just a number,'' said David Bianco, chief United States equity strategist for UBS. ''But as wacky as it is of an index, it does a pretty good job as an indicator.''
 The Dow, which flirted with 11,000 in late November, was pushed over the line yesterday largely by shares of General Motors, which rose nearly 8 percent after receiving a rare bit of positive news: a Goldman, Sachs analyst raised his rating on the stock. The Dow ended the day at 11,011.90, up 52.59 points, or 0.5 percent. 
 The Dow's advance has been building since last Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its December meeting, which signaled to many that the Fed would raise rates just one or two more times in the next few months. 
 ''The catalyst was the Fed minutes,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital in Minneapolis. ''It's not the force that did it; it is the catalyst.''
 The Dow first broke through 11,000 in May 1999. Now, nearly seven years later, those days may seem like a lifetime ago to investors: then, the Internet was the future of all business and a terrorist attack on American soil seemed unthinkable.
 The Dow, a collection of 30 blue-chip stocks selected by Dow Jones & Company, is the longest-running major market index. It is the one most likely to be brought up at a cocktail party or wind up in a newspaper's headline, but it is not the market's broadest or best measure. The small size of the index and the way it weighs individual stocks limits its utility, analysts and academics that study the stock market say.
 Yet, Dow 11,000 remains a powerful symbol for the ordinary investor. 
 ''It is more psychological than anything else,'' said Ralph J. Acampora, a longtime market forecaster who accurately predicted in 1997 that the Dow would reach 10,000 by 1999. ''The average investor is now going to be impressed with the market's new high,'' he added. ''Now that they hear it and see it, that is going to bring new money into the market.'' 
 The Dow's recent trading gains mirror the advances the index made when it first surpassed the 11,000 milestone, on May 3, 1999. Then, as now, it was staid manufacturers, not the glamorous telecommunications and technology stocks, that fed the rally.
 Moreover, in 1999, it took just 24 trading days for the Dow to reach 11,000 after it first closed above 10,000. Before yesterday, the Dow had been hovering above 10,000 for more than 182 trading days. 
 Of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones average, manufacturers like Caterpillar, 3M, Boeing and United Technologies have been the strongest performers since May 1999. Each posted returns in that time of more than 50 percent. The Altria Group, the holding company for Phillip Morris and Kraft foods, led the pack with a return of nearly 110 percent. 
 At the other end, two of the former Baby Bells were among the index's worst performers. Verizon Communications and AT&T, formerly SBC Communications, have each fallen more than 47 percent since May 1999. Merck and General Motors, which is down almost 72 percent, have posted similarly large declines.
 The poor performance of telecommunications and technology stocks in recent years underscores that the market collapse in 2000 involved ''a tech bubble,'' said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
 ''That was what blew and collapsed,'' he said. ''The other part of the market that was never hard hit is still carrying the day.''
 To be sure, the star performer yesterday was the Dow's most troubled member. General Motors accounted for nearly 13 points of the Dow's gain. G.M. shares rose $1.61, or 7.7 percent, to $22.41 -- its biggest gain in seven months. The stock rose after Goldman, Sachs upgraded its rating and said in a report that the company did not appear to be facing imminent bankruptcy.
 The S.& P. 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index, the other two major market gauges, also finished the day up, reflecting investors' growing confidence. The S.& P. 500, a broad measure of the market, advanced 4.70 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 1,290.15. The Nasdaq composite index increased 13.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,318.69, its highest close since February 2001. 
 So far this year, the S.& P. 500 is up 3.35 percent; the Nasdaq composite is up 5.14 percent; and the Dow is up 2.75 percent.
 The price of gold, meanwhile, rose 1.6 percent yesterday, to $548.80 an ounce, its highest closing price in 25 years.
 From 1999 to 2001, the Dow rose above 11,000 on 19 occasions. But during the last 12 months, the Dow has flirted with the 11,000 milestone twice. Each time, analysts said, it could never get the gains to stick because investors lacked confidence in the economic recovery.
 A surge last year led the Dow to close at 10,940.55 in early March, but then it fell nearly 9 percent to a 2005 low of 10,012.36 in mid-April. By late fall, however, the Dow had climbed back to within striking distance of the 11,000 mark. But instead of staging an end-of-year rally, the market fizzled.
 The Dow 11,000 benchmark may obscure a broader market recovery. The Dow is still more than 6 percent off its record of 11,722.98, set on Jan. 14, 2000. At the same time, indexes made up of smaller and mid-cap stocks, like the Russell 2000 and Wilshire 5000, have been much quicker to recover.
 Since June 7, 2001, the last time the Dow Jones industrial average was at 11,000 or above, the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 is up 9.4 percent. The Russell 2000, which closed yesterday at 706.24, is at a record. 
 The S.& P. 500, meanwhile, is slowly clawing its way back. It is still off about 20 percent from its record of 1,527.46, set on March 24, 2000.
 ''It could make it this year, but that is a long way to go,'' Professor Siegel said.
 And the Nasdaq? It remains about 54 percent off its peak level of 5,048.62 during the dot-com boom. The prospects of crossing that benchmark this year? Highly unlikely.
 Following are the results of the three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Growth of National Health Spending Slows Along With Drug Sales 

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The growth of national health spending slowed in 2004, mainly because insurers reined in drug costs so that spending on pharmaceuticals increased at the slowest rate in a decade, the Bush administration said Monday.
 Total health care spending rose 7.9 percent in 2004, to $1.9 trillion, or an average of $6,280 a person, the administration said. That represents 16 percent of the nation's economy, the highest share on record.
Spending on prescription drugs rose 8.2 percent, to $188.5 billion in 2004, the government said. This was the first year of single-digit growth in retail drug sales since 1994. 
 But spending on hospitals and doctors' services surged in 2004, and the nation spent far more on them than on prescription drugs. 
 The 8.6 percent increase in spending for hospital care and the 9 percent increase in payments to doctors were the highest recorded since 1991.
 The new figures do not reflect the cost of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, which took effect this month. Stephen Heffler, a government economist, has previously said that the benefit will have ''only a minor impact on overall health spending,'' but will redistribute costs so the federal government bears a larger share of drug spending.
 Cynthia Smith, an economist at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the slowdown in drug spending resulted from greater use of low-cost generic drugs, in place of brand-name products; increased use of mail-order services to dispense drugs; and ''reduced consumption of certain drugs'' because of safety concerns.
 ''U.S. health care spending grew more slowly in 2004 than in the three previous years,'' Ms. Smith and three colleagues said in a report published in the journal Health Affairs. ''Prescription drug spending has been the strongest factor in the slowdown in recent years.''
 Mark Merritt, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said the new data vindicated the techniques used by members of his organization to manage drug spending. These companies, known as pharmacy benefit managers, include Caremark Rx, Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions. 
 But, Mr. Merritt said, at the federal and state levels, ''lobbyists for brand-name drug makers, chain drugstores, trial lawyers and others are working to undermine many of the tools we have used to reduce the rate of growth in drug spending.'' For example, he said, brand-name drug companies have resisted state laws that encourage the substitution of generic drugs.
 Andrea Hofelich, a spokeswoman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, a trade group, said patients received generic drugs for 53 percent of the prescriptions filled in 2004. But, Ms. Hofelich said, the costs were so much lower that those drugs accounted for only 12 percent of drug spending.
 Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a private group that tracks health costs, said he took little comfort from the new data.
 The latest slowdown must be viewed in context, Mr. Ginsburg said. Health spending grew at abnormally high rates in 2001 and 2002 because consumers forced insurers to relax many restrictions of managed care, like rules requiring patients to get authorization from a primary care doctor before visiting a specialist.
 ''The rate of growth in health spending slowed in 2004, but it's still substantially higher than trends in earnings, which are the key to being able to afford health care,'' Mr. Ginsburg said. ''Health insurance is becoming less affordable to more people.''
 As usual, health spending grew faster than the economy or consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index, a widely used measure of inflation, increased 3.3 percent in 2004.
 The government's annual report on health spending, issued Monday, includes these highlights:
 Spending for hospital care totaled $570.8 billion. Hospital spending by private insurers rose 9.5 percent, while Medicaid spending on hospitals increased 9.9 percent.
 Spending for doctors' services climbed to $399.9 billion in 2004. Medicare spending on doctors rose 11.1 percent, up from an increase of 8.8 percent in 2003. Doctors are performing more services and more complex services, for which they receive higher fees from Medicare.
 Payments to independent home health agencies have been rising more rapidly than any other category of health spending. They increased 11.1 percent in 2003 and 13.3 percent in 2004, to $43.2 billion. Medicare spending for home care shot up 19.3 percent in 2004, partly because of rapid growth in home-based hospice services.
 Spending on care provided by skilled nursing homes rose 4.3 percent in 2004, to $115 billion. Medicaid accounts for 44 percent of that spending. The federal government has restricted the techniques states can use to finance their share of these Medicaid costs. Medicaid spending on nursing homes rose just 3 percent in 2004, compared with an increase of 5.3 percent in 2003.
 Over all, public spending on health care grew faster than private spending in 2004. Medicare spending, for people who are 65 and older or disabled, rose 8.9 percent in 2004, to $309 billion, partly because of a new law that increased payments to health maintenance organizations and rural health care providers.
 By contrast, Medicaid spending grew 7.9 percent in 2004, to $290.9 billion. Efforts to hold down drug costs slowed the growth in Medicaid spending, which was 11 percent in 2002 and almost 9 percent in 2003.

HEADLINE: Chile's Candidates Agree to Agree on Pension Woes

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Michelle Bachelet is a pediatrician and a Socialist, while Sebastian Pinera is a billionaire businessman and a conservative. They may agree on little as the opposing candidates in Chile's election for president, but they concur on one important point: the country's much vaunted and much copied privatized pension system needs immediate repair.
 The Chilean system of personalized accounts managed by private funds has inspired a score of other countries since the pioneer effort to create it here 25 years ago. It is endorsed by President Bush, who has called it ''a great example'' from which the United States can ''take some lessons.'' Here at home, though, dissatisfaction with the system has emerged as one of the hot-button issues in the election, a runoff that will take place on Sunday. 
 ''Most people perceive the costs of pensions and the pensions themselves as unfair,'' said Patricio Navia, a political science professor at New York University and at Diego Portales University here. ''Many of those who started work when the system was first adopted are realizing that they have not been able to contribute enough to get a significant pension,'' Mr. Navia said, adding that they resent ''overhead costs that are so high'' and that have led to record profits for the pension funds that manage contributions automatically deducted from workers' paychecks.
 Ms. Bachelet, the front-runner in the race, has described the pension system as being ''in crisis'' and has vowed to take steps to fix it. Among the ideas being considered in her camp are increasing and expanding the minimum pension, as well as measures to allow individual contributors to ''bundle'' together into larger groups so as to be able to negotiate better terms with pension funds.
 ''There are two big issues, coverage and costs,'' Andres Velasco, Ms. Bachelet's economic adviser, said in an interview here. ''Too many people are outside the system,'' he said, adding that too many of those in the system have found that ''saving via the pension funds is quite expensive.''
 According to a recent study here, Chile's pension funds, whose number has shrunk to 6 from more than 20 as competition has diminished, recorded an average annual profitability of more than 50 percent during a recent five-year period. Other studies, including one conducted by the World Bank, indicate that pension funds retain between a quarter and a third of workers' contributions in the form of commissions, insurance and other administrative fees.
 At the moment, the government pays about 5 percent of gross domestic product, or more than it spends for either health or education, on pensions for the poor, payments into a separate military retirement plan and so-called transition and administrative costs. Supporters of the privatized system argue that the state's burden will diminish as older retirees enrolled in the pay-as-you-go system that prevailed here before 1981 gradually die off.
 But skeptics point to another developing problem: many young people, who should be enrolling in the system early to accrue maximum benefit, are staying out or paying in very little. Some cannot afford to contribute beyond the obligatory minimum payment, which is 10 percent of wages, while others are either self-employed or have been hired by companies as low-paid independent contract workers and therefore do not have to contribute at all.
 ''The bottom line is that this system does not work with this labor market,'' said Andras Uthoff, an economist who is director of the social development division of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America here. If trends continue, he added, ''only a small percentage of people are going to be able to finance meaningful pensions. What happens then to the rest?''
 As a result of such doubts, attacking the pension system and especially the perceived excesses of the funds has become a surefire source of votes. One of the big winners in the first round of the election last month, for example, was Guido Girardi, a senator-elect and Bachelet supporter who has taken upon himself the role of scourge of the private management funds.
 ''I am going to do away with these thieves in jackets and ties,'' Mr. Girardi vowed. ''We are going to defend the citizenry from these funds that rob people of their pensions.''
 But even advocates of an untrammeled free market, like Mr. Pinera, the conservative candidate, are jumping in with criticisms, to the surprise of some here. Mr. Pinera is the brother of Jose Pinera, the former labor minister who imposed the personal account system during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. In addition, Sebastian Pinera is backed by the large business groups that control the pension funds and have benefited from the expansion of investment capital the funds have provided.
 ''Chile's social security system requires deep reforms in all sectors, because half of Chileans have no pension coverage, and of those who do, 40 percent are going to find it hard to reach the minimum level,'' Mr. Pinera said in a televised debate with Ms. Bachelet on Wednesday. ''This has to be confronted now, and we agree with Michelle Bachelet and will, I hope, join forces behind this large undertaking.''
 One of the changes Mr. Pinera has proposed is a guaranteed pension for housewives, which the Bachelet camp dismisses as populist posturing that will add to government expenditures. He also favors financial incentives to the poor, like matching government contributions, to encourage them to participate in the system; more bargaining power for consumers; and increased competition among the funds to force them to bring down their fees.
 ''We don't want to dismantle the system; we just want to improve it,'' said Felipe Larrain, Mr. Pinera's chief economic adviser. But ''pensions are very low,'' he acknowledged, and reform is ''not just an issue of fixing the pension fund management system, because there are also people who cannot get an adequate pension'' based on the contributions they are making.
 Jose Pinera, who is co-chairman of the Project on Social Security Choice at the conservative Cato Institute, based in Washington, did not respond to e-mail requests for an interview to discuss the changes being proposed here. But his Web site reprinted a recent article in the conservative daily newspaper El Mercurio here that criticized the changes proposed by both candidates as ''demagoguery.''
 Officials in the Bachelet campaign said Ms. Bachelet had already decided to appoint a commission to examine the social security system and recommend changes if she is elected. They predicted that legislation to overhaul the system would be presented to Congress within six months of her taking office in March.
 ''It's a big reform, not just patching a few things up,'' Mr. Velasco said. While the rest of the world is still enamored of the original Chilean model, he noted, ''we are moving to a Chile II model, and there is no blueprint for us to follow. We have to create from scratch.''

HEADLINE: F.T.C. and AmeriDebt Founder Settle Credit Counseling Case 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission said on Monday that it had agreed to a settlement with the founder of AmeriDebt, Andris Pukke, in what the agency said was its largest case of deceptive credit counseling. 
 The F.T.C. said the settlement required Mr. Pukke to give up ''virtually all of his assets'' for a consumer redress program that could total as much as $35 million.
The settlement, which is subject to approval by a federal court in Maryland, would permanently bar Mr. Pukke from engaging in credit counseling, debt management and credit card education activities.
 Mr. Pukke did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement. His lawyer, Geoffrey S. Irwin, of the firm of Jones Day, said the $35 million figure was far less than the $172 million that the F.T.C. had sought.
 ''This settlement does not change the fact that Mr. Pukke did nothing wrong here,'' Mr. Irwin said.
 Nonprofit credit-counseling operations help consumers consolidate their debts and negotiate lower interest rates, usually for a nominal fee. While many credit-counseling agencies are legitimate, scam operations are becoming more common, according to the agency.
 In the AmeriDebt case, the F.T.C. said, nearly 300,000 people were deceived about the services they would be provided and the fees they would be charged.
 In a complaint filed in 2003, the F.T.C. charged that while AmeriDebt advertised itself as a charitable enterprise, it funneled profits to affiliated for-profit entities and individuals, including DebtWorks and Mr. Pukke.
 The F.T.C. also said that AmeriDebt did not provide counseling services, but instead enrolled all its customers in a debt management plan. It said AmeriDebt also deceived customers when it claimed that it did not charge an up-front fee.

HEADLINE: Police Pursue Leads in Journalist's Killing 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The District of Columbia police said on Monday that the death of David E. Rosenbaum, a recently retired reporter for The New York Times, was being treated as a homicide even before the city's medical examiner made an official declaration.
 Mr. Rosenbaum, 63, died of head injuries Sunday after being assaulted on Friday night near his home in Northwest Washington as he went for a walk after dinner. The police attributed the death to blunt force trauma to the back of his head. 
As a cascade of personal and professional tributes reached Mr. Rosenbaum's family and colleagues, Capt. C. V. Morris of the Metropolitan Police Department's Violent Crimes Division said that detectives were following up on ''lots of leads'' and that robbery might have been a motive. But he declined to discuss any evidence in the case.
 Captain Morris said the police were searching for two men who witnesses said they saw inside a dark-colored, two-door sedan in the neighborhood several minutes after Mr. Rosenbaum walked by. He said a witness told the police that the license plate included the numbers 516.
 But Captain Morris emphasized that the police had no suspects and that the men in the car were wanted only for questioning. ''They're not suspects,'' he said. ''They may have seen something; they may have heard something. We don't know.''
 Vince Morris, a spokesman for Mayor Anthony A. Williams, said Mr. Williams spoke Monday morning to Mr. Rosenbaum's wife, Virginia, expressing his sympathies. Mr. Morris also said Mr. Williams assured her that ''this is a high-profile case that we are following very closely.'' 
 Tributes to Mr. Rosenbaum, as well as anger over his killing, came from all across Washington on Monday, from the White House to Capitol Hill and offices in between, from sources, competitors and even strangers who knew Mr. Rosenbaum only by reputation.
 Officials of the Bush administration, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and other agencies, as well as members of Congress, expressed their sympathies to colleagues of Mr. Rosenbaum in the Washington bureau of The Times, where he worked for 37 years. 
 Officials from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which Mr. Rosenbaum served as a member of the steering committee, said they were ''shocked and saddened'' by his death.
 On National Public Radio, Cokie Roberts ended a segment on Congressional doings that put the usual work of Washington in perspective.
 ''You hear so many scandals out of Washington that you forget the good parts, people who are here working every day to serve the public and to explain the people who are serving the public, and David absolutely did that,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''He was a reporter who covered Congress, public policy, economic policy, made it clear so that voters could make up their own minds about what the policy should be and who they should support. And he did it very, very well for many decades.''
 The Washington Post, in its Tuesday edition, published an article about the investigation into Mr. Rosenbaum's death and an ''appreciation'' written by Glenn Kessler, who once competed with him on the budget beat. In the Kessler article, another Post reporter, Dale Russakoff, who covered tax reform in the 1980's, recalled his reaction to Mr. Rosenbaum's work. 
 ''I liked him so much and had so much fun chasing information alongside him that I had this bizarre reaction to getting beaten by him on stories: I'd find myself feeling happy for him instead of getting mad,'' Mr. Russakoff said. He added that he adopted the system of organizing notes used by Mr. Rosenbaum, who was known as a mentor to many reporters and editors who worked in Washington. 
 The assault on Mr. Rosenbaum occurred sometime after 9 p.m. on Friday, shortly after he left his house in an area with a relatively low crime rate. The police said he was wearing a headset and possibly did not hear the approach of his attacker.
 Family members said that his wallet was taken, and that a credit card was used on Saturday in Southeast Washington. Mr. Rosenbaum's brother, Marcus D. Rosenbaum, said the police had talked to the credit card company.
 Captain Morris, who was imprecise in much of his accounting of events, said the police got a call by 9:20 or 9:30 p.m. Friday. He said he did not know who called or when officers arrived, but when they reached Mr. Rosenbaum, an ambulance was there. He said there was some initial confusion at the scene because medical personnel could not determine whether Mr. Rosenbaum had fallen or had been a crime victim.
 Captain Morris said similar assaults had occurred recently in upscale neighborhoods like Mr. Rosenbaum's. In those cases, he said, ''all have resulted in arrests or we know who the suspects are.''
 In general, violent crime has been decreasing in Washington, particularly in the Second District, where Mr. Rosenbaum lived. Police records show that none of the city's 195 homicides in 2005 were committed in the Second District.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about an investigation by Washington police into the death of David E. Rosenbaum, a recently retired reporter for The New York Times, referred incorrectly in some copies to one of his competitors at The Washington Post, who praised his work. The reporter, Dale Russakoff, is a woman.

HEADLINE: Legislators Pass Smoking Ban In New Jersey

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES and JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
New Jersey lawmakers approved a far-reaching ban Monday on smoking in indoor public places that includes virtually all of the state's bars and restaurants but not the gambling areas of Atlantic City's 12 casinos.
 The measure passed in the Assembly 64 to 12 with two abstentions after Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, a strong supporter of the ban, beat back an 11th-hour effort to kill it. The Senate passed the bill last month, and Mr. Codey had said he would sign the bill before he leaves office next week. 
New Jersey would become the 11th state with so broad a prohibition; among states in the region, New York and Connecticut passed similar laws in 2003. Four other states restrict smoking in either workplaces or restaurants but do not ban it in all indoor public places.
 The Assembly's vote ended a yearlong battle that pitted batteries of lobbyists for some of the state's most powerful business interests -- including the tobacco industry and groups representing casinos, restaurants and taverns -- against public-health advocacy groups.
 As recently as last spring, the measure had stalled, but then Mr. Codey made the issue a key objective of his final months in office and overcame a major obstacle by negotiating the exemption for casinos. Until Mr. Codey's concession, South Jersey legislators and their allies were poised to block the bill because of the effect it was expected to have on casino business.
 Over the weekend, Mr. Codey managed to deter a final effort to defeat the ban by making telephone calls to several lawmakers who opposed it. ''The way to do things in life is with the personal touch,'' he said, adding that the bill would be a hallmark of his 17 months in office.
 One by one, supporters of the ban stood in the Assembly on Monday and dismissed concerns about the casino exemption as disingenuous.
 Assemblyman Bill Baroni, a Republican from Mercer County, said, ''This is the day New Jersey takes on and defeats Joe Camel,'' a reference to the cartoon character that was formerly used in Camel cigarette ads. ''It's about time.''
 Other supporters acknowledged that they were unhappy about the casino exemption but said the concerns about public health in the state demanded action. ''I could stand here and say, 'It's half a loaf, it's three-quarters of a loaf,' but it's a start,'' said Assemblyman David W. Wolfe, a Republican from Ocean County.
 In addition to restricting where cigarettes can be smoked, the Assembly approved a second measure to raise the minimum age to buy them to 19 from 18. The two measures were the highlights of a busy final day of the legislative session.
 Measures expanding the rights of domestic partners and imposing a yearlong moratorium on the death penalty were also approved and sent to Mr. Codey, who has promised to sign them. The Assembly declined to take up another of Mr. Codey's priorities, a bill that would have provided $230 million for a stem cell research facility. 
 Senator Shirley K. Turner, a Democrat from Mercer County, said she would sponsor legislation in the next session to overturn the casino exemption. 
 Many businesses owners, particularly those in Atlantic City, have said they are concerned about losing customers because of the ban. Some opponents of the ban sought to weaken its chances by arguing that it should apply to the casinos. 
 Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, a Democrat who represents Union County and whose family owns Cryan's Pub in South Orange, was one of those leading an effort to weaken the bill's chances by making it stronger. He had said he was considering offering an amendment that would have subjected casinos to the smoking ban, but it never materialized on Monday when the ban was presented for a vote in the Assembly. 
 Instead, Mr. Cryan took the floor to say why he would not support the measure. ''It sticks to my craw to no end that the casino exemption is there,'' he said. 
 Mr. Cryan said imposing the ban would eliminate more than 20,000 cigarette sales locations in bars and restaurants, costing the state some of the $540 million generated by the cigarette tax.
 He also said that New Jersey was giving up a competitive edge it had held among smokers since similar bans had been enacted in New York. ''It's just good business sense, something we should be encouraging, not discouraging,'' Mr. Cryan said.
 Tom Schmierer, vice chairman of the New Jersey Restaurant Association, said that because nearly two-thirds of the state's restaurants were already smoke-free, a ban was largely unnecessary. 
 ''So this has already been dealt with for years by us, and it's been fixed to an extent,'' he said, adding that the ban was ''a solution in search of a problem.''
 The exemption for casinos was inherently unfair, Mr. Schmierer said, because it leaves smaller businesses vulnerable to losing customers. Supporters of the proposal said studies in New York and elsewhere showed that business had not been seriously affected by the imposition of a smoking ban.
 ''This does not cause serious economic damage,'' said Peter Slocum, a vice president for advocacy at the American Cancer Society, citing studies of similar bans in places like California and Delaware. ''Yes, some bars go out of business. Some flourish. In Buffalo, one guy said, 'I give up, I can't get a waiver. I'm closing down.' Somebody else bought the bar and they're flourishing.''
 Mr. Slocum attributed the bill's passage to the support of Mr. Codey and increased scientific evidence about the dangers of second-hand smoke, which supporters of the ban said leads to as many as 1,000 deaths in New Jersey each year. 
 ''The science is undisputed,'' he said. ''I think everybody is settled that the exposure is hazardous. The question is how to reduce it. In this case we have a chance to take an effective action. It's one of those examples where government can actually take a step that does pretty dramatically improve people's health.''

HEADLINE: On the Bright Side, Coffee Will Never Get Cold

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
After global warming the disaster film (''The Day After Tomorrow'') and global warming the comedy special (''Earth to America''), the next step was probably inevitable: global warming the coffee mug. 
 The mug is decorated with, naturally, a heat-sensitive world map. When it's filled with a steaming beverage, the shorelines retreat, reflecting an extreme version of what scientists say will happen as melting ice and warming water raise sea levels.
Groups with different views on warming have come up with similarly quirky tools to spread their views. In December, the National Center for Public Policy Research distributed rolls of toilet paper at climate-treaty talks in Montreal printed with the phrase ''emissions credit'' in five languages -- reflecting what it claimed is the value of such credits, which are earned by cutting greenhouse gases linked to warming.
 The online pitch by the mug's purveyor, a Brooklyn-based novelty company called the Unemployed Philosophers Guild, is a bit bleak: ''Have you wondered what the world would look like after the polar ice caps melt? Now see it over a cup of coffee.''
 Nonetheless, it's been selling briskly, with about 25,000 bought last year, said David Shaw, who designed the mug and runs the company with his brother, Stephan, the unemployed philosopher who started the business in the early 1990's.
 They've received a few requests for corrections, like an e-mail message that came in last Thursday noting that the Aral Sea would never fill up because its elevation is far too high. 
 ''We said we'll try to adjust it in a few places,'' Mr. Shaw said. ANDREW C. REVKIN

HEADLINE: Waging a War We Could Be Proud Of

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: PUTTALAM, Sri Lanka 

 BODY:
One of the lessons of the tsunami a year ago is that however stingy we Americans have been in giving foreign aid, we want to do better.
For every $100 of national income, the U.S. gives 17 cents in overseas development assistance -- a lower percentage than any donor country except Italy. But after the tsunami, Americans responded with a wave of stunning generosity, and there is growing bipartisan support for helping poor countries.
 It's an opportunity that President Bush should seize, by working with Tony Blair and Kofi Annan to wage a Global War on Poverty. 
 President Bush could help revive his floundering presidency by providing moral leadership to the world. He has taken half-steps in this direction, with his landmark programs against AIDS in Africa and against sex trafficking, but his overall efforts against global poverty have been grudging. It's sad when we must rely on a compassionate rock star, Bono, or a generous computer geek, Bill Gates, for moral vision on poverty -- instead of on our president.
 If the tsunami demonstrated how generous Americans could be, it also showed the blindness of a system that responds to natural disasters but neglects ongoing suffering. For example, here in the northwestern Sri Lankan town of Puttalam, people might be better off if the tsunami had reached this far and sucked a few victims out to sea.
 That's because people in this area have been sitting in shantytowns for 15 years after being displaced by civil war, yet they have never gotten half the help that has gone to tsunami victims. Unicef showed me around a hospital where a 13-year-old boy, Abdul Quadar, is so malnourished that he stands just 3 feet 9 inches tall and weighs just 26 pounds. The average 1-year-old American boy weighs that much.
 Abdul Quadar is smart and ranks 19th out of 50 in his school class, but he is just about starving to death. 
 Perhaps the malnutrition results from neglect (he's one of 10 children), or perhaps from some underlying disease like tuberculosis or AIDS. But the hospital says this is the first time that a doctor has seen him.
 If we are to help kids like Abdul Quadar, we can't wait for tsunamis. We need a War on Global Poverty, and I suggest that it focus on three elements that might capture public imagination and support.
 Wiping out malaria -- Each year, malaria kills about two million people, many of them children, and it helps stifle economic growth in Africa. Yet demonstration programs have shown us how to control it: with treated bed nets and low-level DDT spraying, coupled with cheap medicines. It's a disgrace that we let two million people a year die unnecessarily.
 Cutting maternal mortality in half -- Every year, more than half a million women die in pregnancy and childbirth, and many more suffer injuries like fistulas. Countries like Honduras and Sri Lanka have shown us how to cut maternal deaths -- what is lacking is simply the will to do it.
 Educating girls -- If women are literate, they hold better jobs and have fewer, healthier children. They also learn how to complain about injustice (my next column, on Sunday, will tell of an educated Indian woman who has become a champion complainer). 
 Some fine groups already tackle these problems. TamTam Africa fights malaria. Averting Maternal Death and Disability saves mothers. The World Food Program and Unicef run a terrific school feeding program that keeps girls in class. But these are a drop of water in an ocean of need. 
 To be sure, the real solution to poverty isn't cash handouts, but economic growth. What distinguishes the African countries that are doing well, like Botswana or Rwanda or Mauritius or Mozambique, is good governance, which promotes growth. That's why it's also crucial to encourage African leaders to nurture markets, trade and investment -- and to push out thugs like Robert Mugabe. 
 If President Bush took on global poverty in a major way, I think the American people would sign on enthusiastically. And Laura Bush, who has shown an interest in women in the developing world, could greatly assist. Just as John Kennedy bolstered America's image in the world when he started the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress, we could restore luster to our reputation around the globe.
 What we need is leadership. Mr. Bush would do wonders for his legacy -- and, above all, wonders for the poor -- if he'd summon the moral vision to launch a high-profile Global War on Poverty. That is one American-backed war that nearly all the world would thunderously applaud.

HEADLINE: In Style or Grungy Lofts, Dance Creates Its Future 

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
In the supposedly impoverished world of New York dance, where honorable artists are driven out of town or to the outermost outer boroughs or into the arms of academia, where choreographers can't pay the rent and creative energies have reportedly shifted to Europe, we find ourselves in the midst of an almost pharaonic building boom.
 Most of the action is in Midtown, a lot of it on West 55th Street (creating a counterpart to the dance axis on West 19th Street, with the recently rebuilt Dance Theater Workshop, the Joyce Theater and the Kitchen). 
The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater has a striking, lavishly appointed new building at 55th Street and Ninth Avenue. Trisha Brown now works in new studios farther west on 55th Street. The Baryshnikov Arts Center is 18 blocks south. Nancy Walton Laurie, a Wal-Mart heiress, has opened a new building for her Cedar Lake Ensemble on West 26th Street.
 The Rose Theater of Jazz at Lincoln Center in the Time-Warner Building at Columbus Circle is showing more and more dance, mostly courtesy of Great Performers at Lincoln Center and the Lincoln Center Festival. The City Center, having just joined forces with Carnegie Hall, plans a major renovation.
 Despite faltering plans for a cultural focus at ground zero, downtown has hardly been forgotten. Dance New Amsterdam is planning a new space on lower Broadway, and Dixon Place, which does a lot of dance, is to inaugurate a new space on Chrystie Street in April.
 Across the East River, the gleaming Mark Morris Dance Center in Brooklyn, which made such a splash when it opened in 2001, has just announced an expansion. Harvey Lichtenstein's neighborhood redevelopment project around the Brooklyn Academy of Music is always percolating with ideas for more cultural structures. Smaller dance and arts centers seem to flicker in and out of life all over Brooklyn all the time.
 Every one of these cases is different. Some involve single patrons; others result from long-term planning and concerted fund-raising. Some of the performing-arts organizations within these structures are struggling; others are decently grounded; still others receive grants from the building owners, as with Mikhail Baryshnikov's center.
 All owe much to the economic upswing of recent years; when the market is flush, donors feel more comfortable springing for major contributions. Sometimes, of course, those contributions are pledges that don't pan out when the market takes a dive: witness Alberto Vilar's well-documented troubles.
 Mention of Mr. Vilar reminds us that while the dance explosion seems particularly striking, it is hardly happening in isolation. Lincoln Center finally seems about ready to break ground on its long-delayed renovation, and new museums or museum expansions are constantly in the news.
 One can fret. Sometimes buildings go up without anything left to support their intended purposes. Fifteen years ago in Paris, the bustling American Center sold its venerable quarters on the Boulevard Raspail and commissioned Frank Gehry to construct a typically flashy new center in east Paris, along the Seine near the new Bibliotheque Nationale. But the board spent all its money on the building, had to abandon it and eventually sold it to the French government, which has turned it into a film center.
 Most boards are smart enough to avoid that fate. The Ailey company, for instance, spent $54 million on its new building but has an endowment drive of $21 million and counting as well.
 Still, for most high-rolling donors, contributing to annual operations seems less glamorous than a shiny new structure with their name on it. ''Naming opportunities'' are a big lure in fund-raising, and it's hard to name a gift meant to shore up an annual deficit. That's why the recent gift of $25 million to the Metropolitan Opera by Mercedes and Sid R. Bass was so unusual. It was an outright gift, not a pledge. It was unrestricted; the company can use it for purposes glamorous (new productions) and less glamorous, like balancing the annual books. And it seems to have come with no expectation of having something named Bass, though that may still happen.
 With financial power can come a yearning for artistic control, which is hard to resist. Sybil Harrington gave millions to the Met Opera but expected conservative productions in return. Mr. Vilar was not shy about making his artistic feelings known, and neither is Robert W. Wilson, the City Opera patron, however much they may think of themselves as hands off.
 Buildings can be envisaged as a permanent mausoleum for one's largess. Deyan Sudjic's new book, ''The Edifice Complex,'' documents 20th-century architectural grandiosity, from dictators to merely rich people, and the complementary ego of the architects they hire. In dance, at least, no one has complained that the architecture overshadows the dancing, though there are constant criticisms that overbearing museums and galleries dwarf the art inside them.
 People often prefer, out of nervousness or fear, to build buildings rather than directly support a company, let alone some individual dancer. Encouraged by the ever-timid National Endowment for the Arts, which has given up the business of supporting artists out of a concern that they might do something nasty, patrons opt for marble and steel over men and women. They can have a say in the design, and they don't have to worry about controversy.
 Does that mean that all the new dance buildings around town are a liability, a curse in disguise? Will their proud magnificence stifle the innovation and creativity they were meant to foster?
 I don't think so. Creativity will out, no matter what the circumstances. It can flourish in grand institutions (like the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg a century ago) and in the humblest outer-borough lofts. Even with poverty-level wages and no job security, what's wrong with having a nice place to work in?
 Patrons shouldn't forget their obligation to support companies and artists. But their buildings remain a welcome addition to the supposedly struggling New York scene, and a welcome corrective to our sometimes despairing image of it.

HEADLINE: All-News Channels Abroad Look to Their Future in English

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The competition stares dead straight into Ulysse Gosset's eyes every moment he sits at his cluttered desk at temporary headquarters near the Seine. Three yards away flickers a television tuned to CNN, which 25 years ago created a powerful genre with a 24-hour all-news network that now reaches more than two billion people. 
 For many countries, such global power is as tantalizing as new oil wells, inspiring fresh competition from India to Russia and Qatar to France, where all-news channels are emerging with different perspectives. But to sway the world, the messengers have settled on a lingua franca: English. Mr. Gosset, who is helping to lead a project to create an all-news French channel this year, is unabashed about why its breaking headlines will be delivered in French and English.
 ''Today news channels are part of the global battle in the world,'' he said. ''It's as important as traditional diplomacy and economic strength. If we have a real desire to communicate around the world, we need to do it with the right medium, and that's English.'' 
 The hotly debated French project, which is scheduled to start by December with 75 million euros ($91 million) in government funds, is one of several all-news channels that are rushing headlong to television screens and Web sites this year. Veteran television executives say the burst of all-news channels has been ignited by two critical forces: the falling cost of technology and television's power in the international marketplace.
 ''Many communities want to have their voice in the global conversation,'' said Richard Sambrook, director of the BBC's World Service and global news division. In the spring, Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based bane of the Bush administration, plans to roll out its English version. A Kremlin-financed news channel in English, Russia Today, began broadcasting last month despite hacker attacks that briefly shut it down. 
 In India, a country of 15 official languages where English is deemed an ''associate'' tongue, urban television viewers will soon become the focus of an old-fashioned media war in English. One competitor is The Times of India, which in October announced an alliance with Reuters to start an all-news channel in English. 
 Two months later, a rival with a familiar brand name slipped quickly onto India's cable and satellite channels. That new channel, CNN IBN, is a partnership forged in October between CNN and the Indian broadcaster IBN. CNN IBN began broadcasting with little fanfare, but quickly sought to make a name for itself with investigative reports about government corruption and juicy tales of the local movie industry, like the recent report: ''Big Boys, Smuggled Toys: How Bollywood Uses Illegally Imported Cars.'' 
 The Times of India's Times Now is playing catch-up this month with a mix of news and weekend features, like a show called ''The Foodie'' and a business program, ''Brand Equity,'' that are aimed at Indian urbanites. Sunil Lulla, chief executive of Times Now, said his company had chosen English for its channel because it is the language of business and metropolitan India. 
 ''We believe,'' he said, ''that over the years to come, with a growing economy, a young consumer market, and as India gets more connected to the world, more people will be looking at news as a business tool.'' 
 For the record, CNN executives say they welcome new competition. ''We're the pioneers of the 24-hour news business,'' said Claudia Coles, a CNN International spokeswoman in London. ''Our view is that it further establishes the importance of the media and challenges us to do better.''
 But many all-news newcomers are drawing more inspiration from Al Jazeera, which they say has created an influential global voice for Arabs that was missing until the channel appeared. While the channel, started in 1996 and financed by the emir of Qatar, says it will begin broadcasting an English version in the spring, so far it has not announced any distribution deals with satellite or cable operators to carry the channel. Charlotte Dent, an Al Jazeera spokeswoman, would not comment on whether any alliances had been struck. 
 Using Al Jazeera as a model, a group of investors and supporters met in Nairobi last month to plan the creation of a pan-African channel in French and English. They are now developing a business plan and have received commitments from some cable and satellite operators to carry a new channel, said Salim Amin, who is leading the effort and is chief executive of Camerapix, a television production and photography company in Nairobi and London. 
 ''We're not looking at Al Jazeera for their contents or their controversial nature,'' Mr. Amin said. ''We're looking at them because they started as a very small set-up. We don't have a network or media that enable us to talk to each other and to send the message out to the rest of the world. All we see on the international networks about Africa is very negative: famine, war, disease, death, H.I.V. There are positive things happening here that never get highlighted.'' 
 Kenneth Tiven, a former CNN executive and a consultant who is advising the African group, said the falling price of new technology had opened the way for smaller countries with fewer resources to start news channels with high ambitions. 
 ''Today if you have a Mac laptop, just about everything you want to do is in that laptop,'' he said. ''You feed your video into the computer. You edit your video and you output it back to a videotape or a network server. That's about 3,000 euros versus what would have been roughly 80,000 euros in the past.'' With low-cost technology, the African group maintains it can start an all-news channel with a $20 million budget, possibly by March 2007. That is far less than the $91 million that the French project will get for its seed money, and the French channel is also drawing on the journalism resources of the country's public broadcasters. 
 Mr. Gosset, who is seeking permanent offices to move out of current quarters at France Televisions, said it was not expected to make a profit, but advertising would be needed to defray some costs. ''We know it is very difficult for any international news channel to make money from advertisements,'' he said, ''but we think there is a real possibility to sell some advertising. It's a complement.'' 
 Deutsche Welle, Germany's all-news broadcaster to the world, has some experience in that area. Since 1992 it has been producing a bilingual German and English news program that switches segments hourly in the two languages. Last year it started providing the same programming in Arabic. 
 ''Every single one of us has difficulties trying to sell advertisements,'' said Cristoph Lanz, managing director of Deutsche Welle. ''There is no global advertising or commercial market. There are only a handful of really global companies, and even some German companies like Siemens are not selling themselves as German companies.'' 
 But after 13 years of delivering news in English as a second language, the channel's management is satisfied with the results. During big news events like the outbreak of the Iraq war, American viewers turned increasingly to the program for another perspective, Mr. Lanz said, and even sent letters and e-mail messages.
 ''There are more viewers watching it in the English language than German,'' he said. ''And that doesn't have to do with a small amount of Germans watching. It just has to do with the fact that the world is six billion people and there are just 80 million Germans and thereare maybe 150 million German speakers. If you have a mission statement to reach out to the world, then you have to reach across the language gap.'' 
 With an annual budget of 69 million euros ($109 million) and a viewership of about 29 million weekly, Deutsche Welle is chasing what the French, the Russians, the Africans and the Indians are also yearning for. Their target viewers are what Deutsche Welle calls ''opinion leaders and the information elite.'' 
 The French are actually even more precise, illustrating why they want a big megaphone. In the first stage of the new channel, they will work to make it accessible in New York, the home of the United Nations, and in Washington, the base for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Commission to Seek Overhaul of Schools and Transit

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The commission devising a blueprint to reconstruct the city will propose on Wednesday a complete reorganization of the troubled school system, the elimination of a 76-mile shipping channel that was a prime cause of flooding after Hurricane Katrina and the creation of a new jazz district downtown. 
 The commission report, several members said, will also advocate building a 53-mile light-rail system crisscrossing the city, connecting neighborhoods with the airport, downtown and other commercial centers. That system would be in addition to a separate heavy-rail system that would link New Orleans with Baton Rouge and the rest of the Gulf Coast.
 The light-rail system, estimated to cost $3 billion, is intended to help spark redevelopment in areas of the city that were flooded. 
 Toward that end, the plan calls on the city to enlist developers to build at least four communities of 1,000 or more houses at stops along the proposed light-rail lines. 
 The jazz district would be in the old Storyville section, north of the French Quarter, an idea championed by the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, a member of the commission and the co-chairman of its culture committee. 
 The recommendations are among dozens in a sweeping seven-part report to be announced beginning on Wednesday by the Bring Back New Orleans Commission. Mayor C. Ray Nagin established the panel in September to plan the rebuilding.
 Because the state and federal governments will have large voices in the process, many proposals may run into opposition, but the plan represents the city's first comprehensive effort to put itself back together.
 The most controversial proposal, reported on Sunday by The New York Times, would have allowed residents to return soon to all sections of the city but within a year would close those neighborhoods that did not achieve a critical mass of residents. A leader of the commission, Joseph C. Canizaro, said Tuesday that members had modified that proposal over the last two days and now believed that no one should be allowed back into the most damaged neighborhoods until June. 
 City services will probably be more readily available then, Mr. Canizaro said, and the extra time will allow the city to identify who wants to return and set up planning teams for each neighborhood.
 ''My concern,'' he said, ''is for people who have the money and we let fix up a place and then they find themselves sitting all by themselves without any neighbors around.'' 
 By Aug. 20, under the plan, the city should begin the neighborhood reconstruction and should begin acquiring property for public projects like expanding parks. Some low-lying neighborhoods may become parks or marshland if they do not attract enough housing development. 
 One measure of whether a neighborhood will succeed will be whether it has enough residents to justify a high school and two primary schools.
 An essential element, Mr. Canizaro said, is forming the Crescent City Recovery Corporation, through which federal funds would flow. The corporation would have the power to buy and sell property for redevelopment, including the use of eminent domain, and could issue bonds. 
 Board members of the recovery corporation, to number seven to 15 under the plan, would be appointed by the president, the governor, the mayor and the City Council. 
 ''If we don't get a reconstruction authority in place right away, we won't have a chance with implementation,'' Mr. Canizaro said. 
 To create such an agency, however, the city needs to amend its charter, he and others said. 
 As of midday on Tuesday, members of the commission and city workers were frantically cobbling together the components of a plan remarkable for breadth and scope. The commission was created to draw up a master plan to remake a city that suffered what was widely described as the worst urban disaster in the country's history.
 The floodwater that covered 80 percent of the city caused half its houses to sit in four feet or more of foul, murky water for weeks, according to a draft of the final report, and it destroyed much of the public works in the city.
 The commission has missed the Dec. 31 deadline that Mr. Nagin imposed. Members said releasing an overview of its plans this week should give the White House time to digest a blueprint certain to cost billions in federal dollars before President Bush delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 20.
 That assumes that Mr. Nagin formally adopts the commission's recommendations.
 Some proposals like the light-rail system have been floated for years and are likely to be greeted with skepticism in Washington.
 ''We might be a little bit late, but we've tried to make this an inclusive process, and we've all been doing the best we can,'' the co-chairwoman of the commission, Barbara Major, said. ''I'm always conscious of the fact that everybody that sits on that commission is also struggling to put their life back together.'' 
 Ms. Major has been living in temporary housing in Texas since the storm, a five-hour drive from New Orleans.
 The commission early on created seven committees led by commission members with scores of volunteers as staff members. The seven areas are urban planning, education, culture, health and social services, infrastructure, government effectiveness and economic development. 
 Each will present the details of its plan over the next 10 days. 
 ''There was a time I didn't know if this process would work, but it has,'' W. Anthony Patton, a member of the commission, said. ''I'm feeling very good about things.'' 
 To improve a school system that has long ranked as one of the worst in the nation, the commission has endorsed a plan that breaks the district into clusters of 8 to 14 schools that will function as semiautonomous units, said Scott S. Cowen, chairman of the commission's education committee and president of Tulane University. 
 Before the hurricane, the district operated about 120 schools. 
 The networks of schools would have the freedom to determine everything from the length of school days to critical curriculum choices and teachers.
 Now that public and private schools are beginning to reopen, a lack of livable housing is the main impediment to people returning. The commission will call on the city to return quickly to the market the thousands of blighted houses in a legal limbo because of tax and ownership problems. 
 The federal government will be asked to pay the $12 billion cost of compensating homeowners who lost their houses.
 By rehabilitating abandoned houses in sections with little or no flooding or demolishing them and building anew, the commission estimates that the city could house an additional 37,000 people. 
 The plan calls on the authorities to close the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, a shortcut from the river to the coast that slices through a corner of the city. Known as Mr. Go, the byway cost $92 million to construct and was heralded as a critical economic driver when it opened to great fanfare in the 1960's. 
 It was also a major source of the water that flooded the eastern, predominantly black half of New Orleans when the storm surge roared up from the Gulf Coast. 
 Officials at the Port of New Orleans have defended the byway as a critical segment of the regional shipping industry. But local officials have reached a consensus that it should be closed. For years, it has been little used, and it serves as a conduit for destructive saltwater into freshwater wetlands.
 ''There are no easy decisions here,'' Ms. Major said. ''So whatever decisions are made, I can guarantee there will be some people who are unhappy.''

HEADLINE: In the Treatment of Diabetes, Success Often Does Not Pay

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
With much optimism, Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan opened its new diabetes center in March 1999. Miss America, Nicole Johnson Baker, herself a diabetic, showed up for promotional pictures, wearing her insulin pump.
 In one photo, she posed with a man dressed as a giant foot -- a comical if dark reminder of the roughly 2,000 largely avoidable diabetes-related amputations in New York City each year. Doctors, alarmed by the cost and rapid growth of the disease, were getting serious.
 At four hospitals across the city, they set up centers that featured a new model of treatment. They would be boot camps for diabetics, who struggle daily to reduce the sugar levels in their blood. The centers would teach them to check those levels, count calories and exercise with discipline, while undergoing prolonged monitoring by teams of specialists. 
 But seven years later, even as the number of New Yorkers with Type 2 diabetes has nearly doubled, three of the four centers, including Beth Israel's, have closed. 
 They did not shut down because they had failed their patients. They closed because they had failed to make money. They were victims of the byzantine world of American health care, in which the real profit is made not by controlling chronic diseases like diabetes but by treating their many complications.
 Insurers, for example, will often refuse to pay $150 for a diabetic to see a podiatrist, who can help prevent foot ailments associated with the disease. Nearly all of them, though, cover amputations, which typically cost more than $30,000.
 Patients have trouble securing a reimbursement for a $75 visit to the nutritionist who counsels them on controlling their diabetes. Insurers do not balk, however, at paying $315 for a single session of dialysis, which treats one of the disease's serious complications.
 Not surprising, as the epidemic of Type 2 diabetes has grown, more than 100 dialysis centers have opened in the city.
 ''It's almost as though the system encourages people to get sick and then people get paid to treat them,'' said Dr. Matthew E. Fink, a former president of Beth Israel.
 Ten months after the hospital's center was founded, it had hemorrhaged more than $1.1 million. And the hospital gave its director, Dr. Gerald Bernstein, three and a half months to direct its patients elsewhere. 
 The center's demise, its founders and other experts say, is evidence of a medical system so focused on acute illnesses that it is struggling to respond to diabetes, a chronic disease that looms as the largest health crisis facing the city.
 America's high-tech, pharmaceutical-driven system may excel at treating serious short-term illnesses like coronary blockages, experts say, but it is flailing when it comes to Type 2 diabetes, a condition that builds over time and cannot be solved by surgery or a few weeks of taking pills. 
 Type 2 , the subject of this series, has been linked to obesity and inactivity, as well as to heredity. (Type 1, which comprises only 5 percent to 10 percent of cases, is not associated with behavior, and is believed to stem almost entirely from genetic factors.) 
 Instead of receiving comprehensive treatment, New York's Type 2 diabetics often suffer under substandard care.
 They do not test their blood as often as they should because they cannot afford the equipment. Patients wait months to see endocrinologists -- who provide critical diabetes care -- because lower pay has drawn too few doctors to the specialty. And insurers limit diabetes benefits for fear they will draw the sickest, most expensive patients to their rolls.
 Dr. Diana K. Berger, who directs the diabetes prevention program for the City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the bias against effective care for chronic illnesses could be seen in the new popularity of another high-profit quick fix: bariatric surgery, which shrinks stomach size and has been shown to be effective at helping to control diabetes. 
 ''If a hospital charges, and can get reimbursed by insurance, $50,000 for a bariatric surgery that takes just 40 minutes,'' she said, ''or it can get reimbursed $20 for the same amount of time spent with a nutritionist, where do you think priorities will be?'' 

Back in the Pantsuit
 Calorie by calorie, the staff of Beth Israel's center tried to turn diabetic lives around from their base of operations: a classroom and three adjoining offices on the seventh floor of Fierman Hall, a hospital building on East 17th Street.
 The stark, white-walled classroom did not look like much. But it was functional and clean and several times a week, a dozen or so people would crowd around a rectangular table that was meant for eight, listening attentively, staff members said.
 Claudia Slavin, the center's dietitian, remembers asking the patients to stand, one by one.
 ''Tell me what your waking blood sugar was,'' she told them, ''and then try to explain why it is high or low.''
 People whose sugars soar damage themselves irreparably, even if the consequences are not felt for 10 or 20 years. Unchecked, diabetes can lead to kidney failure, blindness, heart disease, amputations -- a challenging slate for any single physician with a busy caseload to manage. 
 One patient, Ella M. Hammond, a retired school administrator, recalled standing up in the classroom one day in 1999.
 ''Has anyone noticed what's different about me?'' Ms. Hammond asked. 
 Blank stares.
 ''Now, come on,'' she said, ruffling the fabric of a black gabardine pantsuit she had not worn since slimmer days, years earlier. 
 ''Don't y'all notice 20 pounds when it goes away?'' she asked.
 Ms. Slavin, one of four full-time staff members who worked at the center, remembers laughing. There were worse reasons for an interruption than a success story. 
 Like many Type 2 diabetics, Ms. Hammond had been warned repeatedly by her primary care doctor that her weight was too high, her lifestyle too inactive and her diet too rich. And then she had been shown the door, until her next appointment a year later. 
 ''The center was a totally different experience,'' Ms. Hammond said. ''What they did worked because they taught me how to deal with the disease, and then they forced me to do it.''
 Two hours a day, twice a week for five weeks, Ms. Hammond learned how to manage her disease. How the pancreas works to create insulin, a hormone needed to process sugar. Why it is important to leave four hours between meals so insulin can finish breaking down the sugar. She counted the grams of carbohydrates in a bag of Ruffles salt and vinegar potato chips, her favorite, and traded vegetarian recipes. 
 After ignoring her condition for 20 years, Ms. Hammond, 63, began to ride a bicycle twice a week and mastered a special sauce, ''more garlic than butter,'' that made asparagus palatable. 
 She also learned how to decipher the reading on her A1c test, a periodic blood-sugar measurement that is a crucial yardstick of whether a person's diabetes is under control.
 ''I was just happy to finally know what that number really meant,'' she said. 
 Many doctors who treat diabetics say they have long been frustrated because they feel they are struggling single-handedly to reverse a disease with the gale force of popular culture behind it.
 Type 2 diabetes grows hand in glove with obesity, and America is becoming fatter. Undoubtedly, many of these diabetics are often their own worst enemies. Some do not exercise. Others view salad as a foreign substance and, like smokers, often see complications as a distant threat.
 To fix Type 2 diabetes, experts agree, you have to fix people. Change lifestyles. Adjust thinking. Get diabetics to give up sweets and prick their fingers to test their blood several times a day.
 It is a tall order for the primary care doctors who are the sole health care providers for 90 percent of diabetics.
 Too tall, many doctors say. When office visits typically last as little as eight minutes, doctors say there is no time to retool patients so they can adopt an entirely new approach to food and life.
 ''Think of it this way,'' said Dr. Berger. ''An average person spends less than .03 percent of their entire life meeting with a clinician. The rest of the time they're being bombarded with all the societal influences that make this disease so common.''
 As a result, primary care doctors often have a fatalistic attitude about controlling the disease. They monitor patients less closely than specialists, studies show.
 For those under specialty care, there is often little coordination of treatment, and patients end up Ping-Ponging between their appointments with little sense of their prognosis or of how to take control of their condition.
 Consequently, ignorance prevails. Of 12,000 obese people in a 1999 federal study, more than half said they were never told to curb their weight.
 Fewer than 40 percent of those with newly diagnosed diabetes receive any follow-up, according to another study. In New York City, officials say, nearly 9 out of 10 diabetics do not know their A1c scores, that most fundamental of statistics.
 In fact, without symptoms or pain, most Type 2 diabetics find it hard to believe they are truly sick until it is too late to avoid the complications that can overwhelm them. The city comptroller recently found that even in neighborhoods with accessible and adequate health care, most diabetics suffer serious complications that could have been prevented.
 This grim reality persuaded hospital officials in the 1990's to try something different. The new centers would provide the tricks for changing behavior and the methods of tracking complications that were lacking from most care. 
 Instead of having rushed conversations with harried primary care physicians, patients would discuss their weights and habits for months with a team of diabetes educators, and have their conditions tracked by a panel of endocrinologists, ophthalmologists and podiatrists. 
 ''The entire country was watching,'' said Dr. Bernstein, director of the Beth Israel center, who was then president of the American Diabetes Association.
 By all apparent measures, the aggressive strategy worked. Five months into the program, more than 60 percent of the center's patients who were tested had their blood sugar under control. Close to half the patients who were measured had already lost weight. Competing hospitals directed patients to the program. 
 ''For the first time in my 23 years of diabetes work I felt like we had momentum,'' said Jane Seley, the center's nurse practitioner. ''And it wasn't backwards momentum.''

Failure for Profit
 From the outset, everyone knew diabetes centers were financially risky ventures. That is why Beth Israel took a distinctive approach before sinking $1.5 million into its plan. 
 Instead of being top-heavy with endocrinologists, who are expensive specialists, Beth Israel relied more on nutritionists and diabetes educators with lower salaries, said Dr. Fink, the hospital's former president. 
 The other centers that opened took similar precautions. 
 The St. Luke's-Joslin diabetes center, on the Upper West Side, tried lowering doctors' salaries, hiring dietitians only part time and being aggressive about getting reimbursed by insurers, said Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, who ran the center. 
 Mount Sinai Hospital's diabetes center hired an accounting firm to calculate just how many bypass surgeries, kidney transplants and other profitable procedures the center would have to send to the hospital to offset the cost of keeping the center running, said Dr. Andrew Drexler, the center's director.
 Nonetheless, both of these centers closed for financial reasons within five years of opening.
 In hindsight, the financial flaws were hardly mysterious, experts say. Chronic care is simply not as profitable as acute care because insurers, and consumers, do not want to pay as much for care that is not urgent, according to Dr. Arnold Milstein, medical director of the Pacific Business Group on Health.
 By the time a situation is acute, when dialysis and amputations are necessary, the insurer, which has been gambling on never being asked to cover procedures that far down the road, has little choice but to cover them, if only to avoid lawsuits, analysts said.
 Patients are also more inclined to pay high prices when severe health consequences are imminent. When the danger is distant, perhaps uncertain, as with chronic conditions, there is less willingness to pay, which undercuts prices and profits, Dr. Milstein explained. 
 ''There is a lesser sense of alarm associated with slow-moving threats, so prices and profits for chronic and preventive care remain low,'' he said. ''Doctors, insurers and hospitals can command much higher prices and profit margins for a bypass surgery that a patient needs today than they can for nutrition counseling likely to prevent a bypass tomorrow.''
 Ms. Seley said the belief was that however marginal the centers might be financially, they would bring in business.
 ''Diabetes centers are for hospitals what discounted two-liter bottles of Coke are to grocery stores,'' she said. ''They are not profitable but they're sold to get dedicated customers, and with the hospitals the hope is to get customers who will come back for the big moneymaking surgeries.''
 Indeed, former officials of the Beth Israel center said they anticipated that operating costs would be underwritten by the amputations and dialysis that some of their diabetic patients would end up needing anyway, despite the center's best efforts. ''In other words, our financial success in part depended on our medical failure,'' Ms. Slavin said.
 The other option was to have a Russ Berrie. 
 Mr. Berrie, a toymaker from the Bronx, made a fortune in the 1980's through the wild popularity of a product he sold, the Troll doll, a three-inch plastic monster with a puff of fluorescent hair. Mr. Berrie took more than $20 million of his doll money and used it to finance the diabetes center at Columbia University Medical Center in memory of his mother, Naomi, who had died of the disease. The center was also helped by a million-dollar grant from a company that makes diabetes drugs and equipment.
 Even with its stable of generous donors, even with more than 10,000 patients filing through the doors each year, the Columbia center struggles financially, said Dr. Robin Goland, a co-director. That, she said, is because the center runs a deficit of at least $50 for each patient it sees.
 Without wealthy benefactors, Beth Israel's center had an even tougher time surviving its financial strains.
 Ms. Slavin said the center often scheduled patients for multiple visits with doctors and educators on the same day because it needed to take advantage of the limited time it had with its patients. But every time a Medicaid patient went to a diabetes education class, and then saw a specialist, the center lost money, she said. Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, will pay for only one service a day under its rules. 
 The center also lost money, its former staff members said, every time a nurse called a patient at home to check on his diet or contacted a physician to relate a patient's progress. Both calls are considered essential to getting people to change their habits. But medical professionals, unlike lawyers and accountants, cannot bill for phone time, so more money was lost. 
 And the insurance reimbursement for an hourlong diabetes class did not come close to covering the cost. Most insurers paid less than $25 for a class, said Denise Rivera, the secretary for the center.
 ''That wasn't even enough to pay for what it cost to have me to do the paperwork to get the reimbursement,'' she said.
 Beth Israel was not alone in this predicament. Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, president and director of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, the nation's largest such center, with 23 affiliates around the country, said that for every dollar spent on care, the Joslin centers lost 35 cents. They close the gap, but just barely, with philanthropy, he said.
 ''So you have the institutions, which are doing much of the work in dealing with this major health epidemic, depending on charity,'' he said. ''In the long run, this is definitely not a tenable system.''

Plastic Strips and Red Tape
 Sidney Schonfeld was not a patient at Beth Israel, but he ran into his own set of financial obstacles in trying to manage his disease.
 ''Controlling my condition isn't that hard,'' said Mr. Schonfeld, 82, a retired businessman from Washington Heights. ''The hard part are the things outside my control, like getting the test strips and the medicines.'' 
 Test strips are not complicated pieces of medical equipment. They are inch-long pieces of plastic with tiny metal tabs that diabetics use to measure the sugar in their blood. After pricking their finger, diabetics place a drop of blood on the strip and then insert it into the side of a handheld meter that analyzes their sugar levels. 
 Each strip costs only about 75 cents, but many diabetics are poor and, over the course of a year, those who test their blood frequently, as instructed, will spend more than $500 on strips.
 Mr. Schonfeld, like many diabetics, is supposed to test his blood at least twice a day so he can make adjustments to his diet and medications that can ward off serious complications. But many insurers cover only one strip per day unless a patient obtains written justification from a doctor. Even with letters from his doctor, Mr. Schonfeld has had a tough time getting insurers to pay for his strips, his doctor and nurse said.
 ''Fighting the disease is only half of this job,'' said Mr. Schonfeld's doctor, Dr. Goland. She held up a manila folder thick with letters that she had sent to his insurer explaining Mr. Schonfeld's case. Mr. Schonfeld had his own pile of letters: the rejection notices he got back.
 Dr. Goland says that Mr. Schonfeld has good reason to be vigilant. His mother lost her left foot to Type 2 diabetes. She died several months later after gangrene spread to her right. Mr. Schonfeld's six uncles and aunts on his mother's side had the disease. Three of them underwent amputations. His son, Gary, is also diabetic. 
 ''You can't get a more textbook high-risk case than Sidney,'' Dr. Goland said.
 Though the health care system asks diabetics to become rigorously involved in daily management of their conditions, red tape and the cost of drugs and supplies put self-management out of reach for many patients. As a result, many diabetics either do without or pay out of their own pockets. Some resort to other means to get their supplies.
 In Indiana, hospital workers organized Diabetes Bingo Night last May to collect money for strips and supplies. In California, F.B.I agents found that diabetics were buying stolen strips on eBay. Last year, the agents charged a couple with mail fraud and accused them of having sold $2.5 million worth of stolen test strips and supplies. 
 In East Harlem, doctors at Mount Sinai were mystified by a number of cases in 2002: patients came into the hospital asserting that they had been testing themselves daily and were sure that their blood sugar was under control. Hospital tests, however, showed just the opposite. 
 ''We finally figured out,'' said Dr. Carol R. Horowitz, an assistant professor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, ''that patients who could not afford the strips for their blood monitor were buying cheaper strips that were incompatible and that were giving false reads.''
 At least they knew they had the disease. A third of diabetics do not, in part because doctors do not screen as often as they should, studies show. Since symptoms do not appear for 7 to 10 years on average, the effects of the elevated sugars begin to build and become irreversible. 
 Mr. Schonfeld has known about his diabetes for more than 20 years and prides himself on keeping it in check. 
 ''I've seen what it can do,'' he said. ''So I know better than to ignore it.''
 When Dr. Goland told him to limit the chocolate mousse and frankfurters, he did.
 When she told him to start walking two miles a day, he did that, too. But her instructions to test his blood at least twice a day were not as easy to follow.
 Mr. Schonfeld runs out of strips even though he tries to plan ahead by ordering extras, said Kathy Person, his nurse. ''The insurance reps say they don't want the strips to end up on the black market, so they don't let people preorder extras,'' she said. 
 The Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center has a full-time staff member who tries to do the clerical work associated with insurance coverage. ''Still, it's a struggle to keep up with the paperwork,'' Dr. Goland said.
 Some doctors simply do not have time and patients are left to haggle with insurers -- usually unsuccessfully -- on their own.
 Although a recent federal study found that an increasing number of health insurers cover strips, few cover more than one a day, according to strip manufacturers. In fact, a study last year by Georgetown University found that insurance restrictions on strips and other services for diabetics were reducing the quality of care.
 ''I was a businessman for more than 40 years,'' said Mr. Schonfeld, a former food importer. ''What I just don't understand is how these insurance companies can operate the way they do and keep their customers.'' 

Sick Patient? Expensive Patient
 As it turns out, keeping customers who are diabetic is not the goal of most health insurance companies, experts said. Avoiding diabetics is actually more the point.
 Understanding why, the experts said, requires an appreciation of one of the crucial obstacles to better diabetes care.
 Most insurers do not operate the way Mr. Schonfeld did in the import business, luring additional customers by advertising a good product at a fair price. Were they to operate in that fashion, health plans looking to grow might advertise better coverage for diabetics, such as a wide choice of blood-sugar monitors. 
 But in the insurance business -- and virtually all businesses based on risk -- the point is not to attract the most customers but rather the best ones. As businesses, not charities, insurers need to attract healthy customers, not sick ones, said David Knutson, a former insurance executive who studies the industry's economics for the Park Nicollet Institute, a health research organization in Minneapolis.
 As a result, experts say, insurance executives usually think twice before bolstering their diabetes benefits, for fear they will attract the chronically ill.
 In a 2003 survey, 87 percent of health insurance actuaries queried by Mr. Knutson said that if they were to improve coverage with richer drug benefits or easier access to specialists, they would incur financial problems by attracting the sickest, most expensive patients. 
 ''Insurers are as eager to attract the chronically ill as banks are interested in loaning to the unemployed,'' Mr. Knutson said. ''The chances of losing money are simply too high.''
 Insurers are not alone in these concerns. Large employers, many of which devise and finance their own employee health plans, know that their allotted reserves are jeopardized if too much of their work force is seriously ill. Last year, for example, a Wal-Mart executive suggested in an internal memo that the company could reduce costs by discouraging unhealthy people from applying for work.
 Even when insurers are simply third-party administrators, processing claims but not covering the actual medical expenses, they try to keep claims down by attracting healthier patients to their plans, Mr. Knutson said.
 Similarly, coverage for Medicaid recipients, though underwritten by the government, can be subject to the same private-sector pressures. More than 70 percent of Medicaid recipients in New York now receive their health care through private health maintenance organizations that operate under government contract. These H.M.O.'s get the same annual flat fee from the government, regardless of whether the patient is robustly healthy or chronically ill, thus creating an incentive to attract the healthiest customers. 
 For insurers, the high cost of attracting the sick is far from a hypothetical problem, said David V. Axene, president of Axene Health Partners, a consulting firm that advises these companies. For each additional session of nutritional counseling, he said, an insurer must account for the likely cost of luring sick patients away from its competitors.
 Mr. Axene cited an example from several years ago when, he said, an insurer became puzzled about why a provider network that it had set up at a Boston hospital was consistently over budget. Mr. Axene's company found that two-thirds of the hospital's diabetics had chosen to enroll in that network over others.
 The reason? The insurer had mistakenly listed an endocrinologist on its network's primary care physician list, he said.
 ''These patients no longer needed to get a referral to see the endocrinologist, and with one visit they could get their general and their diabetes needs filled,'' Mr. Axene said. Within months, the network had redrafted its lists, dropping the endocrinologist, he said.
 Mohit Ghose, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade association, said insurers were working to improve chronic care coverage. Many have created disease management programs to track their sickest patients and pay bonuses to doctors who show results in treating the chronically ill.
 ''Is there still a long way to go? Yes, definitely,'' Mr. Ghose said. ''But we're on the right track.''
 Some preventive measures would, at first glance, seem sure money savers for health insurers since they might eliminate or forestall expensive diabetes complications down the road. But many insurers do not think that way. They figure that complications are often so far into the future, insurance analysts say, that many people will have already switched jobs or insurers, or have even died, by the time they hit. As a result, any savings from preventive measures will only go to their competitors anyway, analysts say.
 In fact, experts say, people generally change their health insurance about every six years.
 ''It's perverse,'' Mr. Knutson said. ''But it's the reality of there being a weak business case for quality when it comes to handling chronic care.'' 

'Jerry, We Need to Talk'
 It usually took Dr. Bernstein seven minutes to walk from his office in Fierman Hall to the hospital president's office across 17th Street. On Jan. 4, 2000, he had a bounce in his step, and it took him half that time, he recalled.
 He had a good story to tell, and graphs and tables to back it up. The Beth Israel center was an unqualified medical success. In fact, patient loads were growing by 20 percent each month as its reputation spread.
 When he arrived, Dr. Fink, then the hospital's president, asked the three other executives to take their seats. Dr. Bernstein began talking before he had reached his chair. 
 ''Things are really coming along well,'' he said as he handed out a spreadsheet. ''Patients are starting to turn their lives around.''
 Pausing, Dr. Bernstein looked around the table. He was struck by an awkward silence.
 ''Jerry, we need to talk about what is happening at the hospital,'' Dr. Fink said. ''We're going to have to close your program.''
 Dr. Bernstein cannot say which was more jarring: the news or the way it arrived. 
 Numb, he kept his composure for 25 minutes, he said. The administrators explained that the hospital was running a deficit. The diabetes program was not helping matters.
 ''It was really not about the medicine but the business,'' Dr. Fink said recently about the meeting. ''That didn't make it any easier to deliver the news, especially since I had been one of the main advocates behind getting the center started.''
 After the meeting, as Dr. Bernstein walked back to his office, he wondered where he would direct the program's 300 or so patients. Still, he remained sympathetic to the hospital's plight.
 ''I was not of the belief that we should save the center only to end up losing the hospital,'' he said.
 For many of the patients, the news was a second strike of lightning. They had come to Dr. Bernstein only after being cut loose by the closing of the St Luke's diabetes center earlier that year. Now they were being cut loose again, to drift back to a life of limited care options: understaffed and overwhelmed clinics; general practitioners with too little time; a city with about 100 overbooked diabetes educators surrounded by 800,000 patients; and a shortage of endocrinologists, the specialists who are often critical providers of diabetes care. 
 Since endocrinology is one of the lower-paying specialties, there is a national shortage of such doctors. In New York, with its armies of diabetics, patients must often wait months for an appointment with one of fewer than 200 endocrinologists. The poorest patients face the biggest problem, as only a fraction of the specialists accept Medicaid. 
 Once the center had closed, Dr. Bernstein continued to teach at Beth Israel, but he began to devote more and more time to a side project. He was working on an inhaler that delivers insulin in the form of a mist. The product is being developed by Generex, and it is designed to appeal to patients who are reluctant to use insulin because they do not like the idea of injections or needles. 
 But the device will probably cost about 15 percent more than traditional insulin and is likely to be too expensive for many of the poorest diabetics, who are often the patients who need it most because their illness is most severe.
 ''The center was a way to really make a dent in this epidemic,'' Dr. Bernstein said. ''The inhaler is a promising breakthrough. But it's mostly a business opportunity.''
 Other pharmaceutical innovations are likely to soften the toll of diabetes for many patients in coming years, doctors said. With an average diabetic spending more than $2,500 per year on drugs and equipment, pharmaceutical companies have good reason to focus their attention on the more than $10 billion market in controlling the disease's complications.
 But there is only so much the drugs can do, they add, if they are not accompanied by the sort of changes in patient habits that the centers fostered through education and monitoring.
 Health economists suggest that if these preventive measures were practiced on a wide scale, complications from diabetes would be largely eliminated and the American medical system, and by extension taxpayers, could save as much as $30 billion over 10 years. The experts disagree on what such an effort would cost. (How much nutrition counseling does it take to wean the average person from French fries?) Nonetheless, many of them believe the cost would be largely offset by the savings.
 Dr. Bernstein says the lone hope on the horizon is a restructured reimbursement system that puts the business of chronic care on a more competitive footing with acute care. Experts say this restructuring could start if government insurance programs like Medicaid began paying more for preventive efforts like education, a move that the private sector would be likely to follow.
 ''Until we address the financing and the reimbursement structure, this disease is going to rage out of control,'' Dr. Bernstein said. 
 Not everyone believes the centers were the best answer to diabetes care. Even with their demise, many hospitals, clinics and endocrinology practices say they are providing cost-effective, quality treatment.
 ''The care we provide now is on the par with what was offered before,'' said Dr. Leonid Poretsky, who became director of Beth Israel's endocrinology division after the diabetes program closed. ''The main difference is that we are financially viable because half of our patients are not diabetic.'' 
 These facilities, though, often find themselves in the same position the centers did: financing prevention efforts with profits from the very kidney transplants and amputations that preventive care is meant to deter. 
 It is tough to convince a former patient like Ms. Hammond that the closing of the Beth Israel center was anything but a mistake. She had started to make critical changes in her lifestyle after just a few weeks there. She did not find out it had closed, she said, until several months after the doors had shut, when she called looking to sign up for a refresher class. She was starting to fall back into old habits.
 ''I needed reminding,'' she said. 
 With the center gone, Ms. Hammond said she has had to try to muddle through. She goes to the podiatrist once a year, but she said she could not remember the last time she visited an eye doctor. She has gained about 40 pounds.
 Some days she wakes up and her blood sugar is high. Other mornings she doesn't bother to check, she said. 
 ''I couldn't get to where I was before,'' she said.
 Two years ago, she said, she took a last look at that favorite gabardine pantsuit she had once modeled for her class. Then, she said, she gave it to her cousin.

ABOUT THE SERIES

The Business of Care

Today -- The textbooks describe Type 2 diabetes as a controllable disease. But medical efforts to control it are consistently undermined, experts say, by the perverse financial incentives of American health care.
 A yearlong examination by The New York Times found that doctors and hospitals profit by treating complications of the disease but lose money when they try to prevent them. Unless this is corrected, health officials warn, it will be difficult to stem an expanding epidemic that threatens to outstrip New York City's medical and financial resources.
 Day in and day out, for example, doctors and hospitals reap financial rewards by performing diabetes-related amputations, which are nearly always covered by insurance, experts say. But little money is available for the sort of preventive education that might have saved a foot in the first place.
 Experts say the problem is symptomatic of a financial bias toward treating acute illnesses over chronic conditions. Insurers and employers are reluctant to increase benefits for chronic illness for fear they will attract too many diabetics, and their expensive litany of ailments.
 The impact of these economic forces was evident in the closing of several innovative diabetes centers at New York hospitals in recent years. Though regarded as medical successes, they lost money because the preventive care did not pay.

MONDAY -- Diabetes becomes an epidemic, quickly and quietly.
YESTERDAY -- On the streets of East Harlem, a diabetic ground zero.
TOMORROW -- Among the next generation of victims: children of immigrants.

 Researchers estimated the costs of care and used Medicare reimbursement rates, averaged for several areas of the country. The American Hospital Association, which reviewed the hospitalization numbers, said the approach was reasonable. While some hospitals have a poorer, sicker, more costly population of patients, the researchers said the numbers were representative of the profits made on a typical amputation in most areas.

DOCTOR VISIT

COST OF CARE: $53
REIMBURSEMENT: $81
PROFIT: $28

The diabetic finds a sore on the ball of his right foot. It does not hurt because the diabetic already has nerve damage. But an infection is spreading, the foot is purplish and it smells bad. He goes to see his primary care physician, who finds no pulses, indicating a loss of circulation.

OUTPATIENT DIAGNOSTICS

COST OF CARE: $145
REIMBURSEMENT: $214
PROFIT: $69

A vascular surgeon orders an angiogram, in which a dye is injected to check the circulation in the foot. He confirms the loss of circulation and finds that major vessels below the knee are blocked. He decides that the foot cannot be saved.

HOSPITALIZATION

COST OF CARE: $7,733-17,594 (to the hospital)
REIMBURSEMENT: $19,093 (to the hospital)
PROFIT: $1,499-11,360

The right leg is amputated below the knee in an operation that takes close to three hours and involves two surgeons, a nurse anesthetist and an operating room team. In addition to the hospital's bill, the physicians earn a 5 percent to10 percent profit, experts estimate.

OUTPATIENT PHYSICAL THERAPY

COST OF CARE: $160 per hour
REIMBURSEMENT: $117 per hour
PROFIT: Loss of $43 per hour

After a week recovering in the hospital, the patient goes home and takes physical therapy three to five times a week for 10 weeks. He rebuilds muscle strength and learns to walk with crutches at the therapy center, which is often tied to the hospital where the amputation was performed.

PROSTHETIC

COST OF CARE: $11,668
REIMBURSEMENT: $12,923
PROFIT: $1,255

Specialists make sure the limb has healed, prescribe pain medications and discuss the appropriate type of prosthesis. For five months after the surgery, the patient regularly visits a prosthetist who fits him for a temporary prosthesis -- which is worn for 12 weeks -- and then a permanent one.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Move Said to Hurt The Poor 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Tax refunds sought by 1.6 million poor Americans over the last five years were frozen and their returns labeled fraudulent, although the vast majority appear to have done nothing wrong, the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer advocate told Congress yesterday.
 A computer program identified the refund requests as suspect and automatically flagged the taxpayers for extra scrutiny for years to come, the advocate said in her annual report to Congress. These taxpayers were not told that the I.R.S. criminal investigation division suspected fraud. 
The advocate, Nina Olson, said the I.R.S. devoted vastly more resources to pursuing questionable refunds sought by the poor -- which under the highest estimate is $9 billion -- than to the $100 billion in taxes not paid each year by people who work for cash and either fail to file tax returns or understate their income.
 As for the suspected fraud in refund requests, Ms. Olson said her staff sampled the suspect returns and found that 66 percent were entitled to the amount sought or more. Another 14 percent were due a partial refund. She expressed doubt that many among the remaining 20 percent had committed fraud.
 Unless taxpayers press for their refunds, Ms. Olson said, they ''are not given an opportunity to substantiate their claims or to show that any overclaims identified were due to honest error rather than fraud.''
 The I.R.S. criminal division defended its program as a successful effort to protect against refund fraud, saying it ''has stopped literally billions of dollars of false refunds to criminals.'' It said the program was intended to be fair to all taxpayers while efficiently using limited law enforcement resources.
 Ms. Olson also said in her report that the I.R.S. is answering far fewer telephone calls, spending far less to teach small businesses how to comply with the tax laws and, in general, is cutting back on services to help taxpayers comply with the law. She said cutting taxpayer assistance would probably result in more costly tax collection.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said, ''We've seen a significant increase in refund abuse in recent years.'' 
 ''However,'' he said, ''I'm concerned by the advocate's findings that thousands and thousands of taxpayers are having their refunds frozen by the criminal investigation division, yet the taxpayers often do not know their refund has been frozen and can't effectively challenge the I.R.S.'s actions.''
 Ms. Olson said the criminal investigators' efforts, known within the I.R.S. as the Questionable Refund Program, were unfair and might be illegal.
 ''At a minimum, this procedure constitutes an extraordinary violation of fundamental taxpayer rights and fairness,'' Ms. Olson wrote, adding that it ''may also constitute a violation of due process of law.''
 Her staff's sample of frozen returns found that the average reported income was about $13,000 and the refund due was about $3,500. 
 About three-quarters of those affected were employed parents who applied for the earned-income tax credit, under which all income and Social Security taxes can be returned and, in some cases, a payment made.
 The credit is a kind of negative income tax, first advocated by Milton Friedman, the Nobel-winning economist, and championed by President Ronald Reagan as the government's best program to encourage the poor to improve their circumstances through work.
 Ms. Olson's report noted that in recent years, Congress has given the I.R.S. more than $875 million to investigate suspected fraud in the $32 billion tax credit program. Ms. Olson has repeatedly said that Congressional estimates of rampant fraud appear to have little or no basis in fact.
 She said that in cases where frozen refunds were later issued, the delay was typically more than eight months, which she said was a hardship on the poor taxpayers who had filed proper tax returns.
 The criminal investigators defended the program, writing to Ms. Olson that they had blocked $2.1 billion in questionable refunds.
 Ms. Olson said that statement was misleading because just two refunds, from a scheme run by prison inmates, accounted for $1.8 billion of the total. These refunds, she said, almost certainly would have been stopped anyway because tax experts at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation must review all refunds of $2 million or more.
 She said the balance of the criminal division's refund fraud estimate appeared to be significantly inflated.
 The criminal investigators also criticized the advocate's finding that 80 percent of taxpayers whose refunds were frozen were entitled to all or part of the money. They said that ''innocent taxpayers'' were the most likely to press for refunds. 
 Ms. Olson, in replying to the investigators, noted that they put suspect returns into three categories, the most serious labeled ''conclusively'' shown to be fraudulent. Ms. Olson's staff studied a sample of these returns and found that 46 percent of refund requests were proper, an estimate that the criminal investigators now agree is accurate. 
 Congress created the taxpayer advocate as part of a 1998 law intended to give individual taxpayers greater protections from perceived abuses by overzealous tax collectors and auditors. 
 Ms. Olson, who ran a tax clinic for the poor before her appointment in 2001 as taxpayer advocate, told Congress that the biggest need was a simplification of the tax system. 
 ''Our tax code has grown so complex,'' she wrote, that ''it creates opportunities for taxpayers to make inadvertent mistakes as well as to game the system.''
 The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group that favors lower taxes, said in a separate report on Tuesday that complying with the tax code cost individuals, businesses and others $265 billion last year.
 Ms. Olson cited the growing number of returns considered questionable in her 2003 report to Congress, but it drew little attention because she did not raise any of the fairness, effectiveness and efficiency questions that are in her latest report.
 Professor Leslie M. Book of Villanova University, who runs a tax clinic for the poor and has studied how well the poor comply with the tax laws, said the computer program was a blunt and unfair tool for fighting fraud.
 ''Surely there are taxpayers who are ineligible claiming the credit,'' Professor Book said. 
 ''But freezing refunds without giving taxpayers due process is an extremely dangerous way to administer the earned-income tax credit,'' he said. ''These taxpayers often need more rather than less protection because they are not sophisticated, are afraid of government involvement.''

HEADLINE: Palestinians in Gaza Fear War Between Fatah and Hamas After Vote

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: GAZA, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Campaigning by Fatah and Hamas, the two main Palestinian political factions, paused Tuesday while people slaughtered sheep and goats and the occasional ox for the annual Muslim holiday Id al-Adha. 
 But the mood was subdued amid talk of war between the factions, and Palestinian security forces said they were girding for violence, fearing that the legislative elections scheduled for Jan. 25 could lead to fighting.
''If civil war starts, it will last a long time and cost thousands of lives,'' said Sameeh Nasser, a police officer riding through Gaza City's chaotic streets in a light-blue Peugeot patrol car.
 The densely populated, heavily armed territory is taut with frustration from decades of political injustices, restricted freedoms, stunted economic development and the violent culture of its militias and their suicide bombers. Gaza threatens to turn on itself now that Israel has withdrawn. 
 ''We can't deny that there is real fear that something might happen,'' said the Hamas campaign director for Gaza, Naji Alserhi. He said Hamas had warned the Palestinian Authority that ''people will take the law into their own hands'' if the elections were postponed.
 Fears that the elections would be delayed were partly eased Tuesday when the Israeli defense minister, Shaul Mofaz, said Palestinians would be able to vote in East Jerusalem, a condition demanded by Palestinian authorities for the elections to go ahead.
 Israeli officials had threatened to ban the voting because candidates from Hamas, which advocates Israel's destruction and is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the European Union and the United States, would appear on the ballot. Meanwhile, rival teams of young men roam the streets of Gaza, staking out territory by hanging campaign flags from lampposts, green for Hamas and yellow for Fatah.
 A Monday night rally took place outside a mosque in northern Gaza's Shati refugee camp, which has grown from a tent city in 1948 to a dense urban landscape today. Hamas candidates bellowed to a crowd of several hundred through microphones, pausing periodically while the crowd chanted ''God is great.'' 
 Their message alternated between Hamas's claims of credit for forcing the withdrawal by Israel and promises by the faction to clean up corruption in the Palestinian Authority. Hamas has vowed to ask all Palestinian officials to account for their wealth, and to prosecute any who are found to have benefited from corruption.
 The faction issued a statement this week declaring that the Middle East is better off without Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. But Israeli policy in the wake of Mr. Sharon's debilitating stroke is a subject far from people's minds.
 People in Gaza City talked Tuesday about how bad things had gotten in recent months, and how much worse they could become. Their children celebrated the holiday by playing with toy guns.
 Some people even expressed open nostalgia for the days before the 1993 Oslo accords, when Israel still occupied the territory and Palestinians were freer to travel across the country. More than 100,000 Palestinians from Gaza worked in Israel before the agreements, and thousands were still commuting through the fortresslike border crossings when Israel withdrew in September. Few do so these days because the crossings are frequently closed.
 In northern Gaza on Tuesday, an Islamic butcher in rubber boots and blood-spattered clothes said soaring prices and a shrinking economy since the withdrawal had cut the demand for sacrificial animals by a third this year.
 Still, Hamas, among the most militant of the Palestinian factions, casts its political participation as an effort to ''protect the resistance'' against Israel, and says it will consider strong electoral support a validation of its policies. Its leaders say they have no plan to soften the faction's political agenda. They consider the agreements that the Palestinian Authority has entered into with Israel invalid. 
 Hamas's organizational discipline, hard political line and promises to prosecute corrupt officials have won it widespread popularity among Palestinians, particularly in Gaza. Indeed, its reputation for violent resistance led to a kind of competition with Fatah over attacks against Israelis.
 But the faction presents a public presence strikingly different to the increasingly chaotic Fatah. 
 The military wing of Hamas operates under a unified command and follows its political leaders closely, while Fatah, itself splintered by factionalism, exerts little control over many branches of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, which operate more or less independently. 
 Fighters of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigade of Hamas rarely carry their weapons in public unless they are taking part in a Hamas-sanctioned activity, residents say.
 But Al Aksa fighters regularly roam the streets with Kalashnikov assault rifles slung over their shoulders.
 The difference was clear at a Fatah campaign rally in Gaza this week, where a man held a Kalashnikov above the crowd and squeezed off a deafening burst of gunfire, sending spent shells raining down like confetti. The shots, which periodically have injured or even killed bystanders, were echoed by other gunmen across the crowd. 
 Many Fatah supporters say they will vote for Hamas to send their own faction a message that it needs to reform or lose power. But that is a dangerous game, others warn, because if Hamas wins big, violence is likely to follow.
 Eyad el-Sarraj, a psychiatrist who is an activist in Gaza, said: ''If Hamas wins, do you think the security forces of these guys will leave their posts? Do you think the leaders will give up their offices, that the masses of people who have jobs from Fatah will give up their livelihoods? The big boys with money will disappear, the rest will fight.''
 Feuding Palestinian clans have already turned parts of the north and the south of Gaza into occasional war zones, and there is widespread pessimism about whether the territory's political future will be decided with ballots or bullets. 
 On a sandy hilltop near the northern Gaza border, which was once used to launch rockets into Israel, Ahmed Fayez, a young Palestinian soldier posted to help deter more attacks on Israel said he would soon be reassigned to keeping peace inside the territory's borders. ''There won't be elections,'' Mr. Fayez predicted. ''They'll fight.''
 Many members of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades say that if Hamas wins a substantial share of the vote, more than 30 percent, there could be fighting. The Palestinian Authority's Interior Ministry spokesman in Gaza, Tawfik Abu Khousa, said the government had tried to convince the factions to store their weapons in order to keep them off the street and allow some measure of control, but all refused. 
 ''The situation is getting worse and worse and we are really worried about civil war,'' he said, adding that there had already been several threats to kidnap European election monitors in Gaza and the West Bank.
 The number of weapons on the streets is estimated to be at least triple that in the hands of the Palestinian police, which has only one gun for every 20 officers. 
 ''It affects our ability to operate,'' said Brig. Gen. Omar Moussa, at the Gaza police headquarters. He said three police officers had been killed since Israel pulled out of Gaza.
 While all weapons not in official hands are illegal, the police are unable to seize them because they are outgunned. Palestinian security forces regularly wear masks during operations, but are otherwise afraid to confront militia members for fear of reprisals against their families.

HEADLINE: Another Chinese Export Is All the Rage: China's Language 

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Conquering the world is not supposed to be easy, but that's exactly how things must look some days to Xu Lin, head of the government's new effort to promote the Chinese language overseas.
 Ms. Xu is creating a global network of Chinese cultural centers, called Confucius Institutes, to teach foreigners throughout the world a language with a forbidding reputation for difficulty. But far from having to round people up, Ms. Xu is finding they are beating down her door.
''There is a China frenzy around the world at the moment,'' she said. ''The launch of this program is in response to the Chinese language craze, especially in neighboring countries.''
 For decades, people in those countries have viewed China with deep suspicion. But now mastering Chinese as a door to lucrative business opportunities, or simply as a matter of popular fashion, is suddenly all the vogue -- not only there but in the United States and Europe as well. 
 Just as new, though, is the decision of the Chinese government to ride the wave, not just capitalizing on the newfound chic that surrounds the language but also determined to perpetuate it as a way of extending Chinese international influence and good will toward the country.
 For some, the choice of a slightly fusty name like Confucius Institute, which evokes images of anything but a rising new power, might seem odd given Beijing's increasing penchant for high-tech imagery and slick public relations. Yet the carefully selected label speaks volumes about the country's soft power ambitions.
 Among other things, using the name of the country's oldest and most famous philosopher avoids reference to the official ideology, which remains Marxism. Confucius, who was an educator and quasi-religious figure, also stands for peace and harmony, values that China insistently proclaims today, hoping to disarm fears about its rapid rise.
 Judging by the reactions of its long-wary neighbors, the effort appears to be paying off. Indonesia, which for three decades banned the teaching of Chinese because of Beijing's support for Communist rebels, recently lifted the prohibition. Vietnam, which has long had strained ties with Beijing, has accepted a Confucius Institute amid a boom in Chinese language instruction. In South Korea, an American ally that fought alongside the United States in a war against China's troops a half century ago, Chinese has reportedly outstripped English as the most popular foreign language among students.
 ''Chinese is as popular in Korea today as English is in China,'' Ms. Xu said enthusiastically.
 Although Chinese language studies may be most advanced in neighboring countries, where the ability to understand the Mandarin dialect has traditionally been considered a mark of cultivation, they are making huge strides farther afield. Eleven Confucius Institutes are up and running, in Europe and Africa as well as Asia.
 One center is already operating in the United States, at the University of Maryland, and five others are expected to open soon in Honolulu, Kansas City, Mo., San Francisco, Chicago and New York. Twelve more are under discussion.
 Even before that first center opened, the College Board, the body that administers advanced placement exams, added Chinese to its list of foreign language tests, the first time an East Asian language has been included in its testing. 
 In a 2003 survey of American high schools, the College Board found that 50 said they would like to add advanced placement courses in Russian, about 175 said Japanese and 240 said Italian -- and 2,400 said they would prefer Chinese. ''We had no idea there was such an incredible interest out there,'' Tom Matts, a College Board official, told CNN. 
 Ms. Xu said that ''education officials from several states, actually several dozen states, have sent us requests'' to help them establish Chinese language programs.
 In many respects, China's Confucius Institutes seem like a throwback to the 1950's and 1960's, when the United States, the Soviet Union and leading European countries were competing intensely for international prestige and influence. Moscow distributed magazines like Soviet Life through its embassies, and others promoted their languages through cultural organizations like the Alliance Francaise, the Goethe Institute and the Cervantes Institute.
 As China becomes a major economic and military power and its diplomacy becomes more assertive, Beijing is also working harder at winning friends and influencing people. Indeed, taken together with China's recent launches of manned space flights, and the huge push to build world-class universities and to produce prize-winning scientific research, some have called the language initiative part of this country's ''Sputnik moment,'' after the first artificial satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.
 But where Sputnik fed a sense of alarm in the United States and elsewhere about the rise of an aggressive new superpower, the Confucius Institutes are intended to do almost the opposite, elevating the country's prestige while easing anxieties over the arrival of a new power. 
 ''They are using Chinese culture to create a warmer, more positive image of Chinese society,'' said Nancy Jervis, vice president of the China Institute, a nonprofit Chinese-language study group that will be home to a Confucius Institute in New York City. ''That's probably why the State Council has funded them, and why they've given a fair amount of money in turn to the College Board.''
 China's re-entry into the contest for global influence reflects the broader strategy of a nation that is still poor by many measures but is moving fast and making a big impression. The approach often involves advancing with frugal means through lots of hustle and word of mouth.
 ''The British Council spends over 3 billion pounds a year,'' or more than $5 billion, Ms. Xu said, adding that China is spending only about $12 million on the Confucius Institutes. Instead of building expensive new headquarters in each city, the institutes team up with local partners, taking space in their buildings or getting foreign governments to pay for their housing. Instead of sending teachers who will instruct foreigners directly, the institute sends teacher trainers who can help upgrade the skills of local Chinese teachers.
 ''The vision for this sort of thing has existed in China for a very long time,'' said Wu Yongyi, deputy dean of the International College of Chinese Studies at East China Normal University in Shanghai, who has been involved in overseas language instruction missions since the 1980's.
 Mr. Wu said China worked hard to promote its language among third world nations from the 1960's to the 80's, when he got his start teaching in Africa and elsewhere overseas.
 Today, about 90,000 foreign students come to China every year to study the language, he said, with 30 million more people around the world studying Chinese.
 ''After China's economic reforms started, we discovered we had an urgent need for communication, and we found that it's not enough that we learned foreign languages,'' he said. ''Communications could be better if other people could speak Chinese. We need two-way communications, and now that our economy is strong, we can support this.''

HEADLINE: IRANIANS REOPEN NUCLEAR CENTERS

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and NAZILA FATHI; Steven R. Weisman reported from Washington for this article, and Nazila Fathi from Tehran.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Iran broke open internationally monitored seals on at least three of its nuclear facilities on Tuesday, clearing the way for uranium enrichment activities that Europeans and Americans say are a crucial step toward making a nuclear weapon.
 The Iranians said the step was only for research on enriching uranium, and outside experts said Iran was still years away from producing enough fuel for a bomb.
But the United States and its European allies condemned the action and stepped up a campaign to persuade the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions, perhaps by the end of the month. 
 It was unclear whether Russia and China would support a move toward sanctions, even though both called on Iran as recently as this weekend not to resume enrichment. A European diplomat acknowledged that there was still an ''obvious reluctance'' by the two countries to ''gang up on the Iranians.'' 
 A senior administration official noted, however, that a Foreign Ministry statement in Moscow declared Tuesday that Russia was ''deeply disappointed by Iran's declared decision'' and recalled that a Russian envoy had ''insistently advised them not to take this step'' in a visit to Tehran last weekend.
 ''For the Russians, this is an angry statement,'' said the administration official, who did not want to be identified while discussing tactics or strategy, as opposed to settled policy. The official added that American officials would confer with the other Europeans and the Russians in the next few days before deciding what action to take against Iran.
 ''We view this as a serious escalation on the part of Iran on the nuclear issue,'' said Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman. ''What you see here is the international community coming out and sending a very clear message to Iran that their behavior is unacceptable.''
 German, French and British officials joined in assailing the Iranian action. Over the last year, the three nations persuaded the Bush administration to go along with their effort to negotiate with Iran to keep a freeze on activities that Iran says are peaceful but that many Western experts believe are part of a covert weapons program.
 The negotiations involved European offers of economic incentives, including the sale of aircraft parts and talks leading to trade preferences. But Iran's action appears to have derailed any such discussions for now.
 ''The Iranians have behaved so remarkably badly, it's hard to believe that the international community will do anything other than put them in front of the ultimate court of international public opinion,'' a European diplomat said, referring to the Security Council. ''That is where the Iranians are heading.'' The official did not want to be identified by name or country to preserve a united front with his European colleagues.
 President Jacques Chirac of France criticized Iran's action as a grave error, and the new German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said Iran was sending ''very, very disastrous signals.'' 
 In Tehran, Iranian officials were quoted as saying the actions they were taking involved research activities permitted by the Nonproliferation Treaty, which allows signers to have peaceful nuclear programs as long as they agree to monitoring and do not do anything that could make weapons.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency has not charged that Iran is making a bomb, but Iran has concealed its activities from inspectors in a way that has aroused suspicions. 
 Iran voluntarily suspended some of those activities more than a year ago in an agreement with the three European nations in Paris. Last year, however, it proceeded with the conversion of raw uranium, or yellow cake, into a gas known as uranium hexaflouride, also called UF6. 
 On Tuesday, the seals placed by the International Atomic Energy Agency were removed at Natanz, Iran, where centrifuges for enrichment of uranium to a higher grade are stored. Iranian officials also removed seals at two related storage and testing locations known as Pars Trash, near Isfahan, and Farayand Technique. The international agency said the seals had covered centrifuge components, manufacturing equipment and two cylinders containing uranium hexaflouride.
 Western diplomats said Iran appeared ready to enrich uranium with 164 or more centrifuges, the minimum amount they said was needed for combined use in a ''cascade'' that could produce highly enriched fuel. The centrifuges spin the gas into a concentrated form that can be used for fuel or weapons.
 But other nuclear experts say enriching uranium in centrifuges is an extremely complex undertaking requiring thousands of centrifuges to make enough material for a nuclear bomb. A small ''cascade'' could help teach the Iranians how to get to that larger goal, some experts say.
 While proclaiming its right to enrich uranium as part of its nuclear energy program, Iran has maintained that all its actions are intended for research and not for producing nuclear fuel, even for its energy-related reactors.
 ''We make a difference between research on nuclear fuel technology and production of nuclear fuel,'' Muhammad Saeedi, deputy head of Iran's atomic energy organization, was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency.
 Last year, the West warned Iran not to convert raw uranium into uranium hexaflouride gas. But when Iran proceeded to do so, the West took no punitive action, instead drawing a new ''red line'' saying it would invite retaliation if it took the gas and enriched it in centrifuges.
 ''There's no question that Iran has miscalculated here,'' the administration official said. ''They may have thought that since there have been long and protracted negotiation for two years, there would not be any credible reaction. But this is a big step across a big, bright red line.''
 American officials also said Iran had insulted Mohamed ElBaradei, the chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency, by removing the seals itself and not waiting for the agency to do it. 
 Dr. ElBaradei, who has cautiously said there was no evidence of an Iranian weapons program, has also continually called for Iran to disclose all its activities. On Tuesday, he expressed ''serious concern'' about Iran's action, which he said added to the problem of its ''less than full and prompt transparency'' in nuclear areas, an agency statement said.
 Dr. ElBaradei called on Iran to return to its suspension of activities and to resume its dialogue ''with all concerned parties,'' the agency said.
 Two years ago, when the European nations sought to avert a confrontation between Iran and the West by offering incentives for Iran to abandon its nuclear program, many Bush administration officials were openly disdainful of the European effort.
 Earlier this year, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice changed course and with President Bush in Europe enthusiastically endorsed the diplomatic efforts. This fall, Mr. Bush also endorsed a separate Russian offer to join with Iran in a Russian-Iranian uranium enrichment facility on Russian soil as an alternative to an Iranian program. 
 A top Russian envoy, Sergei Kisliak, went to Tehran last weekend to try to promote that offer. But Iran's actions have now served as an apparent rebuff to Russia. 
 A recurrent concern of the Bush administration relates to North Korea, which was referred to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions because of its nuclear weapons program. The Security Council has not acted, however. American diplomats say they believe that this time, with Russian and Chinese help, there can be a different result.

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Budget Calls for Billions in New Spending

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Aided by a multibillion-dollar windfall in tax revenues, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a $125.6 billion election-year budget on Tuesday that would break from recent years of austerity and increase spending on education, health, prisons and public works without raising taxes.
 The budget also maps out a multiyear, $222 billion program to build highways, transit systems, waterworks, classrooms and prison cells using existing state and federal money and $68 billion in new state bonds, $25 billion of which would be authorized in the coming fiscal year. The borrowing would require approval by voters and the Legislature. 
This is the third budget Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, has proposed since winning office in a recall election in 2003. After several years of anemic growth in state revenues and spending, steady growth in the state economy in the past year is allowing the governor to promote new spending for education, social services and long-neglected infrastructure projects as he starts his re-election campaign.
 The proposed budget offers significant new spending on social programs and construction projects to please Democrats and their union sponsors while holding the line on taxes, a move necessary to prevent grumbling among Republicans. Many conservatives have been critical of the governor's move to the left after voters roundly rejected his so-called reform agenda in November.
 The budget would increase general fund spending by $7.7 billion, to $91.5 billion, a jump of 8.4 percent from the current year. It includes $4.3 billion in additional spending on K-12 education and community colleges, and a $2 billion increase for highway projects. It eliminates planned increases in tuition for hundreds of thousands of students attending the University of California and California State University.
 Despite stronger-than-expected tax revenues, the governor's plan projects a significant imbalance between spending and income -- some $6 billion in the general fund alone. That deficit would be covered by excess tax funds collected this year that would carry into next year. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger again asked the Legislature to give him the authority to make midyear budget cuts if revenue came in below projections. The Legislature rejected that request last year, and voters turned down a ballot proposition that would have given the governor such power.
 ''We have a growing economy and therefore more money is coming into our Treasury,'' the governor said at a news briefing on the budget plan. ''But we still have this structural deficit, a process programmed to spend more money than it takes in. At a minimum we should restore the authority governors had until 1983, to make budget corrections before they get out of control.''
 Analysts said that Mr. Schwarzenegger was entering an election year with a fairly strong economic breeze at his back and with a politically astute focus on the generally uncontroversial issue of rebuilding the state's overburdened water and transportation systems.
 Jaime A. Regalado, executive director of the Edmund G. ''Pat'' Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles, said Mr. Schwarzenegger was moving into Democratic turf to neutralize the Legislature and regain the centrist support that helped him win office.
 ''I think it's strategically and politically a good move to be talking about the infrastructure projects that he wants his administration to focus on over the next four months or four years,'' Mr. Regalado said. 
 The Assembly speaker, Fabian Nunez, a Democrat from Los Angeles, reserved judgment on much of the governor's budget but was critical of roughly $200 million in cuts for several welfare programs.
 ''Under this budget, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,'' Mr. Nunez said in televised comments after the governor's remarks. ''This budget pays lip service to the poor.''
 Mr. Schwarzenegger presented his budget sporting a fat lip held together by 15 stitches after a low-speed motorcycle accident over the weekend. He was driving his Harley-Davidson with his 12-year-old son, Patrick, in a sidecar when a car backed into the street in front of him.
 The governor acknowledged that although he had been riding a motorcycle for years, he had never obtained the required California operating permit, saying he ''never really thought about it.''
 He discussed the incident, and the political problems it posed, in remarks at the beginning of his budget briefing.
 ''The car was right there in front of me,'' he said. ''I knew if I would turn left, the Republicans would get mad at me. If I turned right, my wife would get mad at me. So I crashed right into the car.''
 The governor's wife is Maria Shriver, a Democrat and a niece of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: North Korean Is Said to Pay A Secret Visit To the Chinese 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Wednesday, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, is reportedly making a secret visit to China by train at a time when Chinese-sponsored talks over North Korea's nuclear program have reached an impasse, South Korean news media and Western news agencies said Wednesday. 
 Chinese officials declined to confirm or deny that Mr. Kim was visiting the country and officials from the North Korean Embassy in Beijing flatly denied it. But Mr. Kim has made stealth state visits to China and Russia before.
This time security precautions could be especially intense after an explosion took place on a railway line used by Mr. Kim shortly after his last trip to China in April 2004.
 Reuters quoted an unidentified person as saying that Mr. Kim might be passing through China on his way to Russia. But Reuters and other news agencies also cited people in South Korean intelligence as saying that Mr. Kim's special train had passed through the Chinese border crossing at Dandong and that he was headed for Beijing, where he would meet with Chinese leaders.
 Any travel by the North Korean leader is closely watched by observers of the reclusive country. Mr. Kim is not thought to have made any foreign trips since he came to China in 2004. When he does leave the country, he generally does so by train.
 Talks between Mr. Kim and Chinese leaders would almost certainly address the stalemate in six-nation nuclear talks that have taken place under Chinese sponsorship. After reaching a broad agreement in principle in September to eliminate the North's nuclear program, efforts to resume detailed discussions on how to implement that accord have faltered, with no firm sign of when they might resume.
 In December, North Korea threatened to abandon the talks unless Washington lifted financial sanctions it had imposed on a bank in Macau that had dealings with North Korea. American officials said the sanctions, announced shortly before the last round of nuclear talks in the fall, were intended to punish counterfeiting and drug dealing activities by the cash-starved North Korean government.
 On Monday, North Korea repeated its warning about the talks, saying that any further negotiations with the United States were ''illogical'' at a time when Washington was pursuing financial sanctions.
 Bush administration officials say the sanctions are separate from the nuclear talks, which have been continuing sporadically for more than two years. 
 But there is a current debate in Washington over whether it is in the interest of the United States to continue the prolonged and inconclusive negotiations over the North's development of nuclear weapons, administration officials and members of Congress have said.
 The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, made a state visit to North Korea in October, and a reciprocal trip to China by Mr. Kim has been expected, though the timing was not discussed publicly.
 Even so, another series of high-level meetings between the countries raises the possibility that they are engaged in detailed discussion about the nuclear talks or about North Korea's troubled economy.

HEADLINE: 'When a Precedent Is Reaffirmed, That Strengthens the Precedent' 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearing yesterday for Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court. He was questioned by, among others, Senators Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania; Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont; Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts; and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. The statements were recorded by The New York Times. A full transcript: nytimes.com/supremecourt. 


Abortion

SENATOR SPECTER -- Starting with the woman's right to choose, Judge Alito, do you accept the legal principles articulated in Griswold v. Connecticut that the liberty clause in the Constitution carries with it the right to privacy?

JUDGE ALITO -- Senator, I do agree that the Constitution protects a right to privacy. And it protects the right to privacy in a number of ways. The Fourth Amendment certainly speaks to the right of privacy. People have a right to privacy in their homes and in their papers and in their persons. And the standard for whether something is a search is whether there's an invasion of a right to privacy, a legitimate expectation of privacy.

SENATOR SPECTER -- Well, Griswold dealt with the right to privacy on contraception for married women. You agree with that?

JUDGE ALITO -- I agree that Griswold is now, I think, understood by the Supreme Court as based on the liberty clauses of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment.

SENATOR SPECTER -- Would you agree, also, with Eisenstadt, which carried forward Griswold to single people?

JUDGE ALITO -- I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt.

SENATOR SPECTER -- Let me move now directly into Casey v. Planned Parenthood and picking up the gravamen of Casey as it has applied Roe on the woman's right to choose, originating from the privacy clause with Griswold being its antecedent. And I want to take you through some of the specific language of Casey to see what your views are and what weight you would ascribe to this rationale as you would view the woman's right to choose.
 In Casey, the joint opinion said, quote, People have ordered their thinking and lives around Roe. To eliminate the issue of reliance would be detrimental. For two decades of economic and social development, people have organized intimate relationships and reliance on the availability of abortion in the event contraception should fail -- pretty earthy language but that's the Supreme Court's language. And the court went on to say, quote, The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has become facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.
 Now that states in specific terms the principle of reliance, which is one of the mainstays, if not the mainstay, on stare decisis precedent to follow tradition. How would you weight that consideration on the woman's right to choose?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important doctrine. It's a fundamental part of our legal system. And it's the principle that courts in general should follow their past precedents. And it's important for a variety of reasons. It's important because it limits the power of the judiciary. It's important because it protects reliance interests. And it's important because it reflects the view that courts should respect the judgments and the wisdom that are embodied in prior judicial decisions. It's not an inexorable command, but it is a general presumption that courts are going to follow prior precedents. And, as you mentioned --

SENATOR SPECTER -- Well, how do you come to grips with the specifics where the court, the joint opinion, spoke of reliance on the availability of abortion in the event contraception should fail? On that specific concept of reliance.

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, reliance is, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, one of the important foundations of the doctrine of stare decisis. It is intended to protect reliance interests. And people can rely on judicial decisions in a variety of ways. There can be concrete economic reliance, government institutions can be built up in reliance on prior decisions, practices of agencies and government officials can be molded based on reliance. People can rely on decisions in a variety of ways. And my view --

SENATOR SPECTER -- Let me move on to another important quotation out of Casey. Quote, A terrible price would be paid for overruling Casey, for overruling Roe. It would seriously weaken the court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and to overrule Roe under fire would subvert the court's legitimacy. Do you see the legitimacy of the court being involved in the precedent of Casey?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I think that the court, and all the courts -- the Supreme Court, my court -- all the federal courts should be insulated from public opinion. They should do what the law requires in all instances. That's why the members of the judiciary are not elected. We have a basically democratic form of government, but the judiciary is not elected, and that's the reason, so that they don't do anything under fire. They do what the law requires.

SENATOR SPECTER -- But do you think there is as fundamental a concern as legitimacy of the court would be involved if Roe were to be overturned?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that the legitimacy of the court would be undermined in any case if the court made a decision based on its perception of public opinion. It should make its decisions based on the Constitution and the law. It should not sway in the wind of public opinion at any time.

SENATOR SPECTER -- There's just the final quotation that I intend to raise from Casey and it is, quote, After nearly 20 years of litigation in Roe's wake, we are satisfied that the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe's resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding. That separates out the original soundness of Roe, which has been criticized, and then lays emphasis on the precedential value. How would you weigh that consideration, were this issue to come before you, if confirmed?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I agree that in every case in which there is a prior precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare decisis and the presumption is that the court will follow its prior precedents. There needs to be a special justification for overruling a prior precedent.

SENATOR SPECTER -- Judge Alito, the commentators have characterized Casey as a superprecedent. Judge Luttig, in the case of Richmond Medical Center, called the Casey decision super stare decisis. And in quoting from Casey, Judge Luttig pointed out the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed. And then, in support of Judge Luttig's conclusion that Casey was super stare decisis, he refers to Stenberg v. Carhart and quotes the Supreme Court saying, We shall not revisit these legal principles.
 Now, that's a pretty strong statement for the court to make, that we shall not revisit the principles upon which Roe was founded. And the concept of a super stare decisis or superprecedent arises, as the commentators have characterized it, by a number of different justices appointed over a considerable period of time. Do you agree that Casey is a superprecedent or a super stare decisis, as Judge Luttig said?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I personally would not get into categorizing precedents as superprecedents or super-duper precedents or anything --

SENATOR SPECTER -- You say super-duper?

JUDGE ALITO -- Right.

SENATOR SPECTER -- Good.

JUDGE ALITO -- Any sort of categorization like that sort of reminds me of the size of laundry detergent in the supermarket.
 I agree with the underlying thought that when a precedent is reaffirmed, that strengthens the precedent. And when the Supreme Court says that we are not going to -- 

SENATOR SPECTER -- How about being reaffirmed 38 times?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I think that when a precedent is reaffirmed, each time it's reaffirmed that is a factor that should be taken into account in making the judgment about stare decisis. And when a precedent is reaffirmed on the ground that stare decisis precludes or counsels against re-examination of the merits of the precedent, then I agree that that is a precedent on precedent.
 Now, I don't want to leave the impression that stare decisis is an inexorable command, because the Supreme Court has said that it is not. But it is a judgment that has to be based, taking into account all of the factors that are relevant and that are set out in the Supreme Court's cases.

SENATOR SPECTER -- Judge Alito, during the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts, I displayed a chart. I don't ordinarily like charts, but this one I think has a lot of weight because it lists all 38 cases which have been decided since Roe, where the Supreme Court of the United States had the opportunity to -- Senator Hatch is in the picture.

SENATOR LEAHY -- Just balance it on Orrin's head.

SENATOR SPECTER -- It's a good photo-op for Senator Hatch. Senator Leahy's complaining.

SENATOR LEAHY -- Balance it on Orrin's head.

SENATOR HATCH -- He wants that over by Leahy.

SENATOR SPECTER -- He wants it on his side.
 Well, I think the point of it is that there have been so many cases, so many cases -- 15 after your statement in 1985 that I'm about to come to and 8 after Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which is why it has a special significance. And I'm not going to press the point about superprecedent. I'm glad I didn't have to mention super-duper, that you did. Thank you very much.
 Let me come now to the statement you made in 1985 that the Constitution does not provide a basis for a woman's right to an abortion. Do you agree with that statement today, Judge Alito?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, that was a correct statement of what I thought in 1985 from my vantage point in 1985, and that was as a line attorney in the Department of Justice in the Reagan administration.
 Today, if the issue were to come before me, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed and the issue were to come before me, the first question would be the question that we've been discussing and that's the issue of stare decisis. And if the analysis were to get beyond that point, then I would have to approach the question with an open mind and I would listen to the arguments that were made.

SENATOR SPECTER -- So you would approach it with an open mind notwithstanding your 1985 statement?

JUDGE ALITO -- Absolutely, senator. That was a statement that I made at a prior period of time when I was performing a different role.
 And as I said yesterday, when someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge thinks about legal issues.

Search and Seizure

SENATOR LEAHY -- Let's go into a couple of search cases. And I think we've indicated to you that we'd bring these up. Doe v. Groody, Baker v. Monroe Township, those are unauthorized searches.
 In Doe, the police officers had a warrant for a man at a certain address. When they arrived, they found his wife and 10-year-old daughter. They were not in the warrant. They posed no threat. But the officers detained them and strip-searched them, wife and the 10-year-old, the 10-year-old girl.
 Baker, her mother and her three teenage children were detained and searched when they arrived at the home of the mother's adult son. They didn't live there. They weren't in the home. They were outside. They didn't pose a threat to the police but they were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. They were handcuffed. They were taken into the house, and they were searched. 
 Doe, the strip-search case of the 10-year-old girl, the officers didn't ask for permission to search anybody beyond the man they were looking for. In fact the magistrate didn't give a search warrant for anybody else. 
 But you went beyond that, and you said that they were justified in strip-searching this 10-year-old and the mother. You went beyond the four corners of the search warrant the magistrate gave. 
 And one of your members of the Third Circuit, Judge Chertoff, who's now the head of homeland security, and a former prosecutor, criticized your reasoning. He said that it would allow it to come dangerously close to displacing the critical role of the independent magistrate. 
 Do you continue to hold the position you took in your opinion? Or do you now agree with the majority -- they're right and you're wrong?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, senator, I haven't had occasion to think that what I said in that case was correct. But let me just explain what was going on there. The issue there was whether -- the first issue was whether the warrant authorized the search of people who were on the premises. And that was the disagreement between me and the majority. And it was a rather technical issue about whether the affidavit that was submitted by the police officers was properly incorporated into the warrant for the purposes of saying who could be searched. And I thought that it was, and I thought that it was quite clear that the magistrate had authorized a search for people who were on the premises.
 That was the point of disagreement. 
 I was not pleased that a young girl was searched in that case, and I said so in my opinion. That was an undesirable thing. But the issue wasn't whether there should be some sort of rule or Fourth Amendment law that a minor can never be searched. And I think if we were to -- 

SENATOR LEAHY -- But we'd both agree on that, judge. The only reason I bring up these two cases -- it seems in both of them you went beyond the four corners of the search warrant and you settled all issues in a light most favorable -- the majority in the opinion didn't, but you did -- in the light most favorable to law enforcement.
 In fact, in Baker the majority said that. And I worry about this because I always worry that the courts must be there to protect individuals against an overreaching government. In this case, your position in the minority was that you protected what the majority felt was an overreaching government. 
 Am I putting too strong an analysis on that? 

JUDGE ALITO -- I do think you are, Senator.

SENATOR LEAHY -- O.K.

JUDGE ALITO -- I think you need to take into account what was going on here. The police officers prepared an affidavit, and they said, We have probable cause to believe that this drug dealer hides drugs on people who are on the premises, and therefore when we search, we want authorization, not just to search him, but to search everybody who's found on the premises because we think he hides -- we have reason to believe he hides drugs there.
 And the magistrate who issued the warrant said that the affidavit was incorporated into the warrant for the purpose of establishing probable cause. 
 Now, we're supposed to read warrants in a common-sense fashion because they're prepared by police officers, for the most part, not by lawyers and they're often prepared under a lot of time pressure. 
 And it seemed to me that reading this in a common-sense fashion, what the magistrate intended to do was to say, yes, you have authorization to do what you ask us to do. 
 But even beyond that, the issue there was whether these police officers could be sued for damages. And they couldn't be sued for damages if a reasonable officer could have believed that that's what the magistrate intended to authorize. And I thought that surely a reasonable officer could view it that way.
 Now, Judge Chertoff looked at it differently. And there are cases where reasonable people disagree.

SENATOR LEAHY Let me --

JUDGE ALITO -- And that's all that was going on.

SENATOR LEAHY -- I know. Looking at reasonable -- I spent eight years in law enforcement. I don't know where any reasonable officer under those circumstances would feel they could strip-search a 10-year-old girl.

Law Enforcement Immunity

SENATOR KENNEDY -- Mellott v. Heemer, where the U.S. Marshal Service forcibly evicted a family of dairy farmers from their home and their farm. These farmers had no criminal record and were suspected of no crime. But after they fell on very hard times, the property was sold at a public auction. U.S. marshals were sent to evict them.
 Remember, the marshals were sent to carry out a civil action. Not a criminal action, a civil action. These farmers had committed no crime. 
 Now, I respect the U.S. marshals. They have a tough job, and they do it with great professionalism. But in this case the marshals entered the house with loaded guns. The family was unarmed, did not resist. But still the marshals pointed loaded guns at their heads, chests and backs. One marshal chambered a cartridge in his gun. Twice they pushed the wife into her chair. 
 The trial judge held there was enough evidence in this case to have a jury review the facts, hear the testimony and decide whether the marshals used too much force to evict these farmers. 
 But that didn't sit well with you, Judge Alito. You grabbed the case away from the jury. You wouldn't let them hear the testimony or make up their own mind about whether the marshals had gone too far. No, you simply substituted your judgment for the jury's and decided that the marshals' conduct was, as a matter of law, objectively reasonable. Judgment for the marshals, no jury of their peers for the farmers. 
 Why, Judge Alito? 
 Your colleague on the Third Circuit, Judge Rendell, called the marshals' conduct Gestapo-like. Gestapo-like. She said that seven marshals detained, terrorized a family and friends, ransacked a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction. 
 The trial judge thought the decision should be made by the jury. Why didn't you let the jury exercise an independent check on the marshals' actions? 

JUDGE ALITO -- There was some additional information regarding these people that was important. And that was that they had threatened other people, as I recall. And there was evidence about the possession of weapons and evidence that they would be dangerous. And that was the basis on which the marshals acted the way they did.
 This was a case in which the marshals were sued for civil damages. And they asserted what's called the qualified immunity defense. And that means that if a reasonable person could have thought there was a basis for doing what they did, then they are entitled not to be tried. 
 And that's the law. I didn't make up that law. 

SENATOR KENNEDY -- No, they -- that's right.

SENATOR SPECTER -- Let him finish, Senator Kennedy.

JUDGE ALITO -- That's not a legal standard that I made up. And that was the way I saw the case. And that's the way the other judge, who was in the majority, saw the case. Now these cases involve difficult line-drawing arguments at times, and I respect Judge Rendell's view of this very much. But reasonable people will view these things differently.

SENATOR KENNEDY -- Well, the issue then was the actions of the marshals: whether it was reasonable, whether it was reasonable. And here you have a judge, Judge Rendell, saying it was Gestapo-like, to talk about terrorizing a family and friends, ransacking a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction.
 Aren't juries there to make a judgment and determination whether it was reasonable or not reasonable? And didn't your action take that away because you ruled, as a matter of law, that their conduct was reasonable?

JUDGE ALITO -- The Supreme Court has told us how we have to handle this issue. And it is for the judiciary to decide in the first place whether a reasonable officer could have thought that what the officer was doing was consistent with the Fourth Amendment. And we have to make that decision.
 Now, if we decide that there's an issue of fact, if there's a dispute in the testimony about the evidence that the marshals had or about what these individuals were doing at the time when the search is taking place or what the marshals did, then certainly those factual issues have to be resolved by the jury. 

Executive Power

SENATOR GRAHAM -- Do you believe that any president, because we're at war, could say the statute on torture gets in the way of my ability to defend the United States, therefore, I don't have to comply with it?

JUDGE ALITO -- The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws of the United States that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. That's the principle. The president is not above the Constitution and the laws. Now, there are issues about the interpretation of the laws and the interpretation of the Constitution but --

SENATOR GRAHAM -- Are you a strict constructionist?

JUDGE ALITO -- I think it depends on what you mean by that phrase and if you --

SENATOR GRAHAM -- Well, let's forget that. We'll never get the end of that. Have you heard the term used?

JUDGE ALITO -- I have heard the term used.

SENATOR GRAHAM -- Is it fair to say that when it's used by politicians, people like me, that we're trying to tell the public we want a judge who looks at things very narrowly, that doesn't make a bunch of stuff up? Is that a fair understanding of what a strict constructionist may be in the political world?

JUDGE ALITO -- Well, if a strict constructionist is a judge who doesn't make things up, then I'm a strict constructionist.

SENATOR GRAHAM -- There you go.

JUDGE ALITO -- I agree with that, Senator.

SENATOR GRAHAM -- Now, if there's a force resolution that Congress passes to allow any president to engage in military activity against someone trying to do us harm, and the force resolution says the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or just make it generic, if someone argued that that declaration from Congress was a blanket exemption to the warrant requirement under FISA, would that be a product of strict constructionist legal reasoning?

JUDGE ALITO -- I think that a strict constructionist, as you understand it, would engage in a certain process in evaluating that question. And a strict constructionist, a person who interprets the law -- and that's how I would put it -- a person who interprets the law would look at the language of the authorization for the use of military force and legislative history that was informative, maybe past practices where there are prior enactments that are analogous to that, what was the understanding of those, and a host of other considerations that might go into the interpretive process.

HEADLINE: Creeping Up On Diners: Stealth Charges

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni

 BODY:
IF you want some red wine with dinner at the opulent new restaurant Gilt in Midtown Manhattan, your options typically rise from a minimum of $20 to a maximum of $1,000, with a median of $55 and an average of $246. That range is about what you would expect, but for this: It's not for red wine by the bottle.
 It's for red wine by the glass.
And while Gilt's pour may exceed the usual, this munificence is a matter of only a few droplets, judging from a $24 glass of 2004 Cakebread sauvignon blanc I had recently. 
 I could have chosen a lesser sauvignon blanc for the veritable pittance of $18, the cheapest alternative among nine whites and the only alternative under $20. But I also could have spent up to $225.
 Is Gilt an aberration? Yes and no. You'll find few New York restaurants at which Bacchus is such a bully and a snob. But you'll find more and more with tactics, which sometimes seem like tricks, for making a meal costlier than it first appears to be. With add-ons that stealthily add up. With menus like minefields, financially perilous to anyone who strays broadly and heedlessly across them.
 At Gilt, an extreme case in point, an advertised fixed price of $92 for two savory courses and dessert turns out to be fiction, even apart from the wine. When I dined there, three of eight appetizer options entailed supplemental charges, and those supplements weren't paltry, ranging from $18 to $28. One of seven entrees had a supplement of $16, while another had a surcharge of $18.
 When I dined at the new restaurant Telepan on the Upper West Side, I spent $15.50 on roasted cauliflower with a special herb oil and crushed heirloom shell beans. Granted, the cauliflower came in three kinds and colors, and it was exceptional cauliflower, undoubtedly artisanal cauliflower, for all I knew the Kobe of cauliflower, hand-massaged and moistened hourly with atomized Evian.
 But still, it was cauliflower. And as noteworthy as its price was its placement on the menu in a category of ''Mid Course'' dishes, which was printed after the appetizers and before the entrees and planted the suggestion that a diner who wanted to experience the restaurant fully needed three savory chapters, with respective average costs of about $13, $17 and $27.
 The structure of the menu at Telepan, which opened in December, recalls the structure of the menu at Thor, which opened in September.
 Like Telepan, Thor points diners toward two courses prior to the entree, dividing what other restaurants might label appetizers into distinct categories called ''Cold Plates to Start'' and ''Warm Plates in the Middle.'' Thor has yet another category called ''From the Market on the Side,'' which is where items like roasted or pureed potatoes lurk, entailing surcharges of $6 each.
 Thor's chef, Kurt Gutenbrunner, said in a telephone interview that despite the semantic cues ''to start'' and ''in the middle,'' the menu is not some culinary bait-and-bait designed to fatten checks by persuading diners to order a little from here, a little from there and, while they're at it, some quark spaetzle or fennel and figs from way over there.
 Like other architects of today's increasingly segmented menus, Mr. Gutenbrunner said his goal was to give diners more options and control.
 ''When people are going out, they know exactly how much they're going to spend the minute they walk out the door, and they're not going to spend more,'' he said. ''And if you somehow make them, you've lost a long-term customer.''
 But what if it's only a little more?
 Vicki Freeman, one of the owners of Cookshop, which opened in Chelsea in September, said the existence on its menu of an appetizerlike category for ''snacks'' has not prompted the diners who order snacks to forgo conventional appetizers, which still have their own category. It has prompted them to explore both categories, and a check for a table of two is $5 to $6 higher as a result.
 The broadening presence of snacks on menus -- Taku, which opened in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn in June, also has them -- provides just one example of rampant category inflation.
 A few blocks north of Cookshop, at D'or Ahn, which also opened in September, there are four savory categories (''raw,'' ''cold,'' ''hot,'' and ''side'') for modestly portioned dishes, in addition to a category for entrees.
 Italian restaurants all over the city separate the crudi from the appetizers and the verdure, or vegetables, from the salumi, and before you know it, your $15 pappardelle has become a $50 production.
 Restaurant consultants and industry observers say that actual prices of appetizers, entrees and fixed-price multicourse meals at upscale restaurants haven't been rising as fast as inflation. But perhaps because of that, they say, some surprising surcharges have popped up.
 When I ate lunch a few months ago at Bann, a new Korean restaurant in Midtown, the lettuce and miso paste that other Korean restaurants consider a complimentary accouterment to barbecued meat entailed an extra $3.
 Over the last year, I've been struck by how cunningly many servers push bottled water, asking diners if they want ''still'' or ''sparkling'' without ever mentioning a less taxing possibility. In restaurants, apparently, ''tap'' is a four-letter word.
 I've had servers wordlessly replace finished bottles of water with new ones, so that my companions and I realized only when the bill arrived that we'd had five bottles at a cost of $60. That's insidious, and that's insane.
 But it's indicative of the sneakiness at loose upon the restaurant landscape. 
 Sneaky is a fair word for Gilt (where, it should be noted, wines by the bottle aren't as shockingly expensive as by the glass). Gilt opened in December in a series of sumptuous rooms inside the New York Palace Hotel, replacing Le Cirque 2000. 
 While other fixed-price menus have dishes with supplemental charges, I have not seen another New York menu on which the percentage of those dishes is so high. Or on which the charges seem so odd. There's no supplement for lobster, but there's $16 for lamb and $18 for a portion of Dover sole that, when I sampled it, could be consumed in fewer than 10 bites. 
 Gilt may present itself as comparable in price to Jean Georges and Le Bernardin, both of which charge $95 for three savory courses and dessert. But tack on the surcharges and a glass or two of white -- at Jean Georges you can get one for $9, at Le Bernardin for $13 -- and Gilt has lofted you to unexpected stratospheres of spending.
 It's hardly the only New York restaurant these days that takes you there.

HEADLINE: Can New Orleans Save the Soul Of Its Food?

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
WILLIE MAE SEATON and her wet-battered fried chicken were honored last year in New York in front of thousands of the nation's food elite. Bob Iacovone of Cuvee was enjoying his own measure of success, drawing national notice for his continental Creole food.
 A few weeks ago, Willie Mae Seaton, 89, sat sweating on the stoop of her moldering New Orleans restaurant. About all that was left were a few gallons of unopened vegetable oil, a hulk of an old stove and a shrine to Jesus.
About a mile away, in a part of the city Katrina left intact, Mr. Iacovone was in crisp chef's whites, combining Louisiana lump crabmeat with Brie and orzo. He had a full house coming to dinner.
 Race and money have long separated this city's po' boy counters from its white-tablecloth restaurants. But the line between the two was easily crossed in pursuit of something that tasted good. Mandina's and Henry's Soul Food were New Orleans institutions as surely as Antoine's and Galatoire's. 
 They were equally loved, but, it turns out, not equally protected. Among those who care about New Orleans food, the debate is whether the high can survive without the low.
 ''If New Orleans becomes all about foie gras with grits, you've lost something grand,'' said John T. Edge, the food writer and head of the Southern Foodways Alliance. ''Those of us who live to eat are wringing our hands and wondering what's going to happen to places like Willie Mae's.''
 Miss Seaton's double shotgun shack has for half a century held her home, a 30-seat Creole-soul restaurant and a little bar where she once served her signature cocktail, milk and scotch. Like thousands of others here, she wasn't insured against the water that soaked the place to the studs four months ago. And like other old-line neighborhood spots, even with a cleanup, the cost of expensive upgrades to meet modern health codes could keep the doors shut for good. 
 Still, she seems undeterred.
 ''I've got to come back,'' she said, ''because I don't have any other home.''
 Meanwhile, the other side of the restaurant recovery is being played out in the French Quarter, the central business district and the handful of other neighborhoods that stayed dry. Mr. Iacovone said his biggest headaches are getting clean uniforms and enough dishwashers. He is cooking on crutches, having broken his knee on a holiday skiing vacation in Colorado. 
 He started working on Cuvee about three weeks after Katrina hit at the end of August. By Oct. 4, he was open. Floodwaters didn't reach Cuvee, and the hotel adjacent to the restaurant made sure the walk-in refrigerator was mucked out. The wine cellar stayed cool enough to protect the core of the restaurant's large cache of bottles, and people at Dakota, a restaurant across Lake Pontchartrain owned by the group that owns Cuvee, provided moral and logistical support.
 At first, Mr. Iacovone fed comforting dishes like filet mignon and onion rings to recovery workers, reporters and insurance adjusters. Now about 90 percent of his customers are local, and they are ordering foie gras and $27 plates of grilled redfish served over andouille sausage and scallion hash.
 ''People are looking for a way to escape,'' he said. 
 Although the contrast between Mr. Iacovone and Miss Seaton is stark, some long-time New Orleans residents say the flood simply sped along a natural evolution in the city. Many of the beloved classics were already on a downhill slide.
 ''Some of those businesses weren't going to be long-lived regardless,'' said John Besh of Restaurant August, a native of Louisiana who will star next month in an episode of ''Iron Chef'' on the Food Network. 
 The loss of neighborhood restaurants, including Vera's, Mr. Besh's favorite little seafood shack near his home in Slidell, has made him and other higher-end chefs return to things they might have abandoned for inspiration, like bread pudding or grits. 
 Mr. Besh, for example, has simplified his riff on trout amandine, which used to appear on the menu as almond-roasted Gulf sheepshead with a Meyer lemon and crabmeat salad. He's taken to preparing the dish with trout, butter and almonds, and without a lot of culinary-school flourishes.
 ''Now more than ever I really need to be focused on the New Orleans sensibility,'' he said. ''I have a responsibility to take indigenous foods and pay them more homage.''
 Lolis Eric Elie, a columnist for The Times-Picayune who says he is like a grandson to Miss Seaton, is a lifelong student of the food of New Orleans. He's not convinced the new chefs alone can carry the culture.
 ''By the time the local food gets filtered through Besh's experience, it is wonderful but it's not always the most direct interpretation,'' he said.
 And the problem is defined by more than just cooking styles. It is impossible to look at the bleak difference between a restaurant like Cuvee and Willie Mae's Scotch House without the lens of race. Despite a population that was two-thirds black pre-Katrina, the city had far more white-owned restaurants than black.
 ''Black restaurants had two problems,'' Mr. Elie said. ''Geography and financial stability.'' 
 But many of the white-owned restaurants were small, neighborhood places that were hit as hard as Miss Seaton's. 
 ''We could very easily take a tour of white-owned restaurants and you'd go, oh my god, are they ever coming back?'' Mr. Elie said. 
 Residents and chefs alike are rallying around each neighborhood restaurant that reopens, black, white or otherwise. It's as if every little sandwich shop that manages to fry up some shrimp is one more lifeline pulling the city back.
 ''People want to think it's race and class, but that's not what's going on with us down here,'' said Poppy Tooker, the cooking teacher and food personality. ''We're all missing each other's food, and we're missing each other. The loss is huge, and it's across the board.''
 Leah Chase, 83, is working to gut and rebuild her flooded Creole-soul restaurant, Dooky Chase. It sits a few blocks from Miss Seaton's, just down the street from the nearly abandoned Lafitte housing project in the Treme neighborhood. With more money and more adult children to help, Mrs. Chase might open her restaurant by Mardi Gras.
 Her daughter, also named Leah Chase, said everyone in New Orleans, no matter what race or class, misses a favorite food. But depending on who you are and what part of town you grew up in, the dishes one longs for are different.
 ''Everyone's shuffling to find that little place they used to go to,'' she said.
 There are other, very practical costs to losing neighborhood restaurants. Local places serve as clubhouses, signaling to a community that it is worth gutting out a flooded house to try again. And there is a clear dollars-and-cents symbiosis between high and low. 
 ''If Leah's neighborhood doesn't come back, we won't have workers,'' Mr. Besh said. 
 They also might not have the inspiration that New Orleans working-class cooking provided, Mr. Edge said. Although high-end chefs who care about gumbos and other blue-collar cuisine can validate those dishes by putting them on the menu, it doesn't preserve the soul of New Orleans cooking. What might fade forever are places where the history of a dish was in the hands of a cook who had made it thousands of times.
 ''You lose the small 'd' democracy of those foods at a white-tablecloth restaurant,'' he said.
 To preserve a little of that small ''d,'' Mr. Edge and Mr. Elie have developed a plan to help Miss Seaton. On Friday, the first of four volunteer weekend work parties will start, Habitat-for-Humanity style. 
 The work crews are a mix of out-of-town writers, food historians, chefs and local people who want to help. The Heritage Conservation Network will act as foreman, and Mr. Besh will help feed the crew.
 They have volunteered because they want to preserve one half of the whole that makes New Orleans such a great town to eat in. And because in the end, food might be the only thing that transcends race, class and hurricanes.
 ''I'm going to tell you the truth and tell it like it is,'' Miss Seaton said. ''The white people really like my soul food. If they like it enough to help me, that's just beautiful, baby.''

PERSON: David S. Kruidenier

HEADLINE: David S. Kruidenier, 84, Publisher and Philanthropist

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
David S. Kruidenier, a former publisher of The Des Moines Register who devoted much of his post-newspaper career to revitalizing downtown Des Moines, died on Monday in Des Moines. He was 84. 
 The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
Mr. Kruidenier was a member of the Cowles family, which entered the Des Moines newspaper business in 1904 when Mr. Kruidenier's maternal grandfather, Gardner Cowles, bought The Register.
 The Cowles Media Company eventually grew to include The Des Moines Tribune, The Minneapolis Star and Tribune and other newspaper, radio and television properties in Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
 Mr. Kruidenier started in the family business in 1948 as a trainee at The Minneapolis Star and Tribune, moving to Des Moines three years later to join The Register and Tribune. In 1971, he became the president, publisher and chairman, which he remained until 1985.
 Throughout his decades in the newspaper business, Mr. Kruidenier faced an industrywide decline in circulation and profits. In 1982, he was a crucial figure in the decision to close The Des Moines Tribune, an afternoon paper, after its circulation slumped. Three years later, the Gannett Company bought The Register for approximately $165 million, ending 81 years of Cowles family ownership. 
 Under the leadership of Mr. Kruidenier, The Register was one of the top newspapers in the country, winning 3 of its 15 Pulitzer Prizes. 
 Mr. Kruidenier was an avid supporter of the arts and business development in Des Moines He recruited I. M. Pei in the 1960's and Richard Meier in the 1980's to design wings of the Des Moines Art Center. In the 1970's, he led an effort to raise $9 million for the completion of a downtown civic center.
 After the Cowles Media properties were sold in 1998, Mr. Kruidenier turned his attention full time to philanthropy and the Kruidenier Foundation. He gave millions to other projects to improve the city center.
 David Scholte Kruidenier was born in 1921 in Des Moines. From 1942 to 1945, he served in World War II as an Army Air Force officer.
 After his military service, Mr. Kruidenier graduated from Yale. He later earned a master's degree in business administration from Harvard. 
 Mr. Kruidenier was a trustee of the Des Moines Art Center and with his wife, the former Elizabeth Stuart, owned a vast personal art collection.
 In addition to his wife, Mr. Kruidenier is survived by their daughter, Lisa Kruidenier, of Colorado.

HEADLINE: Of Time and Tide, and Preservation Battles

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT

DATELINE: WESTERLY, R.I. 

 BODY:
For more than a year, preservationists fought to save the Ocean House hotel from demolition, citing its historical significance as one of the last wooden Victorian-era hotels on Rhode Island's coast.
 Situated in the Watch Hill National Register Historic District, an exclusive enclave of shingle-style homes, the Ocean House recalled Watch Hill's illustrious past as a summer resort for the well-to-do, a quiet community where houses were passed down from generation to generation and outsiders with new money were few and far between.
 But the past, it appears, cannot always be saved. 
 After buying the Ocean House last year, Bluff Avenue, a partnership headed by a Wall Street investment adviser, Charles M. Royce, decided that the rambling yellow hotel, built in 1868, was too decrepit to be restored. Demolition crews using a giant claw began to tear down the building late in December, upsetting even those who agreed with the developers that the building should come down. 
 ''It was painful,'' recalled Paula Ruisi, a Watch Hill native who watched the claw attack the hotel's kitchen on a cold clear day just before Christmas. ''People wanted to save that building.'' 
 Bluff Avenue has pledged to replicate the Ocean House in the same location; that effort, to start late this year, is to cost $60 million. The hotel, with 45 to 50 rooms, is to resemble the old Ocean House in its architectural detail and contain many items that were salvaged before demolition began. 
 Among the items destined for a second life are the hotel's front door and its large wooden reception desk. The new hotel, like the original, is also to have a columned porch and be painted yellow. (The hotel had been painted white just before the demolition in order to control the dust from old lead paint.)
 ''When you walk in, it's going to look and feel like the old hotel,'' said Meg Lyons, an architect with Centerbrook Architects of Essex, Conn., the firm designing the new hotel.
 The project also includes 15 to 20 condominiums, which the developers say are necessary to make the hotel economically worthwhile. Condos aside, preservationists say replicating a building is not the same thing as saving one.
 ''A replica is a new building, not an old building,'' said Edward F. Sanderson, executive director of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission, a state agency that had worked with residents and Westerly town officials to save the Ocean House.
 Mr. Sanderson said he did not disagree that the old hotel was too deteriorated to restore. A report commissioned by the developers found that the hotel's basic support of wooden trusses had been severely compromised over the years by the addition of plumbing, electricity and other modern amenities. Still, he said, ''the idea of a replica did not and still does not sit particularly well with the preservation community.''
 A summer resident of Watch Hill for the last 15 years or so, Mr. Royce became involved with plans for the Ocean House in spring 2004. At that time, a developer in Connecticut was planning to raze the hotel and build five luxury homes in its place. Alarmed residents and preservationists began a ''Save the Ocean House'' campaign.
 That developer, Girouard Associates of New Canaan, would have been allowed to build houses on the site, since the property is in a residential neighborhood and zoned for residential use. The site is approximately 11 and a half acres and slopes gently down to a scenic ocean beach. 
 But the preservationists believed strongly that a hotel was more in keeping with the historic use of the site. They also feared that the new houses would be too large for the genteel historic district and that they would block the public's access and view to the ocean.
 For years, Watch Hill had been a quiet community where everyone knew everyone else, Ms. Ruisi said. But in recent years, it has been discovered by wealthy out-of-towners eager to build big homes -- too large in her view. ''Watch Hill is all about scale,'' she said. ''It's all about sensibilities.'' 
 If the Ocean House was to give way to large single-family homes, it could set an unwanted precedent for the future, she said.
 To many people, Mr. Royce, president of the Royce Funds, appeared on the scene like a white knight. Not only did he rescue the hotel, by buying it from Girouard for $11.5 million, but he also said he would restore the Ocean House or replicate it if the building was beyond repair. 
 This pledge was formalized in a zoning amendment that Mr. Royce helped to create; it specified in great detail the architectural elements he was required to replicate. The amendment also required Mr. Royce to work with state preservationists on the design and to reimburse the town for hiring three preservationists to review his plans. 
 The zoning amendment, adopted unanimously by the Westerly Town Council in November 2004, created a historic oceanfront hotel district that overlays the residential one. This means Mr. Royce can still build houses on the site if he chooses. But, reached recently in Florida, Mr. Royce said he was committed to building the replica. ''I'm not going to build houses on my watch,'' he said.
 It was not his first foray into Watch Hill preservation. About eight years ago, when a housing development was proposed for the historic Avondale Farm, Mr. Royce bought the property and has since set aside much of it as a preserve. 
 He said his preference would have been to renovate the Ocean House, but experts told him it probably could not be done. An inspection commissioned by Bluff Avenue found sagging ceilings, drooping floors, a crumbling foundation, sinking columns and severely damaged trusses, among other problems. 
 ''The work envisioned is quite nearly impossible to achieve, and even were it achievable it would leave little left of the original building and its finish,'' the report stated.
 The original hotel was built to accommodate a growing leisure class freed from the constraints of the Civil War and flush with industrial wealth. Like Newport, R.I., Watch Hill became a popular summer resort in the second half of the 19th century. At one time, it had seven large hotels, but only the Ocean House escaped the fires and hurricanes that destroyed the others.
 In recent years, the Ocean House could rent out only 59 of its 154 rooms because of its dilapidated condition. It closed in 2003 after it could no longer meet the state's fire code. In March 2004, the heirs of Louis D. Miller sold it to Girouard for approximately $13.2 million.
 Before demolition, the developers saved everything deemed historically significant and planned to reuse it in the new hotel or to reproduce it. The less important items, like appliances, lamps and rugs, were auctioned off, with some of the proceeds going to a nonprofit organization that supports drug recovery programs, a cause of Mr. Royce's.
 He also has evident feelings for the faded building he had to tear down. ''It just broke my heart that it was going to be turned into McMansions,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Stays Above 11,000 In a Flat Day of Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks closed basically flat yesterday, one day after a January rally carried the Dow Jones industrial average to a close above 11,000 for the first time since June 2001.
 Disappointing earnings from Alcoa, the first of the 30 Dow industrials to report results, concerned investors. The Dow fell more than 44 points in opening trading but rebounded in the afternoon to close nearly even. The Nasdaq composite rose slightly after Apple Computer hit a 52-week high.
 The mixed day came after a surge in buying during the first five trading days of 2006 that sent all the major indexes to at least four-and-a-half-year highs. The rally took off after the Federal Reserve signaled that it was near the end of its streak of short-term interest rate increases. 
 ''This has been one of the strongest starts of the year we've had in many years,'' said Linda Duessel, market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. ''You shouldn't expect it to keep on going.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.32, or nearly zero percent, to 11,011.58. The Dow gained 52.59 on Monday to close at 11,011.90. Before that, the last time the Dow finished above 11,000 was June 7, 2001, when it closed at 11,090.74.
 Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.46, or 0.04 percent, to 1,289.69, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.63 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,320.32.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.75, or 0.67 percent, to 710.99. The Russell rose 6.85 on Monday, closing at 706.24, the first time the index pierced the 700 level.
 Bonds fell, with the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declining 15/32 to 100 18/32 by late in the day. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.43 percent, from 4.37 percent late Monday.
 The dollar was little changed against other major currencies. Gold prices fell after briefly reaching their highest level in 25 years.
 Crude oil futures fell after rising on concerns that Iran was restarting its nuclear program and would further destabilize the Middle East. A barrel of light crude settled at $63.37, down 13 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Yesterday's only meaningful economic data was the Commerce Department's November wholesale inventory report, which, excluding petroleum products, was nearly flat.
 ''I think this is a one-day pause,'' said Philip S. Dow, managing director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. ''I'd be really surprised if this was all there is to this rally.''
 The day's trading pattern was the reverse of one seen often in last year's sell-off. Losses narrowed in the afternoon and advancing issues caught up with decliners. In December, investors saw many early leads whittled to losses as declining issues met advancers.
 Alcoa fell 97 cents, to $29.60, after it missed Wall Street's earnings projections. The company said energy costs and refineries impaired by Gulf Coast hurricanes trimmed its quarterly income 16 percent.
 Phelps Dodge, one of the world's largest copper producers, fell $7.97, or 5.2 percent, to $146.58 after it said fourth-quarter earnings would fall well below previous expectations, with higher copper prices, shortfalls in production and sales, and one-time costs dragging down profits.
 Apple Computer hit a new 52-week high, climbing $4.81 to $80.86, after the company said it sold 14 million iPods over the holidays, up from 4.6 million a year ago. The company also said that it would shift to Intel microprocessors earlier than expected. Intel fell 35 cents, to $26.12.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners roughly 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 1.73 billion shares, up from 1.72 billion on Monday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Boston Front Office Seems Sure-Handed

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
IN the expansion draft that created the Mets, the team made Hobie Landrith their first pick. Why, Casey Stengel was asked, did the Mets select a catcher first?
 ''You gotta have someone back there to catch the ball,'' Stengel replied as only he could. ''Otherwise, you're gonna have a lot of passed balls.''
Not that they had Stengel's immortal words in mind when they reached agreement with J. T. Snow the other day, but it's good that the Boston Red Sox signed a first baseman because otherwise they would have a lot of throws from their infielders bouncing into the dugout. 
 Snow's signing did not satisfy all of the Red Sox' needs. Pennant-winning teams are supposed to be strong up the middle, and if the Red Sox opened the season today, they would watch a lot of balls go through the hole at shortstop and others fall for hits in center field. 
 The Red Sox are smart enough, though, to know they have to fill those holes. If they cannot trade for a shortstop -- Julio Lugo of Tampa Bay, for one -- they are prepared to put Alex Cora at short. They don't have a Johnny Damon replacement in house, but they are confident they can trade for a center fielder. Coco Crisp of Cleveland and Jeremy Reed of Seattle are mentioned most often. The Indians, though, don't have a replacement for Crisp, nor the Mariners one for Reed.
 The Red Sox have been criticized for letting Damon go to the Yankees, and maybe by the end of next season they will regret their decision. But it was an economic decision, and each club is entitled to make decisions for economic reasons. The Yankees, of all teams, made one last season by passing on Carlos Beltran, who was offered to them at a discount.
 Had the Yankees signed Beltran, they would not have had to lure Damon with a four-year, $52 million offer. The Red Sox declined to match the Damon offer, refusing to go beyond $40 million.
 An economic decision cost the Red Sox pitcher Kevin Millwood, too. They and the Rangers both offered him $12 million a year, but the Red Sox for three years and Texas for four years and possibly five. Boston's view of the overrated Millwood made more sense, but Tom Hicks, the far-too-impressionable Rangers owner, offered more dollars.
 Some critics of the Red Sox have suggested that disarray in the front office -- the departure of Theo Epstein and the naming of co-general managers to replace him -- has created problems. That idea makes no sense, though.
 Until Epstein explains otherwise, the prevailing view of the reason he walked away from a job he coveted is that he chafed working under Larry Lucchino, the chief executive. Red Sox critics cannot have it both ways. 
 If Epstein left because he tired of Lucchino's telling him what to do, that means Lucchino was running the front office; and he's still there, presumably telling Jed Hoyer and Ben Cherington what to do. So where is the disarray?
 The signing of Snow, on the contrary, shows that the front office is functioning well. ''One of the themes of this off-season has been to get better defensively,'' Lucchino said. ''Theo articulated that idea in 2004, but we got away from it in 2005.'' 
 Snow, who is expected to platoon with Kevin Youkilis, has long been considered one of the best defensive first basemen in baseball.
 One question that needs to be asked about the front office is, where is Theo? The day before Hoyer and Cherington were named co-general managers, word at Fenway Park was that Epstein would return in 7 to 10 days as a consultant. That was four weeks ago, and Theo has still not been sighted.
 ''I said that we were going to keep a light on in the window for him,'' Lucchino said Sunday. ''I didn't specify a number of days. If he wanted to come back, it would make us a better front office. I don't want to comment further until we have an announcement to make. We may have an announcement sometime soon.''
 Will the Red Sox announce this winter that they have traded Manny Ramirez? Not likely.
 Ramirez was quoted late last week as saying he wanted to stay in Boston. Then his agent said that was not necessarily what he had said. The Red Sox, meanwhile, have heard that Ramirez did say it but didn't realize he was talking to a reporter. Whatever Manny means, the Red Sox have tried to trade him, as he asked.
 ''We've tried to keep faith with the understanding we reached with Manny and his agent,'' Lucchino said. ''It has consumed some time.''
 What the Red Sox have found is what was expected: They can't come close to getting equal value for Ramirez and can't replace him in the lineup. So chances are they won't trade him.
 ''We value him enormously,'' Lucchino said. ''If we get a fair trade, in good faith, we'd consider it. But we'd be proud to have Manny continue to play for us.''

HEADLINE: The Need to Invest in Young Children 

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
This week's trip to New York could have been billed as a victory lap for Beverley Hughes, the British minister of state for children, young people and families.
 For while many American educators and policy experts have spent four decades in a slow push for universal prekindergarten programs and affordable child care, Britain's Labor government has leapt into the full agenda.
 American proponents of early childhood programs have long swooned over the support for families with young children offered in France, Belgium, Italy and the Scandinavian countries, but until recently, Britain had no place on their most-admired list. 
 Just a decade ago, when America's Head Start preschool program for low-income families was already 30 years old, Britain had nothing of the kind. But now, Sure Start, its version of Head Start, is expanding rapidly, while the United States government is considering budget cuts for Head Start. 
 Other British efforts have whooshed past anything the United States has planned: A free part-time universal preschool program for 3- and 4-year-olds is in place in Britain and it is genuinely universal, with virtually all 4-year-olds and about 95 percent of 3-year-olds enrolled. 
 The British are creating a system of extended 8 a.m.-to-6 p.m. schools, offering affordable child care for children 3 to 14, plus homework clubs, music lessons, sports and more. And since 1997, when the Labor government came in, Britain has created more than 1.2 million new child care places and adopted national day care standards, something lacking in the United States.
 So despite her restrained tone, Minister Hughes was a sort of motivational speaker yesterday, talking up her government's approach in a keynote speech at a New York conference intended to build support for government funding of early childhood programs. The conference, ''Building the Economic Case for Investments in Preschool,'' was sponsored by the Committee for Economic Development, a group of business executives and university presidents; the Pew Charitable Trust; and the PNC Financial Services Group. 
 American advocacy groups, business executives and child care experts have for years been producing conferences, research papers and studies showing that investment in high-quality preschool programs more than pays its way -- both during the school years, when it leads to fewer dropouts and special education referrals and more on-time high school graduations, and for years thereafter, when it leads to higher earnings, lower rates of teenage pregnancy and arrests. 
 For the conference organizers, the intent yesterday was to reframe the warm, fuzzy image of early childhood programs, transforming them into a hardheaded, quantifiable matter of economics and work force efficiency. 
 To that end, James J. Heckman, a Nobel Prize-winning economics professor from the University of Chicago, discussed his findings that investments in preschool programs for disadvantaged children bring far higher returns than investments later in the life span, like reduced pupil-teacher ratios, job training, convict rehabilitation or tuition subsidies. 
 And Isabel Sawhill, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit Washington-based policy organization, estimated that investment in universal preschool would increase the gross domestic product by $988 billion within 60 years. It is not an easy sell for politicians, she noted, because the initial investment is relatively high and it takes years to reap the benefits.
 ''We're a big country, bigger than England, so it takes a long time to penetrate the public consciousness,'' said Charles E.M. Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic Development. ''The British get it. The French get it. We're the largest economy in the world and it's outrageous that we don't get it yet. But I'm optimistic.''
 At the state level, 14 states increased their preschool funding by $300 million in 2004, and last year there were increases in 26 states, totaling $600 million. 
 And this year, the British government generated enthusiasm. ''We are thrilled, and awed, by our colleagues in the U.K.,'' said Sara Watson of Pew. 
 Indeed, when Ms. Hughes finished outlining her government's programs, Mr. Kolb asked the first question. ''It is rumored that your prime minister and our president sometimes talk to each other,'' he said, pausing briefly before going on to ask whether she might be able to suggest to the prime minister that he bring up the issue with President Bush.
 But as a practical matter, in this country, government support for early childhood programs has been slow to catch on.
 ''Quite frankly, we're not making a lot of progress,'' said Jim Rohr, the chief executive of PNC. ''Across the country, we're not getting the job done. This issue is not as high a priority as it should be.''
 About 700,000 American preschoolers are now in state-financed prekindergarten classes, and about 800,000 in Head Start, but that is only about 20 percent of the population. And while most states now offer some preschool programs for poor children, paying for effective programs remains problematic almost everywhere. New York, for example, instituted universal prekindergarten years ago but funded only a fraction of what it would take to actually provide it.
 To some extent, the history of the issue has continued to shape the debate. Thirty-five years ago, Congress passed legislation that would have underwritten preschool nationwide, but President Richard M. Nixon vetoed the legislation, refusing to encourage ''communal approaches to child rearing over the family-centered approach''
 '' I don't think we've ever recovered from that veto message,'' said John Brademas, president emeritus of New York University, and, as a former Democratic congressman from Illinois, a sponsor of that legislation.
 At yesterday's conference, Zogby International presented the results of a new survey finding that more than four out of five American business leaders support publicly funded prekindergarten, stressing that parental choice is a core American value and that it is voluntary prekindergarten that the leaders want to see.
 The very fact that so many business leaders are getting involved in the issue is a big step forward, some advocates say.
 ''It's a long uphill battle, but we getting a some traction, from new constituents,'' said Augusta Souza Kappner, president of the Bank Street College of Education. ''For a business-based group like the Committee for Economic Development to come close to saying we must raise taxes to support early childhood education in something important. They've signed on in a major way.''
 Ms. Hughes, meanwhile, said that in Britain she had no doubts that the Labor government's programs would live on no matter which party was in office. ''I think the ground has shifted in the U.K. to such an extent, with what's being provided already, that it would be very difficult to move back from what we have,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Puts Team in Place For the Work Of 2nd Term 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg put the finishing touches on his second-term team yesterday, forming a new cabinet that relies more heavily on longtime associates who followed him to City Hall from Bloomberg L.P. than on the career civil servants who were crucial in shaping his first administration. 
 The last person named to the team, Linda I. Gibbs, his trusted commissioner of homeless services, will become his deputy mayor for health and human services, overseeing the city's sprawling social support network, Mr. Bloomberg announced yesterday.
While Ms. Gibbs is a veteran of city government, she is the only one of four newly elevated top deputies not to have worked with Mr. Bloomberg in the private sector. In appointing trusted confidants to his inner circle, mayoral associates said, Mr. Bloomberg is effectively taking tighter control of a city government that was in large part foreign to him when he took office four years ago. 
 Taken together, they said, the moves reflect the growing confidence of Mr. Bloomberg, who has always had a strong sense of loyalty but now has a better knowledge of what works for him and what does not as the city's top manager.
 ''You have a mayor who is no longer unfamiliar with the workings of government,'' said Maureen Connelly, a consultant to Mr. Bloomberg's first campaign and a partner in a government and media relations firm. ''He's putting together a City Hall staff for the second term that he knows, that he has confidence in.''
 But outside of the government the moves are also being taken as a signal that Mr. Bloomberg, realizing he could be viewed as a lame duck within a couple of years because of term limits, will try to do a lot quickly with help from top deputies who already understand him and his goals. ''These are all people who will carry out exactly what he wants to carry out,'' said Norman Adler, a political consultant and lobbyist who works frequently with city officials. ''He's looking for people to kind of close the policy circles he's begun to draw.''
 City Hall announced Ms. Gibbs's promotion a day after it announced that Edward Skyler, the mayor's longtime press secretary, would be his deputy mayor for administration, and a few weeks after the announcement that Kevin Sheekey, his chief political strategist, would be deputy mayor for government relations.
 Their appointments followed the mayor's announcement that he was naming his closest confidante, Patricia E. Harris -- who was deputy mayor for administration during his first term -- as his top deputy, to serve as de facto mayor when he is out of town. 
 Mr. Skyler, Mr. Sheekey and Ms. Harris have been with Mr. Bloomberg since before his first run for mayor, though all of them had experience in government before working for Mr. Bloomberg. Ms. Gibbs, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer to Mr. Bloomberg's inner circle.
 Unlike Mr. Skyler, 32, and Mr. Sheekey, 39, Ms. Gibbs, 46, has spent her career working on the policy side of city government, beginning as an intern in the Koch administration, working as a finance adviser to the City Council and, before becoming Mr. Bloomberg's commissioner of homeless services in 2002, working as a deputy in the Administration for Children's Services.
 Mr. Skyler said that Ms. Gibbs won Mr. Bloomberg's trust during the homeless crisis early in his first term, when they faced a daily deluge of criticism for giving homeless families temporary shelter in a former Bronx prison. The number of homeless people has since decreased, and Ms. Gibbs has devised a plan to reduce homelessness by two-thirds by 2009.
 Still, even with Ms. Gibbs's government resume, Mr. Bloomberg is going into his second term without three top deputies who together had decades of experience: his deputy mayor for operations, Marc V. Shaw; his chief of staff, Peter Madonia -- both with broad experience in government whose knowledge of governmental relationships were huge assets during the first term -- and his communications director, William T. Cunningham, who had worked for two governors and for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
 All of them were crucial in teaching Mr. Bloomberg the ins and outs of city and state government four years ago, when he was a political novice. All of them are leaving the administration for more lucrative work in the private sector.
 City Council staff members and lobbyists who do business with the city had been predicting that the mayor would choose people from outside his administration with similar deep experience to fill their roles.
 That he has not, aides and supporters said, is evidence that Mr. Bloomberg has learned enough during his first four years -- and built enough important relationships -- that he no longer needs such seasoned hands to guide him.
 But officials disputed the notion that Mr. Bloomberg's team is unseasoned, especially after these four years of fiscal crisis, a transit strike, the fatal shooting of a councilman at City Hall and a citywide blackout, not to mention the city's recovery from Sept. 11, 2001. Ms. Harris worked for many years in the Koch administration. Mr. Sheekey has extensive contacts in Washington, having worked for Senator Moynihan, Representative James H. Scheuer and as a lobbyist for Bloomberg L.P. Mr. Skyler worked in Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration for five years.
 His deputy mayor for policy, Dennis M. Walcott, is no stranger to city government: he served on the Board of Education under Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani while running the New York Urban League..
 Mr. Skyler said that ''although we are losing some experienced hands, the mayor has plenty of skilled people at his disposal who will step up to the plate and implement his agenda.''
 He also now has plenty of deputy mayors -- seven in all, the largest number since the start of Mr. Koch's mayoralty.
 Mr. Koch said that he ultimately decided seven was too many and he pared the number to three within roughly a year and a half. ''They clashed with one another and things fell between the cracks,'' Mr. Koch said yesterday. ''There's no question that Bloomberg's mayoralty has been an immense success, and if he's comfortable and finds that it works, God bless him.''

 mayor for legal affairs. 

PATRICIA E. HARRIS, 50 -- Appointed first deputy mayor, she was the communications director of Bloomberg L.P., has overseen Mr. Bloomberg's charitable giving, and played a central role in Mr. Bloomberg's transformation into a politician. She served several roles in the administration during the first term, and played a major role in the mayor's re-election effort.

KEVIN SHEEKEY, 39 -- Mr. Bloomberg's longtime political adviser, he was the architect of the mayor's re-election campaign, and also is a former employee of Bloomberg L.P.. He becomes deputy mayor for government relations, responsible for pushing the mayor's agenda in the City Council, in Albany and in Washington.

EDWARD SKYLER, 32 -- The mayor's former communications director and another former employee of Bloomberg L.P., he becomes deputy mayor for administration, helping the
 mayor manage the uniformed and emergency services, including the Police and Fire Departments, and will directly oversee such agencies as the Department of Sanitation, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services and the mayor's press office.

LINDA I. GIBBS, 46 -- The commissioner of homeless services during Mr. Bloomberg's first term, she becomes the new deputy mayor for health and human services, overseeing the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Human Resources Administration, the Administration for Children's Services, the Department of Homeless Services, and several other agencies.

HEADLINE: Trade Surplus Tripled in '05, China Says 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
China said on Wednesday that its trade surplus with the rest of the world had tripled in 2005, to a record $102 billion, a figure that could reignite global trade frictions and step up pressure on the government to allow its currency to appreciate further.
 The United States and European Union officials have been pressuring China during the last few years to allow its currency to appreciate. The hope is to restrain the flood of Chinese exports to the world and to rebalance China's economy to allow for more imports. 
 The report on Wednesday showed that imports into China had begun to rise and exports to the rest of the world had slowed in the latter part of 2005, easing concern among some economists. 
 Still, China released a set of blockbuster trade figures that were another reflection of the nation's unparalleled rise as a global economic power.
 The government said that exports in 2005 were a record $762 billion, up 28 percent, while imports climbed to $660 billion, up nearly 18 percent, from 2004. The $102 billion surplus was up from about $32 billion in 2004.
 Total foreign trade in 2005 topped $1.4 trillion, making China No. 3 in the world in foreign trade after the United States and Germany and ahead of Japan.
 Just a decade ago, the value of China's foreign trade was only $289 billion. But today, a giant portion of the world's toys, clothing, furniture and electronic goods carry the label ''Made in China.''
 Indeed, the customs figures released on Wednesday showed that the bulk of China's trade surplus in 2005 came from exports to the world's wealthiest regions, particularly the United States and Europe. The surplus with the United States reached a record $114.7 billion, up from $80 billion a year earlier and $28 billion in 2001. Excluding the United States, China actually had a trade deficit with the rest of the world of about $12 billion in 2005, largely with South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and even Angola.
 And yet China's figures may not be telling the entire story. According to United States government data, China's trade surplus in 2005 could be nearly $200 billion. Just through October 2005, according to official government statistics in the United States, China already had a trade surplus with the United States of over $166 billion. The gap arises from differences in counting, like whether Hong Kong figures are integrated with those of China. The growing bilateral trade deficit could strain ties between the United States and China. In 2004, the United States had a record $617 billion trade deficit with the rest of the world, and it is on track to break that record.
 In Beijing on Tuesday, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, called on China to do its part to reduce its deficit with the United States, calling on the country to allow its currency to appreciate.
 ''U.S. politics will become unmanageable if China's trade deficit with the U.S. continues to grow,'' Senator Baucus said. He was on a trip through Asia to assess trade relations. He added: ''It is in China's interest to make concrete progress in reducing the trade imbalance.''
 Europe fared only slightly better last year, according to the Chinese government. China reported a $70 billion trade surplus in 2005 with the European Union, with the Netherlands and Britain having notable imbalances. 
 The trade figures suggest a changing role for China in the global economy, indicating that it will influence things like prices at Wal-Mart and global interest rates.
 When 2005 economic statistics are complete, China is likely to be home to the fourth- or fifth-largest economy in the world, surpassing France, Italy and possibly Britain. 
 The government last month readjusted its gross domestic product figure by $280 billion to account for previously unreported activity. That suggests that the Chinese economy probably grew as much as 10 percent annually in many of the last few years.
 China may also soon have more foreign currency reserves than any other country in the world, giving it even more influence on global interest rates. As of November, China reported having about $794 billion in foreign currency reserves, just behind Japan, which had about $828 billion at the end of last year. 
 Last year, China revalued its currency, ending a decade-long peg to the American dollar, allowing it to appreciate by more than 2 percent. China also reached separate textile trade agreements with the United States and the European Union after Chinese textile and apparel exports flooded those markets with the end of global quotas in January.
 American and European officials have argued that the weak value of the Chinese currency, the yuan, gave China an unfair advantage in world markets, making its goods extremely cheap.
 As China has grown into an economic power, it has racked up trade surpluses of about $350 billion over the last decade, according to Chinese customs data. And yet, some economists say those figures may still misstate the country's real gains because a large portion of goods are funneled through Hong Kong. 
 Government figures from other parts of the world are at variance with Chinese government statistics.
 For example, the Commerce Department said that in 2004, China had a $162 billion trade surplus with the United States. And last year, through October, the surplus was $166 billion, which suggests that China's trade surplus last year was double what the government reported in its own figures.
 China's figures do, however, suggest that in the second half of the year, export growth eased some from gains of more than 30 percent earlier in the year, and imports picked up from the low double digits.
 Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS, calls the record trade surplus ''old news,'' because it has already begun to fall.
 ''This is not a harbinger of things to come,'' he says. ''If you look at the numbers seasonably adjusted, things peaked at the middle of the year. Exports are now slowing down and imports are picking up.''
 But even if trade begins to balance, some economists think that 2006 will not be much different from 2005. China could report another $100 billion surplus, though the growth rate may moderate slightly.
 ''If you do the math, you'll need imports to more than double the size of exports to begin to close these gaps,'' an economist for Goldman Sachs, Hong Liang, said. ''China's trade surpluses will continue to rise.''

HEADLINE: Goldman Is Said to Have Quit Thomas Weisel Offering 

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
In an unusual move, Goldman Sachs, one of two underwriters set to take the investment bank Thomas Weisel Partners public, has pulled out of the deal, a person briefed on the situation said last night. 
 Goldman's withdrawal came after a disagreement about the timing of the initial public offering, said the person briefed on the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of regulatory restrictions on public comment before a securities offering.
Underwriters rarely pull out of an initial offering. In underwriting offerings, investment banks face a tricky balance in trying to get a rich valuation for a company -- pricing the shares at the highest possible point -- while trying to ensure that the people who buy the shares get stock that will increase in value.
 Thomas Weisel, based in San Francisco, is a boutique firm that prospered during the late 1990's technology boom, but has lately struggled. In 2000, the firm earned $100 million, according to Institutional Investor magazine. The firm focuses on health care, technology and consumer sectors and has investment banking, brokerage and asset management businesses.
 An offering would allow the firm to cash out some of its equity owners -- which include GE Asset Management, Madison Dearborn Partners and Oak Investment Partners -- and invest in its investment banking, brokerage and asset management operations.
 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a smaller boutique bank, is listed in a regulatory filing as a junior underwriter of the Thomas Weisel offering. It is unclear whether it will remain in the deal. Neil Shapiro, a spokesman for Keefe, Bruyette, said the firm did not comment on pending deals. 
 A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment. 
 Thomas Weisel Partners officials cannot comment, said a spokeswoman, because the bank was in a ''quiet period'' before the offering.
 Goldman Sachs has taken other boutique investment banks public, including Greenhill & Company and Lazard. Goldman took Lazard public in May at $25 a share, a price many in the market thought was overly aggressive. The shares fell precipitously and Goldman was left with angry investors and a loss, about $15 million at the time, filings said. The shares have since recovered and closed yesterday at $34.60. 
 According to its prospectus, Thomas Weisel Partners earned profit of $22.7 million on net revenue of $283.4 million in 2004. But for the nine months ended on Sept. 30, 2005, the firm lost $13.1 million on net revenues of $178.2 million. 
 Since the implosion of the technology bubble in 2000, investors generally expect companies to show a pattern of profitability before selling shares to the public. 
 Mr. Weisel, a former speed skating Olympic hopeful, founded the San Francisco boutique in 1998. He is also known as an avid cyclist and has been praised by Lance Armstrong, the seven-time winner of the Tour de France, for supporting his comeback from cancer; Mr. Weisel provided financial support for Mr. Armstrong's team. 
 Before Mr. Weisel founded Thomas Weisel Partners, he also ran Montgomery Securities, another successful investment banking boutique, for almost 20 years. 
 During the go-go years of the 1990's, Montgomery was among four banks that dominated banking for the high-octane growth among companies in Silicon Valley. 
 In June 1997, Mr. Weisel sold Montgomery Securities for $1.2 billion to NationsBank, which later became Bank of America. 
 The partnership soured almost immediately, and Mr. Weisel left in September 1998. 
 Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Weisel declined to comment last night.

HEADLINE: The Bread Is Famously Good, but It Killed McDonald's 

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER; Peter Kiefer contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ALTAMURA, Italy, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
First, an inconvenient truth: This is not a new story. But somehow the tale of how the city with the best bread in Italy forced its McDonald's out of business never really got told, and is spilling out now.
 All the elements of a McDonald's morality play remain relevant today: perceived corporate arrogance; traditional food triumphing over food product; a David in the form of a humble and graying baker against an expansionist American Goliath.
And, inevitably, it includes the French.
 It was the leftist and Amero-skeptic French newspaper Liberation that last week wrote the fullest account of what happened in Altamura, in southern Italy, where the road signs rightly welcome visitors to ''The City of Bread.'' 
 ''The long red mat was taken away secretly during the night,'' it reported, noting too that the ''enormous M'' over Piazza Zanardelli was ''also packed up surreptitiously.'' The windows were covered ''like a shroud on the victim of a culinary battlefield.''
 ''Today,'' the newspaper said, ''there are no longer Big Macs, Chicken McNuggets or industrial fries in Altamura.''
 What Liberation neglected to say, as have most of the other articles in an irresistible landslide of coverage in print and on the Web, is that the McDonald's closed in December 2002. The paper spoke vaguely of events a ''number'' of months ago.
 But no matter. The protagonists here in Altamura as well as many others are thrilled with the belated attention, and the distinction as the city whose food was so good that it closed down a McDonald's without really trying.
 ''What took place was a small war between us and McDonald's,'' said Onofrio Pepe, a retired journalist who founded an association here devoted to local delicacies. ''Our bullets were focaccia. And sausage. And bread. It was a peaceful war, without any spilling of blood.''
 Mr. Pepe and several like-minded citizens of Altamura, a city of 65,000 residents, made up one wing of the army. They say they fought largely for pride and for their food, which includes a local mushroom called the cardoncello, focaccia, mozzarella and, most of all, a coarse-grain bread famous for millennia around Italy. The bread is protected as unique in European Union regulations, which note that Horace called it, in 37 B.C., ''far the best bread to be had, so good that the wise traveler takes a supply of it for his onward journey.''
 When the McDonald's first opened in early 2001, Mr. Pepe said, he was not opposed to it, and even welcomed the 25 or so jobs it created. ''In the beginning,'' he said, ''it seemed like modernization.''
 Then the modern seemed to take over: McDonald's erected the huge arches on a pole near the old town center, jarringly near the 13th century cathedral, beaming yellow neon 24 hours a day (and disturbing, Mr. Pepe said, little falcons that nested in nearby trees).
 ''It gave the sense of a city being occupied,'' he said. ''It was considered a sort of challenge. Not a challenge to confront in anger but with a smile. They brought in their products, and we had ours.''
 So his group held low-key protests to highlight local food, as another front on the war opened, very much unplanned.
 A fourth-generation baker, Luca Digesu, now 35, opened Antica Casa Digesu, a small bakery right next to the McDonald's. He said he had had no intention of challenging it, but had merely hoped to shake free some customers attracted to the spot by the novelty.
 ''I was afraid of McDonald's,'' he said in his bakery on Tuesday. ''I was afraid we would be completely glossed over. I was afraid no one would even notice us.''
 For a while, McDonald's drew in the customers of Altamura. ''In the beginning,'' Mr. Digesu said, ''McDonald's was McDonald's.''
 But soon there was a migration of locals who preferred their own version of fast food: hunks of thick focaccia like the dozen that Mr. Digesu was tending in the oven as he spoke. Part of the reason seemed economic: Mr. Digesu said a big slice of focaccia cost the same as a single McDonald's hamburger. It was also, clearly, preference.
 McDonald's began fighting back, offering school trips to visit the kitchens, free rentals of the restaurant for children's birthday parties, coupons for children and a television for customers to watch soccer. Nothing seemed to work.
 ''They'd watch the game, and as soon as it was over go out and get focaccia,'' Mr. Pepe said.
 Finally, in December 2002, after less than two years in operation, the McDonald's closed shop, according to the company, for lack of profitability. The huge space is now divided up into a jeans store and a bank. Mr. Digesu smiled broadly when asked how he felt that the Italian news media, which missed the story three years ago, are now hailing him as a modern-day David.
 ''I like it,'' he said. ''McDonald's is big. I am small. Right now it is 1-0.''
 The company sees it differently, of course. ''In no way is this a defeat for McDonald's,'' contended Mario Resca, president of McDonald's in Italy, saying he hoped to double the number of McDonald's here from the current 340. ''If anything, I am proud that the local culture is appreciating its local cuisine because this means that McDonald's has stimulated a healthy competition.''
 In the end, it seems there may simply be places in the world where McDonald's is out of its depth on every front.
 The landlord both for McDonald's and Mr. Digesu happened to be Mr. Digesu's brother-in-law. The brother-in-law gave Mr. Digesu a good deal on the rent. He did not do so for McDonald's.
 Then there is the local food -- cheap and overwhelmingly good -- and the people who have eaten it for centuries and consider it as much their tradition as their history. Odd as it might seem in a corporate boardroom, they put no value on a McDonald's in Altamura.
 ''The majority couldn't imagine McDonald's becoming an integral part of their lives,'' said Patrick Girondi, 48, an entrepreneur from Chicago who has lived here for 15 years. ''McDonald's didn't get beat by a baker. McDonald's got beat by a culture.''

HEADLINE: Swiss Investigate Leak to Paper on C.I.A. Prisons in Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Switzerland is conducting criminal investigations to track down the source of a leak to the Zurich-based newspaper SonntagsBlick of what it reported was a secret document citing clandestine C.I.A. prisons in Eastern Europe. 
 The Sunday weekly published what it reported was a summary of a fax in November from Egypt's Foreign Ministry to its London embassy that said the United States had held 23 Iraqi and Afghan prisoners at a base in Romania. It also referred to similar detention centers in Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia and Ukraine.
''The Egyptians have sources confirming the presence of secret American prisons,'' said the document, dated Nov. 15 and written in French to summarize the contents of the fax.
 ''According to the embassy's own sources, 23 Iraqis and Afghans were interrogated at the Mikhail Kogalniceau base at Constanza, on the Black Sea.''
 The leaked fax, which the newspaper said was sent by satellite and intercepted by the Swiss Strategic Intelligence Service, was signed by Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the report said.
 Christoph Grenacher, the newspaper's editor in chief, said that before the article was published, newspaper officials met with high-ranking Swiss government officials, who urged the paper to withhold the information. ''We concluded that the discussion about so-called secret prisons is much more important than the interests of the secret service in Switzerland,'' he said.
 During those discussions, he said, no one contested the authenticity of the document. Egypt has not commented on the report, but it quickly reignited a political fury in Europe that began in the fall with news reports that said there were C.I.A. interrogation centers in Europe and that there had been secret flights through European countries transferring terrorism suspects for questioning. 
 After the article was published on Sunday, Romania and Ukraine issued denials, and the Swiss criminal investigations were opened. Some European lawmakers seized on the information as evidence of dissembling by European Union members. ''This is a piece of real evidence to back up the gut instinct many of us have that the denials of complicity we are hearing from E.U. member and candidate states cannot be relied upon,'' Sarah Ludford, a Liberal Democratic member of the British Parliament, said in a statement.
 The Swiss Army's chief prosecutor opened an investigation of Mr. Grenacher and two of his reporters to determine whether military secrets were exposed and to find the source of the leaks. The Swiss attorney general's office is also investigating the issue, adding another layer to its existing investigation of whether there were C.I.A. flights in Swiss airspace.
 Germany and Denmark are also examining accusations that the agency used their airspace to transport terrorism suspects.
 The United States has acknowledged flights but not the existence of prisons. A C.I.A. spokeswoman declined to comment on the report in the newspaper.
 Conceivably, the journalists could face five years in prison for revealing military secrets, although no one prosecuted under the law has ever served any prison time, the authorities said.
 Martin Immenhauser, a spokesman for the military prosecutor, said of the document: ''Nobody has told us that it's not authentic. I think you can say that it's 99 percent certain that it's authentic.''

Israelis Angry at Evangelist's Comment on Sharon
Israel is breaking off talks on a tourism project with the evangelical leader Pat Robertson in response to his remarks suggesting that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was divine retribution for pulling out of Gaza. ''God considers this land to be his,'' Mr. Robertson said last week. 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Robertson said, ''We continue to maintain our longstanding commitment to the Jewish people and the State of Israel.'' PAGE A16

Scientists Link Frog Deaths to Global Warming
Scientists studying a fast-dwindling genus of colorful harlequin frogs on mountainsides in Central and South America are reporting that global warming is combining with a fungus to kill off many species. PAGE A12

Anger in New Orleans
Residents of the New Orleans neighborhoods most devastated by flooding after Hurricane Katrina responded with anger after the city's rebuilding commission unveiled its most contentious proposal: giving neighborhoods in low-lying parts of the city four months to a year to prove that their homes should not be bulldozed.

Appeal Could Add Access To Courts for Condemned
An argument before the Supreme Court in a 20-year-old murder case suggested that the court might be willing to open the door a bit wider to death row inmates seeking access to federal court to present plausible but belated claims of innocence.
 Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen G. Breyer were particularly steeped in the details of the case, debating almost to the exclusion of the lawyers before them. PAGE A28

Challenging Realtors' 6%
The National Association of Realtors is facing growing criticism that it has worked to smother competition and protect the system that provides the traditional 5 percent to 6 percent broker commission on most home sales. BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1

China's Trade Surplus Triples
China's trade surplus with the rest of the world tripled last year, to a record $102 billion, a figure that could reignite global trade frictions and step up pressure on the government to allow its currency to appreciate further. Economists' concerns were allayed somewhat by figures that showed imports rising and exports falling late in the year. But China's total for the year, $1.4 trillion, moved it past Japan into third place among world traders, behind the United States and Germany. PAGE C1

HEADLINE: Brazil Is Awash in Energy (Except for Natural Gas)

BYLINE: By PAULO PRADA

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
In these times of excruciating oil prices, Brazil is in a position many nations would envy.
 With 11.24 billion barrels in oil reserves, it produces 1.7 million barrels a day, 90 percent of its needs, a turnaround from once being almost entirely dependent on imports. In alternative fuels, it is a pioneer, turning one of its biggest crops, sugar, into ethanol. The fuel, either as pure ethanol or mixed with gasoline, now accounts for around a third of what goes into gas tanks in Brazil.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been crowing about Brazil's achievements in energy. In November, he inaugurated an oil platform in the bay of this verdant city, donning a hard hat and praising the rig for helping the country wean itself from imported oil. A week earlier in Brasilia, he lauded Brazil's advances in renewable fuels, stating that in a few years ''the entire world will take notice.'' 
 But to Vito Joseph Mandilovich, vice president for operations at two power plants run by AES Eletropaulo, the boast rings a little hollow. Twice this year, one of AES's plants in southern Brazil sat idle for weeks when its supply of natural gas, imported from Argentina, disappeared. 
 ''It brought us to a halt,'' Mr. Mandilovich said. His company is partly owned by the AES Corporation of Arlington, Va. 
 Despite major strides in oil production and trailblazing development of renewable fuels, Brazil's energy picture is marred by its inability to meet soaring demand for natural gas. There is no clear estimate of how much natural gas Brazil would consume if the gas were available, but plants occasionally go dark and gas distributors are turning away clients. Existing shortfalls limit new investment in gas-fueled plants and power generators.
 ''There's an imbalance,'' said Rafael Schechtman, director of the Brazilian Infrastructure Center, a consulting firm here. ''Natural gas lags an otherwise healthy energy sector.''
 Indeed, as Brazil became a star in energy self-sufficiency, natural gas was something of an afterthought. Demand began in the 1990's, when the government decided to reinforce Brazil's hydroelectric power grid with plants fueled by natural gas. Industry, facing environmental pressures and higher oil prices, also sought gas to replace the fuel oil that fired engines and furnaces.
 Because Brazil at the time had discovered few reserves at home, it relied upon imports from gas-rich neighbors, like Argentina and Bolivia. A $1.8 billion 2,000-mile pipeline from Bolivia, financed mostly by Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled energy company, feeds Brazil half its needs.
 But in 2003, Petrobras found huge gas deposits off the state of Sao Paulo in the Santos basin. Initially, Petrobras estimated that the new find tripled the country's gas reserves to more than 600 billion cubic meters total. While the fields will help Brazil reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers, Petrobras is reluctant to forecast exactly how much they could yield. At present, Brazil boasts proven reserves of 326 billion cubic meters. The fields, however, would help Brazil move toward self-sufficiency in gas. 
 But the fields are still untapped. Petrobras said in 2005 that it would invest $15 billion through 2010 to develop them and double an existing 2,500-mile network of pipelines. The first gas would be produced in 2008. But the rising cost of steel, coupled with the sheer scale of Brazil's geography, makes a precise project timetable sketchy. Though Brazil is on its way to tapping the gas, it will no doubt come too late to address current need and pent-up demand.
 ''Existing supplies don't match the growth in demand,'' said Sophie Aldebert, an associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, who is based here.
 Critics blame Brazil's government for failing to spur investment in the pipelines and distribution networks that could bring more natural gas from Bolivia as well as from existing domestic fields to more parts of the country. Laws that could stimulate that investment are mired in Congress, leaving the onus on Petrobras, the country's dominant wholesale supplier, to set the development agenda.
 ''Petrobras controls supply and decides where and when to increase it,'' said Luis Domenech, president of Companhia de Gas de Sao Paulo, or Comgas, the distributor in Brazil's most populous state. Until the investment rules are clearer, he said, ''companies remain reluctant to compete with Petrobras.''
 But Petrobras rejects the notion that Brazil's gas fortunes rest solely on its shoulders. Though it recognizes its position as a near monopoly -- only a handful of other companies supply regional distributors -- the company was partly privatized in 1997 and its obligations lie more with private investors than in public service. 
 ''We're not obliged to meet any demand at any price,'' Ildo Sauer, Petrobras's director for gas and energy, said recently.
 From a black leather armchair in his spacious office in the Petrobras tower in Rio, Mr. Sauer points to wall maps illustrating a web of possible gas ducts in Brazil and throughout South America.
 The problems in supply, he said, are just symptoms of the immaturity of Brazil's gas market: there are shortfalls precisely because nobody expected demand to grow so fast. ''Any sector would be envious to have this kind of growth and investment,'' he said. 
 Still, the shortfalls are hampering development.
 In the northeastern state of Bahia, factories and other industrial clients are pressing Bahiagas, the regional distributor, to supply more. While there is demand for at least 6.5 million cubic meters a day in Bahia, the company said, it is able to get only 3.5 million from Petrobras. Until a Petrobras-led consortium completes a new pipeline next year, the company is losing at least 1.56 million reais ($660,000) a day in potential revenue.
 ''I'm turning customers away,'' complains Petronio Lerche Vieira, president of Bahiagas.
 With demand nationwide projected to grow more than 15 percent annually in coming years, future supply is even shakier and could steer manufacturers away from natural gas.
 Besides industrial users, homeowners in Brazil's big cities are switching to natural gas. Also, growing numbers of heavily used vehicles are converting to the fuel. Instead of popping a gasoline cap at the rear of their taxis, cabbies in cities like Rio and Sao Paulo are increasingly lifting their hoods and pumping natural gas into their tanks.
 ''Demand is moving into a variety of other uses, but future growth remains dependent on supply,'' said Carlos Senna Figueredo, an energy consultant in Rio for the National Confederation of Industry, a manufacturing trade group based in Sao Paulo. 
 Doubts cloud the supplies Brazil is getting from its neighbors, too.
 Contracts from Argentina, facing an energy squeeze because investment has withered since a financial meltdown earlier this decade, are faltering. Also, Argentina is required by law to suspend exports if it needs its gas at home. And Evo Morales, Bolivia's nationalist president-elect, has vowed to renegotiate agreements with foreign investors, with Petrobras being the biggest of them. [On Wednesday, Mr. Morales said he would cancel any contracts giving foreign companies ownership rights to the country's gas, according to Bloomberg News. Petrobras currently has rights to 17.5 percent of Bolivia's gas. Petrobras had no comment on Wednesday.] 
 Other leaders around the region have talked of a host of potential new sources, like a transcontinental pipeline to carry gas from Venezuela southward, but those projects could be slow getting off the ground.
 Energy projects and policy, after all, are political hot potatoes in a region where economic fortunes often rely on the price and demand for commodities. 
 ''The need for more gas is clear, but the political landscape is not,'' Francisco Bugallo, president of generation in Brazil for the Spanish power company Endesa. ''The balance between supply and demand for energy is always a sensitive issue.''

My Year in Iraq
The Struggle to Build a Future of Hope
By L. Paul Bremer III with Malcolm McConnell
Illustrated. 417 pages. Simon & Schuster. $27.
 When Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III arrived in Baghdad in May of 2003 as America's proconsul in Iraq, he assumed the most powerful foreign post held by any American since Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Japan. While he knew little about Iraq when he was appointed by President Bush, Mr. Bremer became, as he writes in his revealing new memoir, ''the only paramount authority figure -- other than dictator Saddam Hussein -- that most Iraqis had ever known.'' His mandate was as sweeping as his powers: to oversee the remaking of an entire nation, from its political institutions to its economic machinery to its security infrastructure. 
When Mr. Bremer departed 14 months later, after handing off authority to an interim government, many critics -- in Washington, in the military and in the press -- were biting in their assessment of his record. The insurgency had blossomed, violence and casualties were on the rise, and hopes for a quickly stabilized, democratic Iraq were fading. Mr. Bremer was blamed for allowing the security situation to deteriorate. In particular, he was blamed for disbanding the old Iraqi army, an action that critics said contributed to the security vacuum and put several hundred thousand armed Iraqis on the street with no job and no salary, as the New Yorker writer George Packer has argued. Mr. Bremer was also blamed for issuing an order that banned thousands of Baath Party officials from returning to their government jobs, thereby depriving the occupation of experienced Iraqi administrators.
 ''My Year in Iraq,'' an amalgam of spin and sincerity, is partly an explanation (or rationalization) of actions Mr. Bremer took as America's man in Baghdad, partly an effort to issue some ''I told you so's'' to administration colleagues, and partly an attempt to spread (or reassign) responsibility (or blame) by tracing just who in the White House, Pentagon and State Department signed off on or ordered critical decisions made during his tenure.
 Mr. Bremer deals with some issues like prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib in an extremely cursory fashion, while explicating others, like the debate over the timetable for sovereignty, in considerable detail, and he cavalierly dismisses the State Department's Future of Iraq Project, which critics say was sidelined because of tensions with the Pentagon, as not offering a practical plan for postwar Iraq.
 While the book is studded with familiar administration sound bites about the importance of deposing Mr. Hussein, it paints a troubling portrait of the administration's handling of the occupation. It is a portrait that in many respects ratifies what critics of the war and postwar have long been saying: that there were not enough American troops to provide security and contain a spreading insurgency; that, as Mr. Bremer told Vice President Dick Cheney in the fall of 2003, the United States did not have a practical ''military strategy for victory'' in the postwar; and that, as he told Condoleezza Rice in May 2004, the United States had become ''the worst of all things -- an ineffective occupier.'' 
 At the same time, ''My Year in Iraq'' suggests that the decision-making process within the administration was frequently haphazard and self-defeating, leading, for instance, to procrastination about the firebrand Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr instead of decisive action against him (as Mr. Bremer had urged) before his militant movement got out of hand. 
 The book underscores the degree to which certain idees fixes held by members of the administration hobbled postwar planning, such as the notion that America could ''quickly turn full authority over to a group of selected Iraqi exiles'' like Ahmad Chalabi, even though, Mr. Bremer points out, those exiles lacked credibility in large sectors of the population.
 And finally, the book points up the huge gap between the reality on the ground in Iraq and the wishful thinking and bad intelligence that informed administration hawks' thinking. Assertions, for example, that oil exports would pay for the country's reconstruction, when, in fact, sabotage of pipelines and a decrepit industry infrastructure meant big expenditures just to get the Iraqi oil business up and running. And dismissals of insurgents as mere ''pockets of dead enders,'' when, in fact, Mr. Bremer says he read in the summer of 2003 a pre-invasion Iraqi intelligence document calling for a strategy of organized resistance to be put into effect when and if Saddam's regime collapsed.
 America's paucity of practical intelligence about ''the nature of the enemy'' stemmed in part, Mr. Bremer argues, from the priorities Washington set for the Central Intelligence Agency's Baghdad station -- ''hunting for weapons of mass destruction and capturing the senior Baathist fugitives made notorious on Centcom's Most Wanted deck of cards'' instead of focusing on ''the guys who are blowing up Humvees and killing our soldiers.'' Matters were exacerbated by the fact that the Coalition Provisional Authority was chronically understaffed: in July 2003, Mr. Bremer notes, none of the 250 people he had requested weeks before had arrived, and ''Washington red tape would slow reconstruction funds and personnel for almost a year.'' 
 Although Mr. Bremer did not publicly call for more American troops while he was posted in Iraq, he said in the fall of 2004, before the presidential election, that inadequate forces had hampered the occupation by allowing widespread looting to create ''an atmosphere of lawlessness'' early on. In this volume, Mr. Bremer much more forcefully emphasizes his belief, throughout his tenure in Iraq, that more troops were needed to secure the country, and his fear that the Pentagon -- adhering to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's theory of streamlining the military -- was eager to ''replace U.S. troops with unprepared Iraqi police'' who had been rushed ''through truncated training courses.''
 Mr. Bremer quotes a September 2003 memo in which Mr. Rumsfeld declared that ''our goal should be to ramp up the Iraqi numbers, try to get some additional international forces'' and ''reduce the U.S. role.'' And he writes that Colin L. Powell said this push was related to concerns that the president might have to mobilize more National Guard units, including ones from crucial states in an election year. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld seems to have ignored Mr. Bremer's entreaties. Before leaving for Iraq in May 2003, Mr. Bremer sent the defense secretary a copy of a RAND report estimating that 500,000 troops would be needed to stabilize postwar Iraq -- more than three times the number of troops then deployed. ''I think you should consider this,'' Mr. Bremer wrote in his cover memo. He says he never heard back from Mr. Rumsfeld.
 The same thing happened a year later, Mr. Bremer recounts, when he sent Mr. Rumsfeld a message noting ''that the deterioration of the security situation since April had made it clear, to me at least, that we were trying to cover too many fronts with too few resources.'' He recommended that the Pentagon ''consider whether the Coalition could deploy one or two additional divisions for up to a year.'' Again, he says, he never heard back from Mr. Rumsfeld. 
 As for President Bush, Mr. Bremer says he spoke to him about the RAND report in May 2003 and brought up the issue of troop levels again the following month in a video conference with the National Security Council, presided over by Mr. Bush.
 On the controversial matter of disbanding the Iraqi army, Mr. Bremer argues, as he has in interviews, that ''the old army had long since disappeared'' by the time he arrived in Iraq: ''when Iraqi draftees had seen which way the war was going in 2003, they simply deserted and went home to their farms and families.'' The decision to formally dissolve Mr. Hussein's army, Mr. Bremer contends, was meant to ''demonstrate to the Iraqi people'' that the United States had destroyed ''the underpinnings of the Saddam regime.'' That decision, Mr. Bremer adds, was hardly his alone, but was made in consultation with Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith, and was authorized by Mr. Rumsfeld. 
 The exclusion of former Baathists from the government was more complicated. Mr. Bremer writes that before he even got to Baghdad, Mr. Feith showed him a draft order for the ''De-Baathification of Iraqi Society'' and said he was thinking of having Mr. Bremer's predecessor in Baghdad, Jay Garner, issue the order right away.
 Mr. Feith was persuaded to let Mr. Bremer issue the decree himself, when he got to Baghdad. Its implementation, Mr. Bremer writes, was left largely to Iraqis on the Governing Council like Mr. Chalabi, who was close to Mr. Feith and other neo-conservatives at the Pentagon. ''Our de-Baathification policy had targeted only the top 1 percent of the party's members,'' he writes, ''but under Chalabi's direction, the Iraqi De-Baathification Council had broadened the policy, for example, depriving thousands of teachers of their jobs.'' In retrospect, Mr. Bremer adds, he ''had been wrong to give a political body like the Governing Council responsibility for overseeing the de-Baathification policy.''
 At one point, talking about the Iraqi Governing Council, Mr. Bremer said to Mr. Wolfowitz, ''Those people couldn't organize a parade, let alone run the country.''
 As this book makes clear, the hidden and not-so-hidden agendas of Washington officials and exiles like Mr. Chalabi, along with the clashing interests of various Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish representatives, turned many of Mr. Bremer's 18-hour days into marathons of frustrating conflict resolution. Combined with the daily exigencies of overseeing a country threatening to slip into chaos and the maddening bureaucratic problems of getting even the simplest plans off the ground, they give a whole new meaning to the phrase ''crisis management,'' and they leave the reader with a sobering sense of the staggering difficulties of the situation in Iraq.

HEADLINE: A Test of Wills Between Iran and the West

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
One day after Iran moved to break the internationally monitored seals on its nuclear facilities, a contest of wills between Iran and its adversaries unfolded, with the Europeans threatening to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council for possible punitive actions and Iran issuing defiant new warnings.
 Signaling this strategy, Vice President Dick Cheney, in an interview with Fox News, said Wednesday that the United States would seek the adoption of ''a resolution that could be enforced by sanctions, were they to fail to comply with it.'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain told the Parliament the same thing, saying that ''we have to decide what measures to take and we obviously don't rule out any measures at all.'' 
Among the possibilities being discussed, various officials said, were a ban on travel by Iranian diplomats, restrictions on new commercial contracts or sports contests and other small steps falling short of what would be the toughest sanction of all -- either a ban on oil purchases or on the export of refined gasoline to Iran.
 But it was unclear whether the Europeans could get Russia, China, India and other countries to join a consensus for sanctions, making it possible for the Security Council to act on them. Nor was it certain that Iran would change its behavior in response to new pressures.
 ''The issue cannot be solved by imposing sanctions or similar measures,'' said Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former Iranian president. The West would regret any such attempts, he warned in a speech on Wednesday as Iran celebrated the Muslim holiday of Id al-Adha.
 ''I believe the West has played this game too late and played into Iranian hands,'' said Abbas Milani, director of Iranian studies at Stanford University. ''At this stage, they are convinced that the more hardball they play, the more the West will collapse.'' Mr. Milani said that news reports from Iran suggested that its government had used the last few years to sign up oil deals with various countries to gain their political support, dispersed its nuclear activities to some 300 sites around the country and stockpiled food, medicine and other materials to survive any sanctions.
 American and European officials say that two years of efforts to negotiate with Iran, including the discussion of incentives for ending its nuclear programs, has at least brought leading countries of the world closer to a willingness to apply coercion now that talks have failed.
 They have indicated that the next phase of pressure is likely to take place a step at a time, perhaps starting with a referral of Iran's case by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council early next month.
 ''A lot of what can be done is simply related to Iran's status in the world,'' said Mitchell B. Reiss, a policy and planning director at the State Department in the first Bush term. ''The Iranians are very sensitive to challenges to their own legitimacy, and there are a lot of things you can do before bringing down the hammer big time.''
 But others are less sure of such a course of action, and they fear that Iran can string out the process by appearing to cooperate at each phase, peeling off Russian and Chinese support with a show of reasonableness.
 ''I've been surprised that so many people are acting like referral to the Security Council is some important event that will bring about change in the government of Iran,'' said an administration official, asking not to be identified as questioning the Western strategy. ''I don't buy it.''
 A second official, asked if the period of diplomacy had now ended, said: ''No. Diplomacy just passes to a new phase, one of diplomatic judgment of Iran.'' Such a judgment, he said, will be easier because of the recent inflammatory comments from its new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, about wiping Israel off the map.
 For the time being, there is no talk of military action against Iran, except hypothetically, in part because any kind of airstrike or covert attempt to sabotage its facilities would provoke retaliations in Iraq, Israel and elsewhere. 
 A few years ago, for example, Bush administration hawks spoke of the powerfully persuasive effect on Iran of 150,000 American troops in neighboring Iraq. Now, the United States is angrily calling on Iran not to support lethal attacks on American troops by insurgents. There remain some in the Bush administration who say that American officials could have made a greater attempt in the last year or so to reach out to the Tehran government. But there is no indication that Iran was interested.
 The American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, was authorized to engage Iranians in discussions about cross-border infiltration of bombs and other devices used against Americans, but has been rebuffed. 
 Meanwhile, the United States has concentrated its efforts on trying to isolate Iran diplomatically, proclaiming success repeatedly but without proof that it has gotten anything more than lip service so far.
 State Department officials say that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been concentrating this week on getting Russia on board the campaign to confront Iran. They say Russia has responded with surprisingly tough talk to Iran's rebuff of an offer to enrich uranium on Russian soil, but that Russia could still call for more delays.
 China, administration and European officials say, is considered likely to accept sanctions if Russia does.
 In its five years in office, the Bush administration has engaged in a long-running internal debate over how to deal with Iran. Hard-liners at the Pentagon and Mr. Cheney's office argued against having any diplomatic contacts with Tehran. 
 Some at the State Department say privately that more efforts might have yielded some results, and they got the administration to go along with the European efforts to offer economic benefits last year.
 Iran has had two military plane crashes in the last month, for example, and these officials argue that the offer of spare parts for commercial aircraft might have done the trick.
 Some conservatives in the administration have begun to play with the idea that the best that could be done is to delay Iran's nuclear bomb-making ability, and the United States should use the time to try to encourage political change within Iran.
 A small effort has begun to provide assistance to dissident groups, for example. But a meeting to discuss further openings with Iran as a means to undermine the government was canceled last year after The Wall Street Journal disclosed the plans and hard-liners attacked them as too conciliatory.

HEADLINE: A Firebrand in a House of Cards

BYLINE: By Dariush Zahedi and Omid Memarian. 
Dariush Zahedi is a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist and blogger, is a visiting scholar at the university's Graduate School of Journalism.

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
IN defying international monitors and breaking the seals on its nuclear facilities, Iran seems to be courting confrontation. But Western leaders would do well to consider what President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's bravado really says about Iran's likely posture in the region and at the nuclear talks that are scheduled to resume at the end of January. To continue down the path of conflict could be very costly, both for the regional interests of the United States and most of all, for the territorial integrity of Iran.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is surely motivated by ideology and the desire to solidify the position of the security faction within Iran's ruling elite. But he also appears to be acting on the perception that the United States is in a position of considerable, indeed unprecedented, weakness. America's military is overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Washington has focused on monitoring North Korea's nuclear program rather than Iran's. If threatened, Iran could wreak havoc in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Israel. These observations may lead Mr. Ahmadinejad to an incorrect assessment of Iran's strength relative to any American threat. 
In fact, Iran has serious domestic frailties, including a shaky economy and its attendant unemployment and popular resentment, not to mention soaring levels of drug abuse and a brain drain. But President Ahmadinejad no doubt takes comfort not only in his belief in divine protection but also in the knowledge that Shiite religious parties aligned with Iran are now the dominant political forces in Iraq, while the American public hardly seems amenable to waging another war in the region. Moreover, Mr. Ahmadinejad very likely believes that the best way to guard against regime change from without is to emulate North Korea by swiftly advancing Iran's nuclear capacity. 
 The new president also surely knows that even if Iran's nuclear dossier is referred to the United Nations Security Council, meaningful multilateral sanctions against the Islamic Republic will most likely be vetoed by Russia or China. Flush with petrodollars, Iran has become a major purchaser of Russian technology, including roughly $1 billion worth of allegedly defensive weapons that Moscow recently agreed to sell to Tehran. Meanwhile, China, seizing on Iran as a key producer of oil and gas not beholden to the United States, has quickly emerged as one of Iran's largest trading partners. 
 Given this favorable strategic picture, Mr. Ahmadinejad might even welcome an American or Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Tehran could then retaliate against American and Israeli interests by mobilizing its Shiite allies in Iraq, the Persian Gulf countries and Lebanon -- or even by making common cause with some Sunni rivals. All the while, Mr. Ahmadinejad's faction in government would make full use of the war footing to marginalize its rivals at home and crush the remnants of Iran's civil society.
 But the Iranian regime is not invulnerable, and Washington knows this. Just as Iran can use the Shiite card to create mischief in the region, the United States could manipulate ethnic and sectarian tensions in Iran, which has significant, largely Sunni, minority populations along its borders. 
 Many of Iran's ethnic and religious minorities see themselves as victims of discrimination, and they have not been effectively integrated into Iranian economic, political or cultural life. Some two million disgruntled Arabs reside mainly in the oil- and gas- rich province of Khuzestan. The United States could make serious trouble for Tehran by providing financial, logistical and moral support to Arab secessionists in that province. Other aggrieved Iranian minorities would be emboldened by the Arabs' example -- for example, the Kurds and the Baluchis, or even the Azeris (though the Azeris, being Shiites, are better integrated into Iranian society). A simple spark could suffice to set off centrifugal explosions.
 Furthermore, the plummeting Iranian economy will only worsen if the United States succeeds in referring Iran's nuclear file to the Security Council, whether or not meaningful sanctions follow. Such a referral would accelerate capital flight, deal a blow to the country's already collapsing stock market, devastate its hitherto booming real estate market, and wipe out the savings of a large part of the middle class. It would also most likely result in galloping inflation, hurting Iran's dispossessed, whom the Ahmadinejad administration claims to represent.
 In light of these ominous possibilities, both Mr. Ahmadinejad and Mr. Bush would do well to avoid overplaying their hands. They should take a leaf from the book not of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini the ideologue, but of Ayatollah Khomeini the pragmatic politician. Like Mr. Ahmadinejad, Ayatollah Khomeini argued that the ''Zionist entity'' should be wiped off the map. But he chose regime preservation over ideology when he ended the Iran-Iraq war and even bought weapons from Israel. 
 IRAN should endeavor to regain the trust of the international community by engaging in compromise, and the United States should allow this compromise to be sufficiently face-saving for Iran's ruling elite. To regain the confidence of the international community, Iran should accept the Russian offer to process Iranian uranium gas into fuel and voluntarily stop, for a specified time, insisting on its right to do so at home.
 In return, the United States should lift its unilateral sanctions from Iran. These sanctions, which include a ban on the sale of aircraft and spare parts to Iran, have absolutely no effect on the regime's nuclear capacity, but they harm Iranian civilians. 
 Today the incentive for both sides to step away from the brink of conflict is even greater than it was at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. If the United States responds to a perceived Iranian threat by exploiting Iran's ethnic, sectarian and economic cleavages, it is not just the Islamic Republic that will be threatened -- Iran itself could be dismembered as well.

HEADLINE: Record Profits Elicit Big Bonuses on Wall St. 

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Ferrari dealers, get ready. Wall Street bonuses are in and they are big. 
 Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, announced yesterday that Wall Street bonuses were estimated to hit a record $21.5 billion for 2005, surpassing the previous record of $19.5 billion, set in 2000. Those bonuses were driven by record profits at many of Wall Street's major investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
The Street's munificence will be felt throughout New York: Mr. Hevesi estimated that New York State would collect $1.5 billion in tax revenue from those bonuses, and New York City about $500 million. 
 ''Wall Street continues to be critically important to the economies of both the city and the state,'' he said. 
 The average bonus of $125,000 was also a record, surpassing the previous high of $114,270, in 2004.
 Mr. Hevesi's figures represent bonuses awarded at 220 New York Stock Exchange-listed companies. Adjusted for inflation, the 2000 record was $22.3 billion. 
 The benefits, while widespread, will not be shared equally. ''When the tides come in, all boats rise,'' said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the compensation consulting firm. ''Thousands make $1 million or more, and then there are lots of people who get $10,000. Everyone gets something, but it is by no means equitable.''
 Wall Street chief executives will be at the top of the heap. Henry M. Paulson Jr., chief executive of Goldman Sachs, earned a compensation package of $38 million for 2005. Richard S. Fuld Jr., the chief executive of Lehman Brothers, was awarded $14.9 million in restricted stock. John J. Mack, who took over at Morgan Stanley last summer, earned $11.5 million for six months' worth of work. 
 While most Wall Street executives, bankers and traders have now been told what bonuses they are getting, they will not be receiving the cash or stock until the end of this month or next month. Nonetheless, some will have already budgeted or spent their bonuses. Multimillion-dollar estates, rare art, luxury cars and fractional shares in private jets are among the more popular items coveted by Wall Street's masters of the universe.
 Performance on the Street varied among the firms last year, but the underlying business of trading, lending, advising and raising money for companies was robust over all.
 About $1.8 trillion in mergers and acquisitions were completed in the fiscal year ended in November, according to estimates by Merrill Lynch. That compares with $1.3 trillion in 2004. American companies coming to market raised $48 billion in 2005, compared with $62 billion in 2004. But companies outside the United States raised $379 billion last year, compared with $282 billion in 2004. 
 Indeed, those firms with global reach benefited from it. According to Thomson Financial, European issuance in 2005 climbed 13 percent, to $2.46 trillion, while Japanese underwriting rose more than 10 percent, to $276 billion. United States issuers raised $3.02 trillion, a bigger total, but up only 4 percent from 2004's level. No American company was in the top 10 global initial public offerings. 
 The bulk of Wall Street's profits continue to come from trading, with an increasing amount coming from firms' using their own money to make bets, rather than banks' simply acting as an agent between trading parties. 
 ''The trading business, which drives Wall Street -- it's not investment banking -- continued to be extremely strong, even though interest rates went the wrong way,'' Mr. Johnson said, referring to the fact that interest rates have been rising, which can hurt Wall Street profits. 
 Revenue at Wall Street firms grew by 44.5 percent through the first three quarters of 2005, reaching the highest levels since the stock market peaked in 2000. 
 The year ''2000 was the peak of the greatest boom in our modern history,'' Mr. Hevesi noted. ''It was a remarkable time, so this is very good news." 
 Already this year, the stock market has had a modest rally, a positive indicator for profits on the Street. In addition, many of the banks are planning to increase their work forces by as much as 10 percent, adding more high-priced mouths to feed in 2006.

HEADLINE: A Global Look at Urban Planning

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

 BODY:
RICHARD BURDETT, guest organizer of the 10th International Architecture Exhibition for the Venice Biennale, which will open on Sept. 6, stood in his hotel room on Monday evening looking out over the dark office towers of Caracas, Venezuela, and talked about cities, the subject of his exhibition.
 ''Is it possible to make new civic centers, new housing, which make people's lives hell?'' he asked, speaking by telephone. 
''The answer is yes,'' he answered. ''Flip that around and ask, if that's the case, can you design squares, streets, buildings that can provide the possibility of a more integrated society?''
 Mr. Burdett's topic, which five years ago might have been a gently heated discussion among colleagues, is now a global flashpoint. Cities are terrorist targets -- New York, London, Madrid. Cities are the staging grounds for riots, Paris most recently. And cities everywhere are magnets for immigration, welcome or not. According to population projections, 75 percent of all people will live in a few dozen cities by 2030.
 Mr. Burdett, a professor of architecture and urbanism at the London School of Economics and an adviser to the mayor of London, has recently made the world his home. He is visiting the 18 cities to be showcased in his exhibition, including Shanghai, Sao Paulo, Beirut, Copenhagen, Bogota, Johannesburg and Caracas. Mr. Burdett said of his decision to include Caracas, ''It's a dramatic period of political change, with a new national regime. It's also a city which is collapsing.''
 On Jan. 5 the largest bridge to Caracas, Viaduct 1, which connects it through the mountains to the coast, an airport and a seaport, began to collapse because of erosion caused by rain. It will be closed through the year, the government announced. The collapse was widely anticipated by landslide studies published nearly 20 years ago. 
 ''It's impossible to get in and out,'' Mr. Burdett said, adding of one of most stubborn difficulties of reconstruction, ''The people living under the bridge, in the barrio, squatters, are refusing to leave. How to make lives for them, improve quality of life, in this city?''
 Now mired in mud, Caracas's bridge is a neat illustration of obstacles to be bridged in cities globally in making them habitable, healthy and home to the 'haves' and the 'have-nots,' who live as perpetual neighbors in them. 
 Mr. Burdett gave architects and urban planners high and low marks for their achievements in the last 50 years.
 ''There's been failure at a fundamental level,'' he said. ''Those beautiful housing estates, or 'projects,' designed in the 30's, 50's and 70's, which won architectural prizes, are problems, socially, from Harbor Point in Boston to the United Kingdom's tower blocks.'' He cited Paris, and the recent riots at its outskirts, in particular.
 ''In French cities, it's a particular form of peripheral development that is associated with one social group, who are ghettoized,'' he said. ''How do you avoid creating acres of 'Euro-trash' living and working in the city, and acres of new arrivals outside?'' (Mr. Burdett, a Londoner, was born in Rome, which excused his political incorrectness, he said.)
 By contrast, East London, with Canary Wharf as its new capitol, was an example for hope, Mr. Burdett said, that new development could create a sound, stratified social structure that included housing and shopping for people of various incomes, and also satisfy the market and its pressures to replace poor with rich in renewed neighborhoods. 
 ''Gentrification need not be bad,'' he said.
 And 'star' architects, designing signature buildings -- viewed by their critics as superficial celebrity fixes for cities in crisis -- have sometimes helped substantively, when clients were sensitive to social issues.
 ''I start from the position that you can have your cake and eat it,'' he said. ''I was brought up in Rome. St. Peter's works wonderfully with all the other 'star' architecture of its day.'' 
 Mr. Burdett stressed that solutions for cities differed, depending on where in their economic evolution they were. In Shanghai a pivotal planner told him that he would give permission to build anything, including ''mistakes,'' to keep the economic engine fueled, even if it meant tearing them down in 30 years.
 ''One hundred years ago, would our Victorian city fathers have had the same approach?'' he asked. ''Yes.'' 
 Traditional solutions, like providing mass transit, are proving newly effective in cities like Bogota, and with elements of surprise. Inaugurated during Mayor Enrique Penalosa's administration in the late 1990's, the Transmilenio bus system found popularity with people living outside the central city visiting friends and relatives in Bogota on weekends. The bus stations have become lively places to socialize, drawing businesses with the crowds. Because of that success, Mexico City is now building a bus system based exactly on Bogota's model.
 Mr. Burdett said that his exhibition and its conclusions will be political as well as architectural and the work of a planner.
 ''I don't think you can talk about issues that matter, in the design of cities, without talking about which political system delivers the better quality of life,'' he said. ''Does democracy work? There are many models of civic intervention.''
 And in his travels to date, which system seems to be the winner?
 ''On the 6th of September, I will tell you,'' he said.

HEADLINE: New Moorings at the South Street Seaport, With a Touch of Centuries Past

BYLINE: By ALAN G. BRAKE

 BODY:
Eleven old warehouses and counting houses on Front Street in the South Street Seaport Historic District have been turned into a collection of 13 shops and 95 apartments, many with exposed beams and brick walls, above left, and original industrial artifacts like a vintage hoist, above right. Part of the abandoned Fulton Fish Market, between Beekman Street and Peck Slip, the buildings date to the late 18th and early 19th centuries and were in a state of ''romantic collapse,'' said Richard Cook, a principal in the New York architectural firm of Cook & Fox, which worked to revitalize the area without rubbing off its patina. 
 The architects, working for a developer, Yarrow, filled in gaps with three new low-rise buildings and created new entrances and shared spaces. Courtyard gardens were designed by Saratoga Associates, a New York firm, and the architects tapped into subterranean geothermal energy for heating and cooling, freeing up rooftops for common terraces.
The apartments, with rents of $2,250 to $8,500, have attracted newcomers like William and Coren Sharples, partners in SHoP, an architectural firm. ''We love that it feels like a traditional New York cityscape, not a tourist destination,'' Mr. Sharples said, adding that because the design is so intimate, after 15 years in New York he knows most of his neighbors for the first time. 
 Mr. Cook said he was so moved by the commission, part of the city's downtown redevelopment plan, that he found himself in tears. ''You get really emotionally invested in certain projects,'' he said, ''and this place has a feeling of authenticity unlike any other.'' ALAN G. BRAKE

HEADLINE: American Companies Show an Edge in Putting Information to Work

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
PRODUCTIVITY just keeps humming along. Growth in output per hour in the third quarter of 2005 was a striking 5.4 percent. In fact, output per hour has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 3.5 percent over the last three years.
 These are large numbers by historical terms. From 1974 to 1995, productivity grew at around 1.4 percent a year. Productivity growth in the United States accelerated to about 2.5 percent a year from 1995 to 2000. Since then, productivity has grown at a bit over 3 percent a year, with the last few years looking particularly strong. 
Unlike the United States, European countries have not seen the same surge in productivity growth in the last 10 years. Why the difference?
 The answer, according to Nick Bloom, Raffaella Sadun and John Van Reenen, researchers at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, is that American companies make much more effective use of information technology than European companies. (A selection of their studies can be downloaded from http://cep.lse.ac.uk/research/innovation/ict.asp.)
 Nowadays, most economists agree that information technology is a significant part of the explanation for the post-1995 productivity surge in the United States. In fact, when you look at productivity statistics by industry, those industries that make and use information and communications technologies intensively in the United States have accounted for the bulk of the productivity growth, with other industries showing little change.
 The story is quite different in the European Union. In the late 1990's, when productivity growth in the United States was accelerating, productivity growth in Europe was static. But Europe has access to the same information technology that the United States does, at more or less the same prices. Why didn't those countries get the same increase in productivity?
 To answer the question, we have to move away from macroeconomics and look at the experience of individual companies. Work by the economist Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleagues at M.I.T. suggests that organizational factors are quite important. Just dropping a bunch of new personal computers on workers' desks is unlikely to contribute to productivity. A company has to rethink how business processes are handled to get significant cost savings.
 As the Stanford economic historian Paul A. David has pointed out, the productivity effects from the electric motor did not really show up until Henry Ford and other industrialists figured out how to use it effectively to create the assembly line. The same is true for computers: just as the early industrialists had to learn how to use manufacturing technology to optimize the flow of materials on the factory floor, companies today must learn how to use information technology to optimize the flow of information in their organizations.
 It appears that United States companies are much farther up the learning curve than European companies. Professors Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen looked at 7,500 establishments in Britain and found that in terms of value added per worker, American multinational corporations were 23 percent more productive than the average in Britain. Non-American multinationals were about 16 percent more productive than the average, while British companies were about 11 percent less productive than average.
 Furthermore, the authors suggest that information technology capital may be a big part of the productivity difference: American companies in Britain use a whopping 40 percent more information technology capital per worker than the average company. Not only did American companies use more information technology, they used it more effectively. According to the economists, ''U.S. firms appeared to simply get more productivity out of the same amount of I.T. (this was not true of non-I.T. capital).''
 There is an additional piece of evidence: the big returns to information technology use by American companies operating in Britain were in wholesale and retail trade -- the same industries that have been so productive in the United States.
 Why the difference in effective use of information technology? This is still something of a mystery, but part of the answer seems to be managerial practices. According to the authors, American companies are more likely than European companies to adopt practices like merit-based promotion and pay, lean manufacturing techniques, performance management and employee autonomy.
 Personally, I have found that American managers are much more comfortable with computers than their European counterparts. Until a few years ago, a typical European manager could not even type. This is no longer true of the younger generation of European managers, and I would venture to guess that as they move up in their organizations, managerial comfort with information technology in European companies will broaden.
 As a business school professor, I sometimes worry whether we are giving our students the right skills in finance, accounting, marketing and leadership. But the one thing I never worry about is their skills in PowerPoint and Excel; in these areas, the students far surpass their professors. Perhaps the comfort of young American managers in using computers and other sorts of information technology contributes more than we realize to productivity growth.

HEADLINE: Fed Banker's Inflation Remarks Help Send Shares Higher 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks resumed their advance yesterday after the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that core inflation was ''quite moderate.'' The three leading indexes reached several-year highs for the second time this week. 
 Investors interpreted the remarks by the bank chief, Timothy F. Geith-ner, as another sign that the Federal Reserve might soon halt its long series of increases in interest rates. 
His speech calmed concerns on inflation, said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist for A. G. Edwards & Sons. ''Anything that makes investors feel comfortable with the inflation level and the way short-term interest rates are going,'' he said, ''is going to help the market.'' 
 Early in the session, stocks were under pressure after a profit warning from DuPont and by BP's announcement that its oil production slipped in the fourth quarter. DuPont was the second Dow industrial component to disappoint Wall Street in two days; on Tuesday, Alcoa reported earnings lower than expected. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.86 points yesterday, or 0.29 percent, to 11,043.44, the index's best closing level since June 2001. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 4.49 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,294.18. The Nasdaq composite index closed up 11.04 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,331.36. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks rose marginally, up 0.20 point, to 711.19.
 Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners by 9 to 7. Volume was heavy, at 1.75 billion shares. compared with 1.79 billion on Tuesday. There were 309 new 52-week highs and only 29 new lows.
 Shares have risen in six of the first seven trading sessions of 2006, though big stocks paused on Tuesday, closing nearly flat. 
 That pause was broken with the help of Mr. Geithner's remarks yesterday at an economics lunch at the Harvard Club in Manhattan, in which he said that overall inflation pressure had risen but that inflation excluding food and energy ''has been quite moderate, in part due to very modest growth in unit labor costs.'' 
 Shares of DuPont fell $1.41, to $41.14, after the company said that fourth-quarter earnings would be about 10 cents a share, below its guidance in October of 20 cents to 25 cents a share. DuPont cited suspended operations and logistical problems from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as well as production interruptions in Brazil and the Netherlands. 
 BP fell 28 cents, to $67.90, after it said its fourth-quarter production would be slightly lower than in the period a year earlier. It, too, attributed some of this to the hurricanes. BP also disclosed more than $1.3 billion in special charges. 
 The medical device maker Guidant rose $1.05, to $70.44, as board members considered offers for the company from Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson. Boston Scientific's shares dropped $1.07, to $25.41; Johnson & Johnson was down 60 cents, to $62.50.
 Apple Computer, up more than 6 percent Tuesday on unexpectedly strong sales and earnings disclosed at Macworld Expo by its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, climbed $3.04 more yesterday, to close at $83.90.
 Corning rose $1.62, to $24.95, on heavy volume. The company expects a steep increase in demand for glass used in making liquid-crystal displays.
 On the bond market, prices were lower, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling 7/32, to a price of 100 11/32 , Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.45 percent, from 4.43 percent late Tuesday. The following were the results of the Treasury's auction yesterday of five-year notes:

Price: 99.466

HEADLINE: Anger Meets New Orleans Renewal Plan 

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Residents of the city's most devastated neighborhoods responded with anger Wednesday after the city's rebuilding commission unveiled its most contentious proposal: giving neighborhoods in low-lying parts of the city from four months to a year to prove they should not be bulldozed.
 The plan was presented at a standing-room-only meeting punctuated by catcalls and angry outbursts that often interrupted members of the panel. ''Over my dead body'' was uttered more than once. 
''I'm going to suit up like I'm going to Iraq and fight this,'' said Harvey Bender, a laid-off city worker, who shouted out his comments before an audience at the Sheraton Hotel that numbered in the hundreds and spilled into the aisles and hallways. 
 Mr. Bender owns a home in New Orleans East, a predominantly black middle-class neighborhood of 90,000 residents largely destroyed by the flooding that followed Hurricane Katrina. Parts of the neighborhood might not survive, according to the plan, if they do not attract enough returning residents. 
 Speaker after speaker, black and white, prosperous and poor, dismissed a plan that Mayor C. Ray Nagin described as ''controversial.'' But Mr. Nagin gave them hope as he walked a middle line that neither endorsed the plan nor opposed it.
 ''This is only a recommendation,'' Mr. Nagin said in remarks that preceded the formal presentation of the rebuilding plan. ''We as a community will have the ultimate say in how we move forward.''
 The mayor called on people to listen to the commission's presentation with an open mind. ''Take the time to digest this information, to look it over very carefully,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''The reality is we will have limited resources to redevelop our city.'' 
 Yet the audience did not seem in the mood for calm debate. 
 ''Please let us build our own homes,'' said Charles Young, a homeowner in Lakeview, a largely white middle-class neighborhood. ''Let us come back on our own time. Let us spend our insurance money, which we paid for on our own.''
 Under the proposal, residents would not be permitted to move back into the hardest-hit neighborhoods -- about two-thirds of the city, including more than half its homeowners -- for at least four months. During that time, leaders of each neighborhood would have to submit to a citywide planning body a recovery plan that would have to be approved before residents would be allowed back. 
 Neighborhoods not able to come up with an acceptable plan, or those that do not attract sufficient development within a year, could be bulldozed and returned to marshland, with the city compensating homeowners. 
 The plan represents a compromise between the homeowners in low-lying areas who are determined to rebuild, and the scientists and other experts who believe the city should allow large portions of its flood-prone areas to revert to marshland. 
 Each neighborhood would have at its disposal teams of planners and other experts to help residents do what they need to prevent the city from forcing them to live elsewhere. 
 ''We want to give every community as best a chance to come back as we can,'' said Joseph C. Canizaro, a member of the commission. Much of the crowd's enmity was directed at Mr. Canizaro, the plan's main author and a prominent developer here, who was booed several times. 
 ''Joe Canizaro, I don't know you, but I hate you,'' said Mr. Bender, the New Orleans East resident, when granted his turn at the microphone.
 Robyn Braggs, another resident of New Orleans East, said, ''I don't think four or five months is close to enough time given all we would need to do.'' Because former residents are scattered around the country, she said, many, especially those with school-age children, ''won't be able to even return to do the work necessary until this summer.'' 
 Marc H. Morial, a former mayor of New Orleans who is now president of the National Urban League, described the commission's proposal as a ''massive red-lining plan wrapped around a giant land grab.'' Many homeowners will not be able to settle with their insurance companies if they do not know the future of their neighborhoods, he said.
 ''It's cruel to bar people from rebuilding,'' Mr. Morial said. ''Telling people they can't rebuild for four months is tantamount to saying they can't ever come back. It's telling people who have lost almost everything that we're going to take the last vestige of what they own.''
 Not everyone opposed the plan. One resident of Eastover, a wealthy, largely black community in the eastern part of the city devastated by the storm, told the commissioners, ''I accept your challenge'' to craft a workable rebuilding plan. He added, ''I probably will get hit up the side of the head for my comments.'' 
 The plan also impressed Sean Reilly, a member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, who criticized the city last week, saying it had given the impression that all neighborhoods could be restored. Wednesday, he said the plan struck the proper balance between residents' self-determination and tough choices. 
 The plan was developed by the rebuilding commission's Urban Planning committee, which Mr. Canizaro led. It is the first of seven committee reports to be unveiled over the next week and one component of a sweeping redevelopment plan that includes proposals for a $3 billion light-rail system and an economic development corporation, fashioned after the one New York created to oversee rebuilding in Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The commission is also proposing that New Orleans borrow a second idea from New York: asking the federal government for permission to sell tax-exempt bonds to rebuild businesses, just as New York was able to do to rebuild downtown. 
 But the commission will clearly have a difficult time selling its plan to residents. ''This is a big, audacious plan put together by obviously brilliant people,'' said Fred Yoder, a resident of Lakeview. ''But you missed the boat. We don't need a rail system. We need housing.''

HEADLINE: Expectations Were High, but So Were the Hurdles

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Two months ago, thousands of voter application forms from Mexico were delivered to a shabby former convent in Manhattan, a gathering place for Mexican New Yorkers like Fernando Sauce, a pizza maker; Enrique Lopez, a construction worker; and Salvador Mendoz, a boxing trainer.
 The forms were supposed to represent a historic opportunity: For the first time this year, millions of Mexicans living abroad have a chance to vote by absentee ballot in the presidential election back home. In New York, where immigrants from the Dominican Republic seized a similar opportunity in 2004 and helped unseat the incumbent, demand for the forms by Mexican newcomers was expected to be especially high.
But last week, with a Jan. 15 deadline for applications looming, most of the forms were still stacked unused in the former convent on West 14th Street, the headquarters of Asociacion Tepeyac de New York, an immigrant-rights organization that serves one of the fastest-growing Mexican communities in the United States. Brother Joel Magallan, the director, counted only a few dozen completed applications. 
 Nationwide, the story was the same. As of Monday, just 13,573 Mexican expatriates had applied, out of what was once estimated as 4 million eligible to vote in the July election; only 7,795 had been approved. Even with last-minute publicity, the results promised embarrassment for everyone concerned, including the Mexican election institute, which devoted $12 million to absentee voting, and the Mexican-American activists who spent years lobbying for the ballot on behalf of an estimated 11 million expatriates. 
 ''This is a mess,'' Brother Magallan said. ''In Mexico most people say, 'Why are we spending a lot of money on the election in the United States if they don't care?' '' Like many who fought for the vote, he contends that the absentee voting system arranged by Mexican officials was set up to fail. Problems that many analysts cite include too little time and information, a cumbersome registration process that excludes most would-be voters or requires them to travel to Mexico to get a voting ID, and rules against campaigning in the United States.
 Others say expectations were overblown last summer when Mexican legislators gave in to political pressure from migrants, who send home $16 billion a year. Instituto Federal Electoral, Mexico's election institute, suddenly had to run a fraud-free election not just in Mexico but also in the United States. 
 ''They were reluctant, and it shows,'' said Roberto Suro, executive director of the Pew Hispanic Center, which conducted research suggesting that many Mexicans in the United States would vote if allowed. ''There is going to be a huge debate over whether the result meant that the people here just didn't care about politics in Mexico or if it was the process.''
 Interviews with Mexican New Yorkers at Tepeyac's computer classes and at the Mexican consulate support both views. ''I would like to try to get a vote, but I don't have an ID,'' said Mr. Sauce, the pizza maker, who came to the United States in 1993, when he was 17. ''I tried to get it at the consulate, but they give me too many excuses.''
 He was referring to a Mexican voter credential that under current law can be issued only in the voter's hometown. A photocopy of the card must be included in the application for an absentee ballot, along with proof of address in the United States, like an electric bill. Brother Magallan said that many Mexicans in the United States illegally paid bills under a false name or lived in subdivided dwellings with no record of their presence.
 Though the election is not until July, applications for an absentee ballot must be sent individually before Jan. 15 by certified mail, costing about $8. Brother Magallan said on television in mid-December that applications left at Tepeyac would be hand-delivered to Mexican authorities under a special dispensation. 
 But Mr. Lopez, the construction worker, was one of many would-be voters who mistakenly sent in his application by regular mail instead. ''I'm going to do it over,'' vowed Mr. Lopez, 23, who left Mexico for the Bronx at 18 and regularly sends money to his parents and brothers in Puebla. ''Our vote could make the difference in Mexico. There's a lot of exploitation of the minorities. The economy is not growing.''
 Besides Mr. Lopez, the only other computer student with the necessary voting card was Mr. Mendoz, the boxing trainer, who said he had no desire to register. After almost two years in the United States, he said, he knew too little about the issues. ''I don't suffer the same as people over there,'' he said.
 The lackluster participation will likely deflate the image and clout of Mexican-American organizations, said Alejandro Poire, a visiting professor of Latin American studies at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. 
 ''The idea that these groups were very active and organized and really representing a massive demand was clearly overstated,'' said Professor Poire, a former official of Mexico's election institute. But he added, ''I think we would have a different picture if candidates were holding rallies and registration drives in the United States.''
 The contrast with the Dominican election in May 2004 supports his view. Dominican political parties campaigned hard in New York, where 24,342 Dominican New Yorkers registered out of about half a million who were eligible, according to Jose Fernandez, president of the board of elections for the Dominican Republic in New York. More than 68 percent of those registered turned out to vote at public schools and the consulate. ''Now we have hundreds of people calling every day to come and register,'' Mr. Fernandez said.
 Pilar Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the election institute, said the comparison was unfair, since Dominicans are concentrated in New York, while a much larger Mexican population is spread across the nation. ''Many criticisms have been issued and many are well founded, but we have to see the context,'' she said. That thousands registered in 90 days is ''not insignificant,'' she added.
 Like the Pew Hispanic Center, the election institute had theorized that in the newest areas of Mexican settlement, like New York and North Carolina, more Mexicans were likely to have valid voter ID cards. It calculated that up to 4.2 million expatriates could have cards, in addition to 69 million voters in Mexico.
 But it turns out that many of the migrants' cards have been lost or were destroyed at the border, Ms. Alvarez said. And projections by expatriate organizations that up to 10 percent, or 400,000 people, might register were ill founded because studies show the highest absentee participation rate anywhere is 5 percent.
 Lack of official enthusiasm also shaped the results, Mr. Suro said: ''There was potentially a large number of voters in what has all the potential to be a close election, and they have no way of knowing what their political orientation would be.'' 
 For Mexico's election institute, which banned campaigning in the United States because it could not enforce spending limits there, the stakes are also high. The coming election is seen as a major test of its achievement in running the landmark election of 2000, in which Vincente Fox became the first opposition party candidate to win the presidency in 71 years and the vote count was accepted as honest. 
 President Fox's handpicked successor was trounced in the primary. The next president will be chosen from among the left-wing former mayor of Mexico City, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador; a conservative former energy minister, Felipe Calderon; and Roberto Madrazo, a political boss in the P.R.I. machine, which ruled Mexico for seven decades. 
 But at the Mexican consulate in New York last week, the race seemed far away. Jaime Diaz, 39, a Brooklyn garment worker with five children, said he had no interest in voting in Mexico after 16 years in the United States. On the other hand, Sixto Carrillos, 60, a maintenance worker who has also lived in New York for 16 years, had made a special trip seeking an absentee ballot but was stopped outside the consulate door by a security guard who told him there were none. 
 Only when Mr. Carrillos persisted did the guard, glancing at the watching reporter, reach for one of the application forms on display inside and hand it to him. 
 ''I'm a Mexican citizen,'' Mr. Carrillos said, visibly frustrated. ''When I come here, nobody knows anything. It's confusing. I'm still unsure what's the right thing to do.''

HEADLINE: The New Megayachts: Too Much of a Good Thing?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WHETHER it's providing a helicopter pad or installing jade-inlaid marble in the master bedroom, William S. Smith III has grown accustomed to satisfying every request from his custom-yacht customers -- except when it comes to finding places where they can park their outsized boats. 
 Many megayachts have grown so big -- sometimes as long as a football field -- that their very size rules out docking at most marinas, which don't have large enough slips to accommodate them. To combat the crunch, Mr. Smith, vice president of Trinity Yachts in Gulfport, Miss., one of the top custom yacht builders in the world, has begun to design vessels based strictly on where the owners plan to take them.
''If an owner tells me he wants to be in St. Bart's on New Year's Eve, that means he can't build over 200 feet,'' Mr. Smith said. ''If they tell us they want to do the Bahamas, which is relatively shallow, the boat can't have more than an eight-foot draft -- no matter what size.'' 
 More and more, limitations like these are frustrating the growing megayacht crowd. In recent years, the production of these nautical behemoths, which range from 80 feet to more than 200 feet and can easily cost as much as $200 million, has been outpacing the availability of dockage long enough or deep enough to accommodate them. 
 There are an estimated 7,000 motor yachts over 80 feet long in use, said Jill Bobrow, editor in chief of ShowBoats International, a yachting magazine. That's up from about 4,000 a decade ago.
 ''Boats are getting bigger and bigger,'' Ms. Bobrow said. ''It used to be that 200 feet was big. Now the largest boats are 400 feet.'' Contracts for motor yachts 150 feet and larger increased 15 percent, to 118 from 103, in 2005, according to ShowBoats International. Of those 118, 33 percent are more than 200 feet.
 By contrast, there are roughly 440 marinas with berths big enough and water deep enough to accommodate vessels 100 feet or bigger, according to Superports, a British magazine that publishes an annual list of megayacht marinas. It is a problem that has vexed Ira and Audrey Kaufman ever since they built their dream boat, Gray Mist III, a 150-foot yacht fashioned after their home in Highland Park, Ill. -- complete with antique furniture, a working fireplace and a dining table that seats 12 -- about five years ago.
 ''Many places that we go to, you can't get in the marina because our draft is too deep,'' said Mr. Kaufman, 77, a senior managing director at Mesirow Financial. He ended up purchasing a dock slip at the Fisher Island Club, one of the few Miami-area marinas that can accommodate such a large boat. He estimates his dock slip would sell for about $7,000 a foot today. Most marinas have only a handful of slips for these large vessels. And because boating is seasonal -- with owners typically heading to the Caribbean in the winter and the Mediterranean in the summer -- megayachts are constantly competing for the same dock space. 
 ''There's so few marinas now that you can get a boat in,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''There's not room.'' Without a spot at the dock, megayacht owners and their passengers are relegated to dropping anchor off the coast and lowering a dinghy to get ashore. But after spending untold millions on a yacht and used to getting the V.I.P. treatment everywhere else they go, most owners prefer not to do so. 
 ''A lot of times, it's first come, first served,'' said Chris McChristian, who is working on his British captain's license and until recently worked as a pilot on a 107-foot yacht, the Anne-Marie, whose owner Mr. McChristian declined to identify. ''If you get there and it's too tight, you'll go to a facility that's not as good or be at anchor somewhere having to commute in by tender. With owners, that's a very awkward position to be in.'' The megayachters, he added, ''like to step on and off the boat.'' 
 But all that is about to change.
 IN an effort to capitalize on the megadollars that megayachts can bring to a harbor area, coastal resorts around the globe are racing to build or retrofit their marinas to accommodate the colossal cruisers. Nowhere is the pursuit more pronounced than in the Caribbean, where there are still large chunks of undeveloped shores, and in Florida, where a real estate boom over the last few years has been fueling new waterfront developments. 
 From Miami to St. Thomas, new marinas with names like Super Yacht Harbor and Yacht Haven are being developed with berths for boats as long as 450 feet, roughly half the length of a 2,000-passenger cruise ship. To keep megayacht owners busy -- not to mention spending -- while their boats are parked at the marina, developers are surrounding their ports with high-end restaurants and retail shops. To entice yacht owners and their entourages to stay longer, they are also building luxury condominiums and five-star hotels. 
 As a result, a new real estate concept is beginning to emerge centered on the lifestyle of the boating elite. Island Capital Group in New York is transforming an existing port, Long Bay Harbor in St. Thomas, into a megayacht marina called Yacht Haven Grande with 48 slips averaging 120 feet in length. Twelve luxury condominiums, four waterfront restaurants, high-end shopping and a private yacht club around the 32-acre harbor are scheduled to open in the fall.
 In Miami, Flagstone Property Group is designing Island Gardens, a $480 million development to be built on Watson Island, between downtown Miami and South Beach. Island Gardens will include a 50-slip Super-Yacht Harbor for vessels up to 450 feet, a Westin hotel and a Shangri-La Hotel, to open in 2008, offering round-the-clock butler service. Shangri-La will also manage 105 fractional-ownership residences on the site and CHI, a 20,000-square-foot spa. 
 Developers believe the megayachts will be an inherent attraction, drawing other visitors to the destination as well. ''It's not only a place to visit for the megayacht owners, but also a great opportunity for people to enjoy viewing the megayachts,'' said Mehmet Bayraktar, chief executive of Flagstone Property Group. ''That's how places like Monaco and Portofino became famous. People want to get close to that lifestyle.'' 
 Bigwig boaters who pull into these new marinas can expect white-glove treatment. Uniformed dockhands will greet owners upon arrival, help bring boats in and assist crews in obtaining provisions. The owner will be able to step off the boat for fine dining or for a massage. A concierge office will be available to arrange car services or sightseeing excursions. 
 Many port towns see these new developments as a way to increase the flow of high-end tourists and help their economies with new jobs and revenue from servicing the big boats that stop by -- a 155-foot yacht can guzzle 16,000 gallons of gas at one fill up, for example -- as well as pampering their owners. In 2002, the average expenditure of a megayacht visit to boatyards in Broward, Dade and Palm Beach Counties in Florida was $140,000, according to a report by Thomas J. Murray, a marine business specialist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at the College of William & Mary. The direct economic impact of megayacht repair and maintenance projects at local boatyards was an estimated $181.6 million.
 Already, yacht owners and real estate investors are showing interest in the houses and condominiums being designed around the harbors. The first phase of construction at Cupecoy Yacht Club, a new marina development being built on St. Martin by the real estate arm of Orient-Express Hotels, is not expected to be finished until fall 2007. But 20 percent of its 169 planned condominiums sold within twomonths of the project's announcement last year. Sales included condominium units with one to four bedrooms and a penthouse for $1.3 million; the sales generated $23 million in revenue. 
 Chub Cay Marina & Resort, a private island in the Bahamas that is being redeveloped to expand a marina for megayachts, has sold roughly 75 percent of its new 57 colonial-style villas and has raised the prices to $1 million to $3 million, from the $850,000 to $2.5 million range it had been charging. On West Caicos, an 11-square-mile island in the Turks and Caicos where a new marina resembling an 18th-century seaside village is planned, 15 of 30 Ritz-Carlton-branded condominiums have been sold. 
 For the most part, because the megayacht industry is still relatively new, developers are taking an ''if you build it, they will come'' approach with the marinas. In a few cases, megayachts have already shown up at unfinished developments. 
 At West Caicos Reserve, there are no fuel, no restaurants and no hotel rooms yet at the 12-acre harbor. But megayachts have already been stopping by.
 ''We don't know how they found us already,'' said Alan Lisenby, managing director of Logwood Development Company, the developer of West Caicos Reserve. Because the marina is not yet officially open or providing services, Logwood is not charging the yachts for mooring in the harbor.
 ''Basically, we'll let them stay for free if we can take their picture,'' Mr. Lisenby said.

HEADLINE: Silver City, N.M.

BYLINE: By MARIA FINN

 BODY:
PEOPLE who live in Silver City like to say that their town of 10,000 offers ''the real New Mexico experience.'' Perched on the edge of the Gila National Forest in a high-desert wonderland of ponderosas, deep gorges and red-rock mesas, Silver City is a bit rough around the edges, especially compared with places like Santa Fe and Taos -- but that's the way the locals like it. The town was founded after silver ore was discovered in 1870, and soon transplanted Yankees built the large Victorian houses that still loom over newer structures in the historic downtown. The silver industry crashed in 1893, but the town was becoming a haven for tuberculosis patients -- including Billy the Kid's mother -- because of the desert air and healing hot springs. (Billy himself passed some of his youth in Silver City.) By the 1900's, TB patients started going there en masse. After 1910, large-scale copper mining began, and that continues to be the basis of the economy, making Silver City a place where miners, artists, ranchers and extreme sports types mix easily. MARIA FINN

Friday 


5 p.m.
1 -- Fruits of the Desert
The tradition of New Mexico viticulture is said to date back more than 350 years to Spanish monks who established a small vineyard to make sacramental wine. Today, some wine bars in New Mexico sell only those wines made in the state, and the Twisted Vine (108 East Broadway, 505-388-2828) specializes further by serving only vintages made south of Tularosa. Those turn out to be a wide range of varietals, with many running toward the sweet end of the spectrum. For something drier, try the hearty syrah from D. H. Lescombes ($6) or the oaky Luna Rossa red zinfandel ($5). Sit back and enjoy the scene. ''We see a lot of cowboys dragged in here by their girlfriends,'' the bartender explained. ''Initially they're reluctant, but they usually find something they like.''

8 p.m.
2 -- Taste of the Old West
The Buckhorn Saloon and Opera House, above, is seven miles north of Silver City in Pinos Altos (32 Main Street, 505-538-9911). The original saloon, built in 1865, is now a dark and smoky restaurant with roaring fireplaces and sparkling chandeliers. As you tuck into a filet mignon ($29.95) or porterhouse ($26.95) cut from local beef and sip a local Mademoiselle pinot noir (bottle $16.95), you might feel as if you're dining in a brothel from the frontier days -- and, according to the manager, Karen Campbell, that is, in fact, what you are doing. Reservations are recommended on weekdays and required on weekends. It's a bar after 8 p.m., so if you're with children, plan on finishing by then. The Opera House next door, built in 1969 in the Old West style, plays host to melodramas much of the year and to occasional events in the winter.

Saturday

8 a.m.
3 -- Silver's Spoon
Make your way to Nancy's Silver Cafe (514 North Bullard Street, 505-388-3480) on Silver City's main drag for a breakfast of huevos rancheros ($6). The dish of fried eggs over corn tortillas covered with green chili sauce and chunks of beef is reason alone to visit this town. For another spicy option, try huevos con chorizo ($6).

10 a.m.
4 -- Gallery Stroll
Walk the streets of the old town and duck into the brightly painted adobe galleries along Yankie and Texas Streets, above. One nearby highlight: the StudioSpace and Gallery (109 North Bullard Street, 505-535-4548), which exhibits photography and is also the home of the Bakshi School of Animation. The school is associated with Ralph Bakshi, the animator known for his ribald 1970's features ''Fritz the Cat'' and ''Heavy Traffic.'' Continue on to the Silver City Museum (312 West Broadway, 505-538-5921) to learn about the town's past, and then to the Western New Mexico University Museum (west end of West 10th Street, 505-538-6386) to learn about Mimbres pottery, Navajo rugs and prehistoric Southwest artifacts.

1 p.m.
5 -- They'll Always Have Chili
The Jalisco Cafe (103 South Bullard Street, 505-388-2060) is a bright, airy restaurant serving Mexican specialties like chicken tortilla soup ($3.59) and minicrab tostadas ($4.09). If you just can't get enough of this region's smoky green chiles, try the chile relleno plate ($8.09) for a cheese-filled but surprisingly light entree.

3 p.m.
6 -- The Health-Seekers' Way
The owners of the Elemental Day Spa (406 North Black Street, 505-534-1811), Laurie Larson and Mari King, run their friendly and elegant place in a hands-on manner, so to speak, as they also work directly with clients. Hydrate with the Desert Relief Body Wrap ($85): your skin is exfoliated, then a Sedona-mud-and-paraffin mixture is applied over a layer of moisturizing cream. Once your skin is silky smooth, try the Swedish-based Elemental Signature Massage ($50 for 60 minutes; $75 for 90 minutes).

5:30 p.m.
7 -- Dome of Stars
Astronomy and stargazing programs have proliferated in New Mexico since 1999, when the state government started regulating outdoor lighting to protect views of the night sky. City of Rocks State Park (505-536-2800, www.nmparks.com), off Highway 61 about 25 miles southeast of Silver City, holds star parties and other stargazing activities as part of the National Public Observatory's Stars-N-Parks program. Often, star parties are accompanied with talks about how the desert sky informed the cosmology of Southwestern Indians, or by traditional tales told round the campfire by native storytellers.

8 p.m.
8 -- A Fistful of Pasta
Walk to Spaghetti Western (106 North Texas Street, 505-534-4999) to warm up from the cold desert night with a hearty meal. The restaurant does not serve alcohol, so get right to the antipasto platter of Italian meats and cheeses with fire-roasted red peppers, olives and grilled eggplant brushed with white truffle oil ($7.95). You can't go wrong with the lasagna classico ($11.50) or the pasta puttanesca ($10.95) for entrees.

10 p.m.
9 -- Buffalo Stance
Sidestep the big dogs tied up out front and don't knock over the motorcycles on your way in to the Buffalo Bar in the center of town (211 North Bullard Street, 505-538-3201). This is a beer (Santa Fe Wheat from the Santa Fe Brewing Company, $3) or boilermaker ($5.50) kind of place. On Thursday nights, college students come to dance to D.J.'s spinning Tejano and Country and Western music. Open until 2 a.m. Monday to Saturday and until midnight on Sundays.

Sunday

9 a.m.
10 -- Birding and Breakfast
Head north on Highway 15 to the Gila National Forest and follow the winding mountain road through switchbacks and stunning vistas until it intersects with Highway 35. There, at the Grey Feathers Lodge (505-536-3206, www.greyfeathers.com), you can enjoy a breakfast of eggs scrambled with shredded roast beef and green chilis in a Machaca burrito ($4.25) while you watch a flock of dark-eyed juncos feed from the many bird feeders surrounding the restaurant. In the summer, thousands of hummingbirds gather here.

Noon
11 -- Ancient Dwellings
Follow a short trail through a shady canyon and up to the rocky crags of the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument (505-536-9461, www.nps.gov/gicl; $3 for adults, directions to the visitor center and trailhead are available online or by phone). There, in the 1280's, people of the Mogollon culture occupied caves, which may have been used as ceremonial centers, work areas, communal kitchens or prayer kivas. The site today is eerie and beautiful: brick barriers and catwalks are still intact; sunlight plays dramatically off rock walls; the sound of the stream running through the canyon below echoes gently like murmurs in a cathedral. The mystery of why these people chose to live in these cliffs is eclipsed only by the mystery of why they appear to have abruptly left after about 25 years.

THE BASICS

Old New Mexico On the High Desert
 THERE is a small airport near Silver City with daily flights from Albuquerque, but most visitors arrive by car via Interstate 10, which runs south of Silver City and connects it with El Paso and Tucson. It is about a two-and-a-half-hour drive from El Paso, five hours from Phoenix and four and a half hours from Albuquerque. 
 The Inn on Broadway (411 West Broadway, 866-207-7075; www.innonbroadwayweb.com), run by a retired couple from Massachusettes, is a nicely renovated house built in 1883 in downtown Silver City. Some rooms include a whirlpool tub and are stocked with locally made bath salts and hand creams. Breakfast is included. Its four rooms range from $85 to $125 a night.
 The Bear Mountain Lodge (877-620-2327; www.bearmountainlodge.com), a bed-and-breakfast that is run by the Nature Conservancy, is a renovated hacienda from the 1920's three miles north of Silver City, adjacent to the Gila National Forest. Packages include birding and native art and archeology weekends. Rooms and cottages range from $115 to $185 a night. 
 At the Casitas de Gila Guesthouses (50 Casita Flats Road, Gila; 877-923-4827; www.casitasdegila.com), each Southwest-style house has a full kitchen and a wood-burning fireplace and comes with high-powered binoculars to spot bighorn sheep. Rates are $95 to $185.

'THE PAJAMA GAME' Previews start Thursday. Opens Feb. 23. Labor unrest leads to romance in this classic musical about a manager and a union representative at a pajama factory.

Broadway

'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodovar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)

* 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)

'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

*'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. (Genzlinger)

'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)

* 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)

 Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

* 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THE OTHER SIDE' In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'APRIL'S SHOWER' (No rating, 98 minutes) A lighthearted comedy about the outing of a bride-to-be and her five-year relationship with her maid of honor. Though filled with sitcom-ready stereotypes, ''April's Shower'' presents a refreshingly volatile view of sexual orientation. As faces are slapped and partners are switched, the movie leaves you with the feeling that gay is good, but bi can be even better. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

* 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)

* 'CACHE (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)

'EL CARRO' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Pleasant but slight, this sociological farce from Colombia tells the story of a vintage convertible that changes the lives of the middle-class Velez family to mildly humorous effect. (Nathan Lee)

* 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)

'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile.(Laura Kern)

'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)

'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)

'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)

* 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)

'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee)

'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)

* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)

* 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)

'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)

'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)

* 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career and the most anguished. (Dargis)

* 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)

* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)

'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)

'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Boheme'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)

'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Lee)

'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott)

* 'STATE OF FEAR: THE TRUTH ABOUT TERRORISM' (No rating, 94 minutes, in English and Spanish) Based on more than 16,000 testimonies to the Peruvian Truth & Reconciliation Commission, Pamela Yates's harrowing documentary chronicles the 20 years of terror between the rise of the Maoist leader Abimael Guzman and his Shining Path guerrillas, and the November 2000 overthrow of President Alberto Fujimori's corrupt dictatorship. Together with ''The Montesinos Media Buy,'' seven minutes of surveillance video depicting the Fujimori regime's media bribery, ''State of Fear'' is a timely lesson on the hazards of choosing security over democracy. (Catsoulis)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture cliches. (Scott)

'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)

'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manque never develops any stamina. (Holden)

'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)

Film Series

FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program is presenting a series of 11 feature films and 2 shorts by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82).

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ACT LOCAL HURRICANE BENEFIT (Sunday) The charity group Act Local presents an all-day benefit show for the Southern Arts Federation Emergency Relief Fund, which aids musicians affected by last year's hurricanes. More than 30 local musical acts are scheduled to perform, including the Wrens, Nada Surf, Estevez and Langhorne Slim. All Ages. 1 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra)

AKRON/FAMILY, MI AND L'AU, WOODEN WAND (Tomorrow) This bill sandwiches the whispery Finland-based folk duo Mi and L'au between two weirder acts: the layered and deceptively melodic Akron/Family, a quiescent lo-fi quartet that explores the dark crannies and latent explosiveness of Americana, and Wooden Wand (a k a James Toth), who mixes modal guitars with mutters and yawps that suggest a Pentecostal drunk. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra)

BURNSIDE PROJECT (Tonight) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath. 8, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)

CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN, TRAMPLED BY TURTLES (Tomorrow) The 80's college-rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California. The electric bluegrass band Trampled by Turtles opens. 10 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)

LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country resume that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 8 and 10, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, between Second and Third Streets, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra)

OLU DARA, RICHIE HAVENS (Monday) The cornetist Olu Dara leads a group that takes an amiable approach to a stream of good-time American music that runs from old jazz and blues to funk; he keeps audiences happy. An unswerving 60's holdout, Richie Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

THE ENGLISH BEAT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dave Wakeling still performs under the name of his old Birmingham band, which in the 80's mastered a soulful version of British ska and had hits with songs like the jittery ''Mirror in the Bathroom.'' 8, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)

MARK EITZEL (Tonight) The American Music Club's Mark Eitzel continues his conspiratorial wallowing and baritone complaints, with increasingly electronic beats of late. The sad-folk outfit Last Town Chorus also plays. 8:30, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)

GOLDEN FESTIVAL (Tonight and Tomorrow) Featuring the energetic Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band, which plays dance music in the Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian and Romany traditions, this two-day festival of regional Balkan dance and music begins with a program that will include John Parish, the Greek-Macedonian Kavala Band and the Scandinavian Loretta Kelley before a midnight Zlatne Uste show. Some of the more than 50 performers filling tomorrow's three performance spaces hail from places like Bulgaria, Slovakia and Macedonia, but the bill also includes admirers from Norway, Iran and Louisiana.

HARD-FI (Tuesday) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic arena punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)

HUUN-HUUR-TU (Tomorrow) Cowboys from Tuva, where Siberia meets Mongolia, cultivate the technique of throat singing: producing a deep bass note and two or three harmonics above it, all at the same time. Tibetan monks use a similar technique for Buddhist chants. Huun-Huur-Tu uses the style for ancient herding songs and newer material. It is an eerie, riveting sound, like a growl linked to whistling winds, and it seems both raw and timeless. 8 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Pareles)

JAZZANOVA (Sunday) Alexander Barck performs as an ambassador of Berlin's Jazzanova, an electronic music collective that has always placed an emphasis on groove over glitch. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, meatpacking district, (212) 645-5700; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)

FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) Freedy Johnston's finely turned country-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. 7:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Pareles)

B. B. KING: TRIBUTE TO MARTIN LUTHER KING (Sunday) The bluesman B. B. King's falsetto vocal flips and vibrato guitar licks have been an indelible influence on the blues and rock traditions. He made his musical reputation in Memphis, which is also where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died. This Sunday, on the eve of Martin Luther King Day, he plays a show in the civil rights leader's honor. 7 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $35 to $100. (Sinagra)

THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco ornamented by clang and Moog-like warps. It's the sound of postindustrial slackers having a party in a junk shop, dancing freely. 9 p.m., Supreme Trading, 213 North Eighth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4224; free with R.S.V.P. at www.crashinin.com. (Sinagra)

KOOL KEITH, SLUM VILLAGE (Tomorrow) The shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith's Ultramagnetic MC's were a critical hit in the late 80's, helping to nudge old school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. Solo, he created personae like Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom, though his intricate, zany rhymes have grown less rewarding over time. Detroit's Slum Village also plays. 11:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

LYCAON PICTUS (Tomorrow) Aaron Diskin used to play with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' kinetic, stinging guitarist Nick Zinner, but Mr. Diskin's music for the synthesizer-bass-drum trio Lycaon Pictus is darker, recalling the apocalypse imagined by forerunners like Pere Ubu. 8 p.m., Kingsland Tavern, 244 Nassau Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-9883; $5. (Sinagra)

PABLO MAYOR AND FOLKLORE URBANO, FORRO FOR ALL (Thursday) Pablo Mayor's Folklore Urbano gives Colombian folk some modern inflections. Rob Curto's Forro for All plays bouncy accordion-based party music from northeastern Brazil. 7:30 p.m., Makor Steinhardt Building, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; $12. (Sinagra)

MI AND L'AU (Tonight) The Finnish singer Mi and the French musician L'au, after becoming a couple in Paris, reportedly moved to the woods in Finland to record what they will showcase here, a cache of austere, wintery bedroom folk. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sinagra)

ELIZABETH MITCHELL: YOU ARE MY FLOWER (Tomorrow) Like several indie-rockers, the soft-pop band Ida's Elizabeth Mitchell and Daniel Littleton have turned to making kids' music lately. Their approach takes the form of reinterpreting classic folk songs. Here Ms. Mitchell plays and sings selections from that repertory. 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, (212) 864-5400; $14; members and children, $10; Just Kidding Club members, $5. (Sinagra)

ALEC OUNSWORTH, PURE HORSEHAIR, MICHAEL LEVITON (Tomorrow) The frontman of the local rock band Clap Your Hands Say Yeah has a side project with members of Ida, Boss Tweed and Ill Ease. Also on the bill are Pure Horsehair (a k a Garrett Devoe), a fingerpicking folk-pop songwriter, and Michael Leviton, who plays sea shanties on the ukulele. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra)

MIGUEL POVEDA WITH GIOVANNI HIDALGO (Thursday through Jan. 21) Th0e raspy drama of traditional flamenco singing arrives in a new generation with Miguel Poveda, an award-winning flamenco vocalist. He plays here with Giovanni Hidalgo, a percussionist who can make his conga drums crackle, slide, sing melodies and just about talk. 7:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Sinagra)

THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Wednesday) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant.

SUFJAN STEVENS (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter and banjoist is imbued with a Coplandesque musical vision and an expansive narcissism reminiscent of Walt Whitman's, though his lyrics can overreach and his compositions veer into the folksily baroque. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800; $20 to $45 (sold out). (Sinagra)

(Pareles)

THE SYN (Tuesday) Back when the Who used to play the Marquee, the Syn used to open for them. One band member, Chris Squire, went on to become way more famous as the bassist with Yes.

King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sinagra)

(Sinagra)

THE WRENS (Tonight) These noise-artist rockers write about life in their home state of New Jersey, but not with a Fountains of Wayne smirk.

BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum.

(Chinen)

THE BAD PLUS (Wednesday and Thursday) The pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer David King piqued jazz purists a few years ago with a spate of irreverent cover tunes; ''Suspicious Activity?'' (Columbia), their most recent album, shifted the focus to epic-sounding originals. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

(Chinen)

KENNY GARRETT QUARTET/HIROMI (Tuesday through Jan. 22) Mr. Garrett is a forceful and propulsive personality on the alto saxophone; Hiromi is a diminutive yet dynamic presence on electric keyboards and piano. Both artists favor tight ensembles, although that commonality doesn't quite explain this odd double bill. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen)

ROY HARGROVE AND MULGREW MILLER (Sunday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, and Mr. Miller, the pianist, share a postbop language especially rooted in the blues; their duo performance comes under the banner of chamber jazz, but the music they concoct should make the term seem quaint. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. Mr. Miller also plays with his trio tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)

(Chinen)

ROBERT HURST GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Hurst, a bassist with a deep and earthy tone, has long been a resourceful small-group composer, as well as an underappreciated bandleader. This weekend he applies those talents to two distinct crews: a next-generation quartet with the pianist Robert Glasper, the guitarist Lionel Loueke and the drummer Karriem Riggins (tonight); and a quintet of somewhat more experienced peers, like the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the alto saxophonist Donald Harrison and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson (tomorrow). 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

INGRID JENSEN QUINTET (Thursday) A fiery postbop trumpeter with a book of smart original tunes, Ms. Jensen performs here with the same rhythm section featured on her new album, ''At Sea'' (ArtistShare): the guitarist Lage Lund, the keyboardist Geoffrey Keezer, the bassist Matt Clohesy and the drummer Jon Wikan. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8.

GRETCHEN PARLATO (Tomorrow; Tuesday through Jan. 21) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a continuing deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, which is never more pronounced than when she performs with the guitarist Lionel Loueke. Tomorrow at 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. Tuesday through Thursday at 11 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $10, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

RE:ARRANGED: THE MUSIC OF JACO PASTORIUS, GIL EVANS, LENNON & McCARTNEY (Through Sunday) The sweep of this project, which clearly runs the risk of incoherence, could be a perfect challenge for the pianist and accordionist Gil Goldstein, one of the most resourceful arrangers in jazz today. Just as promising is the lineup, featuring the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the saxophonist Chris Potter, the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the bassist Richard Bona, the percussionist Don Alias, and an improvising string trio led by the violinist Joyce Hammann. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

CHRIS POTTER TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Potter is among the small number of tenor saxophonists to have absorbed both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and emerged sounding like his own man; he appears here in the setting that both predecessors helped popularize, backed only by bass (Scott Colley) and drums (Jeff Ballard). 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)

TIM RIES AND THE ROLLING STONES PROJECT (Thursday) Mr. Ries, a tenor and soprano saxophonist who has toured extensively with the rock 'n' roll institution mentioned here, rearranges a handful of its signature hits, smoothing many of the rough edges but also uncovering ample opportunities for improvisation. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)

WALLACE RONEY SEXTET (Through Sunday) On the recent album ''Mystikal'' (High Note), Mr. Roney advanced a variety of Afrocentric futurism inherited and adapted from his trumpet mentor Miles Davis; he explores similar territory in an ensemble with Robert Irving on piano, Clarence Seay on bass, Eric Allen on drums, Val Jeanty on turntables and his brother, Antoine Roney, on tenor and soprano saxophone. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25 to $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel is almost certainly the most widely hailed jazz guitarist under 40, especially among musicians; his deeply sympathetic rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner provides the focal point of this shadowy and slippery ensemble, which also includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Eric Harland on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

YOSVANY TERRY GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Terry, a saxophonist and percussionist, chases postbop ideals without abandoning the rhythmic pull of his native Cuba; in this ensemble, he plays alongside the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, the guitarist Mike Moreno, the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Yunior Terry, the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15.(Chinen)

(Chinen)

* RANDY WESTON AND FRIENDS (Tomorrow) The pianism of Randy Weston can recall that of Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, but as a composer he has long reached beyond strict jazz traditions; this concert, dubbed ''The Spirit of Afrika,'' will commemorate the year of his 80th birthday with an assortment of friends, including the saxophonists Billy Harper and Cecil Payne, the trombonist Benny Powell, the trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater and the conga virtuoso Candido. 8 p.m., Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, Long Island University, 1 University Place, at DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651ARTS.org; $35, $45 and $80. (Chinen)

REGGIE WORKMAN'S BREW (Tuesday) Mr. Workman's bass playing has always evinced a graceful athleticism and an attunement to texture; here he organizes a setting that should emphasize both traits, in a trio with Miya Masaoka on koto and Gerry Hemingway on percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $15. (Chinen)

AVALON STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) Since its founding in 1995 at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in Connecticut, this dynamic ensemble has won several notable competitions and secured coveted residencies, most recently at Indiana University.

(Midgette)

BRONX OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833; $15 to $30. (Allan Kozinn)

CHAMBERFEST (Tuesday through Thursday) You might think that the Juilliard School had enough to handle with its ambitious musical celebration of its centenary, not to mention the annual Focus festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school is also presenting this series of free concerts of diverse chamber works performed by accomplished student musicians. There are piano trios by Ives and Shostakovich; works by Beethoven and Dvorak will jostle against works by Stravinsky and Morton Feldman.

'COMPOSER=PERFORMER' (Thursday) Adventurous programming has been part of Symphony Space's calendar on and off over the years, but lately the hall seems intent on joining the Miller Theater as a new-music center on the Upper West Side. In ''Composer=Performer,'' it offers music written and performed by Todd Reynolds, one of the violinists in the quartet Ethel; Joan La Barbara, who is known for her range-stretching vocalizing; and John King, a guitarist and violinist who will offer a preview of a score he is writing for the Mannheim Ballet. 7:30 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $21; $16 for students and 65+.

In collaboration with the Library of Congress, Mr. Hampson is embarking on an 11-city American tour with a program that covers American song from the 1700's to the present. There will be psalms, hymns, folk songs, cowboy songs, spirituals and art songs -- not just by familiar composers like Bernstein and Copland but also by influential (and overlooked) composers like Arthur Farwell and Elinor Remick Warren. Wolfram Rieger will be the pianist. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $72.(Tommasini)

MEREDITH MONK YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Sunday) Ms. Monk, the eclectic and soulful composer-singer-performance artist, has spent the last week working with a group of young singers with impressive backgrounds in contemporary music and performance, teaching them the rudiments of her own distinctive vocal technique.

The composers are Debussy, Varese, Cage, John Luther Adams and Theodore Wiprud. 3 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 488-5913; $15; $10 for students and 65+.

NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Sunday) Neeme Jarvi leads his New Jersey players in the first installment of ''The Many Faces of Mozart,'' a festival -- among the first of roughly a gazillion scheduled around the world this year -- celebrating the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth. The concert's title, ''Mozart's Autumn Years,'' is a bit odd for a composer who died at 35, but you get the idea: included are late works, including the Symphony No. 41 and the incomparably beautiful Clarinet Concerto, with Karl Herman as the soloist. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75. (Kozinn)

Megan Metcalf will show dance video. 7 p.m., Swing Space, 15 Nassau Street, between Cedar and Pine Streets, Lower Manhattan, (347) 268-1012. (Dunning)

FULL CIRCLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Innaviews'' takes a look at the lives of hip-hop dancers. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $20 and $12.(Anderson)

Their ''Conjunto di Nero'' is a full-evening work for six dancers who are, according to press materials, ''dressed in wooly black garments.'' Tuesday through Jan. 21 at 8 p.m., and Jan. 22 at 2 and 7:30 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $38. (Sulcas)

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-0018 or www.bax.org; $8 to $15. (Dunning)

'THE JUILLIARD SCHOOL, 1905-2005: CELEBRATING 100 YEARS' (Today and tomorrow) This is the closing weekend for this free multimedia exhibition on one of the nation's most influential performing conservatories, whose history is depicted in photographs, playbills, correspondence, musical scores, and audiotapes and videos of classes and performances of music, theater and dance. Today and tomorrow from noon to 6 p.m., New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-1630 or www.nyp.org. Six speakers, including Linda Kent and Lawrence Rhodes, will participate in a free panel discussion on the recent history of the school's dance division.

Mr. McCall, a dancer, choreographer and director, looks partly to Homer's ''Odyssey'' for his inspiration. 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www .dixonplace .org; $12 or T.D.F.; students and 65+, $10. (Dunning)

MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP (Sunday) Need we say more? Sunday at 3 p.m., Performing Arts Center, Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6200; $40 to $60.(Dunning)

MOVEMENT RESEARCH AT THE JUDSON CHURCH 'ABOUT TOWN' (Sunday) This free weekly winter forum offers choreographers a low-pressure context to experiment with ideas rather than present a finished work. (At least that's the theory; no doubt they get nervous anyway.) This week's lineup includes the wonderful former Merce Cunningham dancer Kimberly Bartosik, Sam Kim and Chris Yon. 8 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 598-0551.(Sulcas)

BEN MUNISTERI (Wednesday through Jan. 21) Mr. Munisteri was one of the most compelling of Doug Elkins's performers many years ago; now he makes dances that match his unpredictable, frisky stage presence. You also have to appreciate the range of his musical tastes: A new work, ''Tuesday, 4 a.m. and other dances,'' is set to Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, while the older ''Turbine Mines'' is set to the ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack as accompaniment. 7:30 p.m. (next Friday, also at 10 p.m.), Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 9224-0077; $25; $15 for students, 65+ or artists.

(Rockwell)

'THE SEVEN' (Wednesday and Thursday) The New York Theater Workshop's hip-hop adaptation of Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'' has choreography by Bill T. Jones as well as music and text by Will Powers and direction by Jo Bonney.

 Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRaPHY: 'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Ken Johnson)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Felix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from Southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. On the secular side but equally dazzling are two portraits of men from a long series of male visages done by Antonello in the 1460's and 70's. The intensely human play of expression on the subjects' faces makes a connection with the viewer that few artists before or since have been able to achieve. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Grace Glueck)

MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck)

* MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)

ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)

* Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Holland Cotter)

* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson)

* Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. This substantial exhibition of works on paper extends the full-scale Bluemner retrospective now at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

* 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: 57th Street

* SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, through Jan. 21. (Smith)

Galleries: Chelsea

Marina Abramovic: 'Balkan Erotic Epic' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith)

Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

* ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)

'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix in most cases a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

PHILIPPE MAZAUD: STAGE LIGHT Roaming the countryside in rural Idaho and Nevada, Mr. Mazaud shoots provocative, sometimes spooky night scenes using only found light. Following a current tendency to make pictures that don't tell tales, but move viewers to create their own, he presents scenarios like a small house on a snowy street with two bright windows giving evidence of occupancy, illumined by a streetlight near an old-fashioned telephone pole strung with taut, crisscrossing wires. It could be the setting for domestic felicity or mayhem. Foley, 527 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Jan. 21. (Glueck)

* LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)

Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Bryan Savitz The inventive Mr. Savitz presents a forest of fake tree trunks and objects, like a hammock and a pipe organ, made mainly of scratch-off lottery tickets. A wild group show in the rear gallery called ''Waiting for the Barbarians'' includes a Beaux-Arts-style pornographic vision of flying cowgirls painted by Nicola Verlato; a horribly abused anthropomorphic pig in a sculptural tableau by Fernando Mastrangelo; a large, Dali-esque ballpoint pen drawing by Tim Maxwell; and a big, semi-abstract digital photograph by Chris Rodrigues, apparently illustrating an otherworldly epic. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 268-1520, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)

* JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith)

ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'I woke up in a strange place ' The Postmodern mindscape gets a good workout in a show that includes Samantha Simpson's finely drawn allegorical monkeys; Simon Keenleyside's small paintings of gloomily magical birch forests; a puddle of vomit made of pearlescent pink sequins by Craig Fisher; Edward del Rosario's precise paintings of tiny, oddly dressed people; and a Neo- Pop installation representing an old world hunting-lodge interior by Ryan Humphrey. Moti Hasson, 330 West 38th Street, (212) 268-4444, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

Last Chance

Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)

Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, closing Sunday. (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)

Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

* TAMY BEN-TOR, 'EXPLORATION IN THE DOMAIN OF IDIOCY' On video -- and live on Friday and Saturday afternoons -- a wonderfully talented comic performance artist creates hilariously self-absorbed characters. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, (212) 989-7700, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: Best of Worlds, Unless China Alters Course

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IN the best of all possible worlds, those who wish to borrow and spend can do so to their hearts' content, while others choose to save and thus finance that consumption. Economies grow at steady rates, inflation never soars and interest rates are always friendly.
 This, if you believe consensus economic forecasts, is just such a year. Growth will remain strong in the United States while it will accelerate in Europe. China will keep growing and Japan's recovery finally is real. Interest rates will hardly change. 
''Moreover,'' says Rob Carnell, a senior economist at ING, ''having achieved these targets during 2006, such levels are expected to persist for the foreseeable future.'' Yet he is not convinced: ''Few things are certain in economics, but as likely scenarios go, this fairy-tale view of the economy looks highly improbable.''
 So it does. Mr. Carnell thinks the Fed's tightening will finally slow the housing boom, and thus the economy, in midyear, and that will hurt consumer spending more than most expect.
 The housing market's effect on the economy has been growing in recent years, accounting for an unusually large share of the recovery. The net amount of new mortgage borrowing is running at 7.9 percent of gross domestic product, a record. The share of the economy devoted to residential construction spending is 5.1 percent, also a record.
 Fred Post of Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm, points out that the difference between those figures is also higher than ever and that it roughly corresponds to the excess of consumer spending over historical averages.
 If housing prices falter, he argues, ''this would force consumers to find alternative ways to get their hands on cash if they wanted to maintain their high levels of consumption.''
 As 2005 ended, there was a brief flurry of worry over the yield curve, which was ever so marginally inverted. Ten-year Treasury notes yielded one basis point -- that is, one one-hundredth of a percentage point -- more than two-year Treasury notes, and that fact set off talk about recessions, with commentators duly noting that recessions were often preceded by inverted curves.
 For those worriers, the good news is that the yield curve is no longer inverted, so the recession warning is passe. But they may be missing the real point. What will kill the current recovery, if anything does, is a setback for housing. And the thing that would cause that is a serious rise in long-term interest rates.
 ''You've got a housing boom that is consistent with 8 percent G.D.P. growth,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig. ''The reason growth is not there is that the dollar is wildly overvalued versus Asian currencies, and we have this huge trade deficit.''
 The decision on long-term interest rates will not be made in the United States. The Federal Reserve can, and will, try to adjust short-term rates to keep the economy growing. But just as long-term rates failed to rise when the Fed increased short-term rates, it is conceivable that they would rise later even if short-term rates were being cut. That depends to a significant extent on foreign demand for American bonds.
 If Asian central banks are happy to keep buying dollar-denominated bonds to support the dollar, then the current situation can continue, with the housing boom staying alive in the United States and the trade deficit growing ever wider.
 The alternative would be for those central banks to let their currencies appreciate while devoting more attention to domestic demand. 
 When, or if, they do that, long-term rates are likely to rise. And we will learn just how much a housing decline could hurt the economy.

HEADLINE: In Iraq, Wrongs Made a Right

BYLINE: By L. Paul Bremer. 
L. Paul Bremer III, the former director of the Coalition Provisional Authority, is the author of ''My Year in Iraq: The Struggle to Build a Future of Hope.''

 BODY:
THE recent debate set off by the publication of my book about my time in Iraq has shed more heat than light. Here are some of the fundamental lessons I took away from the American experience.
 First, repairing the damage to Iraq by decades of tyranny was never going to be easy, and I made some mistakes.
For example, consider our efforts to ban senior Baath Party officials from public office. This was the proper decision -- the party had been a key instrument of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship -- and our policy was intended to affect only the top 1 percent or so of party members. 
 The error was that I left the implementation of the policy to a political body within the nascent Iraqi government, where it became a tool of politicians who applied it much more broadly than we had intended. De-Baathification should have been administered by an independent judicial body.
 We also placed too much emphasis on large-scale reconstruction projects. While the urgent need for modern highways, electrical generating plants and the like was clear, we should have anticipated that building them would take a long time. Our earlier efforts should have been directed more tightly at meeting Iraqis' day-to-day needs.
 To speed up those larger projects, I should have also insisted on exemption from the usual bureaucratic and contracting rules. This lesson was brought home to me in a dramatic fashion a few weeks after I arrived. We had learned that six major hospitals in Baghdad urgently needed new generators to run their operating rooms and air-conditioning plants. Our budget director told me I could use American funds, which were subject to United States federal contracting rules, or Iraqi government funds, which were not. Using American money, he told me, would mean waiting four to six months for the generators. We used Iraqi funds and got the equipment in eight days. In the future, Congress must make provisions for legitimate exemptions. 
 Another clear lesson is that the United States must be better prepared for the post-conflict phase should we find ourselves in similar military situations in the future. The administration has made a good start by setting up offices of reconstruction in the State and Defense Departments. But the effort must be broadened through the government and especially the private sector. The goal should be a quick-reaction, public-private Civilian Reserve Corps consisting of people with expertise on matters like the establishment of telecommunications facilities, rebuilding of electrical power plants, modernizing health care systems and instituting modern budgeting procedures.
 Last, much attention has been paid to my concern about the need to retain adequate manpower to defeat the terrorists and insurgents. Our military leaders said they had sufficient forces to ensure law and order, and that additional soldiers might increase Iraqi hostility. Theirs was a respectable argument. But I disagreed with it. And while I had concerns about the quality of Iraqi forces two years ago, their training has since been revamped. Today they are playing an increasingly important role in defending Iraq.
 Despite the missteps and setbacks, there is little question that, thanks to efforts by the American-led coalition, enormous political and economic progress is being made in Iraq today. 
 Two years ago, Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq, Abu Musab Zarqawi, told his followers there that there would be no place for them in a democratic Iraq. One year later, Iraqis voted in the country's first genuine elections. Then they wrote and approved a new Constitution. And last month 70 percent of voters turned out to elect a new Parliament. Now that body should modify the Constitution to address legitimate concerns of the Sunnis. 
 As for Iraq's economy, at liberation it was flat on its back: the World Bank estimated that in 2003 the economy contracted by 41 percent. Now Iraq benefits from an independent central bank, and a new currency whose stability is a remarkable indicator of confidence. The economy is open to foreign investment and commercial laws have been modernized. The International Monetary Fund reports that per-capita income has doubled in the last two years and predicts that Iraq's economy will grow 17 percent this year. No wonder registration of new businesses has jumped 67 percent in the last six months. 
 There is, of course, still much to be done. American troops and Iraqis continue to die battling criminal elements of the Saddam Hussein regime and Qaeda terrorists. President Bush has correctly identified Iraq as the central front in the war on terrorism, as Osama bin Laden himself acknowledged when he told his followers ''the third world war has begun in Iraq'' and that it would ''end there in victory and glory, or misery and humiliation.'' 
 Despite these enormous stakes, some Americans have called for setting a timetable for our withdrawal or even pulling out now. This would be a historic mistake: a betrayal of the sacrifices Americans and Iraqis have made; a victory of the terrorists everywhere; and step toward a more dangerous world.

HEADLINE: Iran and the Bomb

 BODY:
Fortunately, Iran is believed to still be several years away from being able to produce nuclear weapons. But it has now embarked on a course that can have no other plausible intent. 
 Turning its back on generous European and Russian offers that would have guaranteed its supplies of civilian reactor fuel, helped its economy, added jobs and lessened its diplomatic isolation, this week Tehran unsealed the centrifuges it can now use to enrich uranium to bomb-grade levels.
By doing so, it thumbed its nose at all those governments, including the United States, that had been working patiently and creatively to find a diplomatic formula that met everyone's needs without adding to nuclear dangers. Now those countries -- along with China, whose veto power on the United Nations Security Council makes it an essential participant -- need to look for new ways to stop, or at least slow down, Iran's nuclear weapons drive.
 Every new addition to the roster of nuclear weapons states significantly raises the odds that nuclear weapons will be used in war, or will become available to terrorists. Those dangers are especially acute in the case of Iran under its radically belligerent leadership, which has called for the elimination of Israel and maintains close ties with groups that have embraced terrorism. 
 The problem is that no one has yet come up with any very good ways of deflecting Iran from its nuclear course. Nature has given it all the raw uranium it needs. With help from the rogue Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, it has acquired uranium enrichment centrifuges and possibly a workable bomb design. And thanks to its ample oil reserves, it has the means to withstand all but the most sweeping and universally enforced sanctions. 
 Even if the United States and Europe got the Iran case referred to the United Nations Security Council, it is not clear what that body would or wouldn't do. Even if Russia and China could be persuaded to go along with sanctions, that might not be enough to pressure Iran, a major oil exporter whose leadership doesn't seem to care very much about other areas of international trade or diplomacy. 
 There are no realistic military options, especially for Washington. Iran is more than three times as large and nearly three times as populous as Iraq. And it is worth recalling that the ill-fated invasion of Iraq was first sold to the American public as the most promising way to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists and terrorist-friendly states. 
 Still, the world can scarcely afford to ignore Iran's nuclear ambitions and its contempt for diplomacy. The inadequacy of nuclear proliferation safeguards is an argument for strengthening them, not for giving up and wishing for the best. 
 China and Russia should join the United States, Britain, France and Germany in putting Iran's behavior before the Security Council and condemning it as a steadily growing threat. Plain talk and a united stand are never bad ideas, particularly when more conventional diplomacy has so far failed.

HEADLINE: For U.S. Makers, Lessons In Efficiency and Cost Control

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
As General Motors and Ford struggle to remake themselves and rejoin the car wars, one company is proving what a successful American carmaker can look like: Toyota.
 Unlike G.M. and Ford, bogged down by dozens of models competing for the same buyers, Toyota has a well-chosen lineup of both bread-and-butter cars and trucks that sell in big volumes as well as luxury models for which it can command a higher price.
As G.M. and Ford are closing plants, Toyota is opening new ones, at sharply lower labor costs -- which still include health care and retirement plans -- than its American rivals. And it is adding jobs at its existing plants, which produce 60 percent of the cars and trucks it sells here. While G.M. and Ford are trying to stop their declines and regain lost market share, Toyota is on an unimpeded roll. It held a record 13.3 percent of the American market in 2005, just short of third-place Chrysler, which it outsold during several months last year.
 ''They are what an American company should be,'' said Jeffrey K. Liker, a professor of engineering at the University of Michigan and the author of ''The Toyota Way,'' the best-selling book that examines Toyota's business methods. 
 He went on, ''Do I think it's realistic for American car companies to be like Toyota? No. They would have had to have been different 20 years ago'' and focus on the quality, efficiency and cost-cutting that have always been a Toyota hallmark. ''Now what they're trying to do is pull themselves together and survive,'' Professor Liker said. 
 But as the Detroit players try to come back, Toyota is now studying what it would take to get even bigger, even as it faces its own challenges.
 One is quality. Last year, Toyota's recalls soared to 2.2 million vehicles, double the number in 2004. Though that was half the level at G.M., and half the recalls were for trucks and S.U.V.'s built before 1995, the recalls also included Prius, a darling among hybrid-electric vehicles.
 And Toyota executives acknowledge that the company still does not have an attractive small car and -- most important for the United States -- enough big pickups to take on G.M. and Ford. Meanwhile, the excitement surrounding its hybrids could fade when new government fuel-economy estimates, expected to be lower than what is now on window stickers, are published next year.
 But Toyota is not sitting back.
 Three years ago, Toyota officials said they were aiming to take 15 percent of the global car market by 2010. But with that target in reach, now that Toyota has just over 13 percent of the market, Toyota managers are analyzing what they would require, in terms of more plants, products and employees, to reach 20 percent of markets both in the United States and around the world.
 Globally, 20 percent would give Toyota a solid lead over G.M, which remains in the top spot with just under 15 percent in worldwide sales, although Toyota could match G.M. in terms of worldwide production as early as this year. 
 In the United States, a 20 percent share would make Toyota the No. 2 auto company, bigger than Ford is now, and put Toyota within overtaking distance of G.M., which held about 26 percent of the United States market in 2005.
 ''If we are clever in terms of the right products and we are genuine in terms of serving the customer, there is no reason we cannot achieve 20 percent,'' Yukitoshi Funo, chief executive of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. said in an interview this week at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
 But such growth would not be easy, Mr. Funo cautioned. And Toyota, always careful not to seem overconfident, does not yet consider it achievable, he said. ''Thirteen to 20 is a big step,'' Mr. Funo said, ''and becoming the biggest U.S. seller is a long way out. It is not in our mindset. It is not in the business plans at Toyota.''
 Indeed, analysts said they were skeptical, saying no company, not even Toyota, could expect to grow that much given the brutal competition erupting in the United States market among Detroit, European, Japanese, Korean and soon, Chinese companies.
 ''There are going to be so many companies out there fighting like hell,'' said Ron Pinelli, the president of Autodata, an industry research firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
 But further growth is clearly within Toyota's sights. While its official forecast is for 5 percent to 6 percent growth in American sales this year, Mr. Funo said he would be disappointed if Toyota did not grow by 10 percent, as it did in 2005.
 Some of that growth was fueled this summer, when Toyota stepped up its incentives to combat the ''employee discount'' plans offered by G.M., Ford and Chrysler. Its incentives, which had averaged less than $1,000 throughout 2004 and 2005, swelled to $1,100 in June, according to an estimate by Autodata.
 Officials at the Big Three automakers saw the heftier incentives as proof that Toyota could not escape the rebate fray. By year's end, Toyota still gave discounts of about $1,000 a vehicle, while the Detroit companies were offering an average of $3,500.
 For their part, Detroit companies are vowing to do everything they can this year to stop Toyota's growth. On Sunday, Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., said that 2006 must be the year when Ford stops losing market share -- and that it would do so, in part, by stressing its American heritage. 
 Mark Fields, president of Ford's operations for the Americas, said: ''Americans want to buy American cars.''
 But Toyota officials argue that buyers are looking at more than a company's headquarters. 
 James E. Press, president of Toyota Motor Sales, said any top American company must first have a lineup that meets its customers' needs. It also must produce vehicles in the United States that lead their category in quality, resale value, comfort and design, he said.
 A leading American player has to have a strong brand image, a dealer network that offers good service and most important, put buyers first, Mr. Press said. Asked if Toyota meets those criteria, he said, ''Not yet. We can improve on everything.''
 One major improvement will be Toyota's lineup. 
 Next month, it will finally unveil its big pickup truck, set to be produced in San Antonio starting later this year. This week, Toyota had two of the most talked-about cars at the Detroit show -- restyled versions of the midsize Camry, which has been the nation's best-selling car for the last four years, and the big Lexus LS sedan, which Toyota is aiming directly at the Mercedes flagship S-class sedan.
 Mr. Fields of Ford, in fact, was spotted looking over both the Lexus and the Camry, which also will be sold in a hybrid version. But to Toyota, the Camry is more than just a car. The latest model helped the company cut both development time and production costs. 
 Acting on suggestions from workers in eight countries where the Camry will be produced, Toyota's engineers and designers cut its development time from 23 months to 17 months. 
 Thanks to simplified production methods, devised so that factories around the world can build the car the same way, Toyota's plant in Georgetown, Ky., will reach full speed in a lightning-fast 15 days, versus the 45 days the plant needed to ramp up production of the previous Camry.
 The quicker pace will allow it to ship several thousand more cars to dealers once the Camry goes on sale, a time ''when they are dying to get new product,'' said Gary L. Convis, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky and the first American to run a Toyota plant.
 Meanwhile, Toyota reconfigured the process it uses to produce plastic parts at the plant, allowing it to bring back work from a supplier and create 45 new jobs at the plant, which employs 7,000 people. Those jobs are at labor rates of about $44 an hour -- roughly $23 less than those paid by Detroit automakers, because of vastly lower costs for health care and retirement.
 Even with the extra people, the reconfigured work is now so efficient that Toyota is saving $10 a car, Mr. Convis said. That adds up to annual savings of $30.2 million, based on the 302,000 Camrys Toyota sold last year.
 The Georgetown plant will begin building the first hybrid version of the Camry this summer, joining hybrid versions of the Toyota Highlander and Lexus RX crossover vehicles, as well as Toyota's best-known hybrid, the Prius.
 Competing carmakers like Nissan, G.M. and Ford promoted their own hybrids at this week's auto show, insisting that they would not let Toyota own the hybrid market. Yet, the excitement over hybrids may have been interrupted this week, when the Environmental Protection Agency announced new proposals on calculating fuel-economy ratings that would sharply reduce its estimates for hybrid cars in city driving.
 A Toyota spokeswoman, Martha Voss, said that even if estimates dropped for hybrids, they would still look attractive compared with many gasoline-powered vehicles. And Mr. Pinelli, of Autodata, said he did not expect interest in hybrids to die down. Nor did he expect Toyota to let up on its expansion push, despite the heated competition that is sweeping the market. 
 Unless G.M. and Ford can recover quickly, he said, Toyota has the best chance to become the company that exemplifies the best American buyers can expect. Mr. Pinelli said: ''Toyota is the golden company.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about lessons for General Motors and Ford in Toyota's successful turnaround misstated the saving Toyota had achieved by reconfiguring the process used to make plastic parts at the plant in Georgetown, Ky. It was $3.02 million a year, not $30.2 million.

HEADLINE: EUROPE JOINS U.S. IN URGING ACTION BY U.N. ON IRAN 

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN and STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Richard Bernstein reported from Berlin for this article, and Steven R. Weisman from Washington.

DATELINE: BERLIN, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The leading nations of Europe joined with the United States on Thursday to declare an end, for now, to negotiations with Iran over dismantling its suspected nuclear weapons program and to demand that Iran be referred to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions.
 The Europeans' announcement was made at a news conference in Berlin two days after the Iranian authorities removed internationally monitored seals on nuclear facilities involved in the enrichment of uranium that Western nations say could be used in a bomb.
''Our talks with Iran have reached a dead end,'' the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said at the news conference after meeting here with his French and British counterparts and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana. ''From our point of view, the time has come for the U.N. Security Council to become involved.'' 
 Shortly afterward, in an apparently orchestrated response, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared in Washington that the United States fully supported the European action. Iran's actions, she said, ''have shattered the basis for negotiation.'' 
 [On Friday morning, Iran threatened to stop cooperating with international monitors, including allowing strict controls over its nuclear program, if the matter was handed over to the Security Council, Reuters said the official Irna agency reported.
 [Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki was quoted as saying that ''the European countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal'' because ''the government will be obliged, in conformity with the law adopted by Parliament, to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation.'']
 Despite the new resolve by the Americans and Europeans, and very probably by Russia and China, on getting Iran to reverse course in the nuclear area, many experts and diplomats say the process of actually coercing that step could take a long time and may never work.
 Iran is believed to be years away from making bombs but only a year or two from having the expertise to do so. For its part, the Iranian government has insisted that its nuclear program is only for peaceful commercial purposes.
 Many Western experts say that its government appears determined to press ahead even if sanctions are imposed and the country becomes isolated diplomatically. There is no sign that leading nations are ready to cut off oil purchases, because such a step would send oil prices rocketing, possibly damaging the world economy.
 American and European diplomats said, however, that several days of intense diplomacy had convinced them that Russia and China would join in a growing consensus that the International Atomic Energy Agency board, comprising 35 countries, should refer the matter of Iran to the Security Council, if only to register a nearly worldwide condemnation of the Tehran government.
 A senior State Department official in Washington said that Russia had indicated that it would not oppose a referral at the board but that the West was trying to get Russia to go further and vote yes. On Thursday, Ms. Rice spoke about this matter to the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, as she had done earlier in the week. Mr. Lavrov said in Moscow that Russia was putting a heavy premium on Iran's compliance with international regulations on nuclear development.
 ''Iran has removed the seals from a uranium enrichment plant and therefore urgent consultations are needed,'' Mr. Lavrov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
 The senior State Department official said, ''I'm not saying that Russia is in the yes column, but they're moving in that direction.'' If Russia abstains on a referral or even votes yes, American and European diplomats say, China will probably go along and there will be a greater chance for approval of an anti-Iran measure by India, Brazil and other so-called nonaligned members of the atomic energy agency board.
 The move toward referral to the Security Council did not necessarily mean that the Council itself would impose penalties without giving negotiations still another chance to resolve the matter, several diplomats said. An initial action simply condemning Iran and calling on it to change its behavior, with the threat of punishment in the background, appeared the most probable step once the matter gets to the Council.
 ''We've always said that going to the Security Council is not an end in itself and did not signal an end to negotiations,'' said Robert Joseph, under secretary of state for arms control and international security. ''Going to the Council provides a menu of options that can be used to try to get Iran to reverse course.''
 The campaign to raise pressure on Iran involved telephone calls from Ms. Rice and her top aides and plans for an extraordinary meeting on Monday in London of senior envoys from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. 
 American officials said this meeting would be focused on a strategy for a resolution aimed at referring the matter to the Security Council, to be adopted at an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency board as early as later this month. American and European officials said they were prepared to be flexible on both the timing of the resolution and its wording, to get a maximum number of countries on board.
 There remained concern among some Western diplomats that while Russia and China seemed willing to abstain in a resolution of referral to the Security Council, they could demand delays or watered-down wording changes that would undercut the effort.
 The possibility of more negotiations with Iran, perhaps soon, was raised again, however, by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, who said Thursday evening that he had spoken earlier in the day to Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, to head off a looming confrontation. 
 Iran was still interested in ''serious and constructive negotiations,'' Mr. Annan said, adding that the only viable solution to the dispute with Iran was ''a negotiated one.''
 But American and European diplomats saw little prospect of any talks with Iran soon, at least not unless Iran took major steps to back away from a confrontation, like returning to its suspension of the conversion of raw uranium into a gas, and the enrichment of that gas into a concentrated form that could eventually be used for nuclear fuel or a bomb.
 For two years, the United States has repeatedly declared that after many instances of Iran failing to disclose its nuclear activities to international inspectors, its conduct should be subject to condemnation or sanctions at the Security Council. But until this week, the United States' major European allies have declined to endorse that step.
 Only after allowing the Europeans to negotiate with Iran and to offer possible incentives for suspending its activities, and encouraging Russia to make a separate offer to operate a joint uranium enrichment program on Russian soil, has the United States brought these partners around to more overt pressure.
 Iran has repeatedly maintained that it has the right to develop nuclear fuel on its own soil, but the West argues that it has forfeited that right by its habit of concealing its activities.

HEADLINE: The Axis Of Order?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Paul Krugman is on vacation.

 BODY:
Last September, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick gave a speech to the National Committee on United States-China Relations in which he repeatedly urged China to become a responsible ''stakeholder'' in the international system. It turns out that there is no word in Chinese for ''stakeholder,'' and the initial Chinese reaction was puzzlement and reaching for a dictionary. Did Mr. Zoellick mean ''steak holder?'' After all, he was speaking at a dinner. Maybe this was some Texas slang for telling China it had to buy more U.S. beef? Well, eventually the Chinese got a correct interpretation.
 At the time, I thought Mr. Zoellick was raising an important point, but I now believe it is an urgent point. Why? Because Iran is determined to build a nuclear bomb, and the only nations with the clout to stop it -- by diplomatic means -- are China, Russia and India. Let's hope they act, because if Iran goes nuclear, the international order that has evolved since the cold war ended could unravel. 
Iran decided this week to defy the U.S., Europe and the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency -- by removing the I.A.E.A. seals at three Iranian nuclear sites -- so Tehran can resume uranium enrichment, a key step in making a bomb. 
 The I.A.E.A. seals were put in place two and a half years ago, after the U.N. agency found that Iran was in breach of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Iran could have been referred to the Security Council then for sanctions. But instead, in return for keeping the seals on Iran's facilities, the Europeans tried to negotiate an end to the crisis. 
 Why has this now become a stakeholder test for China, Russia and India? Because if the Iranian mullahs -- who are now awash in petro-dollars -- know one thing, it is how to read power and weakness. The Iranians know that the U.S. has already put all the sanctions on Iran that it can. They seriously doubt that the Europeans will ever impose sanctions. And -- this is the key -- even if the Security Council censures Iran, and Europe miraculously joins the U.S. in imposing sanctions, the Iranians assume that China, Russia and India (that's half the world) will never follow. 
 Iran will back down only if China, Russia and India make it clear that they are not only willing to let Iran's case be taken up by the Security Council -- a step sought by the U.S. and Europe -- but that they will also join in stringent economic sanctions. Western threats, which Iran's radical president dismissed with the back of his hand yesterday as some little ''fuss,'' are no longer credible.
 Communist Russia and China opposed the U.S. during the cold war, and socialist India was neutral. But since the end of the cold war, all three countries have embraced capitalism and become huge players -- and beneficiaries -- in today's global economy, with Russia providing oil and gas, China manufacturing and India software. All three now have a huge stake in the stability of the international system. 
 But these countries have basically been cruising along as free riders on a stable international order, which has been maintained largely by the U.S., with help from the E.U., NATO and Japan. Both Russia and China have actually used their clout at times to protect international bad actors -- like Iran, Sudan and North Korea -- out of a narrow economic self-interest and a kind of residual third-world, gotta-counter-the-Americans reflex.
 But if Iran defies the U.N. and goes nuclear, it will give an already nasty regime a shield behind which to make even more trouble -- from Iraq to Israel and Europe. It would also be likely to lead to the end of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to a possible military strike against Iran by Israel or America -- which would surely disrupt the Persian Gulf oil supplies that India and China depend upon -- and to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. The Sunni Arabs may tolerate the Jews' having a bomb, but not the Shiite Persians' having one. The Arabs would want their own bomb. And Russia would have an unstable, nuclear-armed Iran on its border.
 In fairness, India, China and Russia have taken small steps to defuse the crisis and signal Iran that they don't approve of its actions and may let it be hauled before the Security Council.
 That helped keep Iran on the fence -- for a while. But now Iran has gotten off the fence, and so must Russia, China and India. For their own sakes, if not ours, these emerging big three have got to become the Axis of Order. The old cops on the beat can't deal with the Axis of Evil alone anymore. Pay attention to how this one ends, folks. The structure of the whole post-cold-war world is at stake.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Narrowed in November as Energy Costs Eased

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
A surge in aircraft exports and a drop in imports and energy prices helped narrow the nation's trade deficit in November, according to government reports yesterday.
 The United States imported $64.2 billion more in goods and services than it exported in November, which was about 5.8 percent less than the $68.1 billion deficit in October. It was the lowest reading on the trade deficit in four months, though it remained far larger than in any single month before 2005. Economists had expected a trade gap of $66.1 billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
In the first 11 months of the year, the deficit totaled $661.8 billion, up 17.6 percent from the comparable period in 2004. 
 A big part of November's improvement could be explained by an easing of higher oil prices and surging fuel imports that occurred in September after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted energy production in the Gulf Coast region. The price of petroleum imports dropped 9.2 percent in November and 0.9 percent further in December, the Labor Department said yesterday in a separate report. Prices for other imports rose 0.1 percent in November and were flat in December.
 In addition to paying less for energy, Americans also imported less of it. Crude oil imports fell 4.4 percent, to 421,086 barrels.
 In other industries, civilian aircraft exports rose 27.4 percent in November, to $3.2 billion. Boeing had its best year for orders in 2005, as Asian airlines, particularly in China and India, expanded rapidly. Some Boeing plane deliveries were delayed to later in the year because of a machinists' strike in September, helping to increase November's figures.
 The trade deficit with China eased by nearly 10 percent in November, to $18.5 billion; for the first 11 months of the year, the China gap increased to $185 billion. 
 The trade deficit with the European countries, Canada and other nations also narrowed in November.
 Total exports increased $1.9 billion and imports dropped $2 billion.
 Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc., explained: ''A lot of what you are seeing now on the export side is some life abroad. European growth is fanning up, and even Japan is showing some signs of life.''
 Analysts cautioned, though, that November's improvement in the deficit should not be read as the beginning of a trend, given that trade in energy is resuming its normal pattern: one of steady growth in imports. And aircraft deliveries are expected to dip in December.
 Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients that ''the underlying trends are still adverse'' and that ''the deficit will rebound next month.''
 Oil prices, which according to the Commerce Department averaged $52.16 a barrel in November, have risen in the last two weeks amid concern about Iran's nuclear program. Crude oil for February delivery settled unchanged at $63.94 yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 For the economy as a whole, the trade deficit may continue to depress growth. Mr. Shapiro estimated that it could subtract 0.5 percentage point to one point from the fourth quarter's gross domestic product.
 The Labor Department also reported yesterday that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by 17,000, to 309,000. The total number of continuing claims, at 2.7 million, were up by about 12,000 from the week before. Compared with a year earlier, continuing claims were up slightly.

HEADLINE: Doubts Cloud Plan for Cellphone Service in Subway Stations

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Ken Belson contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
When proposed nearly five months ago, the idea held the promise of a new era of underground communications. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, long hesitant about enabling cellphone service in the subways, said it would oversee the creation of a wireless network for all 277 underground stations.
 Despite fears that cellphones could be used to detonate explosives, the authority, in a change of heart, maintained that the devices would allow passengers and employees to quickly report suspicious activities and summon help in emergencies. Not to mention the convenience. 
Today, however, the plan, which would not provide cellphone service on moving trains, is yet another example of how nothing involving the New York City subways is ever simple. It has become mired in disagreements about the project's cost, feasibility and worthiness. The deadline for bids, originally Oct. 12, was pushed back to Nov. 30, then to Dec. 28 and now to Wednesday. 
 In procurement documents that were distributed only to potential bidders, the authority answered 82 questions about the project, many of them expressing skepticism. One prospective bidder wrote that wiring underground stations with little traffic ''may not make economic sense'' and claimed, ''There is serious question if significant revenue to the M.T.A. could be justified.'' Another called the plan ''unjustifiable economically.''
 Even so, some of the country's largest wireless carriers are considering forming an unusual alliance to compete for the work, although they have asserted that it will be hard to recoup their investment unless tunnels, not only stations, are included in the contract. 
 The alliance, or ''teaming agreement,'' would be led by Cingular Wireless, the nation's largest carrier, and include Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile. Sprint Nextel is also considering joining, said a spokesman, Mark Elliott. 
 An official at one carrier noted that most customers buy large packages of minutes that are paid for in advance, so carriers would make additional money only if customers went over their allotments. Talking in subway stations may promote more cellphone use, but not necessarily enough to push customers over their limits. Because subway platforms and trains are noisy, talking may not seem attractive.
 The authority has vowed to spend no money on the project. It wants the winning bidder not only to design, build, operate and maintain a network, known as a distributed-antenna system, but also to pay monthly access fees, essentially rent, for the privilege of having coverage in the stations. The winner will get an exclusive 10-year license, but must allow other carriers to rent access. 
 Until recently, the major precedent for such an effort was the Washington subway system, which began installing a wireless network in 1993 as part of a plan to upgrade police, fire and emergency communications underground. Its agreement with Verizon Wireless lasts through 2017 and generates ''very modest revenues annually,'' according to a spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. 
 In February, InSite Wireless was granted a 15-year license to create a wireless network in the Boston subway, with guaranteed fees totaling nearly $4 million for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In December, U.S. Cellular entered a $3 million, 10-year lease agreement with the Chicago Transit Authority to provide a wireless network in the subway system there. 
 This month, Bay Area Rapid Transit District, in San Francisco, completed the first phase of an underground wireless network; its contract, with an alliance of the four major carriers, expires in 2014 and guarantees the agency annual income of $326,400, rising as the remaining two phases are completed. In all four of these arrangements, tunnel coverage is included, although each system is much smaller than New York's.
 Although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced the cellphone plan on the same day it unveiled a $212 million deal to saturate the subways with television cameras and other security devices, the plan is the brainchild of the authority's real estate department, which leases advertising and commercial space in the subways, and was not primarily born of security concerns, officials said.
 A critical point of contention is the scope of the project. For now, the authority insists that wiring nearly 700 miles of tunnels would be impossible because it would require access to the tracks and interrupt train service for unacceptable stretches of time. Even so, officials sounded out a prominent advocate for riders, Gene Russianoff, last month on the notion of wiring the tunnels.
 Mr. Russianoff, a lawyer at the Straphangers Campaign, part of the New York Public Interest Research Group, said he was ''helplessly ambivalent'' about the idea. 
 On the one hand, he said, riders are wary of being trapped next to inconsiderate cellphone users inside subway cars. On the other hand, coverage in tunnels would allow riders to call their families and even to report problems like graffiti, broken doors or train delays.
 Representatives of the four largest carriers all declined to comment on their proposal, but owners of smaller companies said the authority would get the best deal by hiring a ''neutral host'' rather than an alliance of wireless operators. 
 ''It's a nightmare,'' said Kevin F. Donohue, an owner of Integrated Wireless Alliance in Blauvelt, N.Y., which owns cellphone towers and decided not to submit a bid. ''There is nothing in the contract to force carriers to move forward in a timely way. The M.T.A. should have looked at an independent third party to win this contract, not a carrier.''
 Christopher J. Davis, president of InSite Wireless, said the company, based in Alexandria, Va., would not submit a proposal for the New York project because the risks were too great. 
 ''They're better-positioned to take on the capital and logistical risks of the project, even though they've largely divested themselves of owning wireless infrastructure,'' he said of the major carriers. ''But are they the best people to operate and manage infrastructure, when their natural tendency is to compete with one another?''
 Jeffrey Just, president of Dianet Communications, said his company was preparing a bid for the work but also said that the four biggest carriers appeared to be strongly favored. ''The carriers are interested in paying as little rent as possible,'' he said. ''But this is a project that's very feasible. The business model is there, and it will provide security and service improvements to the M.T.A.'s customers.''
 Dianet, based in New York and Cranbury, N.J., is one of six companies that received a contract with the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications in 2004 to place cellphone antennas and Internet transmitters atop lampposts, traffic signals and highway signs.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 18, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about snags in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's plan for a wireless network to make cellphone service possible in all of New York City's underground subway stations gave an incorrect spelling in some copies for the New Jersey town where Dianet Communications, one of the companies preparing a bid for the contract, has an office. It is Cranbury, not Cranberry.

HEADLINE: The Father Behind the Speaker's Throne

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
THE newly elected City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, favors pinstripes. Her dad, Lawrence P. Quinn, the ubervolunteer behind both of her Council campaigns (he can stuff envelopes in his sleep and cold-call older voters with impunity) and the necessary in-house strategizing behind her speaker bid (his talent for schmoozing was not underutlilized), prefers plaid. Vintage Sy Syms plaid, circa 1975. 
 ''Perfect for the suburbs,'' observes Mr. Quinn, a retired electrical engineer who raised his younger daughter in Glen Cove, N.Y., after his wife died of breast cancer in 1982. Close to Christine? She's mostly why he moved to Manhattan in 1992. 
So there's a slight clash of patterns as they take their places in identical maroon leather wing chairs -- massive, manly, visibly elderly chairs -- in Ms. Quinn's flower-, balloon- and nut-filled City Hall office. The bouquets and balloons arrive in bushels: currying favor with the new speaker is apparently a participation -- not a spectator -- sport. The nuts are of the foodstuff, not human, variety; peanuts and cashews are this regime's snack of choice. She likes cashews; he goes for peanuts. 
 If being interviewed in the baronial office of his daughter, now the second-most-powerful person at City Hall, is a perk of his volunteer renown, which includes receiving a standing ovation at her election last week, helping her ring the New York Stock Exchange bell, and being named volunteer of the year by Representative Charles B. Rangel's Martin Luther King Democratic Club, Mr. Quinn is decidedly underwhelmed. Besides, he's not big on celebrities, particularly celebrity politicians. Take his daughter's main adversary, the two-term billionaire Republican mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, for instance.
 ''That's tough, dealing with these celebrity politicians, and I hear you've got Trump in the wings,'' he says, shaking his silverish head. ''But you're not afraid of him; you've managed him before,'' he says to her about Mr. Bloomberg, whose plans for a West Side stadium found an enemy in them both. They do occasionally agree. 
 When Ms. Quinn, 39, says she intends to put a fresh coat of paint, something along the lines of ''historic, government blue,'' on these blah beige office walls, her father, 79, moans faintly and reminds her of the aesthetic perils of Department of Education green. But hanging up the 1916 Irish proclamation of independence that maybe came inside a Clancy Brothers album and definitely graced their Glen Cove kitchen? A joint must. 
 When she mentions that the antique furniture could use some sprucing up, he cautions her not to ''make a mistake with the couch,'' adding something about a knuckle-rapping meted out to certain city commissioners who wasted the taxpayers' money on opulent sofas. He seems on the verge of naming names; the Council publicist sitting in on the chat -- it was felt Mr. Quinn rated a censor -- signals for help. 
 ''Shoosh,'' Ms. Quinn hisses smoothly at her father. He obeys. ''All effective women are somewhat bossy,'' he explains when reached by telephone the next day at her district office. And what is he doing there, besides answering phones? ''Waiting to stuff some more envelopes.''
 Ms. Quinn traces her politics to her mother's charitable work and her father's stint as a union shop steward at Sperry, where he worked for 32 years and drove the doughnut truck along the picket line during strikes. ''Power through pastry,'' he riffs, catching his daughter's eye for approval. He mischievously denies experiencing anything resembling ''the thirst for power'' in his union role; he did it as a favor, the same reason he schleps posters for her and her Democratic cohorts. Where did his daughter get her political ambition? Beats him.
 ''Well, I haven't been around politicians much, so I guess I'd call it one of those errors or consequences of genetics,'' he says, his voice on the rise, Irish-tenor style. ''But you can't blame it on me. I had hoped she'd become a C.P.A. or a dentist, you know, something practical. How about the oil painting lessons, the clarinet, the dance lessons with Madame Vera? How about that typing course?'' he asks his daughter, enjoying his mock-harangue. ''You could have made something of yourself!''
 ''Some say I have,'' she replies, only half-joking. In 1991, when she went to work for the campaign of Thomas K. Duane, the city's first openly gay councilman, her father volunteered in the trenches not because he was a Duane fan, but because his daughter asked him to. 
 IT'S like they say on 'The Sopranos,' family is everything, and once she became Duane's chief of staff, I could see it coming along,'' he says of her transition from staff worker to Mr. Duane's replacement on the Council after he was elected to the State Senate. ''She seems to have a natural gift for the political game. I'm just an old-time Democrat: I vote the ticket and don't ask any questions.'' 
 Ms. Quinn, the city's first openly gay speaker, has a predilection toward advancing an equal rights agenda that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference. Her dad is mainly mum on that topic. She came out after joining Mr. Duane's staff. His reaction?
 ''Denial is a good mechanism,'' he says. ''I'm not O.K. with it, it's more you're resigned to it. She's a good daughter.'' He volunteers, he says, out of ''love and affection.'' During her 1999 campaign, he called senior citizens in Greenwich Village with this spiel: ''I said, 'Look I don't agree with all of her policies, either, but if she loses, she's unemployed, and I'll have to pay her rent. Thanks for your vote!' ''

HEADLINE: Fate of Uzbek Refugees Worries Rights Groups

BYLINE: By ETHAN WILENSKY-LANFORD

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Human Rights Watch and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees voiced concern this week over the fate of four refugees who fled violence in Uzbekistan last summer.
 The four men were granted refugee status by the United Nations after they fled Uzbekistan for Kyrgyzstan in May following an uprising in the Uzbek city of Andijon. Witnesses said hundreds of people fled the city after government troops ended the uprising by shooting hundreds of unarmed protesters. 
Uzbekistan is seeking the extradition of the four men, whom it accuses of killing a regional prosecutor during the violence. Under pressure from Uzbekistan to honor its request, Kyrgyzstan's Committee of Migration and Employment, which is responsible for refugees, has asked Kyrgyz courts to invalidate their refugee status and approve extradition, said lawyers for the men, identified as Yakub Tashbayev, Rasul Pirmatov, Jakhongir Maksudov, and Odiljan Rakhimov.
 The decision by the United Nations agency to consider the men refugees ''was made after a thorough review of all the circumstances surrounding their cases,'' including the criminal charges against them, according to a news release issued by the agency on Monday. 
 Human Rights Watch issued a statement about the case on Thursday. ''The Uzbek government's promises not to torture these men are not worth the paper they're written on,'' Holly Cartner, the group's Europe and Central Asia director, was quoted as saying. 
 Human Rights Watch says that Kyrgyzstan is bound by both the 1951 United Nations refugee convention and other treaties against torture not to return the men to Uzbekistan.
 Under a 1993 multilateral agreement known as the Minsk Convention, however, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics are obligated to provide legal assistance and extradition to other signatory countries. 
 The 4 men were among about 500 refugees who fled to southern Kyrgyzstan in May. Uzbek authorities have resisted European and American calls for an international inquiry into the violence. They blame terrorists and say 187 people were killed. Human rights organizations say the number of dead was much higher.

HEADLINE: A Seer in the Making

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab, is not ashamed to admit that she is a talking head. Brisk and boldly conservative, Ms. Sonders has become a fairly common presence on television recently as Schwab, eager to promote its first-ever strategist, pushes for Ms. Sonders to achieve a greater renown.
 ''Yeah, they are marketing me,'' she said, sitting behind her desk in a suite of offices in the U.S. Trust building near Times Square. Ms. Sonders is dressed smartly in a leather jacket; next to her, a television is tuned silently to CNBC. ''But not just as smoke and mirrors. We hope there is more behind the curtain.'' 
As the Dow climbs and hovers near 11,000 -- levels last seen in 2001 -- individual investors surely have similar hopes. Yet many investors have felt ill-served by Wall Street strategists, who for the most part failed to forecast the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000. The reputation of the Wall Street seer may have never been lower. 
 Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman Sachs strategist who is celebrated for her bullish prognostications, has assumed a lower profile these days. Other well-known cheerleaders like Thomas M. Galvin of Credit Suisse First Boston and Jeffrey M. Applegate of Lehman Brothers have lost their jobs. 
 So far this time around, as the market has made its move, there has been no accompanying fame accorded to strategists. Today the chief bulls, like Tobias M. Levkovich of Citigroup and Henry C. Dickson of Lehman Brothers, both of whom forecast a 10 percent return for the S.& P. 500, remain mostly unknown to the broader investing community.
 While Ms. Sonders also forecasts a 10 percent increase, her view on the market is tinged with doubt: for the record, she recommends a neutral weighting in United States stocks, reflecting her skepticism that the market is about to take off just because the Federal Reserve has indicated that it is nearly done with raising interest rates this year.
 It is a bit of an about-face for someone who, during the frothy days of the Nasdaq bull market, was an ardent advocate of some speculative technology companies that hardly merit a mention these days.
 But Ms. Sonders, who was a portfolio manager for a growth-oriented mutual fund at U.S. Trust before the company merged with Schwab, has left those days behind.
 Instead of plugging the likes of JDS Uniphase on television, she is striving for a higher plane, blending grave prognostications about the market's direction and investor sentiment with wonkier reflections on tax reform. And while she has been a regular on Bloomberg TV and CNBC, the public recognition that Schwab is hoping comes her way has been slow to arrive.
 ''I have not seen much of her,'' said James B. Cowperthwait, an institutional money manager who worked at U.S. Trust before Ms. Sonders arrived there in 1999. ''I thought she had been kicked upstairs or something.''
 Schwab, which makes its money by catering to individual investors, cares little whether Ms. Sonders becomes an established voice among institutional investors, many of whom scorn the musings of such figures. 
 Still, its aggressive campaign to market Ms. Sonders is part of a broader initiative to provide intelligent market advice and recommendations to its clients and move beyond the bare-bones do-it-yourself model that has been the core of the firm's strategy for years. 
 In that vein, the firm has been sending out shiny media kits extolling the expertise of Ms. Sonders and its other analysts. It is an approach that stands in contrast to that of many of the larger firms on Wall Street, which, in the wake of the 2000 market meltdown and the scandal over conflicts of interest involving research and opinions, have kept their strategists on a tighter leash.
 To that end, Schwab hopes that Ms. Sonders, if she is not to achieve the market-moving eclat that belonged once to Ms. Cohen, becomes, at the very least, relevant.
 ''How important is it to be influential? I think it is important,'' she said. ''Are we there yet? I would like to think so, but maybe not in the eyes of others.''
 Ms. Sonders is eager to promote her performance record, proudly displaying a series of charts showing how her various calls have paid off for Schwab investors, assuming that they followed her advice.
 If her advice is not yet an overwhelming hit with the investing public, Ms. Sonders's fervent support of tax cuts has caught the eye of the Bush administration. Since becoming Schwab's public voice, she has been called to the White House with others from Wall Street to provide her market view to President Bush. She participated in the White House public forum in 2004 on the economy, and was on the president's advisory panel on tax reform.
 At the conference, where she was seated next to the president, she proclaimed herself to be a big believer in personal accounts for Social Security and said that privatization was what the markets ''absolutely want to see.'' Most of Wall Street has remained mute on the topic.
 It was a heady moment for Ms. Sonders. ''I had more heart palpitations than under normal circumstances,'' she said, and while she is critical of the administration's lack of spending restraint, her support of the administration's bedrock philosophy remains firm. 
 ''I'm a free trader. I'm a capitalist,'' she said. ''And I believe in low taxes to stimulate economic growth. When it comes to tax policy, I am a supply-sider.''

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Chief Hints at Rate Increase 

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank will monitor inflation ''very closely'' as an economic recovery continues among the 12 countries that share the euro, the president of the bank said Thursday, suggesting that it could increase interest rates as early as March. 
 The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, made the statement after the central bank's monthly policy meeting, at which it left borrowing costs unchanged at 2.25 percent. The bank raised the rate in December for the first time in five years.
After the December increase, Mr. Trichet said the bank was not embarking on a series of rate increases similar to those by the Federal Reserve in the United States, which has increased borrowing costs steadily since June 2004.
 Economists took Mr. Trichet's statement as a signal that the bank would shift rates quarterly, when it publishes its regular estimates of economic growth for the coming years.
 On Thursday, Mr. Trichet did not call for vigilance in combating inflation, now hovering slightly above 2 percent, even as he signaled that the bank would continue to monitor prices.
 The bank used the word ''vigilance'' two months before it raised rates in December to signal that a shift in policy was imminent and thus avoid surprising financial markets.
 The markets read Mr. Trichet's remarks Thursday as suggesting that the bank was continuing to brace for an increase, although not as early as February.
 ''The rhetoric was not there in the way it has been in the past, but we're still looking at a hike in March,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief European economist with Goldman Sachs in London.
 Mr. Trichet also said that the economic recovery in the 12-nation euro zone had kept up its moderate pace at the end of 2005, a situation that the European bank has made clear will accompany any moves toward higher rates.
 Momentum from the recovery has carried over into the new year, Mr. Trichet said, citing positive indicators showing an upturn in business sentiment. ''The conditions remain in place for sustained growth of economic activity,'' he said.
 Mr. Trichet cited higher oil prices, large trade deficits -- notably in the United States -- and sluggish consumer confidence in Europe as factors that could upset the outlook for recovery.
 ''Risks to this outlook for economic growth continue to lie on the downside,'' he cautioned.
 Analysts offered various interpretations for the bank's softening of its tone to smooth the way for the next increase in interest rates.
 Ken Wattret of BNP Paribas in London said that he did not expect the bank to issue a series of signals pointing to a rate increase in March, as it did before the December increase, the first since 2000.
 ''When you haven't changed in several years, you need to give more notice,'' Mr. Wattret said. ''The next hike will be much less of a seismic shift.''

HEADLINE: Dow Closes Below 11,000 On Concerns About Iran 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday on worries over Iran's nuclear intentions, doubts about corporate earnings and downgrades of J. P. Morgan Chase and Coca-Cola. 
 The Nasdaq composite index ended a seven-day winning streak and the Dow closed below 11,000 just three days after crossing the level for the first time since 2001.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joined European powers in saying that Iran must be referred to the United Nations Security Council over its nuclear plans. 
 ''The market is overbought short term,'' said Michael James, senior trader with the regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. ''People are looking for an excuse to sell. That came in the form of Secretary Rice raising significant concerns about Iran's nuclear program.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.08 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 10,962.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,286.06. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 14.67 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,316.69 
 Piper Jaffray lowered its rating on J. P. Morgan, saying healthy capital markets and synergies from the bank's merger with Bank One are now fully figured into J. P. Morgan's stock price. Shares of J. P. Morgan slid 75 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $39.95, a day after hitting its highest in more than one and a half years. 
 Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Coca-Cola on expectations of lower European demand for soft drinks. Coke shares fell 23 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $41.44. 
 Profit warnings from RadioShack and from American Home Mortgage Investment, a real estate investment trust, stirred concern about the outlook for corporate earnings. Shares of RadioShack fell 31 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $21.49. American Home shares dropped $3.60, or 10.7 percent, to $30. 
 ''What little earnings reports we have had have been a little bit more disappointing than outperforming,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. 
 The reporting period began this week with disappointing results from Alcoa. 
 The market's reaction was muted to economic data, including a narrowing in the United States trade deficit for November that exceeded expectations. Import prices in December fell unexpectedly as the price of imported petroleum declined for the third consecutive month. And new claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly less than expected in the latest week. 
 Iran has said it wants to pursue peaceful nuclear research, but the United States and others are worried that its programs could lead to the creation of nuclear weapons. 
 Markets are nervous that the dispute with Iran could lead to disruption in oil shipments from the country, the world's fourth-biggest exporter of crude oil. 
 The February contract for crude oil settled unchanged at $63.94 a barrel.
 Goldman also lowered its rating for Anheuser-Busch, and its stock fell 70 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $42.41. 
 Shares of Johnson & Johnson declined after the medical device maker Guidant said it had accepted a $23.2 billion takeover bid from the company. But Boston Scientific said the takeover battle was not over. 
 Shares of Johnson & Johnson slipped 29 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $62.21. Guidant's stock dipped 4 cents, to $70.40, while Boston Scientific stock declined 36 cents, to $25.05. 
 Treasury yields fell with the 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.40 percent, from 4.45 Wednesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the rate, rose 13/32, to 100 24/32.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year inflation notes:



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	High Price	99.722	High Yield	2.025	Low Yield	1.001	Median Yield	2.000	Accepted at low price	87%	Total applied for	$16,609,260	Accepted	$9,000,072	Noncompetitive	$84,820	Interest set at	2%	The 10-year inflation notes mature Jan. 15, 2016.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Schoolgirls Have a Message for the President

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
It was not exactly a protest, but it was pretty pointed nonetheless. As President Bush hustled through town Thursday morning, the proper young ladies of the Academy of the Sacred Heart were in Jackson Square, wearing life jackets over their plaid-skirt uniforms, and politely but firmly demanding better levees.
 ''Do what it takes, do what it takes!'' more than 200 of the high school girls chanted, many holding aloft signs reading ''Category 5 Levees and Coastal Restoration'' and ''Party Affiliation: Louisianian.'' Cars passing through the French Quarter honked in support. 
The girls of the academy, a stately, turn-of-the-century institution in the Uptown neighborhood, do not normally forsake the school's ornate high iron gates for the streets. And school officials were at pains to emphasize that they were not protesting anything, and that politics had nothing to do with it. Mr. Bush won a mock election at the school handily, they said. 
 Still, that it was young daughters of New Orleans's elite -- almost exclusively white -- who organized the city's sharpest response to the president's brief visit spoke volumes. Anxiety for the future and pain over the past cuts across class, race and economic lines here. Indeed, some of the school's students and faculty members lived in Lakeview, the well-to-do, largely white section destroyed by Hurricane Katrina's floods.
 ''When the mock election was held they stood behind Bush,'' said Liz Manthey, director of public relations and marketing at the school. ''Now it's his turn to stand behind us.''
 Behind her were the high school's girls, arrayed on the steps of the Mississippi River levee in the French Quarter, delighted to have the morning off. Some carried life preservers, while others had put masking tape on their foreheads inscribed with the words ''water line.'' 
 As Emma Matesky, a 15-year-old freshman, smilingly explained, pointing to her head: ''We're literally up to here with this.''
 Elizabeth Evans, an 18-year-old senior, said: ''We're going off to college, and we want to come back. If we don't have these levees, will there be a safe place to raise our children?''
 The high turnout -- 230 students out of the pre-Katrina enrollment of 269 -- was further evidence that the better-off in this city have had a far easier time returning than inhabitants of poorer neighborhoods. At a protest over demolitions in the Lower Ninth Ward last week, there was hardly a single local resident.
 Thursday's rally was organized by Shawn Holahan, a parent whose Lakeview home was destroyed in the flooding. 
 ''I've lost my home, I've lost everything,'' said Ms. Holahan, a lawyer. ''I've got three kids here, and no home. I'm frustrated that that issue -- Category 5 levees -- is being obfuscated by politics.'' 
 The president has committed to spending $2.9 billion on levee restoration here, but has made no commitment to spending far more for protection from Category 5 hurricanes, a project that could cost over $32 billion, experts say. 
 Money was not the issue at Thursday's good-natured but earnest demonstration, however. 
 ''This institution is out in the street to show the world that this city is unified on this issue,'' Ms. Holahan said, exasperation breaking through.

HEADLINE: Israel Wants West to Deal More Urgently With Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
With Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling for Israel to be ''wiped off the map,'' Israeli officials have special reasons for concern now that Iran has defied the West and said it will resume enriching uranium.
 The Israelis are engaged in a careful effort to press the United States and the Europeans to deal more urgently with Iran. Israel has no intention for now of trying to deal with Iran alone or through military means, officials say.
But Israeli officials are worried that politicians in the United States and Europe are focusing on estimates of when Iran might actually have a bomb -- rather than concentrating on the ''point of no return,'' perhaps within the next year, when they argue Iran may gain enough technical knowledge to make the fissile material needed for a weapon. After that point, in the Israeli view, it is simply a matter of time until Iran is nuclear-armed. 
 Maj. Gen. Aharon Zeev-Farkash, who retired Jan. 5 as Israel's director of military intelligence, said Israel believed that the moment was no more than a year away, although estimates differ among governments, based on different views of how advanced Iranian technology has become. Once Iran starts enriching uranium, the general said, it will need just six months to a year to achieve the ability to produce fissile materials. 
 In a report released Thursday, David Albright and Corey Hinderstein of the Institute for Science and International Security described a number of technical problems Iran had to solve before it could begin testing its enrichment technology. 
 ''Absent major problems,'' they wrote, ''Iran will need roughly six months to one year to demonstrate successful operation'' of its pilot operation. ''Iran could have its first nuclear weapon in 2009,'' they went on to say, though they noted that that estimate ''reflects a worst-case assessment, and thus is highly uncertain.''
 General Farkash had a similar estimate, saying that within another two and a half to three years, Iran will have enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it is able to construct and run 2,000 to 4,000 centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium.
 ''We have a crucial six months to a year to do something,'' he said, adding that ''unfortunately when I say this to our friends and allies, they like to focus on the third step,'' the production of the bomb, ''rather than the first step.''
 ''The first step is the most crucial, when Iran will achieve independent research and development capacity to enrich uranium -- we all agree,'' the general said. ''Then it's not an intelligence problem, but a political decision.''
 Iran's announcement has sent governments scurrying to come up with estimates about how much time they have left until Iran can produce its first nuclear weapon. The Israelis say they think that Iran can produce its first bomb in 4 to 5 years. European officials estimate a weapon will take 5 years, and American officials have offered estimates of 6 to 10 years.
 Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington, is skeptical about the American estimates. 
 He said that ''what's important is the ability to build a successful centrifuge and get it to work in a cascade,'' a series of 164 centrifuges, and then tie a series of cascades together. 
 ''People feel the Iranians can do that now,'' he said. ''But whether they've done it or not is less clear.'' He said his own sources thought that the Iranians could solve the various technical problems. 
 ''How long will it take? No one really knows,'' Mr. Milhollin said. ''But I think that if the Iranians decide to go all out, they could make a bomb's worth of material a year with 2,000 centrifuges running.''
 He viewed Israel's estimates as a sophisticated form of lobbying, but said he thought that the Israeli estimates were not out of line. ''I'd be surprised if the Iranians don't make it in five years with one, two or three bombs,'' he said.
 The problem for intelligence agencies, General Farkash said, is that ''while we have hard evidence about a lot of things'' supporting Iran's intention to make nuclear weapons, ''we don't have the smoking gun'' proving that Iran is violating its pledge to enrich for civilian use only.
 He said: ''So I told my people, we have to bring for the States and everyone the smoking gun. And then they have to face it and decide what to do.'' 
 Intelligence assumptions are not enough these days, the general said. ''We as intelligence chiefs need to bring a smoking gun if we want to influence policy makers, especially after Iraq,'' he said, alluding to the fact that assertions that Saddam Hussein possessed an active program to make nuclear and other prohibited weapons, used to justify the invasion of Iraq, proved to be wrong.
 Meir Dagan, the chief of Israel's espionage service, Mossad, recently testified before the Israeli Parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee in similar terms. He said that Iran would attain technological independence in producing fissile material in ''a matter of months'' and that subsequent development of a nuclear bomb would be only a matter of time and the number of centrifuges Iran could operate.
 He emphasized Israel's view that ''there exists a strategic Iranian decision to reach nuclear independence and the capability to produce bombs,'' no matter what the Iranians say, and that Iran will produce a number of them.
 General Farkash, Mr. Dagan and Israeli policy makers all agree that a military option against Iran's nuclear facilities cannot be ruled out. Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, the Israeli chief of staff, said recently that the West had the ability to destroy the main elements of Iran's nuclear program. 
 But Israel believes that diplomatic efforts at preventing or at least delaying Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons should continue with more intensity -- at the United Nations Security Council, through economic sanctions, because of Iran's heavy reliance on imported parts, but also through an oil embargo or other means to affect the Iranian government and population.
 ''Economic sanctions take too long, but we can blockade oil and use Western strategic reserves,'' said Efraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. ''Let the Iranians and the government feel some heat. Right now they don't feel any heat. Oil is just money, so let the Americans put their money where their mouth is.''
 The diplomatic process has already delayed Iran's program by some two years, the Israelis believe.
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, speaking on Jan. 3, in his last interview before his massive stroke, made the same case as General Farkash and Mr. Dagan. ''In any event, time is not working in favor of anyone who wants to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear,'' he said. Israel, Mr. Sharon said, ''is not the spearhead, but we are working together when it comes to intelligence and evaluation with the United States, together with European countries.'' 
 Israel is also being careful not to react too strongly to the violently anti-Semitic comments of the Iranian president, Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 David Menashri, the director of the Center of Iranian Studies at Tel Aviv University, said: ''The less Israelis speak about Iran the better. Ahmadinejad is trying to turn the Iranian nuclear issue into the problem of Israel, and by responding to his statements we just play into his hands.''

HEADLINE: Defendants File a Flurry of Motions Challenging the KPMG Tax-Shelter Case 

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Former KPMG tax professionals who are facing criminal charges over questionable tax shelters challenged the government yesterday to prove that they had broken the law. 
 The defendants filed more than two dozen motions in United States District Court in Manhattan yesterday, asking among other things that charges be dropped because no court had ever ruled the shelters in question illegal.
Carolyn Rule, a lawyer at Kostelanetz & Fink representing Richard Smith, a former vice chairman of taxes at KPMG and among the most senior former executives indicted, said yesterday that ''the whole indictment is sloppy and peppered with words that have no legal meaning.'' 
 In joint motions, many of the defendants also asked the judge in the case, Lewis A. Kaplan, to dismiss the charges because they said they were being unfairly singled out among many other KPMG employees who created and sold similar tax shelters from 1996 through 2002 and who have not been indicted.
 Nineteen people have been indicted in the case, including former senior executives like Jeffrey Stein, KPMG's former vice chairman; Richard Rosenthal, a former chief financial officer; and John Lanning, a former vice chairman for tax services. 
 Two people outside KPMG were indicted: Raymond J. Ruble, a former tax lawyer with Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, and David Amir Makov, who worked at an investment firm, Presidio Advisory Services, that collaborated with KPMG. 
 A revised indictment, handed up last October, accused the 19 of ''devising, marketing and implementing fraudulent tax shelters'' as well as preparing ''false and fraudulent'' income tax returns containing the shelter losses, and with hiding all of this from the government. The case is the largest criminal tax case ever filed by the government.
 The indictment came less than three months after KPMG, one of the nation's largest accounting firms, narrowly avoided its own criminal indictment and instead reached a $456 million agreement in a deferred- prosecution deal with federal prosecutors over certain shelters. 
 One motion filed yesterday on behalf of several of the indicted, including Jeffrey Eischeid, a senior former KPMG partner, asked Judge Kaplan to dismiss the charges on the ground of ''prosecutorial misconduct.'' 
 That misconduct, the filing said, included withholding from the grand jury important information about a gray area of tax law known as economic substance. 
 Mr. Eischeid's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, also submitted three internal KPMG documents, signed by the firm's top leadership, in an effort to bolster assertions by Mr. Eischeid and others that questionable tax shelters were a firmwide business at KPMG.
 ''Each of the strategies were repeatedly approved by KPMG after an exhaustive vetting process, and the company's approval of the strategies was communicated widely within KPMG,'' Mr. Arkin wrote in a memo accompanying the documents.
 The internal documents include a letter from Stephen G. Butler, then the firm's chairman and chief executive, to partners in March 1998, outlining the firm's shift from traditional client services, like audit and tax preparation, to faster-growing products, like tax shelters. 
 ''The rationale for our thinking is clear,'' Mr. Butler wrote. ''Clients buy products.'' 
 ''We see,'' he added, ''an incredible opportunity to continue the aggressive growth curve we've seen over the past 18 months.'' 
 Mr. Butler's letter included new organization charts showing that some executives like Mr. Lanning, who are now among the indicted, were elevated to senior positions as part of the strategy. 
 Mr. Butler has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
 An e-mail message to the partners in October 2003 from Eugene D. O'Kelly, then KPMG's chairman, about an impending ''60 Minutes'' program on the firm's tax shelter activities, urged the partners to assure clients ''that we provide appropriate tax planning to our clients, which is fully supported by the Internal Revenue Code.'' 
 The message then urged partners with questions to contact Mr. Smith, who has since been indicted.
 Mr. O'Kelly died of cancer last year at age 53.
 Other defendants, some of them senior partners or top executives who once worked at KPMG are: Philip Wiesner, John Larson, Robert Pfaff, Mark Watson, Larry DeLap, Steven Gremminger, Gregg Ritchie, Randy Bickham, Carol Warley, David Rivkin and Carl Hasting. 
 Lawyers for David Greenberg, a former partner at KPMG in Los Angeles who is among the indicted, filed a motion asking that charges against him be dropped. 
 Those charges -- that he issued opinion letters blessing a shelter called SOS -- distinguished him from the 18 other individuals, who have been charged with dealing in other questionable tax shelters known as Flip, Blips and Opis.
 Many of the motions yesterday were filed jointly, with many of the 19 defendants joining them. One joint motion asked the judge to force the government to turn over internal audit files for specific clients on certain questionable tax shelters. 
 One motion filed by Mr. Rivkin, a former KPMG partner, asked that the judge move the trial to a federal court in California.

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit Will Climb In 2006, White House Says

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The White House acknowledged on Thursday that the budget deficit would climb back above $400 billion this year, erasing the brief improvement last year and complicating President Bush's vow to cut the deficit in half by 2009.
 Joel Kaplan, the White House deputy budget director, predicted that the government's shortfall would climb to more than $400 billion in 2006 from $319 billion in 2005, largely because of relief efforts tied to Hurricane Katrina.
 That shortfall would be equal to about 3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, a significantly higher share than last year and high for a country that is expected to experience its fifth straight year of economic growth. 
 The new deficit forecast is about $60 billion bigger than what the administration had predicted in July, before Hurricane Katrina. 
 ''We believe that those increased outlays associated with Katrina recovery efforts are a temporary event,'' Mr. Kaplan told reporters, adding that the administration is still hoping for the deficit to resume its ''downward trajectory'' and meet Mr. Bush's promise for 2009.
 Congress has appropriated about $85 billion in spending related to Hurricane Katrina, as well as about $8 billion in tax relief for the Gulf Coast over the next few years. 
 But Mr. Bush's fiscal challenges are not all the result of hurricanes. Even though administration officials and lawmakers have known for months that the next year's deficit would be higher, Mr. Bush and Republican leaders in Congress are pushing hard to pass nearly $90 billion in tax cuts for the next five years.
 ''The deficit is going up again, and that complicates some of the administration's agenda,'' said Robert Bixby, director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan research group that pushes for fiscal discipline. ''It makes part of it easier for them to argue for greater spending restraint in nondefense areas, but it will make extensions of the tax cuts more difficult.''
 Democrats are certain to seize upon the new deficit forecast in attacking Republican efforts to cut spending on social programs for the poor while extending tax cuts that tend to benefit high-income families.
 Some Republicans also made it clear they were unhappy, too. 
 ''The expected increase in the deficit is to some degree understandable,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''But it is still unacceptable. As a government, we must continue to try to control the rate of growth of spending.''
 Since President Bush took office in 2001, the federal budget has swung from a surplus of more than $100 billion to deficits as high as $412 billion in 2004. Last year, the deficit narrowed unexpectedly to $319 billion, mainly because of a surge in corporate tax revenues and taxes on stock-market gains.
 Mr. Bush has attributed much if not most of the rising deficit to several unforeseen shocks: a recession in 2001, the collapse of the stock market bubble, huge new spending on domestic security after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the cost of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
 But budget analysts outside the administration have long argued that the government spending has been very high under Mr. Bush while tax cuts have chipped away at revenues.
 As a percentage of gross domestic product, a measure that economists prefer over simple dollar amounts, government spending has climbed sharply, from 18.5 percent in 2001 to nearly 20 percent for each of the past three years.
 By contrast, tax revenues plunged to as little as 16.3 percent of the nation's economy from 19.8 percent in 2001.
 The yawning deficit has provoked strong criticism from conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats alike. But lawmakers remain locked in partisan combat over whether to restore discipline through higher taxes or tighter spending.
 In a report last month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned that the long-term budget problems could not be solved without basic changes, because soaring health care costs and a growing population of retiring baby-boomers would greatly increase government's overall pace of spending.
 ''Limiting the growth of outlays for defense, education, transportation and other discretionary programs would not be enough to ensure fiscal sustainability,'' the budget office said.
 ''If taxation is restricted to levels that prevailed in the past,'' it added, ''the growth in spending on programs for the elderly will have to be reduced substantially.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Spent $84 Million To Remain Mayor, a Record

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
It's official: The spending record for a New York City mayoral contest is more than $84 million. For now.
 New campaign documents released yesterday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg show that he spent $84,134,993 on his re-election drive, more than $10 million higher than the $73,864,383 he spent on his first mayoral contest in 2001. 
Mr. Bloomberg also released records showing that he spent roughly $1 million on his inauguration and transition -- less than half of the $2.5 million he spent on his inauguration and transition four years ago, when he was building a government from scratch.
 Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said his spending figures from the 2005 campaign and the inauguration could still go higher when he makes his final filing later this year, as bills continue to trickle in.
 For instance, Mr. Bloomberg's latest campaign spending figure is $6 million more than the one he released a few weeks ago because of late bills from accountants, lawyers and subcontractors.
 Mr. Bloomberg's inaugural and transition committee records show that his generous treatment of his political team continued through December, above and beyond the more than $1.55 million he gave out in campaign bonuses last month.
 Mr. Bloomberg's inaugural committee paid Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, a salary of almost $10,500 every two weeks through Dec. 30. Mr. Sheekey started as Mr. Bloomberg's new deputy mayor for intergovernmental relations several days later. 
 The committee paid Stu Loeser, the campaign press secretary, a salary of $6,000 every two weeks through Dec. 30. Mr. Loeser started this week as Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary in training, succeeding Ed Skyler, who was named as the deputy mayor for administration earlier this week.
 Mr. Bloomberg had said in 2001 that he had to spend so much because he was wholly unknown to voters, a problem he did not face in 2005.
 Mr. Loeser said yesterday that Mr. Bloomberg's costs were higher in 2005 than they were in 2001 because of inflation, increases in advertising costs and a more extensive campaign that included television commercials in Chinese, Hindi and Urdu.

HEADLINE: Disclosure Won't Tame C.E.O. Pay

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
THIS Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to unveil its first overhaul of executive compensation disclosure rules in 14 years. The new rules, which were leaked to the news media this week, are intended to give investors a fuller picture of the staggering amounts of money going to America's chief executives and other top corporate officers.
 Under the proposal, companies will have to disclose much more than just information about outsize salaries and bonuses. An estimated dollar value will be placed on obscene grants of stock options. The details of bloated retirement packages will be made public. And companies will have to list all the absurd perquisites that have accrued to chief executives in recent years -- including the latest twist, the practice of having companies pay the boss's taxes. Nor will companies be able to bury this stuff in the proxy statement, as they've long done; it will all have to be put in one place, where it can be easily seen and understood.
All in all, it's going to be a pretty sickening sight. 
 It is fitting that this is the first initiative of the new S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox; better disclosure, in all sorts of areas, is likely to be his hallmark. ''Disclosure of material information has been one of the priorities of the S.E.C. for 70 years,'' Mr. Cox told me a few days ago. ''It's a priority I inherited.''
 In the case of compensation, it was Mr. Cox's view that such disclosure had become ''less accurate and less useful'' in recent years -- and who can doubt it? Think back to 2002, when the world learned about Jack Welch's retirement perks -- including Red Sox tickets, a Manhattan apartment for life, country club memberships and free use of a corporate jet -- not from the General Electric proxy statement, but from his angry wife's divorce papers. After taking down some $1 billion in the two decades he ran G.E., it appeared that he had negotiated a retirement plan that would cause him to never have to take cash out of pocket to pay for anything. 
 BETTER disclosure rules are all fine and well, but we already know plenty about executive pay. We know that it is out of control, socially corrosive and divorced from any real rationale (did Michael Dell really need stock options to ''incent'' him?). Nor is it economically insignificant. According to Lucian A. Bebchuk, an executive compensation expert at Harvard, from 2000 to 2003, the total compensation of the five best-paid officers of all publicly held companies amounted to 10 percent of corporate earnings. 
 But when I asked Mr. Cox whether he thought the new disclosure rules would help rein in executive pay, he punted. ''It is not the role of the S.E.C. to determine the level of compensation,'' he replied. ''It is the role of directors and shareholders.'' And hence the problem: when the S.E.C.'s new rules are instituted, some months down the road, it won't be just you and me who are getting a fuller picture of executive compensation -- so will the nation's chief executives. And history suggests that whenever they discover a fellow C.E.O. is getting something they don't have, they make a grab for it. In other words, as laudable as more disclosure is, there is a real possibility that it will make a bad situation worse.
 Take, for instance, 1993, the year Congress passed a law eliminating the tax deduction for any executive salary that exceeded $1 million. What happened? First, the new law accelerated the trend of giving C.E.O.'s hefty stock option grants. Second, it made $1 million the new salary floor. ''In the hall of fame of unintended consequences,'' said Nell Minow of the Corporate Library, a corporate governance monitoring group, ''that has to rank right near the top.'' 
 Or take the last time the S.E.C. pushed through executive pay disclosure rules. ''I was a consultant to Richard Breeden when the S.E.C. did its disclosure rules in the early 1990's,'' recalled Graef Crystal, the grand old man of executive compensation critics, referring to the S.E.C. chairman at the time. ''I absolutely thought it would cause comp to go down because the disclosures would be so embarrassing. But it turned out that when somebody is hauling in $200 million, he's not embarrassable.''
 Mr. Crystal, who ran the Towers Perrin compensation consulting practice before becoming a critic (''atoning for my sins,'' he likes to call it), points out that the information currently disclosed in proxies has been a huge force in driving compensation upward. Compensation consultants use it to compile surveys of C.E.O. perks and pay, allowing for easy comparison. Such surveys, which most boards rely on to set their own C.E.O.'s pay, are one of the most invidious tools in the comp racket. And with the Internet, compensation information is available the instant the proxy is filed with the government. ''The consultant will call within 30 seconds saying, 'Michael Eisner just got a huge grant. We have to do more for you,' '' Mr. Crystal said.
 So what do we do about what I've come to think is the single most intractable problem in corporate America? How do we put a lid on executive greed?
 There are many people in the field who think the essential problem is that pay is disconnected to performance, and that is certainly true. ''If a C.E.O. gets a million stock options and the stock goes up a buck, that's not what I'd call pay for performance,'' Ms. Minow said. Mr. Crystal says that most so-called pay for performance plans are really ''pay for pulse'' plans. 
 But I think the problem is deeper than that. Even C.E.O.'s who do perform well are often paid too much. There is a huge disconnect between the amount executives are paid and society's expectation of what is reasonable to pay someone to manage a big company. Nobody begrudges Bill Gates his wealth; he became the richest man in the country because he founded a hugely successful company. But lots of people begrudge, say, James M. Kilts, who ran Gillette for just four years -- and then pocketed $175 million when he sold the company to Procter & Gamble, because the sale put in play the options he was handed during his short tenure. There is simply no excuse for showering Mr. Kilts (who is on the board of The New York Times Company) with that kind of wealth.
 There are plenty of ideas out there for getting C.E.O. pay more in line with investors' expectations, though none of them strike me as the perfect solution. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, has filed a bill that would allow shareholders to vote on ''change of control'' compensation schemes -- like the one that enriched Mr. Kilts -- and would also force executives to return compensation if the company subsequently had to restate its earnings. But Mr. Frank told me that he is leery of trying to legislate the appropriate level of executive pay. ''It is the shareholders' money,'' he said. ''If they want to pay for Jack Welch's newspaper, they have that right.''
 Ms. Minow thought that giving shareholders the means to put additional heat on boards would help. ''There is no such thing as an independent director if C.E.O.'s are picking them,'' she said. As a result, she added, ''I am very committed to the most significant shareholder initiative right now: majority vote.'' If shareholders could oust directors with a simple majority vote, she believes, they would start voting against compensation committee members ''who approve these absurd packages.'' 
 Leo J. Hindery Jr., the former C.E.O. of a number of telecommunications companies, attacks executive compensation practices in his new book, ''It Takes a C.E.O.'' He has an idea that came from his time running the YES Network for George Steinbrenner and Major League Baseball decided to crack down on sky-high team payrolls. ''When the Yankees exceed the salary cap,'' he said, ''Steinbrenner has to pay a luxury tax. Writing a check gets his attention.'' Mr. Hindery believes that there should be a ratio between what the C.E.O. makes and what the average worker in the company makes -- say, 25 to 1. (It is currently over 400 to 1.) If the chief executive's pay exceeded the ratio, the company would have to pay a luxury tax, just as Mr. Steinbrenner does.
 Indeed, one prominent compensation consultant has begun advocating for what he calls ''internal pay equity.'' That is Frederic W. Cook, who has been in the field for nearly four decades. ''I am proposing it,'' he told me, ''as an alternative to this 100 percent reliance on surveys. There has to be some other way. Surveys are flawed.''
 Mr. Cook put this idea into practice in 1990, when he was advising DuPont. Its C.E.O. at the time, Edward Woolard, decided to set his pay at 1.5 times the pay of his senior managers. He did so, he said in a recent speech, because he thought it was ''equitable.'' 
 He didn't care that his peers were making much more; indeed, he felt they were giving corporate chieftains a bad name. Of course, if all C.E.O.'s were as public-minded as Mr. Woolard, we wouldn't have the problem.
 So how would you fix the executive pay problem? Send me your ideas at tsnocera@nytimes.com. If I get enough good ones, I'll revisit the subject. And if not, I'll just keep wringing my hands, like everyone else.

HEADLINE: Getting Reacquainted With Good Times 

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Japan's leaders are facing a new challenge, now that the country's economy finally seems to be pulling out of years of stagnation. And it is not just that they will have to manage a healthy market economy -- they will have to learn how to manage a healthy market economy.
 Even before the economic doldrums of the 1990's in Japan, there were the stock and real estate bubbles of the late 1980's. That means that it has been almost a generation since Japan's leaders have managed an economy that was not in some sort of crisis.
In recent months, the economy, still the world's second-largest after the United States, has shown convincing signs of recovery. Stock prices are up along with corporate profits. And for the first time in 15 years, land prices have posted gains. That is good news for the global economy, which has long relied on the United States and China as its twin growth engines. 
 Even the experiences of those who were around in the mid-1980's are of limited value to Japan today, analysts and policy makers say. They note that the economy has drastically changed since then, as the country unleashed market forces by cutting regulations and trimming the wings of its once-powerful bureaucracy as it tried to end the long slump.
 ''There are not a lot of people in policy making who have dealt with a normally functioning economy,'' said Stefan Worrall, an economist in Tokyo for Credit Suisse First Boston. ''This includes government, analysts -- everyone.''
 At the same time, the changes in rules and procedures in recent years have also deprived policy makers of many of the tools that Tokyo once used to manage the economy. 
 Deregulation ended the trade and finance ministries' control of everything from foreign exchange to the interest rates that banks could pay on savings accounts. In addition, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has significantly cut government spending on road construction and other public works, closing Japan's traditional route for spending its way out of a recession.
 So, perhaps it is not surprising that now, when Japan is finally recovering, policy makers cannot seem to agree on what to do next, or even who has the final say in making policy decisions. 
 One of the bitterest debates involves the role of the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank. In most developed economies, central banks lead management of the economy by setting interest rates and are given autonomy from the rest of government to prevent political interference. The Bank of Japan, which won independence from the powerful Ministry of Finance just seven years ago, is keen to prove that it is up to the task. 
 But many economists and investors in Japan still lack faith in the bank. It has been criticized for not moving more aggressively to end the deflation -- the economically damaging downward spiral in prices -- that hit Japan in the 1990's and early 2000's. 
 Its reputation suffered an additional blow in 2000, when it raised interest rates too quickly and then had to lower them again, in an embarrassing about-face for a central bank in a developed country.
 Seeking to restore its credibility, the bank wants the freedom to make one of the most important decisions now facing the Japanese economy: whether to end a radically loose monetary policy adopted five years ago that has kept interest rates near zero and essentially flooded banks with cash to avert a financial collapse. 
 The bank's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has signaled that he wants to move toward tighter money for fear the current policy could touch off another bubble in the nation's rebounding stock market.
 ''This is a decision that should be 100 percent the Bank of Japan's responsibility,'' Mr. Fukui told reporters in November.
 Many lawmakers have called on the bank to follow the lead of the government, which wants money to remain easy to maintain robust growth. One of Japan's most influential lawmakers on economic affairs in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the general affairs minister, Heizo Takenaka, has even threatened to rewrite the central bank law to require the bank to cooperate with the government before acting.
 Other government bodies have been criticized for failing to shift away from a crisis footing, even with the economy on sounder ground. One is the Financial Services Agency, the bank watchdog established in the late 1990's to strengthen oversight of a banking industry in crisis over bad loans. Now that those loans have largely been cleaned up, bankers complain that the agency continues to use heavy-handed tactics even during routine audits.
 Some lawmakers say the country needs to take even bolder steps toward letting market forces rule. They back new legislation that would further deregulate the stock market, and oppose efforts by other members of Parliament and business leaders to limit free-market activities like hostile takeovers.
 ''We need a new overall framework for managing the economy,'' said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a Liberal Democrat member of Japan's upper house who served on a special committee in Parliament for revitalizing the economy.
 Economists say that behind many of the policy debates lies a larger tug of war between lawmakers and bureaucrats for control of economic policy. For decades, the bureaucrats ran Japan, issuing edicts that were rubber-stamped by Parliament. But in recent years, lawmakers have expanded their powers, as a series of corruption scandals discredited the nation's bureaucrats.
 Lawmakers have excluded bureaucrats from new advisory bodies like the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, a sort of economic cabinet set up by Mr. Koizumi. For the last three years, the council was led by Mr. Takenaka, the former economic policy minister who was the architect of Mr. Koizumi's toughest and most successful economic steps, forms, including a cleanup of the banking system.
 But Mr. Takenaka suffered widespread criticism for his ''dictatorial'' governing style, which in Japan's political context meant a failure to consult with bureaucrats and industry groups. In November, Mr. Takenaka was succeeded as economic policy minister and as head of the council by Kaoru Yosano, a longtime lawmaker with broad ties in the ministries. While Mr. Yosano said he would not cede power back to the bureaucrats, he said he would seek to be more accommodating.
 ''You can't always get the best results by constantly being on the attack,'' Mr. Yosano said in an interview. ''At some point, you need to re-establish relationships of trust.''
 These conflicts also underscore what economists call a broader uncertainty in Japan over how exactly to manage a market economy, and over exactly how free the nation wants its now-revitalized economy to be. For decades, Japan behaved almost like a command economy, with bureaucrats overseeing heavily regulated industries that were cogs in a formidable export machine. But after the economy stalled in the 1990's, Japan dismantled this in search of a new model that would yield growth.
 The problem is, experts say, Japan still needs to figure out what that model will be and then, how to manage it.

HEADLINE: Major Indexes Finish Week of Surges With Modest Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks were little changed in quiet trading yesterday as a slowdown in retail sales and profit warnings from Lucent Technologies and Tyco International kept investors from building on earlier gains. The major indexes finished the week with modest gains. 
 Better-than-expected wholesale inflation figures gave Wall Street some hope of extending its New Year's advance, but Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke, attributed the listless trading mostly to an overbought market. During the week, stocks surged to their highest levels in four and a half years.
 Coupled with lackluster earnings from Alcoa and DuPont earlier in the week, ''investors face an uphill battle in trying to push stock prices higher,'' Mr. Sheldon said. ''Over all, the tone of the market remains positive, but we could easily see a bit of profit taking or consolidation before stocks start to head higher again later this month.'' 
 Investors have turned much of their attention to the fourth-quarter earnings season, which kicks into full swing Tuesday. 
 The Dow lost 2.49 points, or 0.02 percent, to 10,959.87. Earlier this week, the Dow topped 11,000 for the first time since June 2001, closing Wednesday at 11,043.44, the highest in four and a half years. 
 Broader stock indicators also finished below the multiyear highs reached this week. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.55 points yesterday, or 0.12 percent, at 1,287.61, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.35, or 0.02 percent, to 2,317.04. 
 Bonds added to the prior day's gains, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.35 percent from 4.40 percent late Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, was up 13/32, to 101 5/32. The dollar was mixed against most major currencies, while gold prices edged upward. 
 Markets in the United States will be closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday. 
 Traders were optimistic about a Labor Department report that its core Producer Price Index grew just 0.1 percent in December, less than the 0.2 percent rise forecast by economists. While the overall index surged 0.9 percent, traders were probably comforted by a second straight monthly decline in material prices, Mr. Sheldon said. 
 The inflation data, a precursor to consumer-level increases, tempered a drop in monthly retail sales growth, which slowed to 0.7 percent and missed economists expectations for a gain of 1 percent, the Commerce Department said. 
 Over the next several weeks, investors will be focused on quarterly earnings while keeping a close watch on the Federal Reserve's actions at its Jan. 31 meeting, said Jack Caffrey, equities strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank. 
 ''It's not just what you deliver, but what your future is likely to hold,'' Mr. Caffrey said of the earnings reports. ''I feel like there is a lot of one-time noise in earnings. That's going to create volatility for some stocks.'' 
 A sharp sell-off Thursday gave back most of the market's gains this week, with the Dow rising 0.01 percent, the S.&P. 500 gaining 0.17 percent and the Nasdaq up 0.5 percent for the week. 
 In corporate news, Lucent said its annual revenue growth would be slower than previously forecast because of lagging sales in the United States and China. Lucent fell 6 cents, to $2.65. 
 Tyco confirmed a rumored move to split its security, electronics and health care businesses into three public units, but warned that its first-quarter and yearly earnings would miss estimates. Its shares sank $3.19, or nearly 11 percent, to $27.12. 
 The hospital operator HCA gained $1.75, to $50.94, after saying its fourth-quarter profit could top current Wall Street estimates and affirming its projected full-year earnings. 
 General Motors said it expected $4 billion of savings this year from measures aimed at lowering annual structural costs by $6 billion and material expenses by $1 billion. G.M. shares nonetheless slid 59 cents, to $20.37. 
 Late Thursday, I.B.M. said the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened a formal investigation into the forecast the company made for stock-option expenses in the first quarter of 2005. I.B.M. dropped 40 cents, to $83.17.

Nasdaq Application Approved
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (Reuters) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday approved the long-delayed application of the Nasdaq Stock Market to become a registered securities exchange.
 Under consideration for several years, the Nasdaq's application will be crucial to its gaining full independence from the regulatory organization NASD.
 ''The commission and its staff have worked with Nasdaq to facilitate this significant step,'' the S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Commercial Travelers Feel Less Gouged, But Some Other Kinds Of Tickets Cost More

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Clients of his educational software firm, the Critical Skills Group, reimburse him for his travel costs, but Charles C. Jett said it still offended him to be charged $1,900 to fly round trip to Los Angeles. ''I wouldn't charge anyone that,'' Mr. Jett said. 
 Increasingly, neither would airlines, which are becoming less inclined to try to charge very high fares, a trend that has pleased Mr. Jett. He paid just $400 recently to fly to and from San Francisco. ''The price was a lot lower than I thought it was going to be.''
Business travelers have long been irritated to know that the casually dressed person in the next seat -- a vacationer or a student headed back to college -- paid a lot less to be on the same flight. 
 A substantial gap still remains between business and leisure fares. But now, corporate travel officials say that some order has intruded on the black art of airline pricing. The average price of tickets is rising, if modestly, but most of the millions of fares that make up that average sell within a narrower price range than a year ago. The very highest business fares, bought at the last minute, have declined drastically. Many of the lowest leisure fares, bought far in advance, cost a bit more. Thus, the airline industry's price structure is beginning to look -- to business travelers, anyway -- a lot more reasonable, and fewer of them should feel gouged. ''In the last 12 to 18 months, I haven't been shocked by an abhorrent fare,'' said J. Robert Tillman, who frequently travels on short notice as an executive recruiter and partner at Blackbird Partners, based in Oak Brook, Ill.
 Indeed, the ratio of domestic business fares to leisure fares, tracked by Harrell Associates, an airline consulting firm in New York, has fallen to about four to one today from about six to one as recently as a year ago. Average one-way business fares fell to $400 from $600 and leisure fares held steady at about $100. 
 The expansion of low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines into more markets has forced traditional carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, to reduce fares, including those of business travelers. The Internet, which allows travelers to comparison shop far more effectively than in the past, helps, too. And financially desperate carriers, led by Delta Air Lines, abandoned past pricing models in hopes of avoiding collapse.
 Bob Harrell, principal in Harrell Associates, said domestic business fares fell about a third from their peak in 2000 and, despite recent increases, are still down 20 percent to 25 percent from the peak.
 For instance, one-way last-minute tickets on American Airlines from Boston to Dallas were 50 percent cheaper early last month than a year earlier, or $599 versus $1,193, Mr. Harrell said. United's one-way business fares from Chicago to Los Angeles fell 69 percent in that period, to $316 from $1,009. And Continental Airlines reduced its Houston-to-San Francisco one-way business fare 68 percent, to $319 from $999, according to Mr. Harrell.
 Over time, airline executives hope the new pricing will stimulate demand for travel and produce a more sustainable revenue base for an industry known for volatility. 
 The airlines, said Michael Allen, a managing director at Back Aviation Solutions, a consulting firm in New Haven, ''were offending the traveling public by having such high walk-up fares.'' His firm counts far fewer very high fares. The percentage of domestic city pairs -- heavily traveled routes, Dallas to New York, for instance, -- with average round-trip fares (including the cheapest and the most expensive seats) of more than $500 hit nearly 16 percent in 2000. But since then, it has plunged to less than 6 percent, according to Back Aviation.
 More people are able to travel at prices some regard as the reasonable middle range of fares -- $200 to $400 for a round-trip ticket. About half of domestic tickets were sold in that price range in the late 1990's, according to Back Aviation. Beginning in 2001, however, more seats fell into that middle range. And by the second quarter of 2005, more than 70 percent of tickets sold for $200 to $400, Mr. Allen said.
 After a sharp decline, fares on average began to rise again last May, according to figures compiled by the Air Transport Association, an airline industry trade group. Bankrupt airlines are now trimming the size of their fleets, reducing the number of seats for passengers, so domestic fares are expected to continue upward at least through the first half of 2006. At the same time, demand remains strong. So, unless fuel prices unexpectedly soar, industry results should strengthen in 2006. 
 A combination of fuller planes and higher fares, on average, pushed fourth-quarter 2005 airline industry revenue up about 11 percent, estimated David Strine, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Company. He expects 2006 revenue to rise about 6 percent. 
 The question now is whether airlines, as they have in the past, will try to take advantage of a favorable supply-and-demand situation by sharply raising prices for business travelers. ''Will it turn back up when the industry gets healthy, or are we in a new world now?'' said Steve Morrison, who, as a professor and chairman of the economics department at Northeastern University, follows the gap between business and leisure fares.
 Mr. Morrison said he thought the traditional carriers might at this point lack the market power to reinstate a system of significantly higher business fares. ''It sure seems like the low-fare carriers are sufficiently entrenched,'' he said. ''You would think it's a new world.'' 
 With stiff competition and the Internet making prices more transparent, Mr. Morrison said the gap between the highest and lowest prices should over time continue to narrow. 
 A gradual narrowing of the range of fares was already under way, but got a real jolt a year ago when Delta, looking for some strategy to become more competitive and avoid bankruptcy, simplified its fare structure and capped one-way fares at $499, later raised to $599. Reluctantly, most competitors in most markets followed suit, though they feared they would not attract enough additional business travelers to offset the lower prices. 
 Delta said the move was essentially neutral to its revenue. ''It came out to be almost a wash,'' said Glen W. Hauenstein, an executive vice president. But he hopes customers will feel better about pricing that seems less capricious than in the past. ''We're kind of considered untrustworthy in some respects,'' he said.
 Alaska Airlines, to make its pricing easier to understand, now presents fares on its Web site in a matrix that allows customers to easily compare the lowest and highest prices on a particular flight and the restrictions that go with each fare. Southwest does, too.
 US Airways, which operates the shuttles between New York and Boston and Washington that are used heavily by business travelers, has long charged a relatively high price. The former low price was $248 for a round-trip ticket, purchased 21 days in advance. The airline flew its planes on those routes nearly 45 percent empty, said Scott Kirby, an executive vice president.
 Last month, it began offering advance purchase fares as low as $138 round trip, hoping to fill some of those seats but not wanting business travelers to fly at the reduced rate. ''We sold a bunch,'' Mr. Kirby said. He is aiming to fly planes more than 70 percent full.
 While business fares are coming down, some leisure fares are rising. ''The absurdly low fares -- many of them are coming out of the system,'' Mr. Kirby said. Southwest's entrance into the Philadelphia market, where US Airways holds a large share, included some $29 one-way fares. ''They were introductory -- for a year and a half,'' Mr. Kirby said grimly. He said he was pleased that Southwest raised many of those fares to $49.
 But as Southwest and its low-cost competitors continue expanding, some fares that today seem very high will decline. ''We're the price policeman,'' said Keith Taylor, a Southwest vice president. ''We take that role very seriously.'' It charged as little as $49 one way between Dallas and St. Louis, recently entering that market, deeply undercutting American.
 Southwest, long before Delta's cap, had set a $299 maximum on a one-way ticket. ''They're setting the pricing ceiling in the industry,'' said Kevin Mitchell, who operates a group called the Business Travel Coalition that advocates on behalf of corporate travelers. ''They're brilliant people.''
 With the very high fares, airlines were discouraging last-minute business travel. ''The airlines can't measure the number of times I may have gone,'' Mr. Mitchell said.
 Tom McCabe, global director of travel services at PerkinElmer, a medical and industrial instruments maker based in Wellesley, Mass., said: ''The trip not taken: why worry about beating up the airline for a 10 percent or 15 percent discount? Why go at all?''

 After Delta capped one-way business fares at $599 in January 2005, many airlines followed suit, leaving the range of ticket prices narrower than it used to be.

HEADLINE: The Inflation Of Our Expectations 

BYLINE: By M.P. Dunleavey

 BODY:
WHILE economists continue fretting about inflation and the rising cost of living, I'd like to send up a small alert about another kind of inflation that's taking just as big a bite out of people's finances. 
 You won't see it released with other benchmark numbers, like the Consumer Price Index, but the steady inflation of people's lifestyle expectations is changing not only how people spend, but how much and why. 
Human beings seem to be hard-wired to want more. Research has found that no matter what people earn, they tend to estimate that the amount they really need to live on is just a bit beyond their means. 
 Consider the study Richard A. Easterlin, an economist at the University of Southern California, released in 2003. At one point, he analyzed a survey in which people were shown a list of items and asked to name the ones they felt were crucial to living a good life and disclose which of those items they already owned. He surveyed the same people some years later, and found that although most had acquired some of the original desired items, they now regarded others on the list as crucial. 
 You've probably experienced this phenomenon in your own life. In the last couple of years I've come to see my television as too small and my stereo as outdated. Never mind that they both work just fine, thanks. For some reason, that's no longer the point; the real issue is that like most Americans, my expectations for a basic lifestyle keep expanding.
 Witness the average size of a new single-family home. In the early 1970's it was 1,500 square feet. As of early 2005, the average new home had grown to 2,400 square feet -- and with it, people's expectations of how big a typical home should be, as well as which amenities should come with it, said Gopal Ahluwalia, vice president for research at the National Association of Home Builders.
 What was once considered upscale is the new normal for home buyers today, he said: from his and hers walk-in closets in the master bedroom to kitchen islands with cooktops to three-car garages. 
 This isn't because people have bigger families. In the last 35 years, Mr. Ahluwalia said, the average family size declined to 2.11 people from 3.58. 
 Nor do most Americans have significantly more money to spend, said Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell and a contributor to The New York Times. ''The top 1 percent of the rich have about three times the real purchasing power they did in the early 1970's, whereas there was only a slight gain of about 15 percent in the middle,'' he said, which adds up to very little in real new purchasing power for most Americans.
 GIVEN that your paycheck and mine may not be stretching as far as it once did, perhaps it's not too surprising that the savings rate has dropped. According to recent figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in fact, 2005 may go down as the first year since the Great Depression in which the personal savings rate in America dipped below zero.
 The way the government calculates the savings rate is a matter of some debate. But there's no question that the amount of disposable income that the average household has left over after taxes and paying bills -- not home equity, but the cash you can sock away for a rainy day or a leaky roof -- was closer to 10 percent a couple of decades ago. Now it's zip.
 I would argue that the depletion in people's cash reserves is not just a matter of earnings not keeping up with the cost of living, but of people being under far more pressure to spend.
 This isn't the age-old desire to keep up with the Joneses or whomever else you know who just bought that Bose speaker system for their iPod, which I want (just as soon as I get an iPod). It's what Mr. Frank calls the ''cascading wealth effect.'' 
 When people at the top of income distribution enjoy more luxuries, their increased standard of living cascades down and raises the bar for people below. That's why percale sheets and a drip Mr. Coffee maker were the norm for our parents -- and 250-thread-count sheets and a stainless steel Braun are what many people consider standard today. ''The norms in every category have become inflated,'' said Mr. Frank, who also wrote the book, ''Luxury Fever.'' 
 It's not that traditional inflation should be discounted, but people are under far more inflationary pressure than you ever hear from the Federal Reserve. I don't know that there's a simple solution, but if the government can try to control inflation for the sake of fiscal balance, maybe those of us hit with the Other Inflation can check our expectations from time to time, for our own financial well-being.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inflation Increases By Highest Amount Since '90 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Soaring energy prices pushed wholesale inflation up in 2005 by the highest amount since 1990, the government reported Friday. Another report said that retail sales rose 0.7 percent in December, with almost all of the strength coming from higher car sales. 
 The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose by a bigger-than-expected 0.9 percent in December, closing out a year when wholesale prices rose by 5.4 percent, the biggest advance since a 5.7 percent increase in 1990.
 However, core inflation, which excludes energy and food, was much smaller, rising 0.1 percent in December and just 1.7 percent for the entire year, lower than the 2.3 percent increase in core prices in 2004. 
 Energy prices shot up 3.1 percent as gasoline prices rose 12.3 percent last month. That was close to the 12.7 percent surge in September, when gasoline rose briefly above $3 a gallon as a result of widespread production shutdowns at Gulf Coast refineries. 
 While the tame core inflation number showed surging energy has not translated into higher overall prices, analysts said it would keep the Federal Reserve on guard and would probably translate into two more quarter-point rate increases at the Jan. 31 and March 28 meetings of the Fed policy panel. 
 ''This alerts us to the fact that we still have to deal with the issue of a possible spillover of high energy prices into core inflation,'' said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor. ''It hasn't happened yet, but there is a potential problem.'' 
 Analysts said that the weaker-than-expected increase in retail sales last month provided evidence that the economy was slowing, which should help damp future inflation. 
 Many economists say that overall growth in the final three months of 2005 probably slowed to a rate of 3 percent or less, compared with the 4.1 percent growth in the third quarter of last year, as debt-burdened consumers cut back on spending. 
 The 0.7 percent rise in retail sales in December followed a 0.8 percent November increase, but both months were heavily influenced by auto sales. 
 Outside of autos, December sales rose by just 0.2 percent. November sales fell by 0.4 percent when autos were excluded. 
 Sales were down by 0.3 percent at department and other general merchandise stores in December and were flat at specialty clothing stores. 
 Even electronics stores, which supposedly enjoyed a boom in sales of high-tech games and music players for Christmas, posted a drop of 0.1 percent last month. 
 Sales were up 2.6 percent at car dealerships after a 5.7 percent jump in November car sales. But automakers had to return to sales incentives to increase demand after big sales declines in the early fall. 
 Excluding both cars and gas station sales, which largely reflected higher prices, retail sales would have risen only 0.1 percent in December. 
 ''If you take out gas and cars, sales were basically flat,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York. ''Consumers are getting more cautious.''

HEADLINE: Tulane's Engineering Students Strive to Save Their School

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
In the early 1900's, the Sewerage and Water Board here hired a young student from Tulane University's School of Engineering to help deal with flooding and drainage, the city's most vexing problems.
 The student, Albert Baldwin Wood, designed a pumping system that not only drained areas that routinely flooded but also allowed the city to grow into a modern metropolis on what had been its swampy hinterlands. Four months ago, his pumps, some more than 90 years old, continued to churn water out of the city even as Hurricane Katrina knocked newer models out of service.
Given that legacy, engineering students at Tulane say, they are finding it hard to accept that the university, the city's premier academic institution, has chosen to eliminate majors in civil, environmental and electrical engineering, among others, as part of its own post-hurricane recovery plan. 
 They have reacted fiercely, undertaking a campaign on campus sidewalks, on the Internet, with elected officials and in the news media. Their rallying cry, as posted on trees in the University District, is, ''These majors are needed in New Orleans now more than ever in order to help rebuild the city.'' 
 And messages written in chalk on the campus's sidewalks read, ''We survived Katrina but not the administration,'' even as a banner in one of the main engineering buildings reads, ''Welcome Tulane Engineering Students: Tomorrow's Leaders!''
 ''We came back expecting to go headfirst into working with the city and the state to fix the levees, the transportation system and the power grid,'' said David O'Reilly, a first-year doctoral candidate in civil engineering. ''There has not been an opportunity like this in our generation to rebuild an American city on this magnitude.''
 Instead, Mr. O'Reilly is likely to be leaving his native New Orleans by the end of the semester to find a research program in another city.
 The School of Engineering is not the only part of the university to undergo changes in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which left floodwater over two-thirds of the campus and caused up to $250 million in property damage and more than $90 million in operational losses.
 Tulane also did away with its traditional undergraduate college system, Newcomb College for women and Tulane College for men, replacing it with one Undergraduate College. It eliminated its graduate school as an administrative entity, and an array of intercollegiate sports teams, as well as 230 full-time faculty members and 243 members of its staff, who were laid off. Those cuts included a sharp hit to the medical school faculty, which was reduced by 180 positions, to 345.
 But the students at the engineering school are among the most vocal, because they are losing six majors. Only two majors -- biomedical and chemical engineering -- will survive as part of a new School of Science and Engineering.
 Engineering students in the programs that are being eliminated will be allowed to graduate in their majors if they can complete their studies by next year. Still, some students feel jilted.
 ''No one saw this coming; no one expected it,'' said Justin Mikowski, a computer engineering major from Tampa, Fla., who is a leading force in the campaign to change the university's mind. ''We all thought engineering would be expanded with all the rebuilding that has to happen.''
 Scott S. Cowen, the university's president, who announced the changes on Dec. 8, defends the decision as thoughtful, necessary and final.
 ''I wish Katrina had never happened, and I wouldn't have to do any of these things -- I'm sympathetic,'' Dr. Cowen said. ''I admire their compassion and their enthusiasm to keep this going,'' he said of the students, ''but the board has already made its decisions, and they have been implemented. They will not be reversed.''
 Still, Dr. Cowen met with engineering alumni as recently as last week, and many last-ditch efforts to change his mind continue.
 ''New Orleans, as a city, owes its very life to the products of Tulane engineering and will not be able to rebuild without a strong engineering pool of knowledge at its base,'' said David A. Kanger, the president of the Society of Tulane Engineers.
 Others, like a former dean of the School of Engineering, William C. Van Buskirk, said Dr. Cowen had hurt the school's reputation and its students in claiming that the relatively small engineering school had not gained national prominence and that it was unlikely to do so without a significant investment of resources.
 Tulane has 900 undergraduate and graduate students in engineering.
 ''I think he really couched it wrong when he said these programs aren't strong enough to compete,'' Dr. Van Buskirk said. ''It's just nonsense.''
 He noted that Tulane's legacy did not end with Albert Wood and his pumps. A more recent graduate, David Filo, a co-founder of the Internet giant Yahoo, holds a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Tulane. And by other standards of success, the school also fared well, Dr. Van Buskirk said.
 ''It's more than a hundred years of tradition gone, and it's heartbreaking,'' he said.
 Robert S. Boh, the president of Boh Brothers Construction, one of the most significant local businesses in the reconstruction effort, and a member of the School of Engineering's advisory board, said, ''Tulane in engineering circles had a pretty good reputation to begin with, and seemed to be improving in every category that's important, so the timing of this is curious, really.''
 Despite his position on the advisory board, Mr. Boh said he had not been consulted about the recovery plan.
 Students said they were left to wonder how to market themselves to other universities and employers when their own university found its programs lacking. ''Our efforts are falling on deaf ears,'' said Will Clarkson, a computer engineering major from Canton, Ohio.
 Dr. Cowen said Tulane was offering $2,000 in assistance to freshmen who would like to visit other campuses in the hope of transferring.
 And Tulane will have a prominent role in the rebuilding effort, he said. The changes were intended in part to produce new areas of specialization for Tulane, including a partnership on urban issues with two of the city's historically black universities, Xavier and Dillard.
 Xavier and Dillard, along with the other well-known colleges in the city, the University of New Orleans and Loyola University, all suffered damage and have streamlined their operations for the spring semester. But, unlike Tulane, none have cut majors or sports, even though their endowments are smaller than that of Tulane.
 On that point, Dr. Cowen said Tulane had taken the lead in making unpopular but realistic and tough decisions.
 ''Hope is not a method,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Border Killing Inflames Mexican Anger at U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Guillermo Martinez could see the promised land of Southern California from the cramped three-bedroom house he shared here with his mother, his wife and two small children.
 The smooth, dry hills of San Diego County lay just beyond the slum where he lived, past the cinder block shacks, the garbage-strewn streets and rusted-out cars, past the corrugated steel fence that marks the border, and past the taller metal-columned fence put up in the 1990's to stop people like him from crossing.
It was in the no man's land between the fences that he was fatally shot by a United States border patrol agent just after dark on Dec. 30. His family says he was trying to get to Fresno, Calif., to take a job picking fruit. Investigators on each side, however, say he might have been trying to smuggle migrants across.
 ''My boy did nothing, nothing, nothing for them to shoot him,'' said his mother, Ofelia Rodriguez. ''He was trying to cross to take care of his children.'' 
 Whatever his reasons for sneaking over the border, the shooting of Mr. Martinez, 20, has fanned the flames of anger in Mexico over what many here see as an increasingly hard line in the United States against illegal immigrants. His death has become a rallying point for politicians of all stripes, who have condemned the shooting as a racist violation of human rights. 
 Mr. Martinez was killed two weeks after the House of Representatives passed a bill that, among other provisions, would build an additional 700 miles of tall double fences like the one here to stop illegal immigrants. 
 The proposed ''frontier wall,'' as the barrier is called here, and Mr. Martinez's death have become symbols of what many Mexicans see as the deteriorating relationship between the countries and a rising tide of xenophobia in the United States. 
 The wall has prompted street protests in the capital and howls of criticism from Mexican politicians and editorialists, many of whom have likened the proposal to the Berlin Wall. Two Catholic bishops, in a statement, called the proposal ''absurd, shameful and intolerable'' and ''an aspirin against cancer.''
 President Vicente Fox has called the wall ''a disgrace,'' and a ''very bad sign'' that ''does not befit a country that prides itself on being democratic.'' He took the unusual step of ordering his government to investigate the Martinez shooting and sent a diplomatic note to Washington demanding a full investigation.
 Human rights advocates say that, in addition to Mr. Martinez, at least four migrants have died in the last 15 months in run-ins with Border Patrol agents. One man was fatally shot Oct. 4 near Otay Mesa as he struggled over a gun with an agent who was trying to arrest him. Three others drowned running away from the Border Patrol agents.
 In a sign of increasing tensions, it has become more common in the past year for migrants to throw rocks at the agents trying to corral them. In the last two weeks, United States border patrol agents have come under fire twice near the Veterans International Bridge over the Rio Grande between Matamoros and Brownsville, Tex. No one was injured.
 The outrage in Mexico over the House bill and the shooting death reflects a difference in how people on each side view the border. Conservatives in the United States see the 2,000-mile long frontier as a security problem, a leaky sieve through which all manner of evils can pass: drug smugglers, petty criminals and, possibly, terrorists. 
 ''It's a national security issue,'' said Representative Duncan Hunter, a San Diego Republican who sponsored the fence amendment. ''The world understands that if you want to get into this country illegally, you come across the land border with Mexico. You have to know who's coming into the country.''
 Other supporters of the measure say more fences are needed near urban areas to prevent crime and because Mexican law enforcement does nothing to stop people from crossing illegally. The fence in San Diego, a 14-mile pilot project started in 1994, has substantially reduced not only the smuggling of people and drugs, but crime in general in that region, its supporters say. 
 ''Mexico has not been serious about helping us control our border,'' said Representative Dan Lungren, a Republican from Long Beach, Calif., who supports the fences. ''So this griping about what we are doing seems to be a little fatuous.''
 Not everyone in the United States supports building fences. Big-city Democrats, Catholic leaders, advocates for immigrants and civil-rights groups have all criticized the idea. Even some Republicans with large Hispanic constituencies, among them Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, oppose it. Mr. Perry said recently that more fences would not be as effective as increased spending for law enforcement agencies on the border.
 Mexicans, rich and poor, see a relatively porous border as an essential part of their economy. It is lost on no one in power here that migration relieves Mexico of hundreds of thousands of its poor and unemployed every year, while bringing in more income. Migrants send about $20 billion a year home to relatives. 
 At the same time, the view is widely held in Mexico that the United States could not function without cheap Mexican labor, and that efforts to more tightly regulate the flow of migrants are hypocritical and racist. Mexican politicians regularly depict the migrants as heroes, people seeking a better life and braving terrible conditions to get it. 
 The frustration is also compounded by the failure of the Bush administration to push through a guest worker bill that would, in essence, legalize the status of millions of illegal Mexicans immigrants working in the United States. On Wednesday, President Bush expressed support for the fence, saying it would slow the flow of migrants and illegal drugs.
 The Fox administration has argued that a guest worker law would do more to regulate the flow of immigrants than building more walls.
 Mr. Martinez was typical of many of the 1.2 million migrants the Border Patrol intercepts every year -- poor, with no job prospects. His mother had 18 children, 9 of whom died as infants. Of the surviving children, he was the youngest.
 His father died when he was a baby. Like his siblings, he never got more than a sixth-grade education. He married at 17 and had two children before he was 20. 
 Three years ago, he moved with his mother and children to Tijuana, where he made a living washing cars and doing small construction jobs, his family said. He also tried to enter the United States to find work.
 Border Patrol officials have said that Mr. Martinez may have also worked as a pollero, someone immigrants paid to guide them across the border. He was arrested and deported at least 12 times trying to cross the border, though he was never charged with smuggling, they said. 
 His brother Agustin Martinez, 33, was convicted of smuggling migrants in the United States and served time, authorities said. In an interview, Agustin said he was with Guillermo at the time of the shooting, but denied they were guiding others.
 He said at least three agents spotted them about 7:30 p.m. as they tried to cross the border. One fired a shot at the brothers as they ran away. The shot hit Guillermo Martinez in the back and left his body through his chest. He died the next day at Cruz Roja Hospital in Tijuana.
 Lt. Kevin Rooney, a homicide investigator in the San Diego Police Department, has pieced together a different account from interviews with the agent and other sources. He said one agent, who has been identified as Fausto Campos, was guarding a post along the second fence when he received a report of people crossing about 100yards to the east.
 When he arrived there in his car, he saw a man with a ladder in the zone between the fences, Lieutenant Rooney said. The agent, who had been on the force eight years, opened a gate, drove his car through, then spotted the man running toward the open gate. The agent jumped out to cut the man off. 
 The man scooped rocks from the ground and threw them, Lieutenant Rooney said. As a rock passed his head, the agent fired his pistol once at the man, who grabbed his arm, turned and sprinted out of sight along the first fence. 
 ''It is a one-on-one confrontation,'' Lieutenant Rooney said.

PERSON: ANDREW S. NATSIOS 

HEADLINE: Planning to Fight Poverty From Outside the System

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ANDREW S. NATSIOS has just finished almost five years as administrator of the main United States foreign aid agency, and he is going out swinging.
 Unusually for a departing political appointee in the Bush administration, Mr. Natsios, 56, has provided an insider's view of the way America deploys its billions of dollars in foreign aid, and he seems determined to make it plain that the system is deeply flawed.
In recent public remarks, he has described it as ''constipated,'' splintered among too many federal agencies and tied in knots by hundreds of Congressional directives and special budget measures. He seems especially galled that policy is overly driven by domestic interest groups, including major charities, that get a large chunk of his agency's annual $14 billion budget.
 ''That's one of the greatest frustrations of the last five years, to see this stuff,'' he said at a recent forum in Washington. ''It's just -- it's intolerable.'' 
 Fans and detractors admire Mr. Natsios's straight talk, even if it is sometimes counterproductive. But such comments -- combative, impolitic, impassioned -- are characteristic of a man who took on unpopular battles, inside and outside the Bush administration, as he tried to restore the standing of the United States Agency for International Development, whose clout had declined steadily. 
 Mr. Natsios came by his own enthusiasm for foreign aid serendipitously. As a young Republican legislator in Massachusetts, he was a loyal supporter of the first President Bush. When Mr. Bush won in 1988, Mr. Natsios got his first job in Washington, as director of the Office of Disaster Assistance in A.I.D. He had no particular views on foreign aid at the time and did not even want the job, he said.
 But soon after, he flew to Africa and witnessed the horror of starvation in Sudan and Mozambique. ''I saw all these people dying, and America feeding them,'' he said. ''That experience was life-changing for me.''
 Suddenly, stories from his childhood resonated. A great-uncle had perished in a famine in Greece during the Nazi occupation. He remembered going to Greece as a boy and seeing rural deprivation firsthand. 
 Then he returned a generation later with his wife and three children to visit the family village, and found that tractors had replaced donkeys, prosperity had overtaken poverty.
 ''Development works,'' he said fervently. ''Poverty is not permanent.'' 
 AMERICAN politicians have often not shared his faith. The United States gives relatively less than most major powers to foreign assistance, though Mr. Natsios says the current President Bush has done more to increase foreign aid than any president since John F. Kennedy, who established A.I.D. in 1961.
 But in the past quarter-century, the agency has lost too much of its best talent, Mr. Natsios said. The agency itself was so beaten up when he took over in 2001, he said, that it was ''almost like an abused child.'' 
 He takes pride in its achievements -- helping rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq, assisting victims of famine and natural disasters, building new collaborations with corporations and foundations to fight poverty. 
 Mr. Natsios said he now believes he can have more influence from outside government on the intensifying debate about how to make foreign aid more effective. It is a matter, he says, not just of reducing poverty but also of restoring stability to conflict-ridden countries where chaos can threaten America's security. 
 ''I've done what I can do within the constraints of the position,'' he said, when asked in an interview at his office why he had chosen to give up a job he had intended to keep through President Bush's second term. 
 Mr. Natsios traced the fragmentation of authority over foreign aid to the Clinton years, but in the interview he did not raise the fact that President Bush had contributed to it. 
 Mr. Bush's two most far-reaching foreign aid undertakings have been a $15 billion program to treat people with AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean, and the multibillion-dollar Millennium Challenge Corporation, which provides big grants to poor but relatively well-governed countries. 
 Both were established independent of A.I.D., long perceived in Washington as an ineffective bureaucracy. When asked, Mr. Natsios did not hide his disappointment. 
 He recalled a pivotal meeting on the blueprint for the AIDS program. A plan that largely sidelined his agency was presented to him at the last minute, he said, and he spoke out against it. 
 President Bush was not happy.
 ''He stormed out of the room and he yelled at the staff,'' Mr. Natsios recalled. ''He said, 'Don't come in here and tell me that A.I.D. has agreed to this when they haven't.' He ended the meeting. You know what it was? Certain people involved in this intrigue in the White House didn't believe I would actually say anything because the vice president was sitting in the room, the chief of staff was sitting in the room.''
 The AIDS program wound up being run by Randall L. Tobias, a retired pharmaceutical executive who was given the rank of ambassador and reported to Colin L. Powell, then the secretary of state. Mr. Powell said in an interview that while Mr. Natsios might have wanted the program to stay in his own agency, he was a team player once the decision was made.
 ''We wanted it to be a special program of the State Department,'' Mr. Powell said. ''Randy worked for me.''
 Patrick Cronin, who was then a senior official at the agency, said the meeting with the president damaged Mr. Natsios within the administration -- a view Mr. Natsios disputed. ''You have to make trade-offs and compromises, and Andrew often refused to do that,'' Mr. Cronin said. 
 Mr. Powell said he believed that Mr. Natsios, who is to be a professor at the Georgetown University school of foreign service, was leaving an improved agency. And Mr. Natsios pointed to the doubling of the budget during his term and recent presidential programs -- on malaria, bird flu and tsunami relief -- that have gone to A.I.D. as evidence of the changed perception of the agency's competence.
 HIS last big fight was on food aid. He persuaded the administration to propose last year that the government be allowed to buy some food for starving Africans in Africa, rather than ship almost all of it from the United States at huge expense.
 But a so-called Iron Triangle of interests with deep financial stakes in the status quo -- agribusiness, shipping and nonprofit groups -- squashed it in Congress. 
 At a Center for Global Development forum in Washington one snowy morning in December, Mr. Natsios, with the main lobbyist of the big charitable groups in the audience, suggested almost gleefully that he would not let the proposal die. 
 ''We can do this cooperatively, thoughtfully and intelligently, or we can have a big fight,'' he said in sprightly tones that suggested he would relish nothing more than a good old-fashioned political brawl.
 ''Thank you, Andrew, that was perfectly clear,'' the moderator said dryly, as the inside-the-Beltway crowd broke into laughter.

HEADLINE: Race for Majority Leader Draws a Third Candidate

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Representative John Shadegg of Arizona made a late entry into the race for House Republican leader on Friday, suggesting that his two rivals did not represent a ''clean break from the scandals of the recent past.''
 Mr. Shadegg joined Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, and Roy Blunt of Missouri, the acting majority leader, in the race to assume the post vacated by Representative Tom DeLay of Texas. 
''Members of our Republican conference disagree about policy and tactics, but we stand together in our respect for this institution, our hatred of corruption and our support for the basic principles of our party,'' Mr. Shadegg said in a letter to fellow Republicans.
 He starts out far behind his rivals in rounding up firm commitments for an election among House Republicans now set for Feb. 2, but he holds the potential to shake up the base of support for both men and deny either a decisive first-ballot majority.
 Mr. Boehner, who trails Mr. Blunt in the number of representatives who have publicly pledged their support, could benefit from another candidacy if it sparks defections from Mr. Blunt's camp, so he welcomed Mr. Shadegg's entry.
 ''His entry into the majority leader race is further proof that the conference isn't happy with the status quo,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement.
 Aides to Mr. Blunt said he and Mr. Shadegg had a good relationship from working together in the leadership, where Mr. Shadegg held the position of policy chairman. But they said Mr. Blunt did not expect to lose any of his more than 100 committed supporters as the result of Mr. Shadegg's announcement. A total of 116 votes is needed to win.
 Mr. Shadegg, who was first elected in the 1994 elections that swept Republicans into control of the House, will try to draw on his base of support among fellow fiscal conservatives. He quickly won the endorsement of the Club for Growth, an advocacy group that works to lower federal spending.
 ''There is no member of the House of Representatives more committed to the idea of limited government and economic freedom than John Shadegg,'' said the Club for Growth president, Pat Toomey.
 Mr. Shadegg will also try to position himself as the more fresh-faced alternative to Representatives Boehner and Blunt. Both have come under scrutiny for having extensive ties to the lobbying community similar to those of Mr. DeLay, who was the architect of the Republican push to foster party links to K Street and was a close ally of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who recently pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges. 
 On Friday, the watchdog group Public Citizen issued a report detailing Mr. Blunt's fund-raising ties to lobbyists, his subsidized travel aboard corporate aircraft and the move of former aides from his office to the employ of major contributors.
 ''Electing Representative Blunt means choosing more of the same corruption plaguing the system now,'' said Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen.
 Mr. Blunt's office shrugged off the accusation as partisan.
 ''Joan Claybrook, former Carter administration official, vocal supporter and financial contributor to John Kerry's presidential campaign, will have zero impact on who House Republicans choose to be their leader,'' said Jessica Boulanger, a spokeswoman for Mr. Blunt.
 Mr. Blunt continued to gain support as seven Texas Republicans lined up behind him after a conference call with the leadership contenders arranged by Representative Joe Barton, the Texan who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Barton backed Mr. Blunt along with six others who had not previously made known their preference.
 In a rebuke aimed at Mr. Blunt, Mr. Shadegg said he would give up his leadership post, the fifth-ranking party slot, to seek the higher position. 
 Under the current plan, Mr. Blunt, who is the elected party whip, would retain that job should he lose the majority leader's race. Many House Republicans say they consider that unacceptable and that the party should also elect a new whip and potentially review all the leadership slots. 
 Four lawmakers are vying for majority whip, a position that would now become open only if Mr. Blunt prevailed in the majority leader's race. Mr. Shadegg's resignation will open the position of policy chairman, potentially sparking a campaign for that office.
 ''I personally believe it is not appropriate to try to retain one position in our elected leadership while running for another,'' Mr. Shadegg said in a statement.
 With relationships with lobbyists and the call for an overhaul in lobbying rules dominating the public campaigning for the party contest, Mr. Shadegg endorsed changes limiting the ability of lawmakers to insert pet projects in spending bills. He also renewed his push to deny Congressional pensions to lawmakers convicted of taking bribes.
 Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt have proposed their own changes in lobbying rules.

HEADLINE: The Bidding Keeps Going and Going and Going

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
IT was like a TV Land rerun marathon this week, with Boston Scientific topping Johnson & Johnson's bid for Guidant, the Dow eclipsing 11,000, General Motors scrambling to regain market share and Apple Computer being hailed as a blisteringly hot tech stock. There was even another sex-discrimination suit on Wall Street.
 Some things were new, however. China surpassed some Western industrial powerhouses with the size of its economy, and its global trade surplus set a record.

FIGHT TO THE START -- It is a strange kind of bidding war when a last-minute offer from the underdog is about the same as the opening bid made by the heavily favored industry giant. But that is the case in the battle for Guidant, a maker of implantable heart devices.
Boston Scientific, which primarily makes small devices called stents that prop open clogged arteries, agreed late Thursday to pay about $25 billion for Guidant, about a dollar a share more than its initial offer. Boston Scientific's increased bid was in response to Johnson & Johnson's decision to raise its offer to $23.2 billion, from an earlier $21.5 billion. 
 Johnson & Johnson had initially agreed to pay $25.4 billion, but scaled back its bid when Guidant had to recall some defective pacemakers and implantable defibrillators. When the reduced offer was made public, Boston Scientific, which is a rival to Johnson & Johnson in the stent market, made its own bid for Guidant.
 Yesterday, Guidant accepted Johnson & Johnson's revised offer of $24.2 billion, $1 billion more than was on the table Wednesday.
 Guidant has scheduled a shareholder meeting to vote on a takeover on Jan. 31 at its headquarters in Indianapolis.

UP, UP AND AWAY -- Buoyed by expectations of stable interest rates and a fresh inflow of 401(k) and other retirement investments in the new year, the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average zoomed above 11,000 for the first time in more than four years. More remarkably, it stayed there for several days.
 Resurgent energy prices and renewed doubts about some blue-chip members of the index, particularly General Motors, which said it would sharply reduce its prices again, and DuPont, which said its earnings would be hurt more than expected by hurricane damage, pulled in the reins on the rally.
 The Dow is still several hundred points shy of its record of 11,722.98, which it achieved as the dot-com and telecom bubble was peaking in January 2000. But it is much further from its post-bubble nadir of 7,286.27 in October 2002. It closed yesterday at 10,959.87.
 Potentially market-moving earnings announcements are due next week from big financial services companies, including American Express, Bank of America and Citigroup, as well as major manufacturers, including General Electric and Johnson & Johnson.

FORWARD IN REVERSE -- Faced with shrinking market share even after offering some of the most generous discounts and rebates in its history, General Motors said it would try plain old price-cutting to increase sales and persuade buyers to once again take sticker prices seriously.
 G.M., still the world's biggest carmaker, reduced prices on 57 of the 76 models it sells in North America by an average of about $1,300. Some of the cuts will be as much as $2,500, but that is still less than the roughly $4,000 worth of no-interest loans, rebates and other incentives it offered to buyers last year.
 All Chevrolet, Buick and GMC cars and trucks and most Pontiacs were reduced. Saab, Saturn and Hummer vehicles were not affected.
 G.M. is scheduled to release its full-year results for 2005 on Jan. 26. Analysts forecast the company will say it lost $5 billion last year while sales fell 5 percent.

APPLAUD THE POD -- Apple said it sold 14 million of its iPod portable music players in the last quarter of 2005, more than three times the number it sold during the period a year earlier. Apple's revenue over those three months soared 63 percent, to $5.7 billion.
 Even more encouraging for the company, Apple sold 1.25 million Macintosh computers in the quarter, up from 1.05 million in 2004, despite the worries of some analysts that consumers would delay buying Macs until after Apple switched to new microprocessors made by Intel. 
 Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, unveiled a new Intel-based iMac computer at Macworld Expo, the company's annual trade show. It is in stores now, while an Intel-powered laptop, the MacBook Pro, is scheduled to go on sale next month.
 Mr. Jobs said all new Macintosh computers would have Intel chips by the end of this year. Analysts said that could help Apple take market share from Windows-based personal computers. 

BIG AND GETTING BIGGER -- China's economy surpassed those of France and Italy, and now rivals Britain's as the fourth largest in the world, statistics show. At the same time, China's trade surplus tripled in 2005, to a record $102 billion.
 China's trade surplus with the United States also reached a record last year, climbing 43 percent, to $114.7 billion. Without that, China would have had a trade deficit of about $12 billion last year, largely because of oil imports.
 A surge in civilian aircraft exports, which rose 27.4 percent, to $3.2 billion, in November, helped to narrow the United States' overall trade deficit in November, though the gap remained far larger than in any month before 2005.
 China may soon have more foreign currency reserves than any other country, giving it more power to influence global interest rates. As of November, it reported having about $794 billion, behind only Japan, which had about $828 billion at the end of last year.

FAMILIAR COMPLAINT -- Some industries never learn. Over the last few years, Wall Street firms have paid more than a quarter of a billion dollars to settle sex-discrimination suits filed by some of their women executives, but problems apparently persist.
 Six senior bankers at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein sued the investment bank this week, contending that they were denied equal bonuses and promotions that went to men with less experience. The plaintiffs -- three directors and three vice presidents, all women and all still working at the bank -- also cited instances of lewd behavior and reduced opportunities for women returning from maternity leaves. 
 The bank said it intended to fight the lawsuit, adding that it fully complies with applicable employment-related laws and that all claims to the contrary are without merit.

HEADLINE: In Uruguay, a Pearl of the Atlantic Gets Its Luster Back

BYLINE: By GISELA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IN the last few years, a number of St. Barts's habitues -- along with other members of the bold-face crowd -- have begun to drift southward to Punta del Este, the South American resort town. Set on a peninsula in the southeast corner of Uruguay between the Atlantic and the Rio de la Plata, Punta has served for decades as the Hamptons of Latin America, a January and February playground for a glittery mix of international personalities, beautiful people and wealthy South Americans. 
 Models like Naomi Campbell and Gisele Bundchen are Punta regulars, as is the fashion photographer Mario Testino, while the author Martin Amis and the hotelier Alan Faena own houses nearby.
Once the playground for 1960's film icons like Gina Lollabrigida and Yul Brynner, Punta -- known as the Pearl of the Atlantic -- fell out of favor in the 90's with the development of one too many high-rises and the economic breakdown of nearby Argentina, but celebrities are now back in full force. ''In the last three years Americans and Europeans have been discovering Punta,'' said Mr. Faena, the owner of the much-publicized Faena Hotel + Universe in Buenos Aires. ''It's a special place with kilometers and kilometers of beach and a really interesting mix of people, from New York socialites to Brazilian models to musicians.''
 He should know. Mr. Faena has been a regular on the Punta scene for the last 15 years, and his spacious estancia on the ocean is near Jose Ignacio, about 25 miles north of Punta and the secret epicenter of its bohemian jet set. The newest addition to Jose Ingacio, scheduled to open late this year, is the Setai Club -- sister property to the Miami Beach hotel of the same name whose club members, including Lenny Kravitz and Heidi Klum, reportedly pay an initial membership fee of $300,000 and $7,800 a year in dues. 
 Michael Breene, a co-owner of the Setai, said of Jose Ignacio, ''It's one of the most pristine places I've been to. I imagine it's what Montauk was like 30 years ago: rural countryside meets the ocean. There's laid-back dining, great weather and a surfing element as well.'' Mr. Breene said the new Setai would be intimate and environmentally minded, (think exclusive thatched roofed bungalows) with a small spa.
 Until the Setai opens, visitors might want to stay at the 12-room Posada del Faro, in Jose Ignacio (598-486) 2110, www.posadadelfaro.com, with rooms from $150. Another good option, in Punta del Este is the 28-room Hotel-Art las Cumbres, (598-42) 578689, www.cumbres.com.uy, with rooms from $120.
 For dinner, both Mr. Faena and Mr. Breene favor La Huella, (598-486) 2279, www.paradorlahuella.com, a rustic beachside spot in Jose Ignacio that serves grilled fish and sushi. But the ultimate insider spot is Marismo, a restaurant in Jose Ignacio that, according to Mr. Faena, ''only people with good directions know how to find.'' O.K., here's the phone number: (598-486) 2273.

HEADLINE: What Is a Living Wage?

BYLINE: By Jon Gertner. 
Jon Gertner is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
If It Happened in Baltimore, Maybe It Can Happen Anywhere
 For a few weeks in the summer of 1995, Jen Kern spent her days at a table in the Library of Congress in Washington, poring over the fine print of state constitutions from around the country. This was, at the time, a somewhat-eccentric strategy to fight poverty in America. Kern was not a high-powered lawyer or politician; she was 25 and held a low-paying, policy-related job at Acorn, the national community organization. Yet to understand why living-wage campaigns matter -- where they began, what they mean and why they inspire such passion and hope -- it helps to consider what Kern was doing years ago in the library, reading obscure legislation from states like Missouri and New Mexico. 
A few months earlier, she and her colleagues at Acorn witnessed an energetic grass-roots campaign in Baltimore, led by a coalition of church groups and labor unions. Workers in some of Baltimore's homeless shelters and soup kitchens had noticed something new and troubling about many of the visitors coming in for meals and shelter: they happened to have full-time jobs. In response, local religious leaders successfully persuaded the City Council to raise the base pay for city contract workers to $6.10 an hour from $4.25, the federal minimum at the time. The Baltimore campaign was ostensibly about money. But to those who thought about it more deeply, it was about the force of particular moral propositions: first, that work should be rewarded, and second, that no one who works full time should have to live in poverty.
 So Kern and another colleague were dispatched to find out if what happened in Baltimore could be tried -- and expanded -- elsewhere. As she plowed through documents, Kern was unsure whether to look for a particular law or the absence of one. Really, what she was trying to do was compile a list of places in the U.S. where citizens or officials could legally mount campaigns to raise the minimum wage above the federal standard. In other words, she needed to know if anything stood in the way, like a state regulation or a court decision. What she discovered was that in many states a law more ambitious than Baltimore's -- one that didn't apply to only city contractors but to all local businesses -- seemed permissible.
 Whether a wage campaign was winnable turned out to be a more complicated matter. In the late 90's, Kern helped Acorn in a series of attempts to raise the minimum wage in Denver and Houston, as well as the state of Missouri. They all failed. ''It wasn't even close,'' she says. In the past few years, though, as the federal minimum wage has remained fixed at $5.15 and the cost of living (specifically housing) has risen drastically in many regions, similar campaigns have produced so many victories (currently, 134) that Kern speaks collectively of ''a widespread living-wage movement.''
 Santa Fe has been one of the movement's crowning achievements. This month the city's minimum wage rose to $9.50 an hour, the highest rate in the United States. But other recent victories include San Francisco in 2003 and Nevada in 2004. And if a pending bill in Chicago is any indication, the battles over wage laws will soon evolve into campaigns to force large, private-sector businesses like Wal-Mart to provide not only higher wages but also more money for employee health care.
 It is a common sentiment that economic fairness -- or economic justice, as living-wage advocates phrase it -- should, or must, come in a sweeping and righteous gesture from the top. From Washington, that is. But most wage campaigns arise from the bottom, from residents and low-level officials and from cities and states -- from everywhere except the federal government. ''I think what the living-wage movement has done in the past 11 years is incredible,'' David Neumark, a frequent critic of the phenomenon who is a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, told me recently. ''How many other issues are there where progressives have been this successful? I can't think of one.''
 The immediate goal for living-wage strategists is to put initiatives on the ballots in several swing states this year. If their reckoning is correct, the laws should effect a financial gain for low-income workers and boost turnout for candidates who campaign for higher wages. In Florida, a ballot initiative to raise the state's minimum wage by a dollar, to $6.15, won 71 percent of the vote in 2004, a blowout that surprised even people like Kern, who spent several weeks in Miami working on the measure. ''We would like it to become a fact of political life,'' Kern says, ''where every year the other side has to contend with a minimum-wage law in some state.'' Though victories like the one in Florida may have done little to help the Kerry-Edwards ticket -- George Bush won 52 percent of the state's vote -- Kern and some in the Democratic establishment have come to believe that the left, after years of electoral frustration, has finally found its ultimate moral-values issue. ''This is what moves people to the polls now,'' Kern insists. ''This is our gay marriage.'' Already, during the past few months, a coalition of grass-roots and labor organizations has begun gathering hundreds of thousands of signatures to ensure that proposed laws to increase wages are voted on in November. The first targets, Kern told me, will be Arizona, Colorado, Michigan and Ohio. Next in line, either this year or soon after, are Montana, Oklahoma and Arkansas, the home of Wal-Mart.

Does America Care About the Gap Between Rich and Poor?
 I first met Kern on a sunny morning in late September in Albuquerque, a city of 470,000 that made her list when she was working in the Library of Congress 10 years ago. She was now, at age 35, campaigning for a ballot initiative that would raise the minimum wage in the city to $7.50 an hour from $5.15. There was no face for the placards, no charismatic presence to rally the troops at midnight or to shake hands at dawn outside 7-Eleven. Instead, there was a number, $7.50, a troop of campaign workers to canvass the neighborhoods and an argument: that many low-wage workers were being paid poverty wages. That a full-time job at the federal minimum rate added up to $10,712 a year. That local businesses could afford the pay raise. And that it was up to the voters to restore balance. 
 One of the more intriguing questions about campaigns like the one in Albuquerque, and those planned for swing states next fall, is whether they reflect a profound sense of public alarm about the divergence between rich and poor in this country. Certainly most Americans do not support higher wages out of immediate self-interest. Probably only around 3 percent of those in the work force are actually paid $5.15 or less an hour; most low-wage workers, including Wal-Mart employees, who generally start at between $6.50 and $7.50 an hour, earn more. Increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour (as proposed by Senate Democrats) would directly affect the wages of only about 7 percent of the work force. Nevertheless, pollsters have discovered that a hypothetical state ballot measure typically generates support of around 70 percent. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center actually put the support for raising the national minimum wage to $6.45 at 86 percent. Rick Berman, a lobbyist who started the Employment Policies Institute and who is a longtime foe of living-wage laws, agrees that ''the natural tendency is for people to support these things. They believe it's a free lunch.'' On the other hand, the electorate's reasons for crossing party lines to endorse the measures may be due to the simple fact that at least 60 percent of Americans have at one time or another been paid the minimum wage. Voters may just know precisely what they're voting for and why.
 In the mid-1990's, the last time Congress raised the minimum wage, the Clinton White House was reluctant to start a war over the federal rate, according to Robert Reich, the former labor secretary. For an administration bent on policy innovation, that would have seemed ''old'' Democrat. ''Then we did some polling and discovered that the public is overwhelmingly in favor,'' Reich told me recently. ''At which point the White House gave the green light to Democrats in Congress.'' Reich, now a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, happens to view the minimum wage as a somewhat inefficient tool for alleviating poverty (compared with earned income tax credits, say). But he acknowledges that it has a powerful moral and political impact, in states red as well as blue, and especially now, in an era when workers see the social contract with their employers vanishing. ''They see neighbors and friends being fired for no reason by profitable companies, executives making off like bandits while thousands of their own workers are being laid off,'' Reich says. ''They see health insurance drying up, employer pensions shrinking. Promises to retirees of health benefits are simply thrown overboard. The whole system has aspects that seem grossly immoral to average working people.'' As Reich points out, whatever the minimum wage's limitations may be as a policy instrument, as an idea, ''it demarcates our concept of decency with regard to work.''
 The idea, Reich points out, isn't new, even if the recent fervor for it is. Massachusetts enacted a state minimum wage in 1912, several decades before the federal minimum wage of 25 cents an hour was adopted in 1938. And most of the wage ordinances of the past decade specifically trace their origins back to Baltimore in 1995. After that moment, in fact, the phrase ''living wage'' soon caught on -- or, you might say, returned. It was a popular workers' refrain in the late 19th century and was the title of a 1906 book by John Ryan, a Roman Catholic priest. In the late 1990's, a loose national network of advocates sprang up, incorporating organized labor, grass-roots groups like Acorn and the Industrial Areas Foundation and, more recently, the National Council of Churches. Legal advice often came out of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school, where a lawyer named Paul Sonn helped write wage ordinances and ballot measures for various states and cities. 
 By dint of its piecemeal, localized progress, the modern living-wage movement has grown without fanfare; one reason is that until recently, most of the past decade's wage laws, like Baltimore's, have been narrow in scope and modest in effect. Strictly speaking, a ''living wage'' law has typically required that any company receiving city contracts, and thus taxpayers' money, must pay its workers a wage far above the federal minimum, usually between $9 and $11 an hour. These regulations often apply to employees at companies to which municipalities have outsourced tasks like garbage collection, security services and home health care. Low-wage workers in the private sector -- in restaurants, hotels, retail stores or the like -- have been unaffected. Their pay stays the same.
 In Santa Fe, the City Council passed a similar kind of wage law in 2002, raising the hourly pay for city employees and contractors. Some officials in Santa Fe, however, had decided from the start that its wage rules should ultimately be different -- that the small city (population 66,000) could even serve as a test example for the rest of the U.S. Early on, several city councilors told me, they anticipated that Santa Fe -- with a high cost of living, a large community of low-paid immigrants and a liberal City Council -- would eventually extend its wage floor to all local businesses, private as well as public, so that every worker in the city, no matter the industry, would make more than $5.15. The initial numbers that the councilors considered as they began to strategize seemed stratospheric: a living wage that began at $10 or $12 or even $14.50 an hour. For some laborers, that could double their incomes. Nothing remotely like it existed in any other city in the country.

The Economists Are Surprised
 In the years before the enactment of the federal minimum wage in the late 1930's, the country's post-Depression economy was so weak that the notion that government should leave private business to its own devices was effectively marginalized. During the past few decades, though, in the wake of a fairly robust economy, debates on raising the minimum wage have consistently resulted in a rhetorical caterwaul. While the arguments have usually been between those on the labor side, who think that the minimum wage should be raised substantially, and those on the employer side, who oppose any increase, a smaller but vocal contingent has claimed, more broadly and more philosophically, that it is in the best interest of both business and labor to let the market set wages, not the politicians. And certainly not the voters.
 This last position was long underpinned by the academic consensus that a rise in the minimum wage hurts employment by interfering with the flow of supply and demand. In simplest terms, most economists accepted that when government forces businesses to pay higher wages, businesses, in turn, hire fewer employees. It is a powerful argument against the minimum wage, since it suggests that private businesses as a group, along with teenagers and low-wage employees, will be penalized by a mandatory raise.
 The tenor of this debate began to change in the mid-1990's following some work done by two Princeton economists, David Card (now at the University of California, Berkeley) and Alan B. Krueger. In 1992, New Jersey increased the state minimum wage to $5.05 an hour (applicable to both the public and the private sectors), which gave the two young professors an opportunity to study the comparative effects of that raise on fast-food restaurants and low-wage employment in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage remained at the federal level of $4.25 an hour. Card and Krueger agreed that the hypothesis that a rise in wages would destroy jobs was ''one of the clearest and most widely appreciated in the field of economics.'' Both told me they believed, at the start, that their work would reinforce that hypothesis. But in 1995, and again in 2000, the two academics effectively shredded the conventional wisdom. Their data demonstrated that a modest increase in wages did not appear to cause any significant harm to employment; in some cases, a rise in the minimum wage even resulted in a slight increase in employment.
 Card and Krueger's conclusions have not necessarily made philosophical converts of Congress or the current administration. Attempts to raise the federal minimum wage -- led by Senators Edward M. Kennedy on the left and Rick Santorum on the right -- have made little headway over the past few years. And the White House went so far as to temporarily suspend the obligation of businesses with U.S. government construction contracts to pay so-called prevailing wages (that is, whatever is paid to a majority of workers in an industry in a particular area) during the rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. David Card, who seems nothing short of disgusted by the ideological nature of the debates over the wage issue, says he feels that opinions on the minimum wage are so politically entrenched that even the most scientific studies can't change anyone's mind. ''People think we're biased, partisan,'' he says. And he's probably right. While Card has never advocated for or against raising the minimum wage, many who oppose wage laws have made exactly those assertions about his research. Nonetheless, in Krueger's view, he and Card changed the debate. ''I'm willing to declare a partial victory,'' Krueger told me. Some recent surveys of top academics show that a significant majority now agrees that a modest raise in the minimum wage does little to harm employment, he points out.
 If nothing else, Card and Krueger's findings have provided persuasive data, and a degree of legitimacy, to those who maintain that raising the minimum wage, whether at the city, state or federal level, need not be toxic. The Economic Policy Institute, which endorses wage regulations, has succeeded recently in getting hundreds of respected economists -- excluding Card and Krueger, however, who choose to remain outside the debate -- to support raising the federal minimum to $7 an hour. That probably would have been impossible as recently as five years ago. Even Wal-Mart's president and C.E.O., Lee Scott, recently spoke out in favor of raising the minimum wage. It wasn't altruism or economic theory or even public relations that motivated him, but a matter of bottom-line practicality. ''Our current average hourly wage for workers is $9.68,'' Lee Culpepper, a Wal-Mart spokesman, told me. ''So I would think raising the wage would have minimal impact on our workers. But we think it would have a beneficial effect on our customers.''

What a Higher Minimum Wage Can Mean to Those Making It
 One evening in Santa Fe, I sat down with some of the people Wal-Mart is worried about. Like Louis Alvarez, a 58-year-old cafeteria worker in the Santa Fe schools who for many years helped prepare daily meals for 700 children. For that he was paid $6.85 an hour and brought home $203 every two weeks. He had no disposable income -- indeed, he wasn't sure what I meant by disposable income; he barely had money for rent. Statistically speaking, he was far below the poverty line, which for a family of two is about $12,800 a year. For Alvarez, an increase in the minimum wage meant he would be able to afford to go to flea markets, he said.
 I also met with Ashley Gutierrez, 20, and Adelina Reyes, 19, who have low-paying customer-service and restaurant jobs. By most estimates, 35 percent of those who make less than $7.25 an hour in the U.S. are teenagers. A few months ago, Reyes told me, she was spending 86 hours every two weeks at two minimum-wage jobs to pay for her car and for college. Gutierrez, also in school, was working 20 hours a week at Blockbuster video for the minimum wage. People like Alvarez and Gutierrez and Reyes were the ones who spurred two city councilors in Santa Fe, Frank Montano and Jimmie Martinez, to introduce the living-wage ordinance. ''Our schools here don't do so well,'' Montano told me, explaining that he believed higher-wage jobs would let parents, who might otherwise have to work a second job, spend more time with their children. (At the same time working teenagers like Reyes would have more time with their parents.) For Santa Fe residents who were living five or six to a room in two-bedroom adobes, Montano said he hoped a higher minimum wage might put having their own places to live at least within the realm of possibility.
 Montano was confident -- perhaps too confident, as it would turn out -- that businesses would become acclimated to higher payroll costs. He has run a restaurant and a tour-bus company himself, and he knew that the tight labor market in Santa Fe had pushed up wages so that many entry-level workers were already earning more than $8 an hour. ''The business owners believe that government, especially at the local level, should not dictate to business, so to them it was a matter of principle,'' Montano says. It was to him too. ''We knew that other communities were watching what we were doing,'' he explains. He and his colleagues on the council were already receiving help from Paul Sonn at the Brennan Center in New York. ''I knew that their involvement meant that they saw this as something that was important nationally,'' Montano says. ''As we got our foot in the door in terms of this ordinance being applied to the private sector,'' he surmised, that would give the living-wage network the ammunition to help other communities across the country do likewise. ''I always knew, early on,'' Montano says, ''that if Santa Fe enacted such an ordinance, that it likely would go to court, and that if it passed the legal test, it would be the kind of ordinance that other communities would copy.'' The problem, at least from Montano's perspective, was getting it enacted in the first place.

The Moral Argument Carries the Day in Santa Fe
 Santa Fe's City Council asked nine residents, representing the interests of labor and management, to join a round table that would settle the specifics of the proposed living-wage law -- how high the wage would be, for instance, and how soon it would be phased in. Some members of the round table, like Al Lucero, who owns a popular local restaurant, Maria's New Mexican Kitchen, found the entire premise of a city wage law objectionable. ''I think the minimum wage at $5.15 is ridiculous,'' Lucero told me. ''If the state were to raise it overall, to $7 an hour or $7.50 an hour, I think that would be wonderful. I think we need to do it.'' But $9 or $10 or $11 was too high, in his view -- and it would put Santa Fe at a disadvantage to other cities in the state or region that could pay workers less. Also, there were the free-market principles that Frank Montano had anticipated: ''They were trying to push and tell us how to live our lives and how to conduct our business,'' says Lucero, who employs about 60 people.
 Not surprisingly, Lucero's opponents on the round table saw things in a different light. For example, Carol Oppenheimer, a labor attorney, viewed the proposed law as a practical and immediate solution. ''I got involved with the living-wage network because unions are having a very hard time,'' she told me. She assumed that local businesses could manage with higher payrolls. Yet after only a few meetings of the task force, both sides dug in, according to Oppenheimer.
 It was then that the living-wage proponents hit on a scorched-earth, tactical approach. ''What really got the other side was when we said, 'It's just immoral to pay people $5.15, they can't live on that,''' Oppenheimer recalls. ''It made the businesspeople furious. And we realized then that we had something there, so we said it over and over again. Forget the economic argument. This was a moral one. It made them crazy. And we knew that was our issue.''
 The moral argument soon trumped all others. The possibility that a rise in the minimum wage, even a very substantial one, would create unemployment or compromise the health of the city's small businesses was not necessarily irrelevant. Yet for many in Santa Fe, that came to be seen as an ancillary issue, one that inevitably led to fruitless discussions in which opposing sides cited conflicting studies or anecdotal evidence. Maybe all of that was beside the point, anyway. Does it -- or should it -- even matter what a wage increase does to a local economy, barring some kind of catastrophic change? Should an employer be allowed to pay a full-time employee $5.15 an hour, this argument went, if that's no longer enough to live on? Is it just under our system of government? Or in the eyes of God?
 The Rev. Jerome Martinez, the city's influential monsignor, began to throw his support behind the living-wage ordinance. When I met with him in his parish, in a tidy, paneled office near the imposing 18th-century church that looks over the city plaza, Martinez traced for me the moral justification for a living wage back to the encyclicals of Popes Leo XIII and Pius XI and John Paul II, in which the pontiffs warned against the excesses of capitalism. ''The church's position on social justice is long established,'' Father Jerome said. ''I think unfortunately it's one of our best-kept secrets.'' 
 I asked if it had been a difficult decision to support the wage law. He smiled slightly. ''It was a no-brainer,'' he said. ''You know, I am not by nature a political person. I have gotten a lot of grief from some people, business owners, who say, 'Father, why don't you stick to religion?' Well, pardon me -- this is religion. The Scripture is full of matters of justice. How can you worship a God that you do not see and then oppress the workers that you do see?''
 I heard refrains of the moral argument all over Santa Fe. One afternoon I walked around the city with Morty Simon, a labor lawyer and a staunch supporter of the living wage whose wife is Carol Oppenheimer. ''This used to be the Sears,'' Simon told me as we walked, pointing to boutiques and high-end chain stores. ''And we had a supermarket over here, and there was a hardware store too.'' Simon came to Santa Fe 34 years ago as a refugee from New York, he said, and for him the unpretentious city he once knew was gone. The wealthy retirees and second-home buyers had come in droves, and so had the movie stars. Gene Hackman and Val Kilmer had settled here; Simon recently found out that someone had plans for a 26,000-square-foot house, apparently a new local record. For him, the moral component of the law, the possibility of regaining some kind of balance, was what mattered. ''It was really a question of, What kind of world do you want to live in?'' he said.
 Several Santa Fe councilors had, over the course of the previous year, come to Morty Simon's view that the wage ordinance presented an opportunity to stop the drift between haves and have-nots. Carol Robertson Lopez, for example, had initially opposed the living-wage law but changed her mind after 30 hours of debate. ''We take risks, oftentimes, to benefit businesses,'' she told me, ''and we take risks to benefit different sectors. I felt like this was an economic risk that we were taking on behalf of the worker.'' She acknowledged that some residents thought the city had started down a slippery slope toward socialism; jokes about the People's Republic of Santa Fe were rampant. But Robertson Lopez says that by the night of the vote she had few reservations. ''I think the living wage is an indicator of when we've given up on the federal government to solve our problems,'' she says. ''So local people have to take it on their own.''
 The living-wage ordinance had its final hearing on Feb. 26, 2003, in a rancorous debate that drew 600 people and lasted until 3 a.m. The proposal set a wage floor at $8.50 an hour, which would increase to $9.50 in January 2006 and $10.50 in 2008. It would also regulate only businesses with 25 or more employees.
 It passed the City Council easily, by a vote of 7 to 1. A few weeks later, a group of restaurant and hotel owners filed suit in state court on the grounds that the living-wage ordinance exceeded the city's powers and was a violation of their rights under New Mexico's constitution. A judge suspended the wage law until a trial could resolve the issues.

Businesses Fight Back
 To business owners in Santa Fe, the most worrisome aspect of the living-wage law is that the city has sailed into uncharted territory. Most of the minimum-wage campaigns in the U.S. have been modest increases of a dollar or a dollar and a half. The numerous state campaigns for 2006 will probably propose raises to between $6.15 and $7 and hour. (When San Francisco raised its minimum wage to $8.50 an hour in 2004 -- indexed to inflation, it is now $8.82 -- California's state minimum wage was $6.75, so the increase was 26 percent.) And even staunch supporters of a higher minimum wage accept that there is a point at which a wage is set so high as to do more harm than good. ''There is no other municipality in the country that believes that $9.50 should be the living wage,'' says Rob Day, the owner of the Santa Fe Bar and Grill and one of the plaintiffs who sued the city. In fact, the most apt comparison would be Great Britain, which now has a minimum wage equivalent to about $8.80 an hour. ''They have minimum wages that are Santa Fe level,'' says Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist. And at least for the moment, he says, ''they have lower unemployment than we do.''
 As the lawsuit against the city progressed, though, Europe wasn't even a distant consideration. The focus was on the people of Santa Fe. I read through a transcript of New Mexicans for Free Enterprise v. City of Santa Fe one day this fall in a conference room at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the white-shoe law firm in Midtown Manhattan that defended, pro bono, Santa Fe's right to enact the living-wage ordinance. In many respects, the trial, which took place over the course of a week in April 2004, was an unusual public exchange on profits, poverty and class in America. Paul Sonn, the lawyer at the Brennan Center at New York University who wrote the Santa Fe ordinance, had enlisted Sidney Rosdeitcher, a partner at Paul, Weiss, to be lead counsel for Santa Fe's defense. Rosdeitcher told me that before the trial began, he wasn't convinced that there were many factual issues in dispute; as he saw it, the living-wage controversy was about the law and, in particular, whether Santa Fe had a legal ''home rule'' authority, under the provisions of the New Mexico constitution, to set wages, even for private industry. Nevertheless, several low-wage workers took the stand to relate the facts, as they saw them, of what the wage increase would do to improve their quality of life. The Rev. 
 Jerome Martinez took the stand as an employer of 65 people in his parish and Catholic school. And a number of restaurant owners, in turn, explained how the new law could ultimately force them out of business.
 The plaintiffs -- the New Mexicans for free enterprise -- were not unsympathetic: the restaurateurs who took the stand, like Rob Day or Elizabeth Draiscol, who runs the popular Zia Diner in town, opened their books to show that their margins were thin, their costs high, their payrolls large. They cared about their employees (providing health care and benefits), trained unskilled workers who spoke little or no English, gave regular raises and paid starting salaries well above $5.15. They had built up their businesses through an extraordinary amount of hard work. Draiscol testified that her restaurant, for instance, had $2.17 million in annual revenue in the fiscal year of 2003. Though her assets were substantial -- a restaurant can be valued at anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of its annual revenues, and Draiscol said that Zia had been appraised at 66 percent of revenues, or about $1.4 million -- she earned a salary of $49,000 a year. Draiscol testified that the living wage would raise her payroll, which accounted for 55 to 65 employees (depending on the season), by about $43,192 a year. Rob Day put the expenses of a living-wage increase even higher. In addition to labor costs, he estimated that the price of goods would go up as his local suppliers, forced to pay employees higher wages themselves, passed along their expenses to the Santa Fe Bar and Grill.
 Rosdeitcher showed that the restaurants had made serious errors overestimating their costs. Still, the increase in expenditures was not negligible. Over the past few years, a variety of experts have tried to perfect the science of predicting what will happen to a community in the wake of a minimum-wage change, and one of those experts, Robert Pollin, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, served as the expert witness on behalf of Santa Fe. Pollin projected that the living wage would affect the wages of about 17,000 workers. About 9,000 of those workers would receive raises because of the ordinance, he said; the rest would receive what he called ''ripple effect'' increases -- which meant that those making, say, $8.50 or more before the raise would most likely receive an additional raise from their employers to reflect their job seniority. Pollin calculated that wage increases would cost businesses a total of $33 million. And to pay for those amounts, restaurants and hotels and stores would probably need to raise prices between 1 and 3 percent. The question, therefore, was whether business owners were willing to raise prices or make less in profits. In the trial, Pollin cited an obscure 1994 academic experiment in which several economists had set a different price within the same restaurant for a fried-haddock dinner. In varying the price of the haddock between $8.95 and $10.95, the researchers' goal was to find out whether variations in cost affected demand in a controlled environment. As it turned out, they didn't. Customers ordered the haddock at both $8.95 and $10.95.

Results From the Santa Fe Experiment
 That the city of Santa Fe has effectively become a very large fried-haddock-dinner experiment is difficult to deny. A state court judge ruled in favor of the city soon after the trial, allowing the living-wage ordinance to take effect in June 2004; recently, the judge's decision was affirmed by a state appellate court, giving the city, and its living-wage advocates, a sweeping victory. Many business owners have found these legal losses discouraging. This fall, not long after I visited the city, the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce sent a note to its members to gauge their opinion on the $8.50 living wage and the hike on Jan. 1 to $9.50. Some members reported that they had no trouble adjusting to the first raise and supported a further increase. (Some of these owners, whose high-end businesses employ skilled workers, paid more than $8.50 to begin with.) Others insisted that they were not averse to a state or federal raise in the minimum wage but that Santa Fe's citywide experiment had put local businesses at a competitive disadvantage: companies could move outside the city limits or could outsource their work to cheaper places in the state. But most respondents opposed the law. The living wage had forced them to raise prices on their products and services, which they feared would cut into business.
 To look at the data that have accumulated since the wage went into effect is to get a more positive impression of the law. Last month, the University of New Mexico's Bureau of Business and Economic Research issued some preliminary findings on what had happened to the city over the past year and a half. The report listed some potential unintended consequences of the wage raise: the exemption in the living-wage law for businesses with fewer than 25 employees, for instance, created ''perverse incentives'' for owners to keep their payrolls below 25 workers. There was some concern that the high living wage might encourage more high-school students to drop out; in addition, some employers reported that workers had begun commuting in to Santa Fe to earn more for a job there than they could make outside the city. 
 Yet the city's employment picture stayed healthy -- overall employment increased in each quarter after the living wage went into effect and was especially strong for hotels and restaurants, which have the most low-wage jobs. Most encouraging to supporters: the number of families in need of temporary assistance -- a reasonably good indicator of the squeeze on the working poor -- has declined significantly. On the other hand, the city's gross receipts, a reflection of consumer spending and tourism, have been disappointing since the wage went into effect. That could suggest that prices are driving people away. Or it could merely mean that high gas and housing prices are hitting hard. The report calculates that the cost of living in Santa Fe rose by 9 percent a year over the past two and a half years.
 Rob Day of the Santa Fe Bar and Grill sees this as the crux of the matter. In his view, the problem with Santa Fe is the cost of housing, and there are better ways than wage regulations -- housing subsidies, for example -- to make homes more affordable. In the wake of the wage raise, Day told me, he eventually tweaked his prices, but not enough to offset the payroll increases. He let go of his executive chef and was himself working longer hours. ''Now in the matter of a year and a half, I think there is a whole group of us who thought, If we were going to start over, this isn't the business we would have gone into,'' he says. 
 Al Lucero, the owner of Maria's New Mexican Kitchen, says that the living-wage battle has risked turning him into a caricature. Opponents backing the living wage ''paint us as people who take advantage of workers,'' he told me. By contrast, Lucero sees himself as an upstanding member of the community who provides jobs (he has 60 employees) and had always paid well above the federal minimum. Other business owners said similar things but would not speak out publicly. They feared alienating customers. As some told it, they had started businesses with a desire to create wealth and jobs in a picturesque small city. Then they had awakened in a mad laboratory for urban liberalism.

The Issue in Albuquerque
 Long after he did his influential research with David Card on the effect of minimum-wage raises, Alan Krueger says, he came to see that ultimately the minimum wage is less about broad economic outcomes than about values. Which is not to say that workers' values should trump those of owners. Rather, that when wealth is being redistributed from one party to another -- and not, in the case of Santa Fe, from overpaid C.E.O.'s and hedge-fund managers but from everyday entrepreneurs who have worked long hours to succeed in their businesses -- things can get complicated. Indeed, while it is tempting to see the wage disputes in Santa Fe and elsewhere as a reflection of whether one side is right or wrong, on either economic or moral grounds, they are, more confusingly, small battles in a larger war (and, in America, a very old war) over where to draw the line on free-market capitalism. On one side there is Al Lucero, on the other someone like Morty Simon or the economist Robert Pollin, who says: ''The principled position is: 'Why should anyone tell anyone what to do? Why should the government?' I just happen to disagree with that. A minimally decent employment standard, to me, overrides the case for a free market.''
 And yet, the fact that voters or elected politicians should decide who wins these battles, rather than economists or policy makers, seems fitting. During Albuquerque's living-wage campaign this past fall, Santa Fe -- the smaller, wealthier, northern neighbor -- served as a rallying point. But it was also a question mark: Was Santa Fe's experience repeatable? Was it even worth pointing to as an exemplar? In the final days of the Albuquerque effort, Jen Kern of Acorn told me she had little doubt that the wage victory in Santa Fe, like the one in San Francisco, was an indication that a battle for creating high base wages in America's cities, in addition to the states, could be won. But these were also rich cities, liberal cities -- ''la-la lands,'' as she put it. ''I think with citywide minimums, if this is going to be the next era in the living-wage movement, it's got to look like it's winnable,'' Kern says. ''The danger or the limitations of just having San Francisco and Santa Fe having passed this is that people in other parts of the country are going to say, 'Well, I'm not Santa Fe, I'm not San Francisco.''' In Kern's view, a win ''in a city like Albuquerque, which I think everyone thinks of as sort of a normal city,'' was a truer test.
 And it didn't pass that test. When the $7.50 ballot initiative lost by 51 percent to 49 percent on Oct. 4, it made many in the living-wage movement wonder how these battles will play out over the next year or two. One political consultant involved in the movement questioned whether the Albuquerque wage itself, at $7.50 an hour, had been set too high by Acorn to win broad support. Matthew Henderson of Acorn, who ran the day-to-day campaign, said he thought they were outspent by their opponents. Most likely, though, the outcome was determined by the actual grounds on which the battle was fought. The businesses that opposed the $7.50 wage, represented mainly by the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce, challenged a small provision in the proposed living-wage law that would allow those enforcing a living wage to have wide ''access'' to a workplace. The campaigns soon began trading allegations through television ads and direct mailings about how far such access might go. And so the living-wage campaign had become a surreal fight over privacy (it would allow ''complete strangers to enter your child's school,'' one mailing against the measure claimed) rather than wages. When I met with Terri Cole, the president and C.E.O. of Albuquerque's Chamber of Commerce, a few days before the vote, she acknowledged that the chamber opposed the living-wage law on philosophical grounds. But she said she saw the access clause as a legitimate grounds for a fight.

Will It Play Nationally?
 In the aftermath of Albuquerque, Jen Kern took solace in the fact that 10 years after she visited the Library of Congress, and 10 years after she began working on living-wage campaigns, the opposition fought not on the economic merits or risks of a higher wage, but on a side issue like privacy. Still, a loss is a loss. It is possible that the Albuquerque wage campaign may still prevail, in effect: New Mexico's governor, Bill Richardson, has said he would consider a statewide raise this spring, presumably to $7 or $7.50, from $5.15, that would affect all New Mexicans. (It would, in all likelihood, leave Santa Fe's higher wage unaffected.) Yet such an act does little to clarify whether progressives can actually transform strong levels of voter support for higher wages into wins at the polls. Kristina Wilfore, the head of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a progressive advocacy group, says that over the years there has been anywhere from a 2 to 5 percent increase in voter turnout specifically correlated with wage measures. ''But people think it's some big panacea, and it's not,'' says Wilfore, who regards success as dependent on how well a local wage coalition (organized labor, grass-roots groups, church-based organizations) can work together at raising money and mobilizing voters. 
 For specific candidates in a state or city where a wage measure is on the ballot, it can be similarly complicated. Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told me that the local battles over living wages reflect the broader debate in the U.S. over health care, retirement security and an advancing global economy. ''Every district is different,'' Emanuel says of the slate of Congressional races for 2006, ''but there is not one where the living wage, competitive wages or health care doesn't play out. The minimum-wage issue, if it's on the ballot, is part of the economic argument.''
 David Mermin of Lake Research Partners, who frequently conducts polls on minimum-wage issues, told me that the dollar level of a wage proposal is important, though it can vary from place to place. (''People have different feelings about what's a lot of money,'' he says.) But he has found that quirks can emerge. An increase to $6.15 sometimes doesn't poll as well as an increase to $6.75, which can generate more intensity and broader support from voters. Mermin also says that wage measures have had success in recent years, Albuquerque notwithstanding, not because Americans feel differently but because campaigners are getting smarter about stressing morals over economics. And when handled adroitly, a wage platform can motivate the kind of voters who are difficult to engage in other ways: younger voters, infrequent voters, low-income urban voters. His research, Mermin adds, shows that most people who vote for the minimum wage know it's not going to affect their lives tomorrow: ''It's not like fixing the health-care system, or repairing the retirement system,'' he says. ''It doesn't rise to that level directly. And if you list it in 10 issues, it doesn't pop out in priority. But when it is on the ballot, it crystallizes a lot of things people feel about the economy and about people who are struggling.'' In his experience, voters seem to process these measures as an opportunity to take things into their own hands and change their world, just as Morty Simon did.
 Still, as an endgame, many in the living-wage movement see the prize not in a series of local victories in 2006 but in Congressional action that results in a substantial increase in the federal minimum wage -- and even better -- one that is indexed to inflation, so that such battles about raising the wage don't need to be fought every few years. The long-run trajectory, Paul Sonn told me, is for cities and states to create enough pressure to ultimately force a raise on the federal level. Or to put it another way, the hope is that raising wages across the U.S. will ultimately demonstrate to voters and to Washington lawmakers both the feasibility and the necessity of a significantly higher minimum wage. In the meantime, Sonn says, cities like Santa Fe play an important role in policy innovation, ''really as sort of laboratories of economic democracy.'' Richard Freeman of Harvard echoes this point. ''If you go back, a lot of the New Deal legislation, good or bad, came about because there was a lot of state legislation,'' Freeman says. Policies from New York or Wisconsin were adapted into the federal system of laws. ''A lot of it came from state variations in the past, and I think we'll see a lot more of this in the next few years. The things that work the best might be adopted nationally.''
 Of course, it also seems plausible that any kind of national coherence on economic -- or moral -- matters may have ended long ago. Just as the voters of states and cities have sorted themselves politically into red and blue, and into pro- and anti-gay marriage, in other words, they are increasingly sorting their wage floors and (perhaps soon) their health-care coverage. This trend may produce not progressive national policies but instead a level of local self-determination as yet unseen. Or as Freeman puts it, ''Let Santa Fe do what it wants, but let's not impose that on Gadsden, Ala.'' That wouldn't make a federal increase in the minimum wage insignificant, but it would make it something of a backdrop for major population centers. As Robert Reich says, ''The reality is, even if the wage were raised to $6.15, it would not be enough to lift a family out of poverty.'' And as Jen Kern notes, even a federal minimum wage that goes up to $7.25, which is the proposal from the Senate Democrats and which probably isn't going anywhere until 2008, doesn't approach what it now costs to live in some cities. 
 This was why, in December, Kern and Acorn were considering the prospects for laying the groundwork for living-wage ordinances in other cities. And it's why, also in December, Paul Sonn was helping to write an ordinance for Lawrence Township, N.J., aimed at forcing the city's big-box retailers like Wal-Mart to pay a higher wage (more than $10 an hour) and to contribute a larger share of employee benefits. Last month, Sonn also pointed out to me that Santa Cruz, Calif., was considering plans to introduce a measure that would establish a minimum wage of $9.25 an hour.
 It wasn't quite Santa Fe's level, but close. And that suggested that the small New Mexican city, to the delight of its living-wage advocates and the chagrin of many business owners, was no longer just an experiment. Rather, it had already become something best described, for better or for worse, as a model.

HEADLINE: Abandoned Hospitals For the Mentally Ill Morph Into Housing

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
FOR 150 years or so, the brick buildings of the Northampton State Hospital have loomed large over this western Massachusetts city. At its peak, the hospital housed 2,400 people with mental illnesses. 
 Ten years ago, the state closed the hospital, which abuts Smith College, and the 70 buildings were left empty. Now, the 126-acre property, within walking distance of the downtown, is shedding its ghosts and being transformed into a mixed-use development.
 The first residents moved into new homes on an outlying part of the property last year. Two buildings were converted into 35 town houses and apartments that will be rented in the next few months, and one more building will probably be refurbished. The other buildings will be replaced with houses, office buildings and industrial space, according to Thomas Kegelman, a project manager at Community Builders, the developer. 
 When it is finished, there will be 207 housing units. ''It is a model of how to develop new housing with a compact footprint,'' said Northampton's mayor, Claire Higgins. 
 The same scene is playing nationwide, as municipalities and developers look for ways to grow in a confined space, while revitalizing shuttered mental hospitals. Although there is sometimes controversy about demolishing the old buildings, the sites have no problem attracting developers or buyers. 
 The Benjamin Development Company in Garden City, N.Y., bought the 850-acre Harlem Valley Psychiatric Hospital in Dover, N.Y., in Dutchess County, north of New York City, for $4.5 million, and plans to build what amounts to a new town, with 1,200 residential units, retail and office space and a nine-hole golf course. The developers say they hope the nearby Harlem Valley-Wingdale Metro-North Railroad station will attract buyers who commute to Manhattan. 
 The Villebois, a community of 2,400 residences in Wilsonville, Ore., built on the old Dammasch State Hospital grounds, has a waiting list, as does the Grand Traverse Commons in Traverse City, Mich., a luxury town house development on the site of the former Traverse City State Hospital. 
 Meanwhile, prices for three-bedroom homes at the Rivermark in Santa Clara, Calif., on the former grounds of Agnews State Hospital, have increased to about $920,000, from about $650,000 in 2002, residents say. Sun Microsystems also built its headquarters on a parcel there.
 While the projects bring benefits, they are often hard to develop. The sites are usually neglected and have rotting buildings filled with asbestos and lead paint. Then there are human hurdles: getting buyers to overcome any stigmas about the sites, dealing with the concerns of former patients and employees who have a personal connection to the land, and considering the objections of preservationists who are worried about the fate of historic buildings. 
 Overcoming the mental hospital stigma was difficult for Linda Jones, 39, who coordinates client services for a diversity training firm and grew up not far from a mental institution, Boston State Hospital. ''Everyone in the neighborhood just considered it a place where the mentally ill went, and the rest of us just stayed away,'' Ms. Jones said. 
 It's no surprise that Ms. Jones, who has spent years trying to buy a home, was skeptical after hearing that part of the hospital was being developed into market-rate and low-income housing. But after attending community meetings and a home buyers' class offered by the developer, Ms. Jones, who rents a one-bedroom apartment nearby, decided to move into the new community. She says she hopes to get a market-rate home for about $250,000. 
 Rebecca Macauley, a medical secretary who spent about five years as a patient living at Northampton State Hospital during the 1980's and later worked as a security guard there, is glad to see the property developed. Ms. Macauley says the transformation reflects the progress made in treating patients with mental illness, who now tend to get help in smaller settings. ''We're now treating people like normal human beings, and in a back-door kind of way this is what the redevelopment is saying,'' she said. 
 Fifteen percent of the homes in the former hospital will be occupied by clients of the state's Department of Mental Health, and 15 percent will be set aside for low-income residents.
 Northampton State Hospital opened in 1858 on a sprawling 500-acre campus, complete with a working farm. In the late 1970's a group of patients filed a lawsuit against the state, alleging improper treatment. Out of that came a consent decree saying patients were entitled to less-restrictive care, which led to the closing of many hospitals, including Northampton in 1996. 
 A group of local preservationists spent years fighting development, on the ground that the hospital's imposing brick structures are historically significant and should be restored. They are considering legal action against the city to prevent demolition. 
 ''To destroy this history is akin to what I would call 21st-century urban vandalism,'' said Tristram W. Metcalfe, an architect involved with the group, called Save Old Main, after the hospital's main building. 
 There are similar concerns in Danvers, Mass., where AvalonBay Communities will soon convert the former Danvers State Hospital into luxury rentals. The deal, made final last month, has been opposed by residents concerned about preserving the buildings, though a judge has ruled against them. AvalonBay plans to save a third of the main hospital building and demolish the rest. 
 ''It's nowhere near enough,'' said John Archer, an insurance agent from Danvers who has always admired the architecture.
 The developments, though, are a boon for local governments, which stand to reap tax benefits, and the projects, in most cases, will also include housing for the mentally ill.
 Robert D. Coble, the mayor of Columbia, S.C., said the conversion of an abandoned 178-acre state hospital campus in the heart of the city into 1,300 housing units and 500,000 square feet of retail space is his city's most significant economic project.
 In Wilsonville, Ore., a town with about 15,000 people around 20 miles south of Portland, the transformation of the hospital into housing will increase the population by 50 percent. ''We've been short housing virtually all our history,'' said Mayor Charlotte Lehan, who spent years fighting the state over the property, which was slated to become a prison for women. The site's developer, Costa Pacific Communities, bought the land from the state in 1999. 
 The area is being developed as an urban-renewal zone. ''It's not like the city is getting a pile of money from this, but it adds housing, which means more of our employees can live here, and that works out better for the community if your companies are tied to your community,'' Ms. Lehan said.
 Many developments come complete with grocery stores, cafes and, in the case of Wilsonville, a school. 
 Julie Liedtke, who bought a three-bedroom home in the Rivermark development for $653,000 in 2002, was not bothered that the home was built on the grounds of a former mental hospital. She was lured by the concept of an urban village where she could walk to the bank or an Italian restaurant for a creamy garlic chicken pizza, her favorite. 
 ''This whole concept of an urban village with all the shops and this and that was a big selling point,'' she said. ''Things are very close, very convenient.''

HEADLINE: Sales Target: People Nearing Retirement

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
WILLIAM SCHEFFLER, 64, cannot wait until he and his wife, Nancy, 63, get to Egypt later this month to start a 15-day vacation. Their plans include a hot-air balloon ride across the desert and a cruise along the Nile. 
 But before leaving Long Island, they plan to close on a new two-bedroom condominium in the Bel Aire, a five-story building that opened this month in East Meadow.
Prices start at $330,000, even though the Bel Aire offers 24-hour concierge, valet and porter service -- features commonly associated with more expensive buildings.
 The developer, Engel Burman Group, is taking aim at a growing market of Long Islanders in their 50's and 60's who, like the Schefflers, want the very best their nest eggs can buy, but without the hassles of having to maintain their own homes. A handful of other residential developers on Long Island of stand-alone houses as well as condominiums are also focusing on promoting relatively moderately priced projects to people nearing retirement. 
 ''In the New York metro area, people are looking more toward Manhattan-apartment-style living,'' said Fern Karhu, manager of the Syosset office of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which is listing the Bel Aire units. ''This is Manhattan-style living without the price tag.''
 Some condos on Long Island with extensive services can offer relatively low prices, developers and real estate agents say, because their locations are less than ideal -- on busy roads or in struggling downtowns.
 The Bel Aire, for example, is on Merrick Avenue, right off Hempstead Turnpike and the Meadowbrook Parkway, which is one of two major north-south parkways traversing Nassau County.
 The building is not age-restricted, but buyers tend to be in their 50's and 60's, with family and friends on Long Island and second homes in Florida or elsewhere, Ms. Karhu said.
 The Schefflers looked at rentals and at similarly priced suburban communities in New Jersey and in Suffolk County after selling their home in Merrick in July, but ''our children told us point blank that they would not drive to New Jersey or far east on the Island to come and visit,'' Ms. Scheffler said.
 When the couple walked into the marble lobby with its wide hotel-like reception desk and two fireplaces, they said they were immediately impressed. ''It's like a pied-a-terre on Long Island,'' Ms. Scheffler said. 
 The condominiums are all two-bedroom, two-bath units with shiny surfaces and turnkey options: granite countertops, stainless steel appliances and huge tiled bathrooms with walk-in showers and Jacuzzi tubs.
 But what sold the Schefflers, and 35 other buyers so far, are the services offered at the 95-unit development. Besides the valet, porter and concierge, amenities include a heated swimming pool in the courtyard, entertaining rooms, denlike common rooms, a wireless computer room and a gym with flat TV screens mounted on exercise machines. 
 ''It's easy living with all the various services on site,'' said Scott Burman of Engel Burman. The developer is planning two more hotel-style condominiums on Long Island.
 Most of the Bel Aire units are priced at $330,000 to $450,000; the two penthouses with rooftop terraces are $700,000. Maintenance is about $500 a month, and annual taxes are about $8,000 on the two-bedroom units, which are roughly 1,000 square feet. 
 The Bristal assisted living facility and Fulton nursing home, which were both built by Engel Burman, are on adjacent lots.
 Farther north in Nassau, in Westbury village, there are two other condominiums under construction -- Maple Tower and the Horizon -- that offer units in the same price range and extensive services. 
 The buildings advertise 24-hour doormen and concierge services, underground parking, terraces, a swimming pool and exercise rooms.
 ''They're paying about $400 a square foot as opposed to $1,000 a square foot in Manhattan for those kinds of amenities,'' said Marilyn Larsen of Lane Realty, which is listing the Horizon units. 
 David Marom, the developer of the Horizon at Westbury, said he moved from building single-family home developments to apartment-style buildings on Long Island two years ago. 
 ''The condos and apartments are attracting more people today,'' he said, and downtown revitalizations in places like Westbury village attract developers with high-density zoning to spur economic development.
 The 90 Horizon units are mostly one- and two-bedrooms ranging in price from $327,900 for a nearly 800-square-foot unit to $531,200 for a two-bedroom duplex. The three three-bedroom units are priced at $691,000.
 Many of the buyers are ''people from Old Westbury who are selling very expensive homes but want to maintain an address on Long Island,'' Mr. Marom said.
 Elsewhere on the Island, a few gated communities are still going up, but some developers are refining the approach and pushing it farther east. 
 Westminster Communities, a New Jersey firm, is building its first Long Island homes at the start of the North Fork in Suffolk County, adjacent to golf courses and farms, minutes from wineries and a short drive to Westhampton Beach on the South Ford. The homes are under construction in the town of Riverhead, ''which doesn't have the greatest of connotations,'' said Sam M. Gershwin, president of the firm, ''but we're creating our own in-house communities,'' with private roads but no gates.
 Allan Schneider Associates, the select East End real estate firm usually associated with expensive single-family homes, is listing the Westminster communities: the Highlands at Reeves and Highlands at Aquebogue. The listings are ''a departure for Allan Schneider,'' said Jack O'Donnell, who manages the North Fork region for the firm. But the intense landscaping, fountains and ponds in the developments; the absence of gates; and the high-end amenities for an attractive price impressed him, he said.
 Mr. O'Donnell said a majority of buyers are in their 50's or early 60's. ''These are active people who use these homes for weekends or the summer and who plan to use them as a retirement home,'' he said.
 The homes, which are still under construction, range from about $500,000 to $635,000 and offer tennis, swimming pools, cathedral ceilings and master suites on the first floors of many units.
 Back in East Meadow, the Schefflers said they are ''champing at the bit'' to close on their condominium and fly off to their Egypt vacation. Buildings like the Bel Aire are ideal, Mr. Scheffler said, for people who like to travel. ''You just tell the concierge what your plans are; you lock the door and go away,'' he said. ''Everything's taken care of.''

HEADLINE: So Close

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
AT 168th Street and Nelson Avenue in the South Bronx, you can look 134 blocks downtown and see the upper third of the Empire State Building pop up unexpectedly like a silvery beacon. So close to Manhattan, and yet so far away.
 On that corner, though, the consequences of Manhattan's wealth are beginning to be felt. It is the site of the first new-construction, market-rate condominium in the South Bronx -- a direct consequence of the real estate boom that has driven prices sky high in the rest of the city.
''Prices are getting so out there in the city or Queens, the Bronx becomes very affordable,'' said Alden Madruga, the director of sales for the condo developer, the Jackson Development Group.
 Seven blocks north of Yankee Stadium, the modest development of pale brick has 28 two- and three-bedroom units in seven adjoining four-story town houses in the final stages of construction. They went on sale last month for $235,000 each and six are already in contract. One buyer is from Manhattan, another is from Queens, and many of those who have come to open houses are also from outside of the Bronx, Mr. Madruga said. One potential buyer who has requested a contract is relocating from Connecticut. 
 Jackson has built about 300 homes in the South Bronx since 1999, most of them three- and four-family town houses where an owner can live in one unit and cover carrying costs like the mortgage and utilities by renting out the others. When the company started, a three-family home was selling for about $325,000. Today, a similar home can go for as much as $600,000. 
 Joshua D. Weissman, Jackson's treasurer, said the company initially planned to create a series of four-family homes on the site on Nelson Avenue, but then decided to experiment by turning them into condos. 
 A review of submissions to the state attorney general's office over the last 25 years revealed only one other market-rate condo project in the South Bronx, an eight-unit project in 1984 in two rehabbed town houses on Forest Avenue.
 Mr. Weissman said the company decided to take a chance with condos on Nelson Avenue to try to bring in a buyer at a lower price level. If they sell, the developer also does better. Although they would cost more to build, four condos would sell for $940,000, while a four-family house would sell for $700,000. The apartments have oak floors and stainless steel Kenmore appliances. 
 Jackson is now looking at sites for other condo projects in the area. It also has about 30 three- and four-family homes in various stages of development elsewhere in the South Bronx. ''Five, six years ago, I drove around and there were illegal parking lots and vacant lots everywhere,'' Mr. Weissman said. ''Now you can't drive down a block and not see something new or rebuilt on mostly every block, both homes and rental units.'' 
 An improving Bronx has been attracting builders for several years for a simple economic reason. ''The land is still the cheapest per buildable square foot in the five boroughs,'' said David Simone, a broker with Massey Knakal Realty Services and the company's director of sales in the South Bronx. Even so, he said that prices have doubled in two years. 
 Mr. Simone has sold 43 large lots to developers in that time and he said that some are waiting to see how well Jackson does on Nelson Avenue. ''A lot of the land is sold to people waiting to build condos in the not too distant future,'' he said. 

'It's a Great Area'
 Bobby Cohen moved from Harlem to Alexander Avenue, in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, in April 2004. Since then, she has become a booster for the neighborhood and encourages her friends and others to consider moving there. ''I love it,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''I think it's a great area. It's really friendly.'' 
 Ms. Cohen, a literary agent and novelist (she writes romances and mysteries under the pen name Roberta Gayle), grew up in suburban Long Island and has lived in Harlem and other parts of Manhattan. But Ms. Cohen and her sister Rhona, who teaches English at the City University of New York, had been house hunting for a couple of years in Harlem, Brooklyn and Queens and had been unable to find anything that they liked and could afford.
 It wasn't until they started looking in the Bronx, with the help of Allison Jaffe, a real estate agent with Skyline Realty, that they found what they were looking for in the 19th-century brick town houses of Alexander Avenue, north of 138th Street. In early 2004 they bought a four-story house on Alexander, near 140th Street, for $430,000. Their mother, Ida, lives in the garden apartment and the two sisters and Rhona's 12-year-old son, who attends school in Manhattan, live in the upper three floors. The entire family frequently shares meals. 
 Ms. Cohen says she feels very safe in her neighborhood and that, as in other parts of the city, crime has dropped steadily. The 40th Precinct station house is down the street and a newly renovated library is across the way. Brook Park is nearby, and there is a neighborhood community center with activities for Rhona's son, who has also taken guitar lessons at the nearby Hostos Community College. 
 The neighborhood has a combination of longtime residents and young families who are moving in and renovating, Ms. Cohen said, and people stop and chat on the street and are quick to help one another out. She said a neighbor recently dropped her cellphone on the sidewalk and another neighbor took it to her house. The 138th Street subway stop is a short distance away, and an express train on the No. 4 or 5 line will take her to Grand Central Terminal in 15 minutes. 
 The Cohens have a favorite Spanish-Chinese restaurant and a favorite pizza parlor. While there is a Western Beef supermarket a few blocks away, she said they frequently drive into Manhattan for grocery shopping, to a Pathmark or Fairway store in Harlem. 
 ''There's no Starbucks yet but when we moved to Harlem a few years ago there was none of that there and then Gap and Starbucks popped up everywhere,'' Ms. Cohen said. 
 Her biggest gripe, she says, is that the city does not provide enough corner trash cans, so that garbage ends up on the street. 
 ''We're pioneers in this area,'' said Ms. Cohen's mother, Ida. ''As pioneers, you shouldn't expect the same thing as when you move into a well-developed area. You're not going to find a good restaurant. If that's what you're looking for, you won't want to be a pioneer.''
 The stretch of Alexander Avenue where the Cohens live, from East 138th Street to East 141st Street, is one of the few parts of the South Bronx with the older, stately town houses that are reminiscent of brownstone Brooklyn or the older town house blocks of Manhattan. Other areas with architecturally noteworthy town houses in the South Bronx include East 139th and East 140th Street between Willis and Brook Avenues, and the Longwood Historic District, including East 156th Street and Kelly and Beck Streets. 
 But in the South Bronx, the comparison only lasts for a few blocks at a time. Over all, the housing stock is very different from places like Bedford-Stuyvesant or Boerum Hill in Brooklyn, and it is dominated by newer three- or four-family homes, housing projects and nondescript rental buildings. While there is plenty of new construction, there are still visible marks of the deterioration of the 1960's and 70's, including derelict buildings and empty lots. In addition, there are still thriving industrial areas, thanks to the concentration of highways and rail links. 
 Ms. Cohen's first recruits to the Bronx are her friends Kim and Dan Reagan. The Reagans paid $440,000 in November for a 14-year-old two-family house on Brook Avenue at 145th Street, a block from St. Mary's Park. The Reagans had lived for seven years in a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan Plaza, a subsidized housing complex for artists at 43rd Street and 10th Avenue, in Manhattan. Ms. Reagan said that their new mortgage payments are about $3,000 a month and that the rental unit will cover half that. The remaining $1,500 is about what they paid in rent, although they now have other costs like property taxes and utilities. 
 The Reagans have three children, a 12-year-old daughter, an 8-year-old son and a 4-month-old daughter. The two older children will continue to attend school in Manhattan for the time being, Ms. Reagan said, although her son may eventually switch to a school closer to home. But she said she did not look into local schools before buying in the Bronx. ''That wasn't the reason we moved,'' she said, noting that her son had been sleeping in the living room of their apartment. ''I wanted to make an investment with our money and also create more space for us.'' 
 Ms. Reagan said she was also attracted by relatively low taxes, a back yard, a driveway with room for two cars and the fact that there is not much traffic in the neighborhood. 

Finding Property
 Lourdes Cartagena of Foxtons may be the busiest real estate broker in the South Bronx. Working with a team of 15 sales agents, she has listed and sold close to 300 homes in the borough over the last three years, many of them in the South Bronx. Ms. Cartagena grew up in Hunts Point and driving through the neighborhood recently she said, ''This is the hard knocks.'' But she added, ''The Bronx is not what it used to be'' and said she marvels that homes in her old stomping ground are now selling for $400,000 and up. 
 Ms. Jaffe, the broker from Skyline Realty who helped the Cohens, has on the market a pair of three-family houses on University Avenue near 165th Street in Highbridge, for $450,000 each. The houses each have three occupied apartments. Ms. Jaffe also has listed a one-bedroom rental in a three-family brick home on Concord Avenue near 147th Street, a block from St. Mary's Park and close to the local No. 6 train. 
 Ms. Jaffe is a former arts group administrator and she says she frequently gets calls from artists looking for large spaces at cheap prices. ''It's the call I get the most,'' she said, but there is a shortage of the kinds of converted industrial properties that artists like. ''There aren't a lot of loft apartments available yet,'' she said.
 For people used to the Manhattan real estate market, looking for a home in the South Bronx can be a struggle. Many homes are listed by local agents who often refuse to work with other brokers. Some of them put their listings on Web sites like realtor.com, but many do not, and house hunters often need to contact several brokers to find out what is available. 
 Still, the changes in the South Bronx have caught the attention of some of the larger Manhattan firms. Adrian M. Thompkins and Shebrelle Hunter-Green, brokers with the Corcoran Group, have started to bring clients to the area in search of good values and they just signed up their first listing on Alexander Avenue. 
 ''We're getting people from Manhattan,'' Mr. Thompkins said, ''who are specifically asking for Mott Haven: 'This is where we want to go. Can you find us anything -- a vacant lot, a shell.' It's sort of like the very beginning stages of Harlem, where you have people who are very savvy and know you can get beautiful space, a town house, and they're counting on the amenities to follow.''

The SoHo Fantasy
 Some people who envision a transformed South Bronx have focused their hopes on the area along Bruckner Boulevard, east of Third Avenue, where they see a kind of proto-SoHo blossoming among the picturesque industrial buildings and cluttered antiques stores. Several blocks on the north side of Bruckner were rezoned in 1997 to allow for residential development, and a couple of large buildings were converted to loft apartments, most notably a former piano factory at the corner of Lincoln Avenue, which has become known as the Clock Tower building. 
 Last March, the city approved a second rezoning in the area, expanding its residential potential. But so far the reaction from developers has been muted. 
 Only one property owner in the newly rezoned area, which extends from just west of the Third Avenue Bridge to Willow Avenue, has submitted plans to convert industrial space to apartments, according to a search of records filed with the Department of Buildings. The plans call for the top three floors of a five-story building at 2439 Third Avenue, overlooking the Major Deegan Expressway, to be turned into 46 rental apartments. 
 A pivotal building is the 181,500 square-foot Kelly's Furniture store building at 20 Bruckner Boulevard, between Alexander and Lincoln Avenues. Neil Pariser, a senior vice president of SoBro, the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, said the Kelly building was ''probably the single largest building in that rezoning area,'' and he predicted that if it were to convert to residential, it could set in motion a much larger transformation. 
 ''The upstairs is huge, high ceilings,'' Mr. Pariser said. ''It would be great for conversions, perfect for lofts.'' 
 Clyde P. Kelly, who runs the furniture company, said he has had many inquiries about the building from developers and real estate brokers. But he said that he owns the building with a partner and that they have not been able to agree on what to do.
 Meanwhile, the recent rezoning may have spurred some activity in the older rezoning area on the north side of Bruckner Boulevard, where the owner of the Clock Tower lofts has hired the architect Bruce Cutler to design a five-story apartment building with 183 rental units for a site next door. SoBro is also getting into the act. It plans to create 21 units of affordable and market-rate housing in a former hotel at Willis Avenue and 138th Street. ''We intend to see to it that when people drive from Manhattan to the Bronx on the Willis Avenue Bridge,'' Mr. Pariser said, ''that building that now greets them very bleakly will be a real signal that the Bronx is turning around.''

HEADLINE: Keeping a Finger In the Wind

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
THE United States needs to develop alternative sources of energy like wind power, in part to mitigate the effects of global warming, says Thierry Vandal, president and chief executive of Hydro-Quebec, the electricity producer based in Montreal. Here are excerpts from a conversation: 


Q. Is global warming really happening?

A. NASA came out with analysis of the year 2005 and concluded that it was the warmest year on record. That certainly seems to be telling us something. It's a potentially huge issue for all our societies.

Q. Can you Canadians actually see the effects of the warming?

A. Populations that reside in the far north, the Inuit, for example, tell us that on the basis of their traditions, they feel that something is going on. And in recent excursions, research ships up north have also detected dramatic evolution of some of the large glaciers. There is an abundance of facts that all point in the same direction. We certainly believe that as a provider of electricity we should be very, very concerned about this. That's why our focus is on renewable sources of energy. There's obviously a huge need for electricity -- it's the fuel of the information age. But we should be proactive in the way we address the supply of electricity.

Q. Aside from the generation of power from water, you think that wind power is increasingly viable. Why?

A. Technology. Clearly, this is a power source that is seeing some very interesting technological development. It's the development of power electronics and the materials that are used. And the scale of these facilities also has seen some development. All those factors combined make it a source of power that is not only renewable but also can be competitive in the power market.

Q. Wind hasn't been seen as a very reliable source of power. Is that changing?

A. Our largest wind farm 10 years ago was actually on the electricity grid about 20 percent of the hours of the year. In more recent wind farms that have been attached to the grid, the technology is allowing them to maintain a presence for more than 30 percent of the time.
 The electronics enhance our ability to control and optimize the production of energy on a more sustained basis. And composite materials mean that the blades are lighter and stronger and can therefore be used to produce at a larger scale. In a matter of 10 years, the scale of each turbine has been multiplied by a factor of 10. The efficiency of scale makes the whole sector more cost-competitive. 

Q. Does this technology come from General Electric?

A. There are others, such as the Danish firm Vestas and a Spanish company named Gamesa. But certainly General Electric is showing strong leadership in this sector.

Q. How big is the wind farm that you and G.E. are working on in northern Quebec?

A. We have attached 500 megawatts to the grid, and we're going to be attaching 1,000 additional megawatts of wind power. That's under way. We're looking at buying an additional 2,000 megawatts. We'll soon be concluding the contracts. So that's 3,500 megawatts, which is enough to supply more than one million homes with energy for a year.

Q. Will any of that power come to the United States?

A. Yes, Hydro-Quebec has a presence in the New York market and in the Northeast in general. We are looking at growing that presence over the next five years on the basis of renewable energy.

Q. Would a dip in the price of oil undermine the economics of what you're doing?

A. No. Our focus on the development of wind and hydro started before the last spike in oil prices.

Q. We're seeing resistance in Massachusetts to an offshore wind farm. Are you encountering any resistance in Quebec?

A. There is clearly a need to focus this development in areas that are not sensitive from the point of view of recreational activities. The Quebec transmission grid is very extended because a lot of our hydro generation is quite far north. The ability to attach wind power, therefore, is easier than in more densely developed areas in the United States, where a lot of power is generated close to where it's consumed.
 If you're 100 meters away from a wind farm, noise is not a factor. Clearly, the industry is going to have to continue research on wind farms' interference with certain species of birds. But on balance, we believe wind farms can continue to be developed in a way that's sensitive to both humans and other species.

Q. The American electricity grid can fail, as it did in August 2003. Has the grid been fixed?

A. Extensive work is taking place. In the Energy Policy Act that was passed last year, Congress and the administration put a lot of focus on reliability. It's all pointing in the right direction.

Q. So even though it's headed in the right direction, very little has actually been done?

A. I wouldn't characterize it that way. We shouldn't minimize the importance of what's taking place at the industry level. There's a focus on new investment and also on having an industry that operates with higher grid reliability. We think 2005 was a year in which we moved forward in grid reliability. It doesn't mean that all the work is done.

HEADLINE: Actually, Video Didn't Kill The Live, Onstage Star

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN 1964, at the height of his popularity, the great pianist Glenn Gould stopped giving live performances. ''The concert,'' he declared, ''is dead.''
 Apparently nobody told the rock band U2, which according to Billboard magazine grossed $260 million in 2005 by giving concerts. Indeed, the worldwide pop concert business grossed $2.6 billion last year, and for many artists, giving performances is more lucrative than making recordings. (It's a good thing, because downloading, legal and otherwise, threatens to kill off the old-fashioned record business anyway.)
The numbers are in, and U2's remarkable haul is no anomaly in the broad category of live entertainment. Broadway theaters report that 2005 was a banner year, with a gross of $825 million and nearly 12 million tickets sold. A record total of more than 116 million baseball fans attended major or minor league games last year, and an estimated 176 million people visited North America's 50 most popular amusement parks. We won't even get into the data on tourism, now the biggest industry in some of the world's leading cities. 
 With hundreds of cable channels on television and a seemingly infinite number of choices on the Internet, it's easy to assume that theaters, concert halls and ballparks must be chronically empty. Instead, the opposite is true. Wherever you look, it seems, people want to see something in person. 
 More and more, I suspect, what they will want is something they can't find at home. Although traditional moviegoing has proved resilient over the decades in the face of new technologies like television and the Internet, I doubt how well it can withstand the combined new forces of large-screen high-definition TV, accelerated broadband and at-home access -- via DVD or download -- to new films at the same time the pictures are released to theaters. 
 People may still go to movies, but they will see different movies in different sorts of theaters -- places more akin to the vast baroque theaters of old than the warrenlike multiplexes of today. Already a few mainstream films -- including some Harry Potter movies -- have been released in the giant-screen IMAX format, offering an experience that can't be duplicated in your living room. 
 The name of one leading IMAX film producer -- Destination Cinema -- tells the story: people will always want somewhere to go, especially the growing numbers who work at least partly at home. And in a break from the past, many Americans are engaged in dating and courtship right into middle age and beyond, meaning that more people will need someplace to go with one another. They will want something special when they get there. Restaurants, another growth industry, are already taking up a lot of this slack, for the simple reason that they're not just about eating. They're entertainment. 
 Given all of this, it's not far-fetched to think that live performance will thrive as well, in part because of the same digital technologies that are widely assumed to render it irrelevant. It's these technologies, after all, that bring everything else home -- everything but actual human beings and direct sensory experiences. 
 These technologies are radically changing the economics of entertainment. The price of creative intellectual production, whether music, books or video, is locked in a downward spiral propelled by the digital revolution -- a revolution that is likely to eliminate a good chunk of the current infrastructure built around intellectual property. Writers, musicians and other artists never made much from this system anyway.
 In the future, the entertainment we pay for may be mainly the in-person variety, best enjoyed in a crowd. Recorded music may become mainly a promotional vehicle for live appearances, just as the theatrical release of many films serves mainly to usher in their more lucrative release on DVD. 
 It's unlikely that vaudeville will rise again, but I expect to see more concerts, circuses, theater and hybrid productions like ''Blue Man Group'' and ''Stomp,'' not to mention continued growth in tourism and adult education. Authors may again derive more of their income from speaking tours than from book advances.
 After all, while books, music and other creative fare are available at little or no cost over the Internet, the price of live performances has held firmer. In the case of some concerts and sporting events, the mysterious reluctance of promoters to charge what the market will bear even makes it possible to resell the tickets for considerably more than they cost. Reselling tickets in this way is known as scalping -- perhaps because it always seems to have economists scratching their heads.

HEADLINE: The Pressure to Cover

BYLINE: By Kenji Yoshino. 
Kenji Yoshino is a professor at Yale Law School. This article is adapted from his book,''Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights,'' which will be published by Random House later this month.

 BODY:
When I began teaching at Yale Law School in 1998, a friend spoke to me frankly. ''You'll have a better chance at tenure,'' he said, ''if you're a homosexual professional than if you're a professional homosexual.'' Out of the closet for six years at the time, I knew what he meant. To be a ''homosexual professional'' was to be a professor of constitutional law who ''happened'' to be gay. To be a ''professional homosexual'' was to be a gay professor who made gay rights his work. Others echoed the sentiment in less elegant formulations. Be gay, my world seemed to say. Be openly gay, if you want. But don't flaunt. 
I didn't experience the advice as antigay. The law school is a vigorously tolerant place, embedded in a university famous for its gay student population. (As the undergraduate jingle goes: ''One in four, maybe more/One in three, maybe me/One in two, maybe you.'') I took my colleague's words as generic counsel to leave my personal life at home. I could see that research related to one's identity -- referred to in the academy as ''mesearch'' -- could raise legitimate questions about scholarly objectivity. 
 I also saw others playing down their outsider identities to blend into the mainstream. Female colleagues confided that they would avoid references to their children at work, lest they be seen as mothers first and scholars second. Conservative students asked for advice about how open they could be about their politics without suffering repercussions at some imagined future confirmation hearing. A religious student said he feared coming out as a believer, as he thought his intellect would be placed on a 25 percent discount. Many of us, it seemed, had to work our identities as well as our jobs. 
 It wasn't long before I found myself resisting the demand to conform. What bothered me was not that I had to engage in straight-acting behavior, much of which felt natural to me. What bothered me was the felt need to mute my passion for gay subjects, people, culture. At a time when the law was transforming gay rights, it seemed ludicrous not to suit up and get in the game. 
 ''Mesearch'' being what it is, I soon turned my scholarly attention to the pressure to conform. What puzzled me was that I felt that pressure so long after my emergence from the closet. When I stopped passing, I exulted that I could stop thinking about my sexuality. This proved naive. Long after I came out, I still experienced the need to assimilate to straight norms. But I didn't have a word for this demand to tone down my known gayness.
 Then I found my word, in the sociologist Erving Goffman's book ''Stigma.'' Written in 1963, the book describes how various groups -- including the disabled, the elderly and the obese -- manage their ''spoiled'' identities. After discussing passing, Goffman observes that ''persons who are ready to admit possession of a stigma. . .may nonetheless make a great effort to keep the stigma from looming large.'' He calls this behavior covering. He distinguishes passing from covering by noting that passing pertains to the visibility of a characteristic, while covering pertains to its obtrusiveness. He relates how F.D.R. stationed himself behind a desk before his advisers came in for meetings. Roosevelt was not passing, since everyone knew he used a wheelchair. He was covering, playing down his disability so people would focus on his more conventionally presidential qualities.
 As is often the case when you learn a new idea, I began to perceive covering everywhere. Leafing through a magazine, I read that Helen Keller replaced her natural eyes (one of which protruded) with brilliant blue glass ones. On the radio, I heard that Margaret Thatcher went to a voice coach to lower the pitch of her voice. Friends began to send me e-mail. Did I know that Martin Sheen was Ramon Estevez on his birth certificate, that Ben Kingsley was Krishna Bhanji, that Kirk Douglas was Issur Danielovitch Demsky and that Jon Stewart was Jonathan Leibowitz? 
 In those days, spotting instances of covering felt like a parlor game. It's hard to get worked up about how celebrities and politicians have to manage their public images. Jon Stewart joked that he changed his name because Leibowitz was ''too Hollywood,'' and that seemed to get it exactly right. My own experience with covering was also not particularly difficult -- once I had the courage to write from my passions, I was immediately embraced.
 It was only when I looked for instances of covering in the law that I saw how lucky I had been. Civil rights case law is peopled with plaintiffs who were severely punished for daring to be openly different. Workers were fired for lapsing into Spanish in English-only workplaces, women were fired for behaving in stereotypically ''feminine'' ways and gay parents lost custody of their children for engaging in displays of same-sex affection. These cases revealed that far from being a parlor game, covering was the civil rights issue of our time. 

The New Discrimination
 In recent decades, discrimination in America has undergone a generational shift. Discrimination was once aimed at entire groups, resulting in the exclusion of all racial minorities, women, gays, religious minorities and people with disabilities. A battery of civil rights laws -- like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 -- sought to combat these forms of discrimination. The triumph of American civil rights is that such categorical exclusions by the state or employers are now relatively rare.
 Now a subtler form of discrimination has risen to take its place. This discrimination does not aim at groups as a whole. Rather, it aims at the subset of the group that refuses to cover, that is, to assimilate to dominant norms. And for the most part, existing civil rights laws do not protect individuals against such covering demands. The question of our time is whether we should understand this new discrimination to be a harm and, if so, whether the remedy is legal or social in nature.
 Consider the following cases:
 Renee Rogers, an African-American employee at American Airlines, wore cornrows to work. American had a grooming policy that prevented employees from wearing an all-braided hairstyle. When American sought to enforce this policy against Rogers, she filed suit, alleging race discrimination. In 1981, a federal district court rejected her argument. It first observed that cornrows were not distinctively associated with African-Americans, noting that Rogers had only adopted the hairstyle after it ''had been popularized by a white actress in the film '10.' '' As if recognizing the unpersuasiveness of what we might call the Bo Derek defense, the court further alleged that because hairstyle, unlike skin color, was a mutable characteristic, discrimination on the basis of grooming was not discrimination on the basis of race. Renee Rogers lost her case.
 Lydia Mikus and Ismael Gonzalez were called for jury service in a case involving a defendant who was Latino. When the prosecutor asked them whether they could speak Spanish, they answered in the affirmative. The prosecutor struck them, and the defense attorney then brought suit on their behalf, claiming national-origin discrimination. The prosecutor responded that he had not removed the potential jurors for their ethnicity but for their ability to speak Spanish. His stated concern was that they would not defer to the court translator in listening to Spanish-language testimony. In 1991, the Supreme Court credited this argument. Lydia Mikus and Ismael Gonzalez lost their case. 
 Diana Piantanida had a child and took a maternity leave from her job at the Wyman Center, a charitable organization in Missouri. During her leave, she was demoted, supposedly for previously having handed in work late. The man who was then the Wyman Center's executive director, however, justified her demotion by saying the new position would be easier ''for a new mom to handle.'' As it turned out, the new position had less responsibility and half the pay of the original one. But when Piantanida turned this position down, her successor was paid Piantanida's old salary. Piantanida brought suit, claiming she had been discharged as a ''new mom.'' In 1997, a federal appellate court refused to analyze her claim as a sex-discrimination case, which would have led to comparing the treatment she received to the treatment of ''new dads.'' Instead, it found that Piantanida's (admittedly vague) pleadings raised claims only under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which it correctly interpreted to protect women only while they are pregnant. Diana Piantanida lost her case.
 Robin Shahar was a lesbian attorney who received a job offer from the Georgia Department of Law, where she had worked as a law student. The summer before she started her new job, Shahar had a religious same-sex commitment ceremony with her partner. She asked a supervisor for a late starting date because she was getting married and wanted to go on a celebratory trip to Greece. Believing Shahar was marrying a man, the supervisor offered his congratulations. Senior officials in the office soon learned, however, that Shahar's partner was a woman. This news caused a stir, reports of which reached Michael Bowers, the attorney general of Georgia who had successfully defended his state's prohibition of sodomy before the United States Supreme Court. After deliberating with his lawyers, Bowers rescinded her job offer. The staff member who informed her read from a script, concluding, ''Thanks again for coming in, and have a nice day.'' Shahar brought suit, claiming discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In court, Bowers testified that he knew Shahar was gay when he hired her, and would never have terminated her for that reason. In 1997, a federal appellate court accepted that defense, maintaining that Bowers had terminated Shahar on the basis of her conduct, not her status. Robin Shahar lost her case. 
 Simcha Goldman, an Air Force officer who was also an ordained rabbi, wore a yarmulke at all times. Wearing a yarmulke is part of the Orthodox tradition of covering one's head out of deference to an omnipresent god. Goldman's religious observance ran afoul of an Air Force regulation that prohibited wearing headgear while indoors. When he refused his commanding officer's order to remove his yarmulke, Goldman was threatened with a court martial. He brought a First Amendment claim, alleging discrimination on the basis of religion. In 1986, the Supreme Court rejected his claim. It stated that the Air Force had drawn a reasonable line between ''religious apparel that is visible and that which is not.'' Simcha Goldman lost his case.
 These five cases represent only a fraction of those in which courts have refused to protect plaintiffs from covering demands. In such cases, the courts routinely distinguish between immutable and mutable traits, between being a member of a legally protected group and behavior associated with that group. Under this rule, African-Americans cannot be fired for their skin color, but they could be fired for wearing cornrows. Potential jurors cannot be struck for their ethnicity but can be struck for speaking (or even for admitting proficiency in) a foreign language. Women cannot be discharged for having two X chromosomes but can be penalized (in some jurisdictions) for becoming mothers. Although the weaker protections for sexual orientation mean gays can sometimes be fired for their status alone, they will be much more vulnerable if they are perceived to ''flaunt'' their sexuality. Jews cannot be separated from the military for being Jewish but can be discharged for wearing yarmulkes. 
 This distinction between being and doing reflects a bias toward assimilation. Courts will protect traits like skin color or chromosomes because such traits cannot be changed. In contrast, the courts will not protect mutable traits, because individuals can alter them to fade into the mainstream, thereby escaping discrimination. If individuals choose not to engage in that form of self-help, they must suffer the consequences. 
 The judicial bias toward assimilation will seem correct and just to many Americans. Assimilation, after all, is a precondition of civilization -- wearing clothes, having manners and obeying the law are all acts of assimilation. Moreover, the tie between assimilation and American civilization may be particularly strong. At least since Hector St. John de Crevecoeur's 1782 ''Letters from an American Farmer,'' this country has promoted assimilation as the way Americans of different backgrounds would be ''melted into a new race of men.'' By the time Israel Zangwill's play ''The Melting Pot'' made its debut in 1908, the term had acquired the burnish of an American ideal. Theodore Roosevelt, who believed hyphenations like ''Polish-American'' were a ''moral treason,'' is reputed to have yelled, ''That's a great play!'' from his box when it was performed in Washington. (He was wrong -- it's no accident the title has had a longer run than the play.) And notwithstanding challenges beginning in the 1960's to move ''beyond the melting pot'' and to ''celebrate diversity,'' assimilation has never lost its grip on the American imagination. 
 If anything, recent years have seen a revival of the melting-pot ideal. We are currently experiencing a pluralism explosion in the United States. Patterns of immigration since the late 1960's have made the United States the most religiously various country in the history of the world. Even when the demographics of a group -- like the number of individuals with disabilities -- are presumably constant, the number of individuals claiming membership in that group may grow exponentially. In 1970, there were 9 disability-related associations listed in the Encyclopedia of Associations; in 1980, there were 16; in 1990, there were 211; and in 2000, there were 799. The boom in identity politics has led many thoughtful commentators to worry that we are losing our common culture as Americans. Fearful that we are breaking apart into balkanized fiefs, even liberal lions like Arthur Schlesinger have called for a recommitment to the ethic of assimilation. 
 Beyond keeping pace with the culture, the judiciary has institutional reasons for encouraging assimilation. In the yarmulke case, the government argued that ruling in favor of the rabbi's yarmulke would immediately invite suits concerning the Sikh's turban, the yogi's saffron robes and the Rastafarian's dreadlocks. Because the courts must articulate principled grounds for their decisions, they are particularly ill equipped to protect some groups but not others in an increasingly diverse society. Seeking to avoid judgments about the relative worth of groups, the judiciary has decided instead to rely on the relatively uncontroversial principle of protecting immutable traits.
 Viewed in this light, the judiciary's failure to protect individuals against covering demands seems eminently reasonable. Unfortunately, it also represents an abdication of its responsibility to protect civil rights.

The Case Against Assimilation
 The flaw in the judiciary's analysis is that it casts assimilation as an unadulterated good. Assimilation is implicitly characterized as the way in which groups can evade discrimination by fading into the mainstream -- after all, the logic goes, if a bigot cannot discriminate between two individuals, he cannot discriminate against one of them. But sometimes assimilation is not an escape from discrimination, but precisely its effect. When a Jew is forced to convert to Protestantism, for instance, we do not celebrate that as an evasion of anti-Semitism. We should not blind ourselves to the dark underbelly of the American melting pot. 
 Take the cornrows case. Initially, this case appears to be an easy one for the employer, as hairstyle seems like such a trivial thing. But if hair is so trivial, we might ask why American Airlines made it a condition of Renee Rogers's employment. What's frustrating about the employment discrimination jurisprudence is that courts often don't force employers to answer the critical question of why they are requiring employees to cover. If we look to other sources, the answers can be troubling. 
 John T. Molloy's perennially popular self-help manual ''New Dress for Success'' also tells racial minorities to cover. Molloy advises African-Americans to avoid ''Afro hairstyles'' and to wear ''conservative pinstripe suits, preferably with vests, accompanied by all the establishment symbols, including the Ivy League tie.'' He urges Latinos to ''avoid pencil-line mustaches,'' ''any hair tonic that tends to give a greasy or shiny look to the hair,'' ''any articles of clothing that have Hispanic associations'' and ''anything that is very sharp or precise.'' 
 Molloy is equally frank about why covering is required. The ''model of success,'' he says, is ''white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant.'' Those who do not possess these traits ''will elicit a negative response to some degree, regardless of whether that response is conscious or subconscious.'' Indeed, Molloy says racial minorities must go ''somewhat overboard'' to compensate for immutable differences from the white mainstream. After conducting research on African-American corporate grooming, Molloy reports that ''blacks had not only to dress more conservatively but also more expensively than their white counterparts if they wanted to have an equal impact.'' 
 Molloy's basic point is supported by social-science research. The economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan recently conducted a study in which they sent out resumes that were essentially identical except for the names at the top. They discovered that resumes with white-sounding names like Emily Walsh or Greg Baker drew 50 percent more callbacks than those with African-American-sounding names like Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones. So it seems that even when Americans have collectively set our faces against racism, we still react negatively to cultural traits -- like hairstyles, clothes or names -- that we associate with historically disfavored races. 
 We can see a similar dynamic in the termination of Robin Shahar. Michael Bowers, the state attorney general, disavowed engaging in first-generation discrimination when he said he had no problem with gay employees. This raises the question of why he fired Shahar for having a religious same-sex commitment ceremony. Unlike American Airlines, Bowers provided some answers. He argued that retaining Shahar would compromise the department's ability to deny same-sex couples marriage licenses and to enforce sodomy statutes. 
 Neither argument survives scrutiny. At no point did Shahar seek to marry her partner legally, nor did she agitate for the legalization of same-sex marriage. The Georgia citizenry could not fairly have assumed that Shahar's religious ceremony would entitle the couple to a civil license. Bowers's claim that Shahar's wedding would compromise her ability to enforce sodomy statutes is also off the mark. Georgia's sodomy statute (which has since been struck down) punished cross-sex as well as same-sex sodomy, meaning that any heterosexual in the department who had ever had oral sex was as compromised as Shahar. 
 Stripped of these rationales, Bowers's termination of Shahar looks more sinister. When she told a supervisor she was getting married, he congratulated her. When he discovered she was marrying a woman, it wasn't long before she no longer had a job. Shahar's religious ceremony was not in itself indiscreet; cross-sex couples engage in such ceremonies all the time. If Shahar was flaunting anything, it was her belief in her own equality: her belief that she, and not the state, should determine what personal bonds are worthy of celebration. 
 The demand to cover is anything but trivial. It is the symbolic heartland of inequality -- what reassures one group of its superiority to another. When dominant groups ask subordinated groups to cover, they are asking them to be small in the world, to forgo prerogatives that the dominant group has and therefore to forgo equality. If courts make critical goods like employment dependent on covering, they are legitimizing second-class citizenship for the subordinated group. In doing so, they are failing to vindicate the promise of civil rights.
 So the covering demand presents a conundrum. The courts are right to be leery of intervening in too brusque a manner here, as they cannot risk playing favorites among groups. Yet they also cannot ignore the fact that the covering demand is where many forms of inequality continue to have life. We need a paradigm that gives both these concerns their due, adapting the aspirations of the civil rights movement to an increasingly pluralistic society.

The New Civil Rights
 The new civil rights begins with the observation that everyone covers. When I lecture on covering, I often encounter what I think of as the ''angry straight white man'' reaction. A member of the audience, almost invariably a white man, almost invariably angry, denies that covering is a civil rights issue. Why shouldn't racial minorities or women or gays have to cover? These groups should receive legal protection against discrimination for things they cannot help. But why should they receive protection for behaviors within their control -- wearing cornrows, acting ''feminine'' or flaunting their sexuality? After all, the questioner says, I have to cover all the time. I have to mute my depression, or my obesity, or my alcoholism, or my shyness, or my working-class background or my nameless anomie. I, too, am one of the mass of men leading lives of quiet desperation. Why should legally protected groups have a right to self-expression I do not? Why should my struggle for an authentic self matter less?
 I surprise these individuals when I agree. Contemporary civil rights has erred in focusing solely on traditional civil rights groups -- racial minorities, women, gays, religious minorities and people with disabilities. This assumes those in the so-called mainstream -- those straight white men -- do not also cover. They are understood only as obstacles, as people who prevent others from expressing themselves, rather than as individuals who are themselves struggling for self-definition. No wonder they often respond to civil rights advocates with hostility. They experience us as asking for an entitlement they themselves have been refused -- an expression of their full humanity.
 Civil rights must rise into a new, more inclusive register. That ascent makes use of the recognition that the mainstream is a myth. With respect to any particular identity, the word ''mainstream'' makes sense, as in the statement that straights are more mainstream than gays. Used generically, however, the word loses meaning. Because human beings hold many identities, the mainstream is a shifting coalition, and none of us are entirely within it. It is not normal to be completely normal. 
 This does not mean discrimination against racial minorities is the same as discrimination against poets. American civil rights law has correctly directed its concern toward certain groups and not others. But the aspiration of civil rights -- the aspiration that we be free to develop our human capacities without the impediment ofwitless conformity -- is an aspiration that extends beyond traditional civil rights groups.
 To fulfill that aspiration, we must think differently both within the law and outside it. With respect to legal remedies, we must shift away from claims that demand equality for particular groups toward claims that demand liberty for us all. This is not an exhortation that we strip protections from currently recognized groups. Rather, it is a prediction that future courts will be unable to sustain a group-based vision of civil rights when faced with the broad and irreversible trend toward demographic pluralism. In an increasingly diverse society, the courts must look to what draws us together as citizens rather than to what drives us apart.
 As if in recognition of that fact, the Supreme Court has moved in recent years away from extending protections on the basis of group membership and toward doing so on the basis of liberties we all possess. In 2003, the court struck down a Texas statute that prohibited same-sex sodomy. It did not, however, frame the case as one concerning the equality rights of gays. Instead, it cast the case as one concerning the interest we all -- straight, gay or otherwise -- have in controlling our intimate lives. Similarly, in 2004, the court held that a state could be required by a Congressional statute to make its courthouses wheelchair accessible. Again, the court ruled in favor of the minority group without framing its analysis in group-based equality rhetoric. Rather, it held that all people -- disabled or otherwise -- have a ''right of access to the courts,'' which had been denied in that instance.
 In these cases, the court implicitly acknowledged the national exhaustion with group-based identity politics and quieted the anxiety about pluralism that is driving us back toward the assimilative ideal. By emphasizing the interest all individuals have in our own liberty, the court focused on what unites us rather than on what divides us. While preserving the distinction between being and doing, the court decided to protect doing in its own right. 
 If the Supreme Court protects individuals against covering demands in the future, I believe it will do so by invoking the universal rights of people. I predict that if the court ever recognizes the right to speak a native language, it will protect that right as a liberty to which we are all entitled, rather than as a remedial concession granted to a particular national-origin group. If the court recognizes rights to grooming, like the right to wear cornrows, I believe it will do so under something akin to the German Constitution's right to personality rather than as a right attached to racial minorities. And I hope that if the court protects the right of gays to marry, it will do so by framing it as the right we all have to marry the person we love, rather than defending ''gay marriage'' as if it were a separate institution.
 A liberty-based approach to civil rights, of course, brings its own complications, beginning with the question of where my liberty ends and yours begins. But the ability of liberty analysis to illuminate our common humanity should not be underestimated. This virtue persuaded both Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X to argue for the transition from civil rights to human rights at the ends of their lives. It is time for American law to follow suit.
 While I have great hopes for this new legal paradigm, I also believe law will play a relatively small part in the new civil rights. A doctor friend told me that in his first year of medical school, his dean described how doctors were powerless to cure the vast majority of human ills. People would get better, or they would not, but it would not be doctors who would cure them. Part of becoming a doctor, the dean said, was to surrender a layperson's awe for medical authority. I wished then that someone would give an analogous lecture to law students and to Americans at large. My education in law has been in no small part an education in its limitations.
 As an initial matter, many covering demands are made by actors the law does not -- and in my view should not -- hold accountable, like friends, family, neighbors, the ''culture'' or individuals themselves. When I think of the covering demands I have experienced, I can trace many of them only to my own censorious consciousness. And while I am often tempted to sue myself, I recognize this is not my healthiest impulse.
 Law is also an incomplete solution to coerced assimilation because it has yet to recognize the myriad groups that are subjected to covering demands even though these groups cannot be defined by traditional classifications like race, sex, orientation, religion and disability. Whenever I speak about covering, I receive new instances of identities that can be covered. The law may someday move to protect some of these identities. But it will never protect them all. 
 For these and other reasons, I am troubled that Americans seem increasingly inclined to turn toward the law to do the work of civil rights precisely when they should be turning away from it. The primary solution lies in all of us as citizens, not in the tiny subset of us who are lawyers. People confronted with demands to cover should feel emboldened to seek a reason for that demand, even if the law does not reach the actors making the demand or recognize the group burdened by it. These reason-forcing conversations should happen outside courtrooms -- in public squares and prayer circles, in workplaces and on playgrounds. They should occur informally and intimately, in the everyday places where tolerance is made and unmade.
 What will constitute a good-enough reason to justify assimilation will obviously be controversial. We have come to some consensus that certain reasons are illegitimate -- like racism, sexism or religious intolerance. Beyond that, we should expect conversations rather than foreordained results -- what reasons count, and for what purposes, will be for us all to decide by facing one another as citizens. My personal inclination is always to privilege the claims of the individual against countervailing interests like ''neatness'' or ''workplace harmony.'' But we should have that conversation.
 Such conversations are the best -- and perhaps the only -- way to give both assimilation and authenticity their due. They will help us alleviate conservative alarmists' fears of a balkanized America and radical multiculturalists' fears of a monocultural America. The aspiration of civil rights has always been to permit people to pursue their human flourishing without limitations based on bias. Focusing on law prevents us from seeing the revolutionary breadth of that aspiration. It is only when we leave the law that civil rights suddenly stops being about particular agents of oppression and particular victimized groups and starts to become a project of human flourishing in which we all have a stake. 
 I don't teach classes on gay rights any more. I suspect many of my students now experience me as a homosexual professional rather than as a professional homosexual, if they think of me in such terms at all. But I don't experience myself as covering. I've just moved on to other interests, in the way scholars do. So the same behavior -- not teaching gay rights -- has changed in meaning over time.
 This just brings home to me that the only right I have wanted with any consistency is the freedom to be who I am. I'll be the first to admit that I owe much of that freedom to group-based equality movements, like the gay rights movement. But it is now time for us as a nation to shift the emphasis away from equality and toward liberty in our debates about identity politics. Only through such freedom can we live our lives as works in progress, which is to say, as the complex, changeful and contradictory creatures that we are.

HEADLINE: Stage Acting: It's Nice Work if You Can Afford It.

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
''WE are subsidizing the theater.'' Those words, addressed to an audience in a Lincoln Center auditorium last weekend, weren't spoken by a corporate suit bragging about slapping the company name on the fire escape at one of the city's often needy nonprofit theaters.
 They were spoken by the actor Tim Blake Nelson to a group of 100 or so of his fellow performers at the National Congress of Actors and Acting Teachers. What did he mean? Essentially, that actors help keep the theater in business by supplementing their meager stage paychecks with other, more remunerative kinds of work -- ''Law & Order'' guest spots, voice-overs, commercials, even that old standby, waiting tables.
That's not really news to anyone paying attention, just common knowledge rephrased in an unusually discomfiting way. And unlike corporations and civilians, the actor doesn't get a tax break for the charitable contribution he makes to the nation's cultural life by working for a pittance. Applause aside, he doesn't get much in the way of thanks, either. No drinking fountain named after spear carrier No. 2 in that Off Off Broadway production of ''Coriolanus,'' temping by day to give himself the chance to practice his craft and pay off debts from acting school. 
 For regular theatergoers, not to mention regular moviegoers and television watchers, actors are a bit like the weather: usually good, sometimes bad, but always there. Unless they reach the heavenly and lucrative realm of bona fide celebrity, and thus become subjects of swoony profiles in glossy magazines, we don't ask where they came from or where they're going, why and how they do what they do.
 The daylong series of panels I attended on Jan. 7, presided over by J. Michael Miller, former director of the acting program at New York University and president of the Actors Center, shed some light on the answers to those unasked questions. (I also appeared on a critics and actors panel in the morning.) It was an eye-opening, often amusing, sometimes distressing look at the status of the actor in American culture, as seen by the practitioners themselves.
 Journalists and theater executives are prone to hand-wringing about the high cost of theater tickets, a serious problem to be sure. But what about the high cost of living as an actor? Testimonials from actors at the congress suggested that in the past two decades, the acting life has been getting more expensive, which is to say the work is getting less remunerative.
 Andrew Weems gave an explicit example, recalling that some two decades back he'd been in a production of ''Troilus and Cressida'' in Washington for which the actor playing Thersites had received about $600 a week. Recently Mr. Weems found himself playing the same role, Off Broadway, in a production directed by the esteemed Sir Peter Hall. Mr. Weems was earning significantly less. Another voice chimed in to denounce the disturbing tendency of regional theater management to mimic the latest trends in the corporate world: While the artistic directors' salaries have steadily grown, payments to actors have not kept pace.
 What's worse, a recent conversation I had with an actress in Los Angeles suggested that the paychecks for work in television and film had been spiraling downward, too. She'd been working in television for a couple of decades, and is today making less per job than she earned in the beginning; guest spots that would once have provided a week's work were being squeezed into two days. No more ''breaking top'' -- paying over strict scale -- for actors with extensive experience. But if actors feel increasingly marginalized economically, it was their neglect as artists that rankled perhaps even more at the conference. (As Ruben Santiago-Hudson somewhat ruefully observed: ''You can explore the depths of your soul. That is your pay.'' Which is doubtless true, but it won't buy you much at Whole Foods.)
 Marco Barricelli, a member for eight years of San Francisco's major regional nonprofit, American Conservatory Theater, confessed to feeling ''cynical about the theater'' after more than two decades of steady work. After years of acting classical roles and becoming a ''great justifier of other people's choices'' in productions over which he had no personal control, Mr. Barricelli felt actors might have earned the right to make some choices of their own. But he complained that the boards who control the nation's theaters wouldn't consider actors for roles as administrators, no matter how extensive their experience. Others lamented that theaters were happy to lavish funds on new buildings, production values and expanding artistic staffs but wouldn't make the investment in establishing salaried companies of actors. (Mr. Barricelli was one of just four company members at American Conservatory.)
 By recounting this gloomy litany of dissatisfaction, I may be giving a false impression of the day's overall tone, which was far more buoyant than bitchy, more affirmative than anguished. When Dianne Wiest contributed a few words from the audience, she began by saying, a little giddily, ''I never want to leave this room.'' There was much talk of the emotional and intellectual rewards of the work, very little of the hard practicalities, the getting of agents and managers, the frustrations of the audition process. (In fact, the word ''agent'' might have arisen only when Denis O'Hare told a funny story of his hapless early years. Running into a familiar face on the street, he fell into a friendly chat before sheepishly saying: ''I'm sorry. How do I know you?'' 
 ''I'm your agent,'' came the seething response.)
 Mr. O'Hare also confessed that some years back, when he'd been starting out, he'd tried to quit acting twice, for reasons he could no longer recall. To the theater's benefit, he didn't succeed. Likewise, Mr. Santiago-Hudson confessed that despite some bad days, ''The heart won't let me out.''
 But will the hearts of future generations of actors prove as intractable? In truth, the answer is probably yes, such is the lure of the profession, which was referred to as a calling and a faith by more than one participant. (Every third actor seemed to have flirted with joining the priesthood.) And the frustrations discussed weren't necessarily new; embarking on a career in acting has always been a risky enterprise.
 But the testimony from the conference suggests that it may well be getting riskier by the minute. And that may be another dispiriting sign of a general shift in values in American culture, where the prerogatives of mega-corporations, their chieftains and their stock prices hold sway, and the increasingly pension-less workers are left to fend for themselves.
 Big movie and television stars are the mega-corporations of the acting profession, and they seem to be acquiring an increasing measure of the industry's rewards, leaving less for the vast numbers of fameless actors. As the status of the star has continued to crest, with celebrity-obsessed television shows and magazines proliferating like bacteria over the past quarter-century, the unfortunate byproduct may be a declining respect for actors who don't happen to be household names. If performers' attractiveness and fame are what studios and even theaters want to buy and market, talent and experience naturally become commodities with lesser or no value.
 That's a potentially calamitous situation. To gauge its impact on our culture, imagine a world in which there were no more actors, just stars. We'd have the cast of ''Friends'' performing Eugene O'Neill, and Paris Hilton as Hedda Gabler. 
 O.K., so I may be guilty of a little fear-mongering there. Things will probably never get that bad. But chances are we'll all continue taking journeyman actors and their gifts for granted, and they'll continue to scramble and scrape for opportunities to be taken for granted.

JOSEPH SMITH
 Rough Stone Rolling.
 By Richard Lyman Bushman,
 with the assistance of Jed Woodworth.
 Illustrated. 740 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $35.
Most men who go searching for signs from God look skyward, but Joseph Smith, the youthful Mormon prophet, distinguished himself from his visionary cohort by hunting for sacred wisdom in the ground. In 1827, this barely literate 21-year-old dug in a hillside in rural upstate New York and unearthed a set of golden plates whose unfamiliar characters he translated with the aid of magical ''seer stones.'' The result was the Book of Mormon, a second Bible whose elaborate tale of interracial warfare between two ancient American peoples -- the so-called Lamanites and Nephites -- was dismissed by Mark Twain as ''chloroform in print'' but today forms the basis of a worldwide church with a still-growing membership of some six million in the United States and another six million overseas. 
 The mystery of the scripture's origins (was it really translated from ''reformed Egyptian'' or was it made up or borrowed from other sources?) is just one of the burning questions about Smith that Richard Lyman Bushman, his latest biographer, examines from every conceivable rational angle before declaring it to be unanswerable -- unanswerable in a way that vaguely suggests such puzzles were divinely intended to stay that way. Bushman, a retired Columbia history professor who also happens to be a practicing Mormon, has a tricky dual agenda, it turns out: to depict Smith both as the prophet he claimed to be and as the man of his times that he most certainly was. ''The efforts to situate the Book of Mormon in history, whether ancient or modern, run up against baffling complexities,'' Bushman writes, seemingly closing the door on the whole matter while slyly leaving it open a crack for a faith. ''The Book of Mormon resists conventional analysis, whether sympathetic or critical.''
 As refracted through Bushman's intellectual bifocals -- one lens is skeptical and clear, the other reverent and rosy -- most of the rest of Smith's remarkable story is shown to resist such analysis as well. So why make the effort in the first place? By showing the inadequacy of reason in the face of spiritual phenomena, Bushman seems to be playing a Latter-Day-Saint Aquinas. It appears he wants to usher in a subtle, mature new age of Mormon thought -- rigorous yet not impious -- akin to what smart Roman Catholics have had for centuries.
 Once the reader despairs of ever finding out whether Smith was God's own spokesman or the L. Ron Hubbard of his day, it's possible to enjoy a tale that's as colorful, suspenseful and unlikely as any in American history. Operating on the margins of society, out where the traveled roads turned into paths, Smith managed to build a major religion from scratch. What's more, unlike other 19th-century utopian faiths, Smith's parade kept lengthening over time rather than dispersing from the start. Despite bloody harassment from all sides, a chronic shortage of funds and almost nonstop challenges to his authority, he did Moses one better by leading an exodus and amassing a tribe at the same time.
 Bushman's Smith, whatever else he was, comes off as a singularly brilliant motivator whose method -- call it Dynamic Overextension -- modern students of management would do well to study. By perpetually promising the world to a mixed bag of followers that included preachers picked off from other sects, Smith not only captured hundreds, then thousands, of minds, he harnessed their muscles, too. From New York he led his pilgrims to Ohio, only to tell them once they'd settled down that Zion lay in Missouri, much farther west, and that many of them would have to pack their things again. To make things yet more strenuous for everyone, he dispatched bands of missionaries to Europe to convert enough souls to populate the place.
 The upshot of always demanding the impossible was chronic disappointment and disaffection when Smith's followers walked face first into the actual and found it painfully solid, not made of cloud. Zion (near modern Kansas City) wasn't the promised land Smith had promised but a turbulent, insecure frontier whose residents tarred and feathered the hopeful interlopers, torched their houses and not infrequently murdered them -- all with the tacit permission of politicians who feared the swelling Mormon vote and the liberal views of the prophet they believed controlled it. Though Mormons today tend to be social conservatives, their founder was something of a wild-eyed radical, opposing slavery, preaching kindness to animals and even promoting an economic order based on distributing wealth according to need. His dreams and schemes came in cascades of revelation, and when they evaporated, fresh visions arrived, many of them assigning blame for the misfortunes on the failings of those whom they befell while promising yet grander glories if the erring Mormons straightened up.
 The violent confrontations in Missouri and the humiliating retreat that brought the Mormons to Illinois (a haven they would have to flee after their prophet was assassinated in 1844) turned Smith from a primarily religious figure into a full-blown political leader. His idealistic pacifism gave way to a practical doctrine of self-defense. His mild-mannered tolerance for dissent became a cranky insistence on discipline. In tracing this fateful shift from seer to czar and oracle to general, Bushman earns a place for his biography on the very short shelf reserved for books on Mormonism with appeal to initiates and outsiders, too.
 Bushman marks the prophet's time in prison, where the Missourians had locked him up on a dubious charge of treason, as the dawn of his historical self-consciousness, when he recast the Mormon experience as myth and situated his people in a narrative that would give them a durable identity, not just a debatable theology: ''Joseph had conceived a strategy. For the Saints to claim their rights, the story of persecution had to be told.'' Bushman, who seems to believe that psychoanalysis can shed a partial light on the miraculous, relates Smith's new emphasis on sacred suffering to the humiliations of his youth as the son of a scorned and struggling farmer. By uniting his private traumas with the public tribulations of his church, the first Mormon became the essential Mormon, too.
 The split personality diagnosed in Smith by his best-known modern biographer, Fawn Brodie, has no place in Bushman's study, whose aim is not really to get inside the prophet but to show him from so many angles that he achieves a lifelike roundness while retaining an impenetrable core, which Bushman suggests is where the holiness goes. But as Smith becomes increasingly ambitious about personally building and peopling God's kingdom in the American Midwest, it's hard not to wonder whether the forces driving him ran on chemical and neurological fuels. Bushman may find such medical hindsight trivial -- a meaningless, anachronistic autopsy -- but it might help make his behavior seem less ghostly, less unremittingly remote. We hear Smith's words but we can't quite picture him speaking them, can't quite imagine their flavor and their tone.
 ''Awake, O Kings of the earth!'' the prophet cried from Nauvoo, Ill., the half-built Mississippi river town that he'd designed to accommodate immigrant Saints who would include but not be limited to ''the polished European, the degraded Hottentot and the shivering Laplander.'' ''Come ye, O! come ye with your gold and your silver,'' he urged. The magnificent gathering Smith craved would also, on some level, include the dead, whom living Mormons would baptize in absentia and rescue from the spiritual darkness that had descended after the time of Christ and hung on until the teenage Smith, sitting up late in his parents' house, came face to face with the angel Moroni, whose strangely luminous white feet hovered several inches above the floor.
 That's where the journey that Bushman chronicles started -- with the prayers of a boy of rudimentary schooling and no conspicuous talent other than a self-proclaimed ability to pinpoint buried caches of gems and gold, whose contentious local religious culture crackled with rumors of signs and wonders while ceaselessly arguing over salvation's fine points until former congregants could no longer stand each other and drifted off to join more agreeable sects that often disbanded more quickly than they'd been formed. The prayers from Smith that sliced through all the bickering constitute the inspiring story that Mormon missionaries first lavish on their converts, but as the faith of budding Mormons matures they're told the story of Smith's murder in 1844 -- a date with destruction he may have made inevitable when his forces smashed the printing press of a newspaper Smith branded libelous and dangerous. 
 The incident led to his jailing in nearby Carthage, where the governor guaranteed his safety from the latest in a series of mobs that saw the prophet as a monstrous devil and were repulsed by his polygamous household, disgusted with the uniform that he affected while drilling his militia, and perhaps most disturbed by his confident declaration that his followers would hold sway over the world someday, and perhaps quite soon. They rushed the jail and shot him. He staggered to the sill of a high window, tipped forward, and toppled to his death while calling out ''O Lord my God.'' This cry to heaven drew no recorded response. Perhaps the realm that Smith had long conversed with had nothing more to say to him, or perhaps he'd fabricated his whole career. For Bushman, the fact that his church continues to grow is proof that he was onto something big, though. For logicians, this is tantamount to arguing that Santa Claus probably exists because he gets millions of letters each year from children. But but since logic played almost no part in Joseph Smith's life, it may be fitting that it's largely absent from this respectful biography as well.

HERSHEY
 Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams. 
 By Michael D'Antonio. 
 Illustrated. 305 pp. Simon & Schuster. $25.
''If it's a rule that behind every great fortune lies a great crime, M. S. Hershey was the exception,'' Michael D'Antonio writes in this thorough and highly readable biography of the candy magnate. ''He was the good millionaire.''
 Hershey's rise was quite unlike the ruthless progress of, say, Andrew Carnegie. Hershey was shrewd, but heads were not broken, nor hearts nor even laws. And yet M. S., as he was called, shared the altruistic grandiosity of many of the men Teddy Roosevelt characterized as ''malefactors of great wealth.'' The utopian worker-village he built around his factory in Pennsylvania's Lebanon Valley survived the Great Depression and still draws millions of tourists a year. The street lamps are shaped like Hershey's Kisses. The air smells of chocolate. While some look at Hershey and see either a beneficent angel or a willful tyrant, it is the great charm of D'Antonio's book that he will not plunk entirely for one judgment or the other. It's the man he's after, not the god. 
 Born on a Pennsylvania farm on Sept. 13, 1857, Milton Snavely Hershey was the first son of Fanny Snavely Hershey and Henry Hershey, a freethinking romantic who talked a magnificent life but led a desperate one. ''Tall and lean with a lush black beard, Henry Hershey liked to dress in silk and often carried a gold-capped walking stick,'' D'Antonio writes. Yet the Hersheys were so poor that Fanny ''sometimes 'stripped' her neighbor's cows, milking them after their udders had been emptied, just to get the little that was left.'' Milton left school at the age of 12 and soon began working in sweets. When the Centennial Exposition opened in Philadelphia in 1876, he was there as the proprietor of the Spring Garden Confectionery Works. Financed by his Aunt Mattie, the business prospered for a time with both Fanny and Mattie pitching in. 
 But despite cash infusions from his mother's family, Milton struggled before turning to a product -- Denver-style caramels, made with milk instead of paraffin, which he came across during a brief attempt to establish himself in that city -- that no one else in the East was making. He soon discovered that by increasing the amount of milk he used, along with the fat content, he could make a caramel that wouldn't stick to the teeth. Within five years his Lancaster Caramel Company had more than 700 employees, but Hershey was not satisfied. ''The caramel business is a fad,'' he is supposed to have said after observing the German chocolate machines at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. ''It is not a staple business. But chocolate is something we will always have.''
 Hershey bought those German machines and had them shipped to Lancaster. In a bold move, he sold his caramel company and began laying out plans for a chocolate factory surrounded by a residential neighborhood complete with trolley system, grand public buildings and homes complete with indoor plumbing, which itself was to be surrounded with dairy farms. ''There remained one problem,'' notes D'Antonio. ''Milton Hershey did not know how to mass-produce milk chocolate.''
 The research team often worked 16-hour shifts, and finally the secret -- using skim milk and heating the mixture slowly -- was uncovered. The business took off and the town of Hershey exploded. But it was not paradise for everybody. A minority of workers, D'Antonio writes, looked at Hershey and saw not ''a benevolent creator'' but ''an egotistical captain of industry.'' For example, ''he was so conscious of his status that when a junior office worker made the mistake of asking him for some water, he ceremoniously filled every glass in the room and then fired the man who had said that he was thirsty.''
 Sensible with money at home but extravagant when he traveled, Hershey was a gambler who was devoted to a wife with a mysterious past. The couple had no children, and in 1909 he placed much of his fortune in trust to a school that he started for orphans. By 2002, the school had an estimated endowment of $5 billion -- eight times as large as that of Phillips Exeter Academy, America's next wealthiest private school. When the school's board announced plans to sell its controlling interest in the company and diversify its portfolio, the townspeople united to stop the deal at the last minute, arguing that the loss of local control could threaten the economic security of the town. 
 Hershey's candymaking genius was hardly consistent. He spent years trying to figure out how to ''mix turnips, parsley, celery and even beets into chocolate.'' Even his signature product had -- and still has -- its critics. Compared to Swiss chocolate, D'Antonio writes, Hershey's ''carries a single, faintly sour note,'' the result of the fermentation of milk fat, a side effect of using liquid condensed milk rather than powdered milk. This edge came to ''define the taste of chocolate for Americans, who would find harmony in the sweet but slightly sour flavor.''
 Like his candy, Hershey, who died in 1945, was flawed. Yet these days the openhanded generosity of a founder-owner like Hershey is sorely missed. Millionaires are not as rare as they once were. I can't think of one, however, who has built his workers a whole town.

HEADLINE: How to Succeed in Business

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
STEVEN GAGHAN'S ''Syriana'' is a movie with a lot to say, but it proceeds mainly by understatement. And in a movie full of quiet, enigmatic performances, none is more intriguingly underplayed than Jeffrey Wright's.
 He plays a young black lawyer named Bennett Holiday. The name is almost laughably incongruous, since of all the characters in ''Syriana'' -- none of whom are exactly what you would call lighthearted -- Bennett seems the least disposed toward festivity, or even relaxation. His smiles, which are rare occurrences (he wears his moustache like a second frown) range from dutiful to grim. Even in moments of leisure he has the furrowed intensity of a man hard at work. Here we find him at a backyard barbecue somewhere in Texas, standing beside the gas-fired grill in his tightly knotted necktie and dark pinstriped suit, waiting for a serving of ribs. 
Bennett's host, who shoves the meat around with a pair of tongs, is Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper), swaggering head honcho of the relatively small Killeen oil company. Killeen is trying to merge with a much larger multinational energy outfit called Connex, and Bennett, a young lawyer at a powerful Washington firm, has the dirty job of making sure the deal passes muster with the Justice Department. While Bennett waits for his food, he and Pope argue quietly. They are mostly shown in close-up, on opposite sides of their frame, positioned in a way that suggests both intimacy and distance. The tone is antagonistic, even threatening, but also curiously warm.
 The content of their dialogue is oblique enough to ensure future deniability, and the camera wavers and bobs around them, as if wielded by another guest indulging in a bit of discreet eavesdropping. What, exactly, are we listening to, or for? Something about due diligence, about the growth rate of the Chinese economy, about two criminal convictions, about metaphorical bodies buried deep in the ground. Whatever they are talking about, both men seemed pleased with the results. ''Call me Jimmy,'' the oilman says as he garnishes the visiting lawyer's plate with a sprig of parsley. A few moments earlier, it had been ''Mr. Pope.''
 ''Syriana'' consists, to a large extent, of scenes a lot like this one: brief, elliptical conversations between men. That, in the film's view, is how the business of the world gets conducted, in boardrooms and hotel suites, on luxury yachts where brandy swirls in snifters and at poolside picnics. Characters who speak from the heart or make stirring declarations of principle are marked as losers or pretenders. The ones who really know how to acquire, use and preserve power express themselves obliquely, in whispers, riddles and incomplete sentences.
 This is the language that Bennett Holiday is studying; Jimmy Pope, for all his affectations of folksy directness, is a native speaker. And their colloquy echoes many others that Bennett has had, with men who are generally older and more powerful than he -- or else with his ruined, alcoholic father. Our first glimpse of Bennett is in the garden of his firm's senior partner, a gray eminence named Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) whose influence extends from the C.I.A. to the petroleum-rich kingdoms of the Arabian peninsula. Later we see Bennett with various mentors and superiors, and with a smug Justice Department heavy who wants him to turn on his colleagues and clients. These guys lecture Bennett, they condescend to him, they figure they can bully, bamboozle or use him. After all, he's not one of them: his youth, his race and his too-serious buttoned-up manner all mark him as an outsider, someone who doesn't understand how this game is played.
 The audience's view of him is a little different. In a movie like this -- a thriller that sets out to diagram a web of interlocking conspiracies -- an outsider like Bennett is the kind of person with whom we identify, the one who will expose wrongdoing, cleanse the system of the evil that taints it and explain exactly what is going on. Or so it appears. This character, slyly conceived by Mr. Gaghan and even more slyly incarnated by Mr. Wright, exists to be misunderstood and underestimated. As he endures slights and humiliations from his more comfortable, better-connected colleagues and antagonists, and listens politely to their self-serving guff, the audience relishes the anticipation of revenge. All this corruption, all this arrogance, all this smug Caucasian fat-cat privilege -- who better to deliver the necessary comeuppance than a young, serious, hard-working black man?
 But appearances can be deceiving. The development of Bennett's character -- or rather the revelation that his interests and motives are as ambiguous, as mixed as anyone else's -- represents ''Syriana's'' canniest subversion of the conventions that seem to govern its narrative. Bennett's job is not the unmasking of conspiracies but the delivery of fall guys, and his zeal to accomplish the task is not ethical so much as it is Oedipal. This movie is as much about paternal failure as it is about oil, and it is hardly surprising that Bennett, a disappointed son, should move, in concert with the big-brotherly Jimmy Pope, against one of his symbolic surrogate dads.
 The barbecue scene, which sets up the movie's swift, busy final act, is Bennett's turning point, the moment that his true nature -- a capacity for decisive action, and also for betrayal -- is revealed. He tells Jimmy Pope that Justice (the government bureaucracy, not the abstract ideal) requires ''the illusion of due diligence'' in order for the Connex-Killeen merger to proceed. In practical terms, this means that in addition to an oil executive, someone else big must be sacrificed, and Bennett does not blink when Jimmy Pope suggests selling out someone from his law firm. Will it be Whiting, the Great White Father who seems to pull every string and whose downfall would imply a measure of real (as opposed to merely governmental) justice in compromised, corrupted world? If this were a different kind of movie -- a more usual kind of political thriller -- that might be the case. But while Bennett may be inclined toward patricide, he is far from suicidal. Instead, he will sacrifice a less mighty mentor, serving the interests of free enterprise and his own career in a single clean stroke of the knife. It is not his job to fix the system, but to find a place within it. 
 And why should Bennett Holiday be any different from any of the others? Why assume that he can't speak their language, or play their game? Maybe next time he's down in Texas for a barbecue at Jimmy Pope's place, he'll roll up his sleeves, loosen his tie and enjoy himself for a change.

BYLINE: By DANA VACHON

 BODY:
A GANTLET of paparazzi flanked the entrance to the Guggenheim on the night of the museum's annual Young Collectors Council gala last month. More than 600 young art patrons slowly made their way past the flashbulbs into the main hall, which over the previous 40 hours had been adorned with hundreds of yards of burgundy draperies, 1,000 long-stemmed roses and 6 life-size mechanical bulls on pedestals rising 15 feet into the air. A platoon of 20 waiters in black tie awaited the guests with 180 bottles of Champagne and 144 bottles of vodka.
 Sponsored by Yves Saint Laurent, the event drew scores of models and celebrities like Usher, Damon Dash, Heidi Klum and Linda Evangelista, who mingled with the young professionals and professionally young who make up the Guggenheim's junior group. This was the high point of a season of programs that included visits to artists' studios, tours of the private collections of friends of the museum and, of course, parties: on the first Friday of every month, the Guggenheim transforms itself into the only Frank Lloyd Wright-designed nightclub in New York, and the Young Collectors Council occupies the V.I.P. section.
 After their initial milling about, the guests dropped off their cocktails and walked through a silent auction of works by emerging artists, which served as the focal point of the evening. 
 The Guggenheim was the overt beneficiary, receiving all proceeds from the sales. But the artists, who donated their work, benefited from association with a venerated institution, and bidders benefited from the chance to acquire work that gallery owners usually reserve for more established clients. And everyone benefited from the thrill of dressing up in beautiful clothes, mingling with beautiful people and drinking cocktails -- all in the name of art. ''I'm supposed to meet Damian Loeb here tonight,'' said the young theater scion and nightclub owner Simon Hammerstein, sipping a vodka as he scanned the room for the young and very social hyper-realist painter. ''I think he's amazing.''
 The Guggenheim is not alone in showing a bit of leg to attract future patrons. All the major museums in New York sponsor junior groups, including the Apollo Circle at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Contemporaries at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Junior Associates at MoMA. Accounting for overlaps, there are perhaps as many as 3,000 young New Yorkers buzzing about the junior circuit. Several times a year, the museums roll out the red carpet for them, and all for the same simple reason. 
 ''Hopefully today's young collectors will continue to support the institution, and graduate to our other collecting groups, such as the International Director's Council, or even trustees,'' said Lisa Dennison, the Guggenheim's director.
 Lisa Anastos, the founder and chairwoman of the Whitney Contemporaries, agreed: ''They are the future trustees and the future supporters.''
 Junior museum boards were originally closed, invitation-only groups aimed at the children of established donors. Over the years, however, as the growth in the art market and economy has produced more people with significant wealth and collections than ever before, the boards have opened wider. Today the junior groups are open to anyone who can pay the annual dues (which range from $500 to $1,000), and foot the $150 to $200 needed to attend the galas. And each party is more opulent than the last.
 ''The whole point is to get the youth,'' explained Thomas Hoving, under whose directorship from 1967 to 1977 the Met formed its first junior group. ''A university has alumni. Museums don't. They have to keep their eye on the youth, who will become either wealthy collectors or just wealthy.''
 ''I deliberately tried to steal all of the young people going to the Museum of Modern Art,'' he recalled with evident glee. ''MoMA was where the young people went, because it was in. I wanted the Met to be in.''
 These days a junior gala can raise $100,000 in a night. That is a respectable figure, but for museums the larger dividends of such a gala can come further down the line -- if, that is, the event is handled correctly. The type of people drawn to a gala is every bit as important as the number, and so the group of socialites directing the gala circuit remains quite insular: even as the number of guests has grown, the number of names engraved by Tiffany at the top of a gala's invitation has not. 
 Jacqueline Sackler's name was among those sitting atop the invitation for the Guggenheim gala. As a co-chairwoman for the evening and the sole chairwoman of the Young Collectors Council, she was in high demand as she made her rounds through the museum in a strapless, plum-hued, harlequin-print Yves Saint Laurent gown. ''The mechanical bulls are fantastic,'' she declared, overlooking the party from the first spiral of the galleries. ''Everybody's commenting on them. I think they understood that the rotunda had a certain shape: It's a ring! A Spanish bullfighting ring!'' 
 Under Ms. Sackler's leadership, the Guggenheim has sought out fashion houses to sponsor their galas. Yves Saint Laurent approached last year's event as a tribute to the company's new creative director, Stefano Pilati. Mr. Pilati was immaculate in a navy-blue three-piece suit, his golden hair slicked and shining, as he held court in the rotunda, receiving would-be muses and well-wishers. All seemed curious about his most striking design on display that evening -- the bucking mechanical bulls.
 ''Is a tribute to virility,'' Mr. Pilati proclaimed in beautifully accented Milanese English. ''Is always nice to play with irony. The contradiction is where you find the real sense of the thing.''
 Indeed. At the Apollo Circle gala patrons danced among the shadows of the Temple of Dendur. Patrons entering the Whitney Contemporaries 2004 spring party were greeted by the performance artist Julie Atlas Muz standing nude in a picture frame, and last year's event featured a concert by Rene Risque & the Art Lovers, as well as a hollowed-out ice sculptures through which vodka was served. 
 The more extravagantly stylish a junior gala is, the thinking seems to go, the more likely it is to inspire future generosity. 
 The Whitney has experienced this generosity firsthand. In 1984 Joanne Cassullo joined the Lobby Gallery Associates, a predecessor of the Whitney Contemporaries, and a year later was named to the full board, endowing the museum's Independent Study Program, of which she is a graduate, with a $2.25 million gift from her family foundation. ''When I found out that the program I attended was not endowed, that was what I wanted to do,'' she said. ''I was very serious about the mission of the museum and what it stands for. It helps young artists at a time in their careers when they need this support and recognition.''
 Other museums say they have seen similar results. ''There have been many instances of J. A.'s who have gone on to become major museum benefactors, '' said Angela Goding, program coordinator for MoMA's Junior Associates, though she declined to name any. ''This group inspires a real feeling of loyalty and a sense of camaraderie among its members, and this carries on naturally towards a deeper involvement with the museum.'' 
 For some members, however, the junior groups are little more than discos of excellent provenance. ''It's a really inconspicuous bar tab,'' said one New York University senior, a member of the junior groups of the Met and the Whitney who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of parental reprisal. For others, the galas are a place to meet eligible partners from the right social set under the cover of cultural philanthropy. 
 And yet, for the museums attitudes like that are not necessarily a bad thing -- one way or the other, it is better to be remembered as the site of great parties than not to be remembered at all. 
 MR. HAMMERSTEIN and his date for the evening, Rowan Swanson, are just the sorts of young people that museums are courting. Earlier that month they had met at Art Basel Miami Beach; now here they were in the latest phase of an arts-based courtship. Ms. Swanson, a 21-year-old philosophy major at Columbia University, nursed a pomegranate martini and declined a passing tray of prosciutto-wrapped asparagus. Surveying the assemblage of bulls, she found the opposite of Mr. Pilati's intended delight. ''Irony's over, and we're entering the age of sincerity,'' she declared. Then, brushing her strawberry-blonde hair from her eyes, she admitted, ''It's really Simon's quotation.'' 
 Mr. Hammerstein was still looking about for familiar faces. A brunette across the way caught his attention. ''Is that India Waters?'' he said, referring to the daughter of the Pink Floyd member Roger Waters. Other women soon caught his eye: ''I've got like four ex-girlfriends here. What the hell am I going to do?''
 He found refuge at the auction, stopping before ''Carpet Tapestry,'' a Hernan Bas painting transposed onto carpet in which a young, shirtless man is seemingly drawn through the ocean by a team of swans. Mr. Hammerstein said that he did not like the work, but considered bidding on it all the same. ''I just think it is in such bad taste that it would be funny,'' he said. ''An androgynous boy? Lying on a canoe? Being towed by swans? My favorite!''
 He didn't win the carpet, but on his way back into the party finally ran into Damian Loeb, who was moving about the rotunda taking candid shots of the junior patrons from odd angles. He soon began photographing of Mr. Hammerstein and Ms. Swanson.
 For his part, Mr. Hammerstein seemed more comfortable as a collector of art than as a subject for it. He moved through a series of awkward poses before resuming his normal posture. ''How do I know Simon?'' Mr. Loeb asked rhetorically. ''It's my lifelong goal to beat him at Scrabble, and I'll put up with him until I do. That, and he has a lovely country home and makes great macaroni-and-cheese.''
 Artist and collector both laughed at the joke, but Mr. Loeb was serious when asked what had drawn him to the Guggenheim gala: ''I hope to be involved in the museum in the way that any artist hopes to be involved in the museum.'' 
 Soon after, the bars ran out of Champagne and the crowd grew thin. Mr. Loeb went home with his wife; Ms. Swanson went home to study for an exam. But the rest of the party took up temporary residence in a fleet of yellow cabs moving downtown to Bungalow 8, a nightclub that doubles as a museum of living celebrity. When Mr. Hammerstein arrived, he found Bungalow's palm-tree lined floor teeming with the Guggenheim's young patrons. The hip-hop mogul Damon Dash soon entered with his wife, Rachel Roy, followed by Ms. Sackler and her husband, Mortimer, a full trustee of the museum. The photographer Peter Beard moved about the floor in a blue Hawaiian shirt, gin-and-tonic in hand, greeting friends made in years and seconds past.
 By all accounts, the junior patrons had excellent cause for celebration. After all, someone had successfully bid on the carpet of the androgynous boy towed by swans. And $168,500 had been raised for the Guggenheim, through the magical interaction of cocktails, flashbulbs, prosciutto-wrapped asparagus and mechanical bulls.

HEADLINE: When Talk of Guns and Butter Includes Lives Lost

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
AS the toll of American dead and wounded mounts in Iraq, some economists are arguing that the war's costs, broadly measured, far outweigh its benefits.
 Studies of previous wars focused on the huge outlays for military operations. That is still a big concern, along with the collateral impact on such things as oil prices, economic growth and interest on the debt run up to pay for the war. Now some economists have added in the dollar value of a life lost in combat, and that has fed antiwar sentiment.
''The economics profession in general is paying more attention to the cost of lives cut short or curtailed by injury and illness,'' said David Gold, an economist at the New School. ''The whole tobacco issue has encouraged this research.'' 
 The economics of war is a subject that goes back centuries. But in the cost-benefit analyses of past American wars, a soldier killed or wounded in battle was typically thought of not as a cost but as a sacrifice, an inevitable and sad consequence in achieving a victory that protected and enhanced the country. The victory was a benefit that offset the cost of death. 
 That halo still applies to World War II, which sits in the American psyche as a defensive war in response to attack. The lives lost in combat helped preserve the nation, and that is a considerable and perhaps immeasurable benefit.
 Through the cold war, economists generally avoided calculations of the cost of a human life. Even during Vietnam, the focus of economic studies was on guns and butter -- the misguided insistence of the Johnson administration that America could afford a full-blown war and uncurtailed civilian spending. The inflation in the 1970's was partly a result of the Vietnam era.
 Cost-benefit analysis, applied to war, all but ceased after Vietnam and did not pick up again until the fall of 2002 as President Bush moved the nation toward war in Iraq. ''We are doing this research again,'' said William D. Nordhaus, a Yale economist, ''because the Iraq war is so contentious.''
 Mr. Nordhaus is the economist who put the subject back on the table with the publication of a prescient prewar paper that compared the coming conflict to a ''giant role of the dice.'' He warned that ''if the United States had a string of bad luck or misjudgments during or after the war, the outcome could reach $1.9 trillion,'' once all the secondary costs over many years were included.
 So far, the string of bad luck has materialized, and Mr. Nordhaus's forecast has been partially fulfilled. In recent studies by other economists, the high-end estimates of the war's actual cost, broadly measured, are already moving into the $1 trillion range. For starters, the outlay just for military operations totaled $251 billion through December, and that number is expected to double if the war runs a few more years.
 The researchers add to this the cost of disability payments and of lifelong care in Veterans Administration hospitals for the most severely injured -- those with brain and spinal injuries, roughly 20 percent of the 16,000 wounded so far. Even before the Iraq war, these outlays were rising to compensate the aging veterans of World War II and Korea. But those wars were accepted by the public, and the costs escape public notice.
 Not so Iraq. In a war that has lost much public support, the costs stand out and the benefits -- offsetting the costs and justifying the war -- are harder to pinpoint. In a paper last September, for example, Scott Wallsten, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and Katrina Kosec, a research assistant, listed as benefits ''no longer enforcing U.N. sanctions such as the 'no-fly zone' in northern and southern Iraq and people no longer being murdered by Saddam Hussein's regime.'' 
 Such benefits, they found, fall well short of the costs. ''Another possible impact of the conflict, is a change in the probability of future major terrorist attacks,'' they wrote. ''Unfortunately, experts do not agree on whether the war has increased or decreased this probability. Clearly, whether the direct benefits of the war exceed the costs ultimately relies at least in part on the answer to that question.'' 
 The newest research was a paper posted last week on the Web (www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/cost--of--war--in--iraq.pdf) by two antiwar Democrats from the Clinton administration: Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University and Linda Bilmes, now at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Their upper-end, long-term cost estimate tops $1 trillion, based on the death and damage caused by the war to date. They assumed an American presence in Iraq through at least 2010, and their estimate includes the war's contribution to higher domestic petroleum prices. They also argue that while military spending has contributed to economic growth, that growth would have been greater if the outlays had gone instead to highways, schools, civilian research and other more productive investment.
 The war has raised the cost of Army recruiting, they argue, and has subtracted from income the wages given up by thousands of reservists who left civilian jobs to fight in Iraq at lower pay. 
 JUST as Mr. Wallsten and Ms. Kosec calculated the value of life lost in battle or impaired by injury, so did Mr. Stiglitz and Ms. Bilmes -- putting the loss at upwards of $100 billion. That is more than double the Wallsten-Kosec estimate. Both studies draw on research undertaken since Vietnam by W. Kip Viscusi, a Harvard law professor. 
 The old way of valuing life calculated the present value of lost earnings, a standard still used by the courts to compensate accident victims, generally awarding $500,000 a victim, at most. Mr. Viscusi, however, found that Americans tend to value risk differently. He found that society pays people an additional $700 a year, on average, to take on risky work in hazardous occupations. Given one death per 10,000 risk-takers, on average, the cost to society adds up to $7 million for each life lost, according to Mr. Viscusi's calculation. Mr. Stiglitz and Ms. Bilmes reduced this number to about $6 million, keeping their estimate on the conservative side, as they put it. 
 None of the heroism or sacrifice for country shows up in the recent research, and for a reason.
 ''We did not have to fight this war, and we did not have to go to war when we did,'' Mr. Stiglitz said. ''We could have waited until we had more safe body armor and we chose not to wait.''

HEADLINE: Becoming Jane Addams

BYLINE: By Alan Wolfe. 
Alan Wolfe directed the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College and is writing a book on whether democracy still works.

 BODY:
CITIZEN
 Jane Addams and the Struggle for Democracy.
 By Louise W. Knight. 
 Illustrated. 582 pp. 
 The University of Chicago Press. $35.
IN 1894, the Pullman Car Works, a paternalistic Chicago firm, announced a wage cut and its workers went on strike. Jane Addams, who had founded Hull House in Chicago five years earlier as a place of refuge and support for the poor, was stunned by the class antagonism that followed. ''Nothing in my experience,'' she wrote many years later, had prepared her for ''that distinct cleavage of society which a general strike at least momentarily affords.'' Unsure what to make of it all, Addams walked four and a half miles to the new statue of Abraham Lincoln created by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, where she brooded over the inscription, a reiteration of the Emancipator's call for charity to all, and then walked back to Hull House. 
 Did Jane Addams approach Lincoln as an equal? Or course not, for no one in American history rivals Lincoln's stature. Yet Addams would go on to become one of the greatest of Americans, and the pilgrimage she made to Lincoln Park, as Louise W. Knight relates in ''Citizen,'' was a key stop along the way. Before the Pullman strike --and the simultaneous death of her sister Mary -- Addams was a product of the small-town Midwest in which she was raised. Strongly shaped by the evangelical convictions of her father, she was as paternalistic, if in her own way, as George Pullman. Poor people lacked refinement; her task was to bring them culture. Sympathy, not solidarity, motivated her. She would teach the poor of Chicago Shakespeare and Goethe, and along the way, she would impress upon them the importance of virtue and the evils of vice.
 The experience of the Pullman strike -- indeed, experience itself -- changed Jane Addams. She had developed a friendship with the University of Chicago philosopher John Dewey, and Dewey's pragmatism opened her to the idea that conflict was a fact of social life, even a sign of progress, not some deviation from an idealistic yearning for harmony. Examining with fresh eyes the realities of fin-de-siecle Chicago, Addams came to understand the role that powerful financial and political interests played in maintaining systems of social stratification. Devastating economic depressions and bitter class conflict, along with the insights of her Hull House colleague Florence Kelley, forced Addams to confront her belief in benevolence, which she increasingly saw as ''self-righteous'' and ''egotistical.'' By the last years of the 19th century, the modern Jane Addams had been born, a determined social reformer, advocate of women's suffrage, opponent of the Spanish-American War, and powerful writer and political thinker.
 Oddly, Knight stops her book at precisely the moment when the greatness of Jane Addams begins to emerge; ''Citizen'' ends in 1899, even though Addams, who would win the Nobel Prize in 1931, died in 1935. A half-life does not a biography make, but Knight is not really writing a biography; her book is what the Germans call a bildung, an account of how a person's character is formed. As it happens, Knight's decision to focus on Addams's early years is a stroke of genius. We know a great deal about Jane Addams the public figure. We know relatively little about how she made the transition from the 19th century to the 20th. In Knight's book, Jane Addams comes to life.
 Addams was raised by three women; her mother died when she was 2*, after which her older sister Mary and her eventual stepmother played major roles in her upbringing. But it was her father who dominated Jane's childhood. A successful businessman and devout Christian, John Addams corresponded with Abraham Lincoln and was an avid supporter of the Italian republican Giuseppe Mazzini. A man of his times, he wanted Jane close to home and constantly thwarted her dream of attending Smith College. But he was the kind of Christian who, believing that individuals ought to find their own path to God, never joined a church or subscribed to a creed. His daughter inherited much of the same disposition. Although under pressure from neighbors and teachers to convert, she resisted, and while her ideas would be shaped by Christianity, Jane Addams would never become a conventionally religious person.
 Addams was an outstanding student at Rockford Seminary, where she met Ellen Gates Starr, with whom she would found Hull House. (Addams and Starr were a couple; whether they were celibate is known only to them.) For a woman expected eventually to settle into domesticity, Addams's early life brought her unusually close to public events. The son of a close family friend was the immortal disappointed office seeker who assassinated President Garfield. When a senior at Rockford, she participated in a debate dominated by men and placed fifth of nine; in second place stood an Illinois College student named William Jennings Bryan. Addams traveled extensively in Europe, where she met the leaders of Toynbee Hall in London, the inspiration for her efforts in Chicago.
 After a personal crisis brought on by the descent of her brother into mental illness, Addams moved to Chicago, using her family inheritance to rent a large house on Halsted Street, in the heart of the immigrant world that Chicago had become. Knight's book is filled with fascinating detail about everyday life at Hull House, from the way residents were selected, to the fund-raising difficulties that emerged as Addams exhausted her personal wealth, to an absorbing account of Addams's life as a Chicago garbage inspector. Knight's extensive research and straightforward narrative allow readers to watch Addams gain self-confidence, survive a breakup with Starr and the formation of a new relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, wrestle with her desire to help immigrants even as she disdains much about their way of life, and try to establish democracy at Hull House while remaining reluctant to cede control of its destiny.
 ''Citizen'' has a larger story to tell than that of Jane Addams's moral formation. Knight wants her readers to believe that the hardheaded and politically engaged Addams is preferable to the idealistic, Christian-influenced and morally absolutist one. Her argument on this point is not completely convincing. For one thing, Addams retained much of her early idealism later in life. She changed the world around her, not only because of her political activism but because of her moral persuasion. The reforms she helped midwife and the social justice she fostered came about because she, like Lincoln, appealed to the better angels of our nature.
 More important, the progressive Jane Addams is familiar to us, and familiarity breeds complacency; we already know that privilege is unjust or that the powerful play unfairly. The thinkers who influenced the earlier Jane Addams -- the British philosopher T. H. Green, the Social Christian economist Richard Ely, Samuel and Henrietta Barnett of Toynbee Hall -- may be out-of-date, but in today's cynical political environment, their idealism is refreshing. Once, in 1895, a British couple visiting Hull House left their shoes outside their bedroom door, expecting that someone would polish them. Finding the shoes, Jane Addams did exactly that. Today's politically engaged leftist would be appalled. But for Addams, little acts of kindness led to large acts of compassion. 
 For all her identification with the mature Jane Addams, Knight, an independent scholar, has something in common with the woman who polished those shoes. ''Citizen'' is written neither to make money norto gain academic tenure; it is a gift, meant to enlighten and improve. Jane Addams would have understood.

HEADLINE: In Tiny Arab State, Web Takes On Ruling Elite

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Abeer Allam contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain 

 BODY:
Ali Abdulemam, this country's most notorious blogger, sat in the boxlike reception room of his father's house in a cramped Shiite village dotted with raw cinder-block houses, trying to log onto the widely popular Web site that he founded. 
 The government on this flyspeck of an island nation, home to an American Navy base, recently renewed its effort to block dozens of opposition Web sites. So Mr. Abdulemam, 28, a computer engineer, had to spend about 10 minutes whipping through various computer servers around the world before finally pulling up his Web site, BahrainOnline.org.
It was National Day, Dec. 16, and some five miles away, the beautifully landscaped boulevards of Manama, the capital, were packed with revelers enjoying bands and fireworks. Pictures of the ruling princes blanketed the city, which was also awash in the national colors, red and white. Red and white lights were even wrapped around the palm trees lining the main thoroughfares.
 But most of the couple of hundred people posting messages in the ''National Forum'' section of BahrainOnline mocked the idea of celebrating the day in 1971 when a Sunni Muslim king ascended the throne to rule over a Shiite Muslim majority. 
 ''In Bahrain, glorifying the king means glorifying the nation, and opposing the king means betraying the homeland and working for foreign countries,'' wrote one online participant, noting that the formula is the mark of a dictatorship. ''Should we be loyal to the king or to Bahrain?''
 Bahrain, long a regional financial hub and a prime example of the power of the Internet to foment discontent, bills itself as a leader of political change in the Arab world. It is a claim echoed in praise from the United States, which considers Bahrain crucial for its many regional military ventures because the American Navy's Fifth Fleet is based here. 
 But in Bahrain, as across the Arab world, those pushing for democratic change want to end minority rule by a family, sect or a military clique. 
 The royal family here dominates, holding half the cabinet positions and the major posts in the security services and the University of Bahrain. 
 Sheik Muhammad al-Khalifa, the prince who runs the Economic Development Board, argues that Bahrain should not become a democracy in the Western sense. ''As traditional Arabs, I don't think democracy is part of our nature,'' he said.
 ''I think all people want is accountability,'' he added, noting that some form of democracy was needed to achieve that.
 So political change in the Middle East rests partly on whether and how the many minority governments will yield power and allow others to participate. So far, the results are anemic.
 The al-Saud tribe slapped its name on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where local elections a year ago have not produced active municipal councils, and crucial issues like how much oil wealth the ruling family absorbs are not discussed. 
 In Syria, the ruling Assad family and its confederates from the Alawite minority sect are in crisis, accused of assassinating Rafik Hariri, a former Sunni prime minister of Lebanon and an important figure who might have been able to rally majority support against the Alawites' monopoly on power. 
 Of course, Iraq remains the biggest experiment of all in changing the practice of minority rule. The American occupation has yet to answer whether it is possible to forge a democratic government in the Arab world, or if the attempt will drown in a cauldron of sectarian bloodshed. But the results are being closely watched, perhaps nowhere more than in Bahrain, where up to 70 percent of its native population of 450,000 are Shiites, similar to Iraq's Shiite-Sunni split. Shiites here also increasingly look to moderate religious leaders in Iraq for guidance.
 Some political change has occurred. Debate is growing through the Internet, satellite television and other forces, and elections this year will replace the Parliament and municipal councils first chosen in 2002 under a new Constitution. Members of the ruling Khalifa family describe this as a vibrant process that will ultimately establish a local strain of democracy. Yet some of its most senior members and their Sunni allies hint that the process is threatened because Bahrain's Shiites disloyally serve outside interests like the Shiites in Iran and Iraq. 
 Members of the opposition call this nonsense and accuse the ruling dynasty of questioning their loyalty to avoid having to share power. They say King Hamad and his Khalifa clan, descendants of Bedouins from the Arabian mainland who conquered this island, taking it from its Persian masters in the 18th century, will only make cosmetic changes, noting that almost nothing has been done to alleviate the entrenched discrimination faced by the poorest segments of the Shiite population. 
 ''The problem with the royal family is that when they give us any democracy they think that it is a gift and we have to thank them for it,'' Mr. Abdulemam said. ''The time when they were the lords and we were the slaves is gone. The new generation is well educated. They won't live like our fathers did in the past, when they said O.K. to whatever the royal family did.''

A 'Golden Time' Cut Short
 Bahrain's first Parliament, elected in 1973, proved too boisterous for King Hamad's father, who dissolved it after 18 months. Opposition demands to restore it increased through the 1990's, marked by bombings and other sporadic violence. The authoritarian government subjected the mostly Shiite opposition political activists to arrest, torture and forced exile. 
 When King Hamad, now 55, inherited power in 1999, he promised a democracy that he described as ''areeqa'' or ''well rooted.'' 
 He announced changes that included amnesty for exiles and the disbanding of the dreaded State Security Courts. Bahrainis enthusiastically approved the new plan in a public referendum. 
 It was then that Mr. Abdulemam established his groundbreaking Web site, determined to give Bahrainis a place to share ideas and develop plans to deepen political change. ''It seemed like a golden time, when the country was moving from one period in its history to another,'' he said. ''Everybody needed a place to talk so I provided it.''
 But King Hamad soon hit the brakes. In 2002 he announced a new Constitution, formulated without public consultation. 
 The cabinet, led by his uncle, a hard-liner opposing democratic change, would report to him, not the Parliament. Instead of a single 40-member Parliament, he added an appointed upper house. Amending the Constitution now required a two-thirds majority of both houses, giving the monarch full control. Parliament now could only propose laws, not write them. An audit bureau that had previously reported to Parliament was replaced with one that would not subject the spending of the royal court or the 2,500 royal family members to any public scrutiny. 
 ''I had been full of hope that a new era was coming to Bahrain,'' Mr. Abdulemam said. ''But what happened next threw us all in the dirt. When the king brought in the new Constitution, everyone was crushed.''

Politics in the Internet Age
 In the old days, with its monopoly over television and radio and the ability to shut down newspapers, the Khalifa dynasty would have had less trouble controlling the debate. Now, with the Internet and satellite television outside its reach, the government resorts to tactics like tossing Mr. Abdulemam and two of his fellow Web masters into jail for a couple of weeks, as it did last year. 
 At the time, the opposition orchestrated repeated demonstrations and international intervention to help win his release, but legal charges of insulting the king, incitement and disseminating false news remain pending and can be dredged up at any time. 
 One reason the Internet is so popular -- scores of villages have their own Web sites and chat rooms -- is that far more can be said about the ruling family online than through any other means. 
 ''Freedom of expression is something you have to take, not something that will be granted to you,'' Mr. Abdulemam said, but he doubts that free speech alone will accomplish much. ''Their policy basically comes down to, 'Say what you want and we will do what we want.' '' 
 BahrainOnline is the go-to political site, with princes, Parliament members, opposition leaders and others with an interest in politics saying they consult it daily to find out what the opposition is thinking. 
 The easiest way to ensure a large turnout for any demonstration, the leader of the main Shiite opposition group said, is to post the announcement for it on BahrainOnline.
 ''If something happens anywhere in Bahrain, usually within five minutes maximum something about it is happening on my site,'' Mr. Abdulemam said. 
 Still, the site's Web masters are often criticized for creating a ''tabloid'' that spreads rumors and demeans those considered enemies. Ghada Jamsheer, a women's rights advocate who criticized the Shiite clergy for opposing a proposed law that would give more defined divorce rights to women, said her face was pasted onto a naked body. 
 Mr. Abdulemam said his site was blamed for trash posted on any site in Bahrain, and his Web masters, monitoring as many as 1,000 posts a day, remove anything that promotes violence. He laughs when he recalls his arrest and how little his interrogators knew about how the Internet works, blaming him for the content of every posting. 
 Mansour Jamri, editor of a daily newspaper, Wasat, and the son of a famous Shiite opposition cleric, notes that many of those writing on the Web sites are very young. 
 ''If you don't shout with them you are a corrupt person, you are basically a dog used by the government,'' said Mr. Jamri, who has been portrayed as just that. 
 Part of the issue is that the press remains hobbled. When Abd al-Hadi al-Khawaja, a prominent human rights advocate, was arrested in late 2004 after giving a speech attacking the prime minister over corruption, no newspaper printed what he had said. For that people had to turn to BahrainOnline. 
 ''This pocket of anarchy is a byproduct of half-hearted democracy,'' Mr. Jamri said. 

Simmering Frustrations
 In 2002, BahrainOnline led a fight to boycott the elections. As a result, Shiites mostly stayed away from the polls, and the vote exacerbated the sense among Shiites that the Khalifas and their Sunni allies were not interested in treating them as equals. 
 Election districts were gerrymandered so that sparsely populated Sunni districts in the south got almost as many members as the heavily Shiite villages in the north. Opposition groups amassed evidence that the government gave passports to various Sunni Muslim groups, including members of a tribe in Saudi Arabia that had once lived on Bahrain, to alter voting demographics.
 Ultimately, Sunnis captured 27 of the 40 seats in the election. As in many parts of the Muslim world, fundamentalists were the best organized, and a group of Sunni fundamentalists became the largest bloc in Parliament. They muted any opposition to the government out of concern that it might help spread the influence of Shiite Islam.
 The new Parliament spent half its time bickering over religious practice. It won a fight to allow fully veiled women to drive. It proposed a ban on scantily clad window mannequins. It tried to separate the sexes in all classrooms. Last year, alcohol sales were banned during a Muslim holiday -- a time when tens of thousands of visitors arrive from Saudi Arabia to drink. 
 What Parliament did not do was really confront the government over a chronic housing shortage and unemployment, particularly among Shiites. The gap between the largely Sunni haves and the Shiite have-nots grows ever more apparent and feeds simmering frustration. 
 Mr. Abdulemam, for example, earns a decent salary as a computer engineer at an American-owned company. With a wife who is expecting their first child any day, he can not afford $130,000 for a plot of land and does not ever expect to be able to. 
 He is the youngest of 10 siblings, 4 of whom still live with their children in his father's house. Some 15 people live there, with each nuclear family allotted a room. ''I know we deserve better,'' he said. 
 Exact numbers are hard to pin down in Bahrain, but about 27,000 applications are pending for subsidized government housing, senior officials concede. Unemployment stands officially at 15 percent but runs as high as 28 percent among Shiite young adults ages 20 to 24, diplomats and Bahraini economists said. 
 Opposition members accuse the royal family of monopolizing all available land, and say an expatriate community of 250,000 -- from Asia and other Arab countries -- blocks Shiites from most decent jobs. Shiites avoid some tough jobs like construction and are generally barred from joining the security services. Royal family members concede that more needs to be done to improve housing but deny hoarding land. A job training program is to begin this month.
 Last spring, the committee in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that monitors racial discrimination rebuked Bahrain. The report said that although Bahrain paid lip service in its laws to barring discrimination, actual practice lagged. 
 When Mr. Abdulemam was arrested in February 2005, he found that his interrogator was an Egyptian, one of hundreds of Sunni Muslims from the Arab world and Pakistan recruited into the security services, given houses and usually citizenship.
 ''He was asking me whether I was loyal to this country,'' Mr. Abdulemam said sourly. ''How can an Egyptian ask me about my loyalty? There are many ways to love your country, and what I do is one of them.''
 The poverty suffered by many Shiites seems particularly galling to them given the real estate boom. The capital's skyline is dominated by gargantuan luxury office blocs under construction, which Bahrainis contend are all owned by the royal family. The capital is also plastered with ads for housing developments like Riffa Heights, an upscale community with sea views and a golf course in a plush neighborhood already dominated by royal palaces where Shiites cannot buy land. 
 Senior officials call it all essential development to attract investment to Bahrain, long the Persian Gulf's financial hub but one competing increasingly with far richer emirates like Dubai and Qatar.
 The young, American-educated crown prince even used a huge tract to build a $150 million Formula 1 racing circuit. Talal al-Zain, the investment banker who is the raceway's chairman, lauded it as a means of putting Bahrain on the international map. The track seems to baffle Bahrainis. For special races on National Day only about 500 people, most of them foreigners, sat in stands built for 30,000. One Web site mocks the crown prince, Sheik Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, as ''Salman Schumacher,'' a reference to Michael Schumacher, a top racer.
 Formally, the Bush administration has declared that it supports democratic change across the region, that the United States will no longer laud despots just because they back American policy. ''Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain,'' President Bush said in his 2005 State of the Union address.
 Practically, though, the United States has not pushed for sweeping change out of concern for what might happen if states fell into the hands of Islamists. 
 The Khalifas court the Bush administration particularly well. The foreign minister, Sheik Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, noted that a proposed port might provide the deep-water docking space needed for the aircraft carriers that now have to anchor offshore. Such cooperation has earned Bahrain a free-trade deal and praise from Mr. Bush. 

A Shiite-Sunni Divide
 During a protest march on National Day, some of the participants chanted ''Death to Khalifa!'' referring to Sheik Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, 69, who has remained prime minister since independence in 1971. They yelled it in Arabic and Persian, the language of Shiite Iran. 
 With Iraq holding so much of the people's attention here, much the way Iran did after its revolution, the question is whether developments in Iraq will lead Bahrain to more sectarianism or more democracy. Signs of both exist. Some postings on BahrainOnline include portraits of prominent Iranian ayatollahs past and present, particularly Khomeini and Ali Khamenei. Members of the ruling family generally use such displays to buttress the accusation that the basic goal of the Shiites is to establish an Iranian-style theocracy in Bahrain. 
 But Shiites here respond that the ayatollahs are strictly spiritual guides and that native Shiites have lived in Bahrain longer than the ruling family and have no intention of living under the thrall of yet another foreign power. To counter the accusation that their loyalties lie outside Bahrain, the Shiite activists stopped hoisting such pictures at rallies. 
 ''The new Iraq is the model,'' said Sheik Ali Salman, the 40-year-old Shiite cleric elected to lead Al Wifaq Islamic Society, the main Shiite opposition group, and a man who once organized rallies denouncing the American invasion of Iraq. The expectation that Shiites will dominate the Iraqi government has given Shiites across the region new confidence. 
 Speaking fluent English learned during five years of exile in Britain, the cleric ticks off all the steps Iraqis have taken toward choosing their own leaders in the same period that King Hamad has been busy consolidating power while warning against moving too quickly to carry out change. 
 Most Shiites follow one senior cleric on matters of religious practice in their daily lives. Mr. Abdulemam said he used to look to Khomeini in Iran, but recently switched to Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the moderate and powerful Shiite cleric in Iraq.
 Sunnis in Bahrain are at times incensed when Shiites fax Ayatollah Sistani questions, like asking him whether they must obey traffic laws, because King Hamad is not, in their view, a legitimate Islamic ruler. (He faxed back to say yes, they do.)
 Where many Shiites here used to watch Al Manar, the satellite channel broadcast from Beirut by the militant Shiite group Hezbollah, they have switched to the Iraqi-run Euphrates channel. When a bombing kills Shiites in Iraq, some in Bahrain wear black.
 Shiites and Sunnis silently assess all events in Iraq, which are both feeding democratic yearnings and deepening the divisions between them. 
 ''If a Sunni area is bombed, the Sunnis wish it was a Shiite area; they don't say it, but they feel it,'' said Sheik Khalid al-Khalifa, a prince and an academic who serves on the Shura Council, the appointed upper house of Parliament. ''It's the same for the Shiites. It's all reflected here.''

HEADLINE: Take Cover, Children, Here Comes an Avalanche of E-Mail 

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Great Neck, N.Y. 

 BODY:
YIKES.
 Last Sunday's column about two suburban parents trying to dial back the overprogrammed, oversupervised lockdown that is modern childhood drew such a flood of impassioned e-mail messages that it seemed worth revisiting.
''Boy -- did you ever strike a nerve!!'' was a typical response, this one from Jane Stein of Portland, Ore. ''I'm a 56-year-old woman who grew up in Levittown, Long Island. I remember the good ol' days when I was 13/14 years old and I was considered old enough to go to the Hicksville L.I.R.R. station, get on the train, and ride into the city by myself to meet up with friends. I can also remember the endless freedom I had riding my Schwinn bicycle all over the place, alone, to visit friends in other parts of Levittown, East Meadow, Wantagh, Seaford, Plainview, Bethpage, Hicksville and Westbury and coming home at dark totally unscathed and without a cellphone I feel very sorry for children growing up today.'' 
 Like the empty landscape last week, on the street in Great Neck where my friends and I used to play every day after school (Good news: They've added ''Slow -- Children Playing'' signs. Bad news: No children playing), most of the responses made the same point: We didn't always have a world of hovering parents and lockdown kids. How do we get out of here?
 Nostalgia for the joys -- real or imagined -- of one's own childhood is eternal, as is the sense that each generation of children is headed for perdition in its own way. 
 But clearly there's more than nostalgia at work. And what's different is a sense not that wayward children are headed toward Hades, but that parents are insisting on chauffeuring them there in their S.U.V.'s. ''Kids' lives today are better in every measurable way except the ways that count the most,'' said Steven Mintz, author of ''Huck's Raft: A History of American Childhood.'' ''And I'm not talking about the poorest kids, I'm talking about privileged kids and middle-class kids. What they lack is something we have the power to give them and don't want to give them -- the freedom to experiment, to undergo odysseys of self-discovery, to experience the same kind of risks you and I experienced, and now we're scared to death of doing that.''
 As correspondents noted, many caveats are in order. First this analysis largely misses the different concerns of poor kids. Second, the syndrome is worst along the coasts and in high-aspiration pockets in other cities. So, as one woman from Madison, Wis., wrote, whatever angst there is in Scarsdale hasn't necessarily made its way to Madison, Iowa City or Grand Forks. 
 Others noted that people make their choices. If they want the huge house in New Canaan, Conn., or Bedford, N.Y., that's fine. But there are plenty of more modest locales where children live in real neighborhoods with other children around. 
 BUT, if we care about kids at all, there are at least four big issues here. One is the physical environment: how much do we want to create bike paths, have sidewalks, think of communities as accessible and connected, or assume that suburbia just means disconnected sprawl? 
 Two is technology. It's one reason childhood is so maddening now. On the one hand, they know more, have access to more, can communicate more -- from a distance -- than any children in history. On the other hand, their real-life interactions all play out in a bell jar. This does not compute.
 Third is school. Just how much do we need to turn the pressure up, demand more advanced placement courses, start college planning in middle school? Right now schooling, and test prep gobble up all else. No wonder they don't have time to play, and childhood obesity is out of control.
 And fourth is the hysteria of so many parents -- about crime, about academic achievement, about every element of children's lives. Forget that, for example, the number of juveniles murdered in the United States in 2003, the latest year for which federal statistics are available, was the lowest since 1984. Today, parents have fewer children, are more worried about safety and economic status, and have more of themselves invested in their children's lives than what's good for them or their kids. 
 Maybe the lockdown childhood won't have horrible consequences. Children manage to adapt to almost anything, so maybe they'll survive childhood in the padded cell and the college binge drinking that follows and go on their merry way.
 But they get to be kids only once. They deserve better.
 ''I'd still like to explore the world through my eyes, without being guarded every moment,'' wrote Akshara Narsipur, a 12-year-old from Ossining. ''Because, the way I see it, there's an adventure around every corner, waiting to be discovered. Just thought you'd like a kid's opinion on it.''

HEADLINE: Laos, Apparently Without Bird Flu, Is Still Pressed by the West to Join Global Fight

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Khamla Sengdavong, the manager of a state-owned farm here, still remembers his horror and dismay when bird flu suddenly killed a quarter of the farm's 2,000 chickens in five days in January 2004.
 ''They bled from the nose and the backs of their heads turned purple and then black, and then they died,'' he said, gesturing with his hands.
 But bird flu seems to have disappeared almost as quickly as it appeared in Laos, and Mr. Khamla and others in this impoverished Communist country on China's southern border have restocked their coops. 
 Not one human case of bird flu was ever confirmed in Laos, and thousands of chickens have been tested in recent months without finding the slightest trace of the disease. 
 Despite the seeming disappearance of bird flu here, it has consumed most of the time and attention of Laos's best doctors and veterinarians for the past two years. 
 Pressed by United Nations agencies, the United States, the European Union and other big donors, top officials at the health and agriculture ministries have set aside previous priorities -- deadly scourges like tetanus, rabies, swine fever and poultry cholera -- to focus on a disease that could someday set off a global epidemic but poses less of an immediate threat here.
 As the global effort to combat bird flu has increased, Laos and other poor countries have become the front lines, expected to manage extensive programs to battle bird flu despite struggling to marshal enough doctors and veterinarians against diseases even in the best of times.
 Next week, those pressures will reach a new level when health ministers, leaders of United Nations agencies and top officials from the World Bank and other lending institutions gather in Beijing to raise as much as $1.5 billion to fight bird flu.
 Almost nobody questions that a global campaign is needed to stop the disease: if the bird flu virus, A(H5N1), evolves to be able to pass easily from person to person in the next few years, it could kill enormous numbers of people. But health experts are starting to raise questions about the trade-offs involved in such a huge effort.
 The danger, even some managers of bird flu programs are starting to say, is that donors focus so intently on a single disease that they unintentionally disrupt many other health programs. ''We could overlook that people could quite literally be dying because of this,'' said Finn Reske-Nielsen, the top United Nations official in Laos.
 In separate interviews, Mr. Reske-Nielsen and two of Laos's top disease fighters -- Dr. Phengta Vongphrachanh, the country's foremost epidemiologist; and Dr. Somphanh Chanphengxay, the director of veterinary planning -- said continued routine testing had not yet shown a resurgence here of other diseases despite the preoccupation with bird flu. But they and other officials in Laos and at aid agencies elsewhere said participants in the Beijing conference would face a series of hard choices.
 Among the first of those trade-offs will be between short-term programs, useful mostly for fighting bird flu, and longer-term programs that may carry broader health benefits but do less to stamp out bird flu this winter or next winter.
 The Asian Development Bank, a Manila-based multilateral lending institution like the World Bank, is one of the first organizations to start worrying about the bird flu trade-offs, partly because it has already had to make a hard choice.
 Indu Bhushan, the leader of the bank's bird flu task force, said that after approving a $40 million preventive health program in Vietnam last year, the bank decided this winter to turn the effort into a bird flu project instead, saving time over having to design a program from scratch.
 The redesigned project will still address other communicable diseases, like dengue fever, because it may improve detection. But it will no longer cover noncommunicable diseases like hypertension and diabetes, Mr. Bhushan said.
 He noted that the Asian Development Bank was also preparing $68 million in new grants for bird flu that do not involve taking money from other programs. But he said it would be important at the Beijing conference that donors not redirect large sums previously approved for other programs.
 ''While emergency response is great, let's not get carried away here,'' he said.
 The emerging debate over spending on bird flu closely parallels the debate in the 1990's over whether donor nations were paying so much attention to AIDS in the developing world that they were neglecting diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. That debate has helped lead to increased aid for research into tropical diseases, mostly from rich countries and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
 Following that example, it is possible that bird flu may yet prompt broader and more strings-free aid to poor countries in areas like veterinary care. But for now, much of the money being offered to poor countries to fight bird flu involves loans, not grants. 
 And health officials in poor countries are leery of borrowing heavily; no country has yet tapped the Asian Development Bank's $300 million in loans available for bird flu programs.
 Laos is one of the world's poorest countries, rivaling Chad in Central Africa in having one of the world's highest maternal death rates -- problems related to pregnancy kill one mother for every 2,000 births, mainly in childbirth. 
 With the government able to spend less than $2 per person annually for health care, officials have been reluctant to take on debt.
 ''We try our best to utilize the grants first, and we reserve the loans for emergency response,'' Dr. Phengta said.
 That emergency response has not been needed. 
 Unlike in neighboring Vietnam, Thailand and China, where live poultry is often transported large distances to markets, sometimes on bicycles, most chickens and ducks in sparsely populated Laos are raised in backyards and eaten by their owners. That limits the spread of the disease, Dr. Somphanh said.
 Turkey has captured international attention with 18 human cases, three of them fatal, in the past two weeks.
 But Dr. Shigeru Omi, the World Health Organization's regional director for the Western Pacific, noted Thursday that Asia remains the center of the disease because contact between infected birds and humans is greatest in this region.
 Laotian government officials reported to the W.H.O. within hours on a weekend last September the country's only suspected human case of bird flu so far. A lab in Japan determined it was a false alarm. 
 The quick notification was one of several signs that Laos does not appear to be concealing any bird flu cases, although it may be hard at times even for the government to determine what is happening in the one-third of Laotian villages that lie a day's walk or more from the nearest road of any sort, said Dr. Dean A. Shuey, the top World Health Organization official in Laos.
 Dr. Shuey's aunt and grandmother died in the Spanish influenza outbreak of 1918, which scientists now attribute to another avian influenza virus. Despite that family history, Dr. Shuey of Nebraska says he worries that too much emphasis now on bird flu may create problems for Laos's health system.
 ''The intense donor meetings, the number of conferences, the travel is taking a lot of time for people who have other things to do,'' he said.
 The United States, Japan and the European Union have donated advanced virus freezers and other high-tech gear to help Laotians gather any viral samples and ship them to labs in rich countries as fast as possible, where they can be analyzed for the possible creation of a vaccine. 
 But with flu vaccine production capacity short in industrialized countries, no one expects Laos, with no vaccine factories, to receive more than a few doses of any vaccine.
 American aid has included hundreds of sets of masks, goggles and full-body suits that would be sweltering in the tropical climate here and that have limited use except for slaughtering sick birds.
 Dr. Phengta called for general-purpose protective equipment. Health workers in Laos now receive only one gown and one surgical mask each year.

HEADLINE: Problem of Homelessness in Los Angeles and Its Environs Draws Renewed Calls for Attention

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
It was not the sort of Chamber of Commerce cheer expected from the chief executive of one the nation's sunniest and most tourist-conscious cities.
 But Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles stood before the news media this week and declared unequivocally, ''This is the capital of homelessness in America.''
The mayor was reacting to the bald truth of a report released Thursday, based on what officials called the most comprehensive census and survey of homelessness in Los Angeles County, that found 88,345 homeless people in the city and surrounding communities. 
 No other county in the country comes close -- the five boroughs of New York have 48,155 homeless people, according to figures from its own census last year reported to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 But even if he wanted to, Mr. Villaraigosa, six months into his first term, would find it difficult these days to skirt the homeless problem here.
 For one thing, he had made a campaign promise to increase the supply of affordable housing and recently pledged $50 million for a trust fund that has helped finance more than 3,500 units for the poor since 2002. Only about 12 percent of the households in the county can afford the median home price, about $500,000.
 The Los Angeles County government has allocated $25 million for increased emergency shelters, which advocates for the homeless say are badly needed; there are 18,000 homeless shelter beds, which critics call paltry considering the much higher number of homeless people.
 In March, a group of city and county leaders, Bring Los Angeles Home, plans to issue an overdue report on confronting the problem, a spokesman for the group said this week. The group's stated goal is to end homelessness within 10 years.
 In addition, much soul-searching came after the Los Angeles police last fall publicly accused several suburban law enforcement agencies of adding to the woes of the downtown neighborhood Skid Row by dropping off homeless troublemakers there. Around the same time, a front-page series by Steve Lopez, a Los Angeles Times columnist, documenting wanton drug dealing and lewd behavior in Skid Row despite years of promises to clean it up, further galvanized public discussion.
 Homeless advocates said they were cautiously optimistic that the tide of events might lead to a decrease in homelessness, having experienced previous spasms of interest that eventually faded. They are waiting to see the extent to which the root causes of homelessness here -- high poverty rates and a dearth of affordable housing and mental and drug treatment services -- are tackled.
 ''I want this to be a watershed moment,'' said Lisa Fisher, director of the Westside Shelter and Hunger Coalition, a consortium of groups aiding the homeless. ''How many homeless people are enough to move county, city and community members to action?''
 Another advocate, Joel John Roberts, the chief executive of the nonprofit People Assisting the Homeless, said he was not sure whether to take all of the results as gospel. A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development said all the homeless census reports they received would be reviewed to evaluate their reliability.
 But Mr. Roberts said, ''This is the first time in many years that the city of L.A. and county of L.A. are stepping up to the plate and saying we are deal with this problem.''
 The new head count in Los Angeles hewed close to previous estimates, but advocates for the homeless and government officials said it was important to quantify the population in order to raise awareness and seek government financing. Indeed, the survey was spurred mainly by HUD, which had asked cities and counties to do the count and uses such data as a factor in weighing grants.
 The report held few surprises for people who follow the issue closely, but it did reaffirm some suspicions.
 Most of the homeless surveyed in greater Los Angeles, 78 percent, said they were living here before they lost shelter, contrary to popular belief that the warm climate drew the homeless from other places.
 ''The perception that homeless people come here from other places has allowed a sense that it is not really our problem,'' said Mitchell Netburn, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, which compiled the report. It is based on a count in January 2005 of people in shelters, on the streets and other places. In addition, 3,000 homeless people were sampled to project demographic and other trends in the overall population.
 The authority surveyed the homeless in 85 of the county's 88 cities, finding 82,291 homeless people there, and combined its count with separate censuses taken in the three other cities.
 Census takers found the homeless population spread out across the sprawling county, with pockets of homeless in generally affluent communities in Los Angeles like Brentwood and suburban expanses outside the city limits like the San Gabriel and Antelope Valleys. The City of Los Angeles had by far the largest homeless population, with 48,103 people.
 The report said 49 percent of the population was chronically homeless, meaning they had a physical or mental disability and had been living in a shelter or in and out of them for at least a year. The median age of the homeless was 43, and nearly 39 percent of the homeless were black. Twenty-nine percent were white and 25 percent Hispanic.
 Just as politicians sought to emphasize their efforts to resolve the problem, another report, by the National Coalition for the Homeless and National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, was released this week calling Los Angeles among the country's ''meanest'' cities (ranked No. 18 of 20) in treating its homeless. The report cited an ordinance restricting people from loitering outside libraries and other public facilities and ticketing ''sweeps'' by the police of homeless people.
 Mary Grady, a spokeswoman for William J. Bratton, the Los Angeles police chief, said the police simply enforced the city's laws and went after ''those who are actually victimizing the homeless population and mentally ill population.''
 Mayor Villaraigosa also disputed any meanness, emphasizing the promised effort to aid the homeless.
 John Batteste, 60, who has been homeless in South Los Angeles for several years since drug addiction and the death of a son took their toll, said he was sleeping in a park until outreach workers found him and persuaded him to enter a treatment program. He lives in 39 West, the residence for the homeless where the report was announced, and receives counseling and other services there.
 ''They need more of these facilities here,'' Mr. Batteste said. ''I would probably still be in that park without them.''

 But as the governor prepares to unveil his 12th and final budget proposal on Tuesday, many lawmakers are asking whether he will offer a plan meant to score political points on a national stage or to provide a sound blueprint for managing New York.
 Mr. Pataki, who is considering a long shot presidential run, faces an emboldened Legislature that increasingly views him as a lame duck.
 He is caught between the Republican Senate leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who has called for no new taxes of any kind in the budget, and the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who wants far more spending on public schools in New York City, to comply with a court order -- an order the governor has chosen to appeal. 
 Both sides of the Legislature are likely to resist his plan, announced on Friday, to cut more than $1 billion in Medicaid costs. And a surplus, after years of deficits, gives lawmakers money to spend and to fight over. 
 All sides, however, have something to gain in an election year from passing a second consecutive budget on time; decades of tardiness made the words ''Albany'' and ''dysfunction'' political synonyms.
 Further, Mr. Pataki appears to be shaping a budget with fewer controversial measures than in the past and with nuggets for all political stripes, buffing his resume as the kind of Republican who can win over a heavily Democratic state. 
 Over all, Mr. Pataki said on Jan. 4 in his State of the State address, his agenda will be ''a clear-cut, forward-looking approach to meeting some of our greatest challenges.''
 For conservatives, he is expected to propose at least $3 billion worth of tax cuts in a budget of roughly $110 billion, though much of the tab would be left to his successor. 
 For instance, $1.1 billion worth of tax cuts aimed at businesses, proposed in recent days, would not fully phase in until the fiscal year that ends in March 2009. In the coming fiscal year, the business cuts would reduce state revenues by $176 million. 
 His other tax plans include cuts of about $1.1 billion, through the elimination of the state's portion of the estate tax and the so-called marriage penalty. The structure of the tax code has many married couples with two incomes paying higher taxes than they would pay if they were not married. 
 Mr. Pataki will also propose a $500 heating fuel tax credit for the elderly, a rebate on school property taxes and lower income taxes for middle-class families.
 On Medicaid, the largest single item in the budget at nearly $50 billion, Mr. Pataki's aides said he would propose $1.3 billion in cuts and new savings, along with a plan to attack rampant fraud in the program. 
 The cuts include large items, like requiring hospitals and nursing homes to cover inflation, and smaller ones, like eliminating most of the $14.9 million the system spends on prescriptions for Viagra and other drugs taken for erectile dysfunction. The new prescription plan that is part of Medicare is expected to save the state nearly $250 million. 
 But the proposed cuts are largely offset by an additional $1.1 billion the state must pay this year because of new caps on how much localities contribute to the Medicaid system.
 Many ideas will come from the Albany archives. 
 Want to buy a bridge? As he did last year, Mr. Pataki is expected to propose privatizing the Tappan Zee Bridge in some form, to finance what will be a costly rebuilding project. 
 The governor will also propose further conversion of nonprofit health insurers into profit-making companies, following the state's $4 billion windfall from the conversion of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. 
 To bolster his crime-fighting bona fides, Mr. Pataki is proposing a $130 million mental health detention center where some sex offenders could be housed after they finish their sentences.
 He also has a host of environmental and education proposals among billions of dollars of new spending, from money to encourage gas stations to offer alternative fuels, to free tuition for math and science students at public universities who agree to teach in the state.
 His environmental proposals are aimed at attacking oil consumption and global warming, topics that many Republican politicians shun. 
 There is also financing for cultural institutions, including $15 million for the Lincoln Center's redevelopment plan along West 65th Street.
 To provide money for health care programs, Mr. Pataki will propose increasing the tax on a pack of cigarettes to $2.50 from $1.50 everywhere except in New York City, which already has a $3 tax because the city itself levies $1.50. The move is expected to bring the state $260 million more in tax proceeds.
 Policymakers on both sides of the aisle say that how much of Mr. Pataki's agenda is enacted depends on whether he wants to leave town fighting or hugging, and on the willingness of lawmakers to compromise. 
 Referring to the proposals aired so far, Mr. Silver, one of the governor's sharpest critics, said in a statement, ''Is he laying the foundation for our future or for a campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire?''
 But a fellow Democratic assemblyman, Richard N. Gottfried, the co-chairman of a budget conference committee that last year dealt with Medicaid, said, ''I think there's a high likelihood of an on-time budget.''
 ''It's in everyone's interests,'' Mr. Gottfried added. ''I expect the fiscal situation will be easier than it has been in most previous years, and I think we found last year that when we did the budget on time, things worked out very well.'' 
 Not that he, or others, likes the health care cuts. 
 ''This would be utterly devastating,'' said Jennifer Cunningham, an executive vice president of the health care workers' union S.E.I.U./1199, referring to proposals to cut $163 million in Medicaid funds from hospitals and $233 million from nursing homes, with the actual costs to the institutions higher because of the loss of matching funds. 
 ''There's no way many of them can absorb these and stay open,'' she said. 
 For Mr. Pataki, clearly the top priority is tax cuts. 
 Critics on the left say that cuts like the estate tax are gifts to the well-to-do. E.J. McMahon, a budget expert at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, said Mr. Pataki had made progress cutting taxes, but not enough.
 He cited figures from the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, showing that New York's combined state and local tax burden went from 13.7 percent of all income earned in the state in 1994, the highest among the states, to 12 percent last year, second highest.
 While there has been significant cutting, ''the bad news,'' Mr. McMahon said, ''is that we've plummeted all the way from one to two.''
 And the new cuts would be little more than symbolic proposals, he added, if they largely take effect after Mr. Pataki's term ends and lead to substantial shortfalls. 
 John Cape, the state budget director, said on Friday that the budget proposal would not cause excessive deficits in coming years, calling the future gaps ''very manageable.''
 Mr. Bruno, the Senate leader, took a hard line this week, saying, ''There is simply no reason to propose any tax increases.''
 But a cigarette tax increase has its ardent advocates. 
 Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco-Free New York, said it would push many people to quit smoking. 
 ''One dollar tax increase, $95 million for tobacco prevention programs,'' he said, mentioning another expected budget proposal. ''It's Christmas.''

HEADLINE: Straight From a Lab, Miles Per Gallon 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNAR

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows that driving fast or sitting in traffic with the air-conditioner cranked up is bad for gas mileage. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that the fuel-economy estimates listed on a car's window sticker would reflect such real-world conditions. 
 But how can the mileage effects of variable road conditions be standardized?
The E.P.A. developed its standards during years of tests at its laboratories in Ann Arbor, Mich., about 45 miles west of Detroit. The standards take into account everything from stop-and-go driving to jack-rabbit starts to very cold or very hot weather. 
 To measure a car's performance, E.P.A. engineers drive it onto a dynamometer, a kind of automotive treadmill. With the car secured in place, a technician gets behind the wheel, while engineers in a nearby control room dial up computer programs that alter the way the dynamometer functions to mimic different road conditions. 
 Then, the technician follows instructions to accelerate, hold a speed and decelerate, while sensors measure the mileage the vehicle is getting. 
 All that data is used to calculate a formula that determines how cars and trucks will be affected, based on their size and weight.
 The E.P.A. won't test every car and truck sold. That responsibility still falls to the auto companies. But it will be auditing the results of the companies' tests to make sure the data jibes with the estimates. MICHELINE MAYNAR

HEADLINE: Energy Impasse

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, a brief Russia-Ukraine squabble over natural gas pricing sent a tremor through Europe. One week ago, another tremor swept through the West -- this time America joined in the shakes -- when Iran broke open internationally monitored seals on its nuclear facilities, clearing the way for uranium enrichment activities that are a big step toward making a nuclear weapon. 
 These two events, in different ways, illustrate the dangers of relying as heavily as the West does on imported energy, much of it coming from chronically unstable countries. The United States, as the world's biggest and most profligate energy consumer, could do more than any other country to lessen this dangerous dependency, and in that way reduce the geopolitical leverage of capricious supplier nations. 
In Europe, all it took was Russia's cutting the flow of the natural gas it pipes through Ukraine, ostensibly in a dispute over pricing and transit fees, to shake world energy markets and leave Europeans reviewing their reliance on Russia for energy. 
 Fast-forward one week, to last Tuesday, when Iranian officials, ignoring pleas and threats from Europe and America, broke the seals on its nuclear facilities. And why not? President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the clerics who run Iran know one thing that Western leaders also know but will not say: there is nothing the West can do because Iran has a bargaining chip -- petroleum -- that puts it out of reach. Iran is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, after Saudi Arabia, and is home to some 10 percent of the world's proven oil reserves. Iran also has the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, after Russia's. 
 Iran has signed deals to provide natural gas to two emerging economic powers: China and India. India embarked last year on a gas pipeline project with Iran; in 2004, China signed a $70 billion oil and natural gas deal with Tehran. Those alliances are just a sign of things to come; as their economies grow, the Indians and the Chinese will become ever more hungry for energy resources. 
 That makes it much less likely that the United Nations Security Council, with China a permanent member, is ever going to agree to sanctions against Iran for pushing ahead with its nuclear program. But what if, by some miracle, America and Europe were able to persuade the Security Council to impose sanctions? 
 Well, slapping Iran with sanctions could very likely prompt Mr. Ahmadinejad and company to cut oil production in retaliation. Once upon a time, a drop in production from one OPEC member could be absorbed by the rest of the cartel. But today's global oil market is so tight, there is little spare capacity left. Any drop in production from a supplier can quickly send the price of oil soaring. 
 ''There's no shock absorber left,'' says Gal Luft, executive director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. ''That leaves us with zero options when it comes to leverage against these oil producers. Why do you think Hugo Chavez is so emboldened? Why do you think Ahmadinejad is saying, 'Go ahead, make my day?' ''
 Clearly, becoming less dependent on foreign sources should be among the West's -- and most especially America's -- most urgent priorities. But not in the way that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney seem to prefer, which is to try to drill our way out of dependency -- an utterly impossible task for a country that uses one-fourth of the world's oil while possessing only 3 percent of its reserves, and whose once-abundant supplies of natural gas are now severely stressed. A much better answer would be a national commitment to more efficient vehicles and to the rapid deployment of new energy sources like biofuels. 
 America cannot win President Bush's much-vaunted war on terrorism as long as it is sending billions of dollars abroad for oil purchases every day. It cannot establish democracy in the Middle East because governments rich in oil revenue do not want democracy. And it will never have the geopolitical leverage it needs as long as it is dependent on unstable foreign sources for fuel.

HEADLINE: Heather Wolfe and Quindi Franco

BYLINE: By LOIS SMITH BRADY

 BODY:
IN some ways a first kiss is like the fall of snow: You might pray for snow, you might predict it, you might watch the clouds headed your way on radar, feeling certain snow is imminent. But when and if it snows is always a wonder. 
 Heather Ruth Wolfe, 34, and Quindi Cushi Franco, 32, waited and wondered about their first kiss like ski bums anticipating snow. 
The tall and slender Ms. Wolfe is the curator of manuscripts at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington. She spends her workdays deciphering Renaissance English handwriting and drinking tea with Shakespeare scholars. 
 When asked how she met Mr. Franco, she replied like a student of literature tracing the germ of a novel: ''The idea of us was spawned at a New Year's Eve party two years ago, where a mutual friend saw Quindi and found out he was single.'' 
 The friend e-mailed Mr. Franco (whose name is pronounced KEEN-dee), an economic development consultant in Washington, who was born in Ecuador. Mr. Franco in turn e-mailed Ms. Wolfe, and they agreed to meet at L'Enfant Cafe, a bistro. He told her what he looked like. 
 ''He described his hair color, so I expected hair,'' she said. It turns out he's nearly bald.
 ''Despite being reserved, he has a creative and interesting and magical mind,'' said Jennifer Daskal, Ms. Wolfe's roommate when they were doctoral students at Cambridge University in England. ''He has a fantasy of buying a plot of land and building a yurt and adding extensions on for kids. His quirkiness is quiet and hard to access, but it's definitely there.''
 Sitting at the bar, drinking beers, Mr. Franco and Ms. Wolfe talked about hiking in blizzards, climbing icy boulders and pitching tents in deserts, things they both love. 
 ''It didn't feel like a date at all,'' Ms. Wolfe said. ''It felt like a really good conversation I wanted to continue.''
 After their next date, dinner at a Thai restaurant, Mr. Franco walked Ms. Wolfe home, hoping for a kiss. ''We were standing on the steps of her apartment saying good night,'' he recalled. ''Then all of a sudden she took a huge step back. I didn't know what that meant. But I still wanted to see, would there always be a step back?'' 
 So he asked her out again, for a hike. She took along Ms. Daskal, her longtime hiking partner. (They once climbed Mount Sinai in the dark with flashlights and slept at the top.)
 ''Jen said, 'Don't kiss Quindi unless you really, really, really like him because we don't want to risk losing him as a hiking friend,' '' Ms. Wolfe remembered. ''So that made me think even harder, 'I don't want to kiss him unless I know I want to be with him forever.' ''
 On their next date, they went back to L'Enfant Cafe for dinner on Wig Night, when the restaurant offers diners half off on their wine if they wear wigs. He wore a 1960's mop, she a rainbow clown wig. 
 Later they found themselves on her stoop again, in wigs. And again she stepped back. 
 ''Step back'' soon became part of Mr. Franco's vocabulary. Co-workers began asking him in the morning, ''Did she take the step back?''
 Ms. Wolfe said she was not aware she had been retreating and was beginning to wonder why he never kissed her good night. ''We'd gone way beyond the normal number of dates where you usually kiss,'' she said. ''I thought, well, I'm kind of enjoying this approach. I was really getting to know him as a friend. And I was pretty sure I'd see him again. We were talking about what we were going to do next, so it felt future-oriented.''
 Next they went to the touring Banff Mountain Film Festival when it stopped in Washington. To her dismay he arrived with a friend, Wendy. ''Then I began to wonder,'' Ms. Wolfe said. ''Maybe he doesn't think these outings are dates. Maybe he's just adding me to his group of female friends.''
 After Wendy went home, Mr. Franco walked Ms. Wolfe to her stoop, where she ended the evening with the usual step back. 
 Nearly two months after they met, he prepared a speech, which he delivered on the stoop at the end of the evening. ''I wanted to give her a little prep time to know something was coming, so the step back wouldn't happen,'' he said.
 She recalled: ''He said, 'I really enjoy spending time with you, and I think you enjoy spending time with me.' And then he moved in for the kiss.'' 
 Ms. Wolfe, who doesn't like mistakes, grammatical or otherwise, said she felt certain by then that he was the ideal partner for her. He made excellent trail mix, told funny campfire stories and, like her, was up for any detour on the trail or otherwise. 
 So she didn't step back. 
 They stayed on the stoop, kissing and talking for hours. ''After that there was no question that we'd stay together,'' she said. 
 They had a two-part wedding, beginning with a civil ceremony on Dec. 23 at the Jefferson County Courthouse in Golden, Colo., where they married themselves under Colorado's marriage statute. Both wore jeans during the short signing, surrounded by fluorescent lights and undernourished poinsettias. Still, they cried quiet tears. 
 On Dec. 31 they had a religious ceremony outside a 17th-century hacienda in San Pablo del Lago in the Andean mountains of Ecuador, led by the Rev. Elton P. Richards, a Lutheran minister.
 They chose New Year's Eve because, the bride said, it was the anniversary of the idea of them.
 Two days later the couple and a few friends took a postmatrimonial hike up a nearby volcano. They lost the trail after 15 minutes and bushwhacked for four hours, at times through grass up to their ears. The bridegroom was in front with his friends; the bride was in back with hers. Ms. Daskal, along for the hike, said of the couple: ''They are so connected, yet there's a lot of space between them.''

HEADLINE: High-Tech, Lowered Profile

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
FOR years, New Jersey has had this understanding: We are rich. We have great jobs. We are the medicine cabinet and the telecommunications nerve center of the world. We have hatched ideas and industries since Edison was recording sound onto tin-foil cylinders in Menlo Park.
 But just as a new governor steps up, with visions of a state growing its way out of fiscal distress, comes some disquieting news: We are not as rich as we used to be. The highest-paying industries are expanding in other states and countries, while in New Jersey some are actually shrinking. The state's fastest-growing sectors employ motel clerks and nursing home aides.
The warnings come from many sources, but the loudest come from two academics at Rutgers, James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca, who have regularly advised the governor and the Legislature on the state's economy. At the State House on Thursday, they drew a dismal picture of job trends. They had already sent out alarms in a report two months ago about a ''startling erosion'' in technology-based industries.
 That report, written for the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology, documented a decline in the state's share of total national employment in every one of 10 technology-based industry groups. 
 For example, New Jersey had 20 percent of the nation's jobs in the pharmaceutical industry in 1990, yet slipped to 14 percent in 2004. What's more, the state's share of jobs in Internet service and data processing was cut nearly in half. 
 In all, in the five highest-paying sectors -- which include financial activities and federal government jobs, in addition to high-tech businesses -- New Jersey lost 44,000 jobs from 1990 to 2004. 
 Given these numbers, it was perhaps not surprising that in census data released last month, New Jersey had lost its No. 1 rank in median household income, slipping behind Connecticut. 
 Any erosion of New Jersey's brain-based economy is worrisome to a state that in the past had claimed ''genius factories,'' in Mr. Hughes's phrase, like the Bell and the RCA laboratories. And while their shrinkage in a global tech upsurge is well known, many technology experts are taken aback by the bigger picture. 
 ''We've known that this is happening for a while, but now we have real numbers,'' said Sherrie Preische, the director of the science and technology commission, a state agency. ''We certainly didn't know we were below 1990 levels.''
 ''Look at where a lot of technology is growing,'' Dr. Preische added. ''A lot of it's in Massachusetts and California. These are not low-cost places.'' 
 As if to drive home the point that other states are eating New Jersey's lunch, at a legislative hearing this month on the fledgling nanotechnology industry, Harch Gill, the general manager of Princeton Nanotech, arrived late with an explanation for his tardiness: he was just returning from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., where he had gone to confer informally with academic researchers.
 There, he said, he was met by a committee that offered grants, loans and other inducements to move to Pennsylvania. 
 ''These stories are repeated over and over,'' Dr. Preische said. 
 New Jersey is not going the way of Alabama or Arkansas, as Mr. Hughes and Professor Seneca make clear; it is simply edging toward average. The state enjoys per-capita income that is 25 percent higher than the national average, down from 29 percent five years ago, for example. In the long term, economic forecasters say, all states are becoming more average. 
 ''New Jersey should perform just below the average over the long term,'' said Mark Zandi, who is the chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, based in West Chester, Pa. ''The wealthier economies will get a little less wealthy, and the poorer economies will get a little wealthier.'' 
 But 2006 is an especially bad time to become more average, since New Jersey's budget gap of about $6 billion is expected to be one of the worst of any state in the nation. It is no time, politically speaking, to be giving grants, tax breaks and seed money.
 So a question heard with increasing frequency is this: What is Jon S. Corzine, the governor-elect who spent a professional lifetime in the business of allocating capital, going to do?
 Mr. Corzine is well aware of the slippage, to judge from statements he issued during his campaign, although the governor-elect's transition team did not respond to several requests for an interview. Mr. Corzine has proposed a venture capital fund, called the Edison Innovation Fund, to be financed initially by bonds and used to aid high-tech enterprises. 
 Mr. Corzine also has the larger job of shoring up the financial industry, salvaging manufacturing jobs and encouraging corporate investment. 
 ''Look, he's a business guy,'' said Anthony Shorris, the director of the Policy Research Institute for the Region at Princeton University. ''He comes out of the environment of the people we're talking about, the world of information technology and financial services. He knows what they need and what it takes to get them to move and stay.''
 Mr. Shorris, among others, noted that high-tech enterprises everywhere took a beating starting in 2000 and 2001, and were only recovering now. 

Adding Up the Pluses
 Yet the state treasurer, John E. McCormac, saw the state's economy far differently, saying that the overall recovery was filling the state's treasury faster than expected.
 ''Our corporate tax is way over target,'' Mr. McCormac said in an interview, shrugging dramatically. ''If there's really a problem, why do we keep beating our targets?'' 
 Mr. McCormac pointed out that the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation was expanding its headquarters in East Hanover, Pfizer was building a new research center in Morris Plains and Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical giant, was putting its United States headquarters in Bridgewater.
 And New Jersey -- going so far as to send Mr. McCormac and Gov. Richard J. Codey to Verizon Communications' headquarters in Manhattan about a year ago -- persuaded the company to take over the former AT&T campus in Basking Ridge rather than move to Virginia. 
 In addition, Mr. McCormac said, a Wall Street surge has fed the state treasury with personal taxes paid on unearned income. ''Those revenues for '04 were great, for '05 were better and for '06 look even better,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hughes replies that Wall Street money is masking losses in the state's economic core. Moreover, jobs in the securities and brokerage firms in New Jersey declined from 2000 to 2004, after a decade in which many companies moved support services across the Hudson. 
 The Hughes-Seneca report said: ''With back-office functions now as easily carried out in low-cost Asia as in Jersey City, the state's recently gained role as a significant national financial center may very well be in jeopardy.'' 
 And sooner rather than later, record-level corporate profits will recede, cutting income tax receipts from the state's wealthiest residents, said Mr. Hughes, who is the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. While people who bring home big paychecks from Manhattan pay income taxes to New York State, they pay taxes on their unearned income to New Jersey. 
 Mr. Hughes, just like many Republican legislators, contends that the ''millionaire's tax'' adopted in 2004 -- raising taxes on income over $500,000 -- is a highly unreliable source of revenue.
 Mr. Hughes and Professor Seneca found an overall decline since 2000 in the highest-paying economic sectors, including the corporate management jobs and financial-industry jobs that were largely responsible for the state's high-end housing boom, which is an economic engine in itself. The average pay for what they label ''Wall Street-type jobs'' in 2004 was $131,422. 

Where the Growth Is
 At the same time, the highest job gains were in local government, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality --a sector that paid an average of $20,065 a year in 2004. 
 A new state analysis of income tax returns, from its 2003 tax year, yielded a puzzling statistic: The average wage reported was $58,546, which was $13 below the average reported in 2000.
 There is little disagreement that the state needs to shore up its high-tech supports. ''Other places have caught up,'' said Richard Goldberg, a member of the state's science and technology commission and a vice president of DRS Technologies in Parsippany, which produces electronics systems for the military.
 Most of the states viewed as competitors for high-tech business lost science and technology jobs in 2001 and 2002. But most lost fewer than New Jersey did, and several have done much better. In scientific research and development services, for example, New Jersey lost more than 4,000 of its 32,000 jobs from 1990 to 2004. The state was leapfrogged during that period by Massachusetts and Maryland, while Virginia and New York rapidly added jobs as well. 
 New Jersey was the first state to commit funds to stem cell research, which helped spur California to adopt a $3 billion initiative. Now, New Jersey has started to spend the money -- which California has not -- announcing $5 million in grants last month. Still, New Jersey remains overshadowed by California and pursued by other states.

Other States' Gains
 Mr. Zandi noted that New Jersey's technology sector had been dominated by very large corporations, especially the pharmaceutical companies and telecommunications giants like AT&T. 
 ''In the case of Maryland or California, a lot of the growth was in biotech, medical instrumentation, in small and midsize companies,'' he said. ''Big companies generally are not experiencing the same kinds of growth rates and hiring in the same way.''
 He then raised and answered his own question: ''Why is it that New Jersey hasn't been able to attract small biotech companies? That may be because the state has underinvested in its university facilities. California, Maryland, Virginia are extraordinarily aggressive in bringing these companies to their states.''
 To stem the tide, Mr. Goldberg advocates more technology incubators -- state-financed facilities that offer laboratory space -- for start-up companies. ''Pennsylvania and New York have over 50 incubators each, and New Jersey has 8,'' he said. ''We've done a poor job of growing that system because it costs money.''
 Professor Seneca and Dean Hughes met with Mr. Corzine on Thursday, before their presentation at the State House, and found him, as Professor Seneca said, ''very sharp in his understanding and penetrating with the questions.'' 
 The science and technology commission, in preparing recommendations for Mr. Corzine, is urging a $300 million commitment for the Edison fund and $20 million to $50 million a year for more short-term programs. 
 One model is New York State's new research center at the State University at Albany, which focuses on nanotechnology. The state has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into its development and has attracted billions in private investment from companies like IBM and International Sematech. New Jersey has given only scattered grants to nanotechnology companies, although it is one of the handful of fields that the science commission wants to emphasize.

The Value of Education
 No high-tech company, of course, can do without a highly educated labor pool, even if it is in a high-cost state -- and it usually is.
 ''The fundamental things don't turn around quickly, and New Jersey is coming at this from a very good position,'' Mr. Shorris said. ''They're not putting Pfizer research labs in North Dakota or Mississippi.''
 For recruiting purposes, he added, it would be nice to have Boston or Chicago in the middle of the state. But New Jersey is blessed, he said, by its nearness to two very attractive metro areas. And Mr. Hughes said it had never been hard to persuade people to live in Princeton or Short Hills or to commute from Manhattan. 
 In fact, New Jersey probably has a harder time recruiting and keeping other types of businesses. In a survey of members of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association last fall, more than 90 percent said New Jersey had higher taxes and fees, health-care costs and government spending than other states. 
 Another report released last month by the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce said relocation consultants who work around the nation reported that their clients rarely even considered the state.
 Some had lukewarm compliments for the state's Business Employment Incentive Program, which is intended to persuade employers to create new jobs in New Jersey by giving to them a portion of the state income taxes paid by each newly hired employee. 
 The state's business-growth programs are now scattered in more than a dozen departments and agencies, and Mr. Corzine has said he wants to bring them all under the Economic Development Authority, the independent agency that handles the larger employment incentive program.
 To help achieve this, the governor-elect has appointed an advisory panel on economic development, which has been meeting throughout the transition period. One member, John Galandak, the president of the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey, said Mr. Corzine spent two and a half hours with the committee at its last meeting, although he said he could not give details of the discussions. 
 ''With the incoming administration facing a $6 billion budget gap, there's not going to be a lot of latitude or political will to give grants or more money,'' Mr. Galandak said. The incentives, he said, would have to come in the form of an easier tax and regulatory burden.
 The Chamber of Commerce report did cite New Jersey's competitive advantages, including the quality of its work force, as identified in interviews with corporate executives and consultants. Advantage No. 1: It is not New York City.

 Keeping companies such as these, as well as attracting new ones, is essential if the state is to reverse the decline in its share of the total national employment in 10 technology-based industry groups.

HEADLINE: Preservation Plan Includes 25,000 Acres

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
A new coalition of 100 environmental, civic and business groups led by the Nature Conservancy announced plans on Wednesday for a final push to preserve 25,000 acres of open space and 10,000 acres of farmland in Suffolk and Nassau Counties over the next decade. 
 The campaign, under the name Long Island's Last Stand, received support from the two county executives, Steve Levy of Suffolk and Thomas R. Suozzi of Nassau; they attended its unveiling at the Huntington Hilton. Mr. Levy has made land acquisition a priority for his administration.
 About 2,500 of the targeted acres are in Nassau. The remainder and virtually all the farmland are in Suffolk, where agriculture remains an economic anchor in its five East End towns. 
 Kevin McDonald, the director of public lands for the Nature Conservancy on Long Island, said the aim was to preserve the most significant surviving open space on Long Island and to restore, protect and better manage public parklands, harbors and bays. 
 Mr. McDonald said financing for purchases of land or development rights or for other conservation measures could come from the New York State Environmental Protection Fund and from restructuring a sales-tax program in Suffolk County. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki proposed on Monday that the state budget allocation for the environmental protection fund be increased by 20 percent next year, to $180 million.

HEADLINE: A Surge of Concern as Electric Rates Rise

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
BILL TRAG, 72, a retired carpenter and building contractor, lives alone with Pete, a 7-year-old Staffordshire terrier, on an isolated spot atop Red Rock Mountain in Sharon. His five-room home is a half-mile from a scattering of houses down the mountain.
 Mr. Trag has lived on the mountain for 21 years, and during the last few he has had to use a wheelchair when the pain from nerve damage in his legs becomes too tough to take. 
 His income comes from the government: $929 a month in Social Security benefits and $69 a month in food stamps. He will also receive about $600 in government heating aid this year.
 ''That barely covers everything,'' Mr. Trag said. ''But it won't with the electric going up.'' 
 Mr. Trag was referring to the two-step, 22.4 percent electric-rate increase by Connecticut Light and Power that began on Jan. 1. The new fee covers the higher prices the utility is being charged by its six private electricity suppliers. The rate increase, which affects the company's 1.1 million customers in 149 of the state's 169 cities and towns, raises an average family's monthly bill from about $102 to $125.
 The reason for the increase, according to state regulators in an opinion on Dec. 28 authorizing the new rates, is ''dramatic global spikes in fossil fuel prices'' that doubled energy costs over the last 12 months.
 Nonprofit groups that assist low-income residents said the increase would hit their clients especially hard. Connecticut Light and Power already helps 23,000 low-income households with their bills, a number the utility expects to rise to 25,000 this year. Nonprofit groups also expect an increase, especially now that a federal program that helps pay heating bills is hung up in Congress.
 ''They're on the edge as it is, barely making ends meet,'' said Paul Pestana, director of energy services for the Community Renewal Team, a nonprofit group that provides money for the heating bills of more than 50,000 people in 60 central Connecticut towns. ''It doesn't take much for bad things to happen, having to make choices between food, electricity, prescription drugs, medical bills and child care. With lower-income families, they're not living in the most energy-efficient quarters.''
 The state received about $40 million last year in federal heating-assistance block grants, but the entire program still has not been approved in Congress. About 62,400 households received heating assistance through the program last year, with 17 percent of them, or 10,700, also getting help with their electric bills. Without the federal money, the households would have to seek alternative help.
 Operation Fuel, a nonprofit group in Bloomfield, helped about 1,700 households with their electric bills last year and is the only statewide organization that pays nonheating electric bills.
 Last winter, Operation Fuel spent $174,000, before running out of money, all raised from foundations and donations.
 ''The costs are compounding and the misery is compounding,'' said Patricia Wrice, Operation Fuel's executive director. ''but there's no way we can address these huge bills, and we're talking about huge numbers of people who are affected by these high energy costs. That's when we start to see people cutting corners with their food and medicine bills. It's happening already.''
 Low-income residents in Greenwich are also feeling the pinch, said Richard Weiner, administrator of the town's Operation Fuel program.
 ''Even though Greenwich is known as a wealthy community, it has between 3,000 and 4,000 people who are either very low income or low income, including seniors living on Social Security and retired town employees,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''We have people who are cash-poor even though they own a piece of property that's worth a lot of money, and they don't want to move.''
 The Manchester Area Conference of Churches is Operation Fuel's partner for Manchester and Bolton, serving 1,800 families and individuals. Last winter the conference provided $70,000 in aid for electricity, oil and gas bills, augmenting a $35,000 budget with money from a rainy day fund.
 ''And it poured last year,'' said Deborah Rutledge, director of client services. ''This year I don't know what we can do since we don't have it to dip into.''
 Most of its clients are ''very low income'' and could not afford the old utility rates, Ms. Rutlege said. The new rate is just going to make a bad situation much worse, she said.
 Connecticut Light and Power also pitches in with several programs. The Winter Protection Plan provides a moratorium on shut-offs from Nov. 1 through April 15 for accounts considered hardship. The Matching Payment Program enables eligible customers pay a reduced bill each month. Another program provides advice and services on conservation and efficiency.
 ''We're expecting to help more people this year, and we are ready, willing and able to do that,'' said Mary Ingarra, spokeswoman for the utility. ''We forgave $330,000 last year under Matching Payment, and it's probably going to be more this winter.''
 In defining hardship accounts, the company also followed the state's lead in legislation passed in December that raised the maximum household income for eligibility for energy assistance from 200 percent of the federal poverty level ($3,226 a month for a family of four) to 60 percent of the state median income level ($4,300 a month). The Legislature also promised to keep $24 million in state money in reserve to finance aid if federal money falls short.
 Nonprofit groups are also being squeezed by soaring energy bills, adding even more pressure for low-income families.
 ''Nonprofits are looking at between 25 and 50 percent higher costs this year,'' said Ronald Cretaro, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Non-Profits Inc., which has 480 members. ''Compounding that is the rate increase from C.L. & P., which is going to drive already-strained budgets over the edge. They're going to be running deficits. You can go a year with a deficit, maybe two if you're lucky, but you can't have chronic deficits and survive.''
 Mr. Trag, the retiree in Sharon, said he would do the best he could with his bills. ''Getting upset isn't going to help,'' he said. ''There's no sense in bellyaching.''

HEADLINE: More Than a Little Night Music

BYLINE: By RICHARD MORGAN. 
E-mail: streetlevel@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HE lives in Weehawken, N.J., but Heathe St. Clair is kept up nights by noise on the Lower East Side. Mr. St. Clair, the owner of the Sunburnt Cow, a bar on Avenue C and Ninth Street, keeps his cellphone by his bed when he sleeps. His employees have his number; so do all the tenants in the apartments above the bar -- and anyone else in the neighborhood who would like him to be held accountable for noise at his establishment.
 Mr. St. Clair, a cheery 37-year-old with bright blue eyes, did get a complaint on New Year's Eve, but it was his first since April. One reason may be that besides cowprint stools and cushions, the Sunburnt Cow has heavy theatrical curtains to muffle the noise from inside. 
In addition, Mr. St. Clair said, he lowers the volume of the music around 11:30 every night and is painstakingly attentive to noise he inflicts upon his neighbors. He has learned the hard way: $10,000 in fines that began with 13 calls to 311, the city's complaint number, most of them anonymous.
 ''I don't blame people for being up in arms about the music and noise,'' Mr. St. Clair said the other day as a shipment of pineapples arrived at the Cow, a bar that has the air of a lush cabana in Key West. ''But these people went out 15 or 20 years ago and partied hard. Now they're older, they don't like it so much, and they want to make Manhattan as quiet as Jersey. You can't have that. This is the city that never sleeps.''
 Mr. St. Clair's preoccupation is a common one in this hip neighborhood. If the Victorian mansion is the symbol of Tottenville, and the art gallery the signature of SoHo, then noise, especially throbbing bar music, is the calling card of the Lower East Side. Guitars and amplifiers, often lugged by Converse-wearing hipsters, dot the area, and its main economic engine is the 400 bars and lounges that swell with music nightly. 
 Many local residents bridle at the noise. In November, more than 250 gathered to protest local loudness, and they have set up an antinoise Web site, www.toomanybars.org, which was under construction Friday.
 Their needs were answered in part last month, when, in an overhaul of the city's noise code, the maximum sound level for bars and nightclubs was lowered to 42 decibels from 45 when measured inside a nearby residence. A commercial fan on low speed, by comparison, registers about 42 decibels. Police officers, who have often relied on their own ears to determine whether nightclub noise is unreasonable, will be armed with more and better noise meters. 
 But perhaps the most noticed change in the code, which will not take full effect until July 2007, is that it includes applies to bass music, that thumping undertow, felt less in the eardrum than in the gut, that is a staple of many post-Woodstock songs. 
 Some residents, like Rebecca Moore, a 37-year-old musician with straight dark hair and a Bohemian look, are pessimistic about the prospects of more quiet. 
 ''I wish the noise codes would help me, but I don't feel much hope about that,'' said Ms. Moore, who lives at Orchard and Stanton Streets and is a local antinoise leader. ''I literally have six bars surrounding my building.'' 
 A ''constant oscillation of solid noise'' typically lasts until 5 a.m., she said. ''If it isn't a car parked blasting bass and music, it is a crowd that exits one bar and just stands yelling out on the street and screaming and hollering. Then they go inside, and the door gets held open at another bar while a live band plays so the music comes blasting out. Then the bar next to that begins blasting music with their iPod parties. Even with the doors all closed, the bass totally permeates down the entire street.'' 
 Ms. Moore is herself a violinist, but she quit doing gigs at some bars. ''I couldn't look my neighbors in the eye,'' she explained. 
 The local hero in all this may turn out to be Deputy Inspector Dennis DeQuatro, the burly commanding officer of the local Ninth Precinct. With a bass-heavy voice himself, Inspector DeQuatro went to the precinct a few months ago from Chelsea, where he brokered peace between nightclubs and residents, and he said he planned to make noise a top priority on his new assignment. 
 ''It would be foolish to assume we could turn the bars or streets into a monastery,'' he said. ''But how do you put a price tag on a good night's sleep?''

HEADLINE: In Detroit, the Rebirth of the Hip(s)

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
BIG hips are back. The swollen rear fenders that dominated car design in the late 1960's, the shape of oversize muscle and latent sensuality, are bulging from many of the dream machines at the North American International Auto Show.
 They were on the retro muscle cars from two Detroit automakers, the Dodge Challenger and Chevrolet Camaro, but even on design studies from foreign companies: the Hyundai HCD9 Talus, the Mazda Kabura and the Lamborghini Miura.
 ''Hips are about sexuality,'' said Joel Piaskowski, chief designer at the Hyundai Kia Design and Technical Center in California.
 Hips are also about hipness, or youth -- but these judgments are often made by designers and auto executives who are no longer young. Something may seem hip to them because it evokes their past; to young people, something may be cool because it envisions their future. 
 A new set of design awards was given this year at the show, which had press previews last week and will be open to the public through next Sunday at Cobo Center. The prizes for concept cars in the Eyes on Design awards, sponsored by the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, went to two efforts that fall on either side of the generation gap.
 The Camaro looks backward for inspiration, though in execution it is an evolutionary design -- what the Camaro might have become if Chevy had made it continuously since 1967. (The nameplate was ''put on hiatus,'' in General Motors' words, after 2002.) 
 The other winning concept car, the Mazda Kabura, aims to move forward -- not just because of its fresh, fluid lines, but because it strives to be a new type of vehicle. Instead of a sports car for two, it is a three and a half seater that rides a bit high off the ground. The Kabura also goes back to the idea that inspired the first muscle cars, rendering speed and dynamism in steel. Its design expresses its performance.
 The Camaro, much anticipated, appealed to almost everyone. It was done by a group of younger designers working under a General Motors veteran, Tom Peters. 
 The interior, with its wonderful play of golden orange and rich browns, furthers the counterpoint of bright accents and buttery soft surfaces that has become a keynote of G.M. interiors under Ed Welburn, vice president for global design. The Camaro's interior was supervised by Christos Roustemis, the design manager who worked on the Nomad styling exercise of 1999, a lovely design that G.M. decided not to build. 
 Putting him to work on the Camaro was a better decision. Mr. Roustemis grew up learning the history of cars by running his hands over them at his family's car wash. He said he could not avoid taking the ''four pack'' of gauges on the console, beside the shifter, from the 1969 Camaro.
 The Camaro seemed to impress even those with little patience for retro. Designers interviewed in the exhibit hall mostly agreed that despite its homage to the early pony car, the new design was ''modern'' -- to use a word that many, including Chris Chapman of BMW's California studio, used to describe it. The test of modernity here, it seems, is whether the new car would have meaning and appeal even if it didn't carry a venerated nameplate.
 The Camaro passes this test, but the Challenger may not. The Dodge is precisely proportioned and carefully rendered, like a shot-by-shot remake of a classic film. But it is overly respectful and almost slavishly polite. In its adoration of the 1970 Challenger it gets the details right but misses the essence. Chrysler's designers seem to have forgotten that the original Challenger, like other Mopar muscle cars of the era, was profoundly impolite, wild and rebellious.
 Besides, Chrysler has already channeled its muscle car tradition in a different direction with the larger four-door Dodge Charger. Chrysler's Mopar muscle cars were all about exaggerated length. The Charger and the Chrysler 300 shifted the exaggeration, rendering it in mass -- what can only be called chunkiness. That is another way to visually express muscle. 
 Chunkiness works well in the 300 and Charger, but gets out of hand in the Imperial, the other concept car that Chrysler showed here. Summoning the ghost of a defunct luxury line that was never hip -- Imperial was always the arriviste imitator of Cadillac and Lincoln -- the show car looked like a knockoff of the Rolls-Royce Phantom.
 Lamborghini also delved into its past to recreate the 40-year-old Miura, which has hips of its own. The Miura concept that the company displayed here was lovely, lush, indulgent -- and self-indulgent. It proves that respected heads of major European studios cannot resist the temptation to delve into the past. Walter de'Silva, chief of design for Volkswagen's Audi group, which includes Lamborghini, took up the pen himself to render the Miura.
 The Detroit show's largest hips are on the Ford Reflex, a small coupe intended for young couples that would theoretically pack a diesel hybrid powertrain and deliver 65 m.p.g. Ford's design chief, J Mays, said the Reflex was built on the premise that ''small is big,'' or hip. That is, in a world where small has gained outsize prestige -- think of iPods or tiny espresso cups -- little cars no longer need to be econoboxes sold at a loss to generate foot traffic at dealerships. 
 A contrasting vision of a young person's car is the freewheeling, sensuous Mazda Kabura. The Kabura, too, has a novel seating arrangement -- three full seats plus a cargo shelf. The Kabura is the work of Franz von Holzhausen, the former G.M. designer whose sketch was snatched by Bob Lutz, G.M.'s product chief, and turned into the Pontiac Solstice. Mr. von Holzhausen joined Mazda's California design studio early last year. 
 Mazda, controlled by Ford, may now have the liveliest, most consistent and most expressive design language of any automaker. Mr. von Holzhausen speaks of the Kabura's ''dynamism'' and tauter surfaces, like the exaggerated wheel wells.
 ''Kids today play video games with cars from age 5,'' he said. ''They have an idea of the dynamics of a vehicle for years before they actually drive one.'' Referring to two favorite cars among gamers, the Subaru Impreza WRX and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, he added, ''They are likely to be more attached to a WRX or Evo than anything they see on the street.'' 
 Other young designers are growing impatient with Detroit's retro-car obsession, a fixation that calls to mind Hollywood's reliance on sequels and remakes. 
 Another designer who left Detroit, Eric Stoddard, arrived at Hyundai some three years ago from Chrysler, where he designed the sporty Crossfire coupe. Back in Detroit last week, he showed off the HCD9 Talus concept car. 
 ''We were looking for a white space in the market,'' Mr. Stoddard said as he and Mr. Piaskowski stood beside the coupe. ''We want a way of removing compromise between the practical vehicle you need and the hunker-down sports car you want.'' 
 Mr. Stoddard is among those frustrated by Detroit's obsession with the past, saying, ''We want to write our own history.'' 
 But each generation writes only its own chapter, and none are beyond the influence of their predecessors. The auto show is full of fresh ideas this year, some of which will seem stale or be forgotten before long. Yet the Camaro shows that an inspiration from the past can produce a car that is potentially hip today. 
 The real difference between forward-looking and backward-looking cars may lie in the inspirations that their designers had when they were young. The boomers had the classics of the 1950's and 60's while young designers grew up with very different cars -- no fins, no hips. 
 ''My past is a Dodge Omni GLH Turbo,'' Mr. Piaskowski said with a smile. 
 Mr. Stoddard did him one better. ''We had two K-cars,'' he said, remembering the hipless Chrysler product.

HEADLINE: The Reality Show

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
WHILE luxury automakers introduced titillating high-performance cars last week at the North American International Auto Show, it was mostly a reality show for real people who need real transportation.
 In a sobering contrast with recent Detroit shows, the new cars were often more affordable and more fuel-efficient. There was less emphasis on trucks, though there was an abundance of the car-based sport utility vehicles called crossovers.
Among domestic automakers, Jeep, Chrysler and Dodge had the most new production cars; Ford showed two crossovers and a boutique 475-horsepower Mustang; and General Motors brought what might be considered its first true hybrid. 
 Honda, Nissan and Toyota put pressure on the Big Three with smaller, less-expensive, more fuel-efficient cars. Toyota also introduced a redesigned Camry. 
 Here are some of the new or redesigned models being introduced this year, mostly as 2007 models:

AUDI S6 -- The new, all-wheel-drive performance sedan has a 5.2-liter 10-cylinder engine rated at 420 horsepower. Prices will start in the mid-$70,000 range when the car goes on sale in the fall.

BMW Z4 and M ROADSTER -- The updated Z4 -- with two versions of a 3-liter 6-cylinder engine, rated at 215 or 255 horsepower -- is expected in dealerships this spring. Later, there will be a high-performance $52,000 M version with a 333-horsepower engine.

CADILLAC ESCALADE ESV and EXT -- Cadillac has revamped its Escalade line, including the long ESV and EXT pickup models. All get a new 6.2-liter aluminum V-8 and 6-speed automatic.

CHRYSLER ASPEN -- The first S.U.V. with a Chrysler nameplate, the Aspen is essentially a restyled Dodge Durango that seats up to eight people. The optional 5.7-liter hemi V-8 employs cylinder deactivation that lets it alternate between eight and four cylinders to save fuel. Sales will start this fall.

DODGE CALIBER -- The Caliber, a small hatchback wagon, replaces the Neon sedan in the first quarter. Available with front- or all-wheel drive, it is a mechanical sibling of the Jeep Compass. Prices start around $14,000.

FORD SHELBY GT500 -- Ford calls this the most powerful Mustang ever: it has a 475-horsepower, 5.4-liter supercharged V-8. When the GT500 shows up in dealerships in the summer, it will come in both coupe and convertible models. Ford says prices will start around $40,000.

FORD EDGE and LINCOLN MKX -- These siblings are crossover sport wagons that should have carlike ride and handling, since both are based on underpinnings from the Mazda 6. Sales begin late this year.

HONDA FIT -- A subcompact four-door hatchback, the Fit will be the smallest car in Honda's line, but it will be big on standard equipment. With a likely price below $14,000, standard equipment includes antilock brakes; side curtain airbags; air-conditioning; and power windows, mirrors and locks. The 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine delivers estimated fuel economy of 33 m.p.g. in the city and 38 on the highway. The Fit goes on sale in April.

HYUNDAI SANTA FE -- The second generation of this utility wagon, seven inches longer with seven-passenger seating, arrives this summer.

JAGUAR XK CONVERTIBLE -- This redesigned 2-plus-2 convertible goes on sale in the spring at $81,500. The aluminum body carries a 300-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 engine.

JEEP WRANGLER -- The redesigned Wrangler looks familiar, though it is five inches longer. Jeep says it provides more off-road capability and more on-road refinement. It goes on sale this fall.

JEEP COMPASS -- A close relative of the Dodge Caliber, the Compass takes Jeep in a new direction. Never intended for true off-roading, it is the first Jeep with front-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is available) and will offer a continuously variable transmission. It goes on sale in the second half of the year.

KIA OPTIMA -- This redesigned midsize sedan goes on sale in the spring with a wider track and longer wheelbase. It will have six standard air bags (including air curtains) and active front head restraints.

LEXUS LS 460 and LS 460L -- Lexus's new flagship sedan will have the world's first eight-speed automatic transmission and a much more powerful, 380-horsepower V-8. A new stretched version takes aim at the largest German luxury sedans. Lexus will offer a feature that lets the LS parallel-park itself without the driver touching the steering wheel. Sales start in the fall.

MAZDA CX-7 -- Mazda's sleek crossover shares its foundation with the Mazda 3 and Mazda 5. The entry-level model will start at $23,700 and a fancy
 version at $28,000. The CX-7 will compete with a new Acura crossover, the RDX, which will be introduced as a production model at the New York auto show in April.

MERCEDES-BENZ GL-CLASS -- The GL puts Mercedes squarely in the full-size sport utility segment. It is about a foot longer than the M-Class, with which it shares many parts, and offers three rows of seats. With a 4.6-liter V-8 engine and seven-speed automatic transmission, it can tow 7,500 pounds. It goes on sale in June.

MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE SPYDER -- A convertible version of the Eclipse coupe goes on sale in April at a price expected to start below $26,000. Four-cylinder and V-6 engines will be offered.

NISSAN SENTRA -- The sixth-generation Sentra is not only six inches longer, it is no longer Nissan's most basic car -- that role will be filled by the new Versa. The Sentra goes on sale this fall for $15,000 and up.

NISSAN VERSA -- This small four-door hatchback goes on sale early in the summer at about $12,000, to be followed by a sedan later in the year. The 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine is expected to have about 120 horsepower, and there is a choice of three transmissions: six-speed manual, four-speed automatic or continuously variable.

SATURN VUE GREEN LINE HYBRID -- G.M. is introducing its less complex, more affordable hybrid system in the Vue, which will start under $23,000. The Green Line's 4-cylinder gasoline engine is boosted by an electric motor and is expected to be rated at 27 m.p.g. in town and 32 on the highway. Sales start this summer.

TOYOTA CAMRY -- America's best-selling car in seven of the last eight years has been redesigned to be more refined. Engines are a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder or a 3.5-liter V-6. Sales start in March, with a hybrid version to arrive later. The hybrid has a 4-cylinder gasoline engine that develops 147 horsepower and can receive a boost of up to 45 horsepower from an electric motor. Its mileage is estimated at 43 m.p.g. in the city and 37 on the highway.

HEADLINE: Stocks Eke Out Gains as Gold Hits a 24-Year High

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average reached 11,000 on Tuesday for the first time since 2001 but slipped below that benchmark by week's end. Still, the three major market indexes managed to eke out tiny gains for the week. 
 Hewlett-Packard, with a gain of 5.5 percent for the week, had the best performance among the Dow industrial stocks. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock, saying the company's performance had exceeded expectations.
The price of gold reached $558 an ounce in New York -- a 24-year high -- and gold mining stocks like Newmont Mining rose on the news. Newmont has gained more than 12 percent since the beginning of the year.
 For the week, the Dow rose 0.56 point, or 0.1 percent, to close at 10,959.87. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,287.61. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 11.42 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2,317.04. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.35 percent from 4.38 percent the previous week. 
 The price of a barrel of crude oil fell in New York to $63.92 a barrel, from $64.21 the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: A Lukewarm Reception To Corzine's Transition

BYLINE: By Josh Benson. 
Josh Benson is a freelance writer in New Jersey.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
GOVERNOR-ELECT Jon S. Corzine strongly rejects the notion that his transition in state government has been a tough one.
 Asked one day last week -- after an appearance in Manhattan at the Rev. Jesse Jackson's annual economic forum -- whether his efforts to assemble an administration have been more difficult that he anticipated, Mr. Corzine reacted forcefully.
''No,'' he said emphatically. ''You know, to get good people, and to make sure that people can work together, that it's not just one person saying 'I want to hire somebody,' that it's not going to slip into only a political judgment, as opposed to trying to get quality, making sure that people can get through the reporting requirements and ownership issues and conflict issues -- it's normal.'' 
 Mr. Corzine, of course, may well have a different definition of what's normal. He is no ordinary career politician, frequently identifying himself by his time as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs and promising to apply his corporate management skills to improve government in Trenton.
 And it seems as if he has very much taken an outsider's approach, setting up a tightly guarded screening process for staff and cabinet candidates and avoiding conspicuous consultation with party regulars.
 Mr. Corzine, who was elected on a premise of making state government more efficient, wants to be clear that his concern is more about achieving that result than in observing traditional political niceties.
 ''We've asked people to make suggestions,'' he said. ''We even put up a Web site if people want to send in ideas. Somebody might feel like I didn't call them, particularly, but there's close to nine million people in the state. We've tried to reach out broadly to get ideas, but the primary ingredient is people who have the capacity. I want to put together a team of excellence, and we have to build this team.''
 So far, there have been indications that Mr. Corzine has already met some challenges.
 Take one example. It wasn't until last Tuesday -- exactly a week before his inauguration -- that Mr. Corzine asked Gov. Richard J. Codey to announce to dozens of staff members, some of whom had served in multiple administrations, that they had until the end of the week to clear out their desks.
 ''Every decent business I know, they at least give you two weeks' notice,'' said one unhappy employee.
 Mr. Corzine's progress seemed similarly grueling on other fronts. More than two months after his election and less than a week before taking office, he announced a ''nationwide search'' for commissioners of education and health.
 A day later, when Mr. Corzine announced that he had selected Zulima Farber, a former public advocate with a penchant for driving too fast, to succeed the much-criticized Peter C. Harvey as attorney general, the choice was greeted with pronounced skepticism by legislators on both sides of the aisle.
 "I am confident that the [Senate Judiciary] Committee will engage in a full examination of Zulima Farber's credentials, based on her education and her professional and public life experiences,'' promised Senator John Adler, a Democrat from Cherry Hill who will lead the confirmation hearings. 
 Ms. Farber, a Cuban-born lawyer who was an assistant counsel to Gov. Brendan T. Byrne and is currently a partner in the well-connected firm Lowenstein Sandler, was nearly nominated in 2003 for a seat on the State Supreme Court by former Gov. James E. McGreevey. But that notion was abandoned when the governor's advisers learned that she had been the subject of an outstanding bench warrant for failing to appear in court after receiving a ticket for unsafe driving.
 Mr. Corzine dismissed the muted reaction to his nominee, calling Ms. Farber a ''terrific lawyer'' who will be a ''strong, disciplined attorney general.'' 
 Still, Ms. Farber's lukewarm reception may well be an indication of things to come. 
 To act on almost any of the ambitious initiatives he laid out during his campaign, Mr. Corzine will need the help of the Legislature, starting with Mr. Codey, who surely considered it no courtesy to have to take an ax to his staff on the day of his State of the State address. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Codey will be returning to his position as Senate president with sky-high approval ratings from the public and, one presumes, an expectation to have serious input on any of the broad initiatives Mr. Corzine has promised to undertake. 
 So, too, will Joseph J. Roberts Jr., the newly elected Assembly speaker who, like Mr. Codey, is willful, wily and considerably more experienced in the ways of state government than the man who is about to become the state's chief executive.
 Mr. Corzine perhaps said it best in his introductory remarks to the audience of black business executives at the economic forum in Manhattan, where he was praised for leaving the comfort of the United States Senate to take on the sometimes thankless task of governing New Jersey.
 ''It's great to be here,'' Mr. Corzine announced. ''I'm six days away from signing up for murder.''

HEADLINE: Jon Corzine at Play 

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
WHEN Jon S. Corzine takes center stage at his inaugural ball in Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton on Tuesday night, he will be surrounded by family and friends. His three children will be there, as will his 89-year-old mother and 62-year-old brother, who both live in Illinois. A New York psychologist he has been dating for more than a year may join him on the dance floor. And close to 4,000 supporters will be on hand to offer their best wishes -- each having paid $250 for the honor.
 The ball will not only mark the culmination of the day the former United States senator and chief executive of Goldman Sachs takes over the executive branch in New Jersey, it will also be the first official social event Mr. Corzine presides over as the state's 52nd governor.
 While most people recognize these gatherings as little more than a blur of obligatory meet-and-greets, the hors d'oeuvres-laden party will give the public its first glimpse of the more personal side of this 59-year-old multimillionaire. 
 In bringing huge wealth and an element of New York sophistication left over from his Wall Street days to his new role, Mr. Corzine is also an anomaly for New Jersey by being the first single governor the state has had in more than a half-century. And so because he and his wife, Joanne, divorced in 2003 after 33 years of marriage, Mr. Corzine finds himself, at least for now, the only state executive in the country who is a bachelor, although three states have single women as governors. 
 Of course, Mr. Corzine's single status is not news to most people. On the contrary, it was constant fodder during the contentious campaign for governor, with everything from a generous gift to his former girlfriend -- who happened to be president of a public employee's union -- to the embittered 11th-hour remarks of his ex-wife considered fair game. 
 Still, Mr. Corzine's insistence that his agenda will include ''more work than play for the first six months'' will not quell the public's curiosity about the social side of this cosmopolitan man, whose estimated worth is more than $260 million. 
 Before even taking the oath of office, people are buzzing over where Mr. Corzine will live; what he likes to do in his spare time; how and whom he will entertain; if he will continue to have a steady companion (and how necessary it is it to have such a mate in 2006); and, finally, if he will be able to conduct a private life in the ever-intensified glare of the news media and public. 
 In interviews with several associates and with Mr. Corzine himself, a fuzzy picture of the new governor's social agenda emerges: that of a New Jersey-conscious elected official eager to showcase the state; one who enjoys mixing it up with friends and political contacts and who, like another multimillionaire bachelor politician, Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York, cherishes his privacy. 

No Stranger to Public Eye
 As a former co-chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and later as a senator, Mr. Corzine is used to being in the public eye, but not to the extent he will be as governor -- a difference that he insists is simply ''an issue of degrees'' but that friends say he may be underestimating. 
 ''As governor, you're cognizant that you represent more than just yourself, that you represent the state,'' Mr. Corzine said in a recent telephone interview. ''There will be people who have opinions about how I carry myself in public. Some may be right, and some may be wrong.''
 One big difference he is already feeling is the constant presence of a security detail. The governor-elect said accommodating the state troopers assigned to protect him all hours of the day and night required some logistical adjustment, like making room for them in his Hoboken apartment, or being sure they are fed while he is dining out. Another constraint will be felt whenever Mr. Corzine wants to leave New Jersey, and he does like to take brief vacations outside the country. 
 According to the state constitution, anytime the governor is going to be out of state overnight, he is supposed to appoint the Senate president as acting governor. That could mean having to swear in, oddly enough, his erstwhile rival and ally, Gov. Richard J. Codey, every time he wants to spend the night at his girlfriend's Manhattan apartment. That rule is usually not strictly enforced, a spokeswoman conceded, although keeping the state and the news media informed of his whereabouts will be more necessary than in the past.
 For now, Mr. Corzine said he had not yet devised a plan for creating ''off limits'' periods -- as Mayor Bloomberg has done -- when he can function outside the fishbowl environment of a prying news media, and hopes he will not have to.
 ''If I want to spend an afternoon watching a football game in my apartment, or at a friend's apartment, or at Drumthwacket, I would like to be able to do that without having to explain myself,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''If the world gets too invasive, that would be the time to set more parameters.'' 
 Of course, a great deal of curiosity surrounds Mr. Corzine's relationship with Sharon Elghanayan, a 60-year-old Newark native who moved in Mr. Corzine's circles before she began dating him in late 2004 after her divorce from K. Thomas Elghanayan, a New York real estate developer. Before that she was married to Richard Roberts, a lawyer in Essex County. A former clothing designer who returned to college to earn a master's degree after rearing two children, Ms. Elghanayan is a psychotherapist in New York City. 
 Although she attended a handful of campaign events, Ms. Elghanayan managed to fly under the radar throughout the campaign, when so much attention was focused on Mr. Corzine's relationship with Carla Katz, the president of Communications Workers of America Local 1034, and the $470,000 mortgage he had paid off on her behalf. Last month, Mr. Corzine first talked publicly about his relationship with Ms. Elghanayan, and last week he confirmed that she would indeed be at his side on Inauguration Day, along with his family members. As for the public's reaction, he is not worried.
 ''I think she's a class act,'' Mr. Corzine said, ''and hopefully we will carry ourselves that way at the inaugural events.''
 As to their future, Mr. Corzine said, ''Those issues are personal.'' 
 If he were to follow in the footsteps of the last bachelor to take office as governor of New Jersey, there would be wedding bells before his first term expired. When Robert Meyner was elected governor in 1954, he was 45 and single. By 1957 he was married to Helen Stevenson, a distant cousin of Adlai Stevenson, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate.

Matchmaker Not Needed
 Fast forward 50 years, and the necessity of having a political mate by one's side seems archaic. 
 ''The governor of New Jersey doesn't really need a spouse in today's political climate,'' said Ruthi Byrne, wife of former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. 
 Noting that Mr. Corzine is a ''man who enjoys the company of women in the most positive way,'' Mrs. Byrne predicted that the governor-elect ''may operate solo at times, and at other times may have a woman -- the same woman'' as his co-host, but that ''the day of having to have a 'little woman' has passed.'' 
 State Senator Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Bergen County who is a personal friend as well as a political associate of Mr. Corzine, agreed. 
 ''If he decided to entertain at the governor's mansion, I'm sure he'd be able to figure out what to do all by himself,'' said Senator Weinberg, who acknowledged, nonetheless, that there would be a great deal of interest in who he is with.
 ''If he is seen in public with a woman, I'm sure there will be some speculation about that,'' she said. ''People are going to be much more interested in him now. I don't know if he'll be able to sneak off to a movie date, or to a bistro.''
 Until now, Mr. Corzine has been able to drop in to a movie or a local jazz club without being inundated. In recent weeks, he said he has seen the movies ''Good Night, and Good Luck'' and Woody Allen's ''Match Point'' and plans to see Steven Spielberg's ''Munich.'' A confirmed workaholic, he says these outings are never planned in advance but instead happen when an evening opens up unexpectedly. 
 Mr. Corzine, an avid basketball and hockey fan, is hoping to be courtside for a Nets or Devils game, and said he is committed to attend the Rutgers-Louisville game. He was a basketball player in college and says his last pick-up game was when he was 50. For exercise, he jogs four or five times a week. A member of the exclusive Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, he said he had played there only four or five times in the last five years.
 ''I'm not much of a golfer,'' he said. ''It's a time-consuming experience. I love to spend the time with people, but since I spend most of my time chasing the ball in the weeds, it's not something I do much.''
 Mr. Corzine said he likes to entertain but never cooks -- boiling water for instant coffee is the extent of his kitchen skills. Rather, he orders take-out and dines regularly at such chic Hoboken restaurants as Elysian Cafe and the Madison. He has also been known to frequent Per Se restaurant in Manhattan. While recognizing the need to showcase New Jersey, Mr. Corzine feels no obligation to have an all-Jersey cultural diet.
 ''I don't feel there has to be an exclusivity to that,'' he said. ''I want to be supportive of the arts of the state, but I'll go to a Broadway show. Maybe I'll see 'Jersey Guys.' ''

Taste for Arts, Jersey or Not
 Lawrence Goldman, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, said he hoped the new governor's taste for New Jersey arts would grow. While Mr. Corzine has been very supportive of the performing arts center in the past -- paying for its giant chandelier and other programs through a foundation he founded with his ex-wife -- Mr. Goldman said such generosity was largely driven by the governor-elect's commitment to Newark. Now he wants to impress the governor with the center's work.
 ''I hope he'll have more time to come as governor than he did during the campaign,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''I know we're saving a seat for him.''
 Another question that has arisen is where the new governor will reside. He has said he intends to use Drumthwacket, the governor's mansion in Princeton, during his work week, while keeping a place in Hoboken, where he has lived since 2002 and is looking to buy a new apartment in one of the luxury high-rises going up on the waterfront. 
 So far, Mr. Corzine has made no special requests or arrangements for his use of the mansion, according to Beverly Mills, executive director of the Drumthwacket Foundation, who added, ''The foundation is ready, as always, to welcome the new governor to use it as much or as little as he wishes.''
 With the exceptions of two former governors, Jim Florio and James E. McGreevey -- both of whom moved into Drumthwacket's upstairs living quarters full time -- most recent governors have used the mansion largely for official state functions. Mr. Corzine is expected to continue that tradition, although he said he hoped to use the governor's mansion to highlight some of New Jersey's musical talent, bringing in local groups to entertain during official events. 
 Ingrid Reed, director of the Eagleton New Jersey Project at Rutgers, a New Jersey political research organization, predicted Mr. Corzine would have no trouble knowing how to use Drumthwacket.
 ''He will use it in a working sense, as a good place for people to be in a different atmosphere, to encourage conversation,'' said Ms. Reed.
 ''He will be conscious of how to use it frugally,'' she said. ''In these times when there is so much sensitivity about spending taxpayers' money on entertaining, that's not an appropriate use of a public property.''
 Undoubtedly, who will attend those official state functions is likely to be closely watched. Sherry Sylvester, a campaign strategist for Mr. Corzine's opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, predicted that those who helped Mr. Corzine win the race would soon be resurfacing.
 ''The election of Jon Corzine was good news for the party bosses and power establishment of New Jersey,'' Ms. Sylvester said, ''and I'm sure they'll play a key role in the social scene as well.'' 
 Dismissing Ms. Sylvester's comments, Senator Weinberg suggested otherwise.
 ''Because of his promise to clean up the whole 'pay to play' system, he's going to be very careful about the parties he throws,'' she said. 
 For his part, Mr. Corzine said he preferred small gatherings to ''casts of thousands.'' 
 ''I like an interesting dinner party, more informal than formal,'' he said. ''I like to have people sit around a table and have a good meal and good conversation.''

HEADLINE: China, Still Winning Against the Web 

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
IT wasn't so long ago that the Internet was seen as a trap for China. The country desperately needed to foster economic growth, and in the early 1990's much of the globe was plugging itself in. 
 Sooner or later, the thinking went, China would have to plug into the Web, too, and however efficiently its leaders might have controlled information in the old days, they would be no match for this new democratic beast, decentralized and crackling with opinion and information from the four corners of the earth. 
Things didn't exactly turn out that way.
 Last week, Microsoft was still defending itself for having acquiesced to Chinese demands over the New Year's holiday that it shut down the MSN Spaces Web site of a popular Beijing blogger, whose postings had apparently run afoul of censors.
 Reporters Without Borders, a group based in Paris, protested, calling on corporations to adopt codes upholding the free flow of information and, short of that, recommending that Western governments take action. Anti-Microsoft opprobrium electrified the blogosphere, and Congressional hearings may be in the offing. 
 The company said it was simply facing reality. ''Microsoft does business in many countries around the world,'' said Brooke Richardson, a group product manager for its MSN division, in an e-mailed statement. ''While different countries have different standards, Microsoft and other multinational companies have to ensure that our products and services comply with local laws, norms and industry practices.'' 
 Microsoft was only the latest technology company to be criticized for cooperating with the Chinese government. Yahoo, Cisco and Google have all been accused of helping to maintain what the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a Congressional investigatory body, has called ''the most sophisticated Internet control system in the world.''
 Of course, it's hard to blame American companies for a repressive apparatus that long predates Bill Gates, or to dismiss the reality that China's proficient hardware and software developers, hosting services and Nasdaq-traded Internet companies -- Netease, Sina, Sohu -- are quite willing to cooperate with the government on their own. It's also fair to suggest, as many American executives do while insisting on anonymity for fear of angering their Chinese clients, that while their companies must toe the line to maintain access to a lucrative market, the liberating promise of the Internet still applies. It will bring about change in the long run, the executives and free-market advocates insist. 
 ''Our best hope for political change in China is a growing middle class that is tuned in and economically independent,'' said Dan Griswold, a trade policy expert at the Cato Institute. 
 But human rights activists remain skeptical. 
 ''When is 'the long run'?'' said Julien Pain, head of the Internet desk at Reporters Without Borders, which tracks censorship around the world. ''Because I don't see the impact of Microsoft over there. The situation is not improving. Microsoft is behaving just as a Chinese company in China would.'' 
 The company, Mr. Pain continued, just wants ''a piece of the cake.''
 And it's a mighty big cake. 
 The American Internet population is reaching saturation levels, with roughly 203 million users, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, a market research firm. China has the second largest online population in sheer numbers, about 103 million users, by the country's official statistics, but that represents less than 8 percent of 1.3 billion people. In the first six months of 2005, China added almost 10 million new Web users. 
 ''Clearly it's a two-edged sword,'' said Allen Miller, the senior vice president for global affairs of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade group representing dozens of companies. ''On the one hand, it is a wonderful market and everyone wants to jump into it, and on the other, it's a bit of a threat.'' 
 China's leaders were savvy about their Internet strategy almost from the moment they began permitting global connections in 1994. Rather than trying to tame the Web through sheer technological derring-do, they instead created a multilayered regime of filtering and surveillance, vague legal regulations and stringent enforcement that, taken together, effectively neutralized the Internet in China.
 In September, Beijing issued additional overarching rules forbidding bloggers to post information that is ''bounded by law and administrative rules'' or that ''creates social uncertainty.'' 
 Mr. Pain's group lists 62 ''cyberdissidents'' imprisoned around the world for their activities online; 54 are in China. 
 American companies are at best ignoring this grim situation, human rights advocates say, and at worst helping to entrench it. 
 Cisco provided much of the hardware forming the backbone of China's Internet. Last fall, it was revealed that Yahoo had given Chinese authorities the name of an anonymous Chinese e-mail subscriber who had distributed a message about Tiananmen Square. He is now serving a 10-year prison term.
 Google and Yahoo both censor some results on Chinese versions of their products, and the MSN blog tool in China prevents phrases like ''Dalai Lama'' and ''human rights'' from being used in the title for an entry.
 ''While this is a complex and difficult issue,'' Ms. Richardson of MSN said, ''we remain convinced it is better for Microsoft and other multinational companies to be in these markets with our services and communications tools, as opposed to not being there.''
 But technology companies ''need to be better corporate citizens,'' said Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is vice chairman of the House International Relations Committee. 
 ''They should at least be neutral, but I would hope they would actually be on the side of fundamental human rights,'' said Mr. Smith, who plans to hold hearings on the topic in early February and has called for legislation that would toughen rules for doing business with repressive regimes. 
 ''You're talking profit versus someone's loss of freedom,'' he said.
 Mr. Miller of the technology trade association said it's simplistic to suggest that the calculus is ever that cold. ''I don't think any of these decisions are made in a vacuum,'' he said.
 So is one American business, or even the American economy in general, more important than the life of one Chinese dissident?
 ''Well, that's the question,'' Mr. Miller said. ''And reasonable people are going to come down on different sides of that question.''

HEADLINE: Rochester Ferry Was Nice While It Lasted, but Costly

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Last month, Anthony Alleyne arrived at the Lake Ontario shore hoping to catch a high-speed ferry to Toronto, the last trip of the season. He thought he had more than enough time, but as soon as he walked into the terminal, he saw, to his dismay, the ferry pulling away without him.
 Mr. Alleyne, 52, wasn't mistaken about the time; the ferry did leave a few minutes ahead of schedule. ''I wanted to catch that ferry,'' he said. ''It was the last one. It's sad.'' 
Many Rochesterians now feel the same. On Tuesday, they learned that the popular but unprofitable ferry service would cease. Rochester's new mayor, Robert J. Duffy, declined to request an additional $11.5 million in financing for the 2006 season, saying it would be a poor investment given the city's continuing struggles with problems like joblessness and violent crime.
 ''There is not one iota of doubt it's the right decision,'' Mr. Duffy said Friday. ''It was years away from breaking even.''
 Rochester embarked on the ferry project in hopes of becoming an international tourist destination and invigorating its economy. After years of negotiations, two entrepreneurs brought a gleaming $42 million catamaran to a new terminal at Rochester's lakefront in 2004. The ferry, which crossed Lake Ontario to Toronto in two and a half hours, was popular with local residents, who accounted for the majority of ticket sales. Many would even come to the shore just to watch it pull out. 
 The venture was fraught with problems from the beginning, though. The ferry came by sea from Australia, where it was built, but once it was in New York City, it banged into a dock. Later, its engines malfunctioned. The mishaps meant costly repairs and interrupted service. 
 The ferry service operated just the one catamaran, which had a capacity of 774 people and 238 cars. At a fare of about $30 a person and making two round trips a day, it was heavily used at its peak. Still, operating costs soared because of rising fuel prices and regulatory complications, and after 80 days the owners abruptly closed down, citing a $2 million debt. 
 Rochester came to the rescue, buying the ferry at a bankruptcy auction in February. The mayor at the time, William A. Johnson Jr., called it the city's ''phoenix, rising up.''
 Yet under city control, the dismal business results continued. The service lost $1 million a month for 10 months, city officials said, burning through a reserve fund. By late fall, the number of passengers dropped to several dozen per trip.
 Mr. Duffy said his administration's projections showed the ferry would still lose money this year even if it doubled the number of riders, increased fares, and had no unexpected costs. Shutting it down ''was clearly the route we had to go,'' he said. ''It was not financially viable.'' He plans to sell the catamaran.
 Untangling Rochester from the ferry service will not be easy, though. City and state officials have invested more than $63 million in the project, including construction of the terminal and the city's purchase of the ship. The city signed a 14-year contract with the Toronto Port Authority for at least $250,000 a year in docking fees, a commitment Rochester hopes can be canceled. 
 The vendors who opened restaurants and shops inside the terminal signed long leases. Mark Cammilleri, owner of Expresso Cafe, a coffee shop inside the terminal, has watched his business dwindle to a few customs agents, security guards and other workers. Once the ferry is sold, even they will be gone. ''We need to develop the whole area,'' he said. ''Rochester needs more than a ferry to do that.''
 Mr. Duffy plans to meet with the vendors soon to see what the city can do for them. He is willing to meet with other potential ferry operators, and a hovercraft company has already publicly expressed interest. 
 Mr. Johnson, the former mayor, believes he has been portrayed as solely responsible for the ferry's failure. Before the city took control, federal lawmakers, international lenders and the City Council looked at the business plan and approved, he said. 
 He said he was sure that with more time and money, the ferry would have thrived. ''It set us apart, it was a source of pride,'' he said. ''Many of us know it would have worked, and that is sad.''

HEADLINE: Corn Farmers Smile as Ethanol Prices Rise, but Experts on Food Supplies Worry

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: SIOUX CENTER, Iowa, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Early every winter here, farmers make their best guesses about how much food the world will demand in the coming year, and then decide how many acres of corn to plant, and how many of soybeans. 
 But this year is different. Now it is not just the demand for food that is driving the decision, it is also the demand for ethanol, the fuel that is made from corn.
Some states are requiring that ethanol be blended in small amounts with gasoline to comply with anti-pollution laws. High oil prices are dragging corn prices up with them, as the value of ethanol is pushed up by the value of the fuel it replaces.
 ''We're leaning more toward corn,'' said Garold Den Herder, a farmer who cultivates 2,400 acres in a combination of corn and soybeans and is on the board of directors of the Siouxland Energy and Livestock Cooperative, which opened an ethanol plant here in late 2001. Last year a bushel was selling for about $2 here, but near the plant it was about 10 cents higher. 
 Farmers expect it to go higher soon if oil prices stay high. Ethanol was up to $1.75 a gallon, last year, from just over $1 the year before. 
 The rising corn prices may be good news for farmers, but they are worrying some food planners. 
 ''We're putting the supermarket in competition with the corner filling station for the output of the farm,'' said Lester R. Brown, an agriculture expert in Washington, D.C., and president of the Earth Policy Institute. Farms cannot feed all the world's people and its motor vehicles as well, Mr. Brown said, and the result is that more people will go hungry. 
 Others say that the price of goods that have corn as an ingredient, including foods like potato chips or Danish pastries, will rise. 
 But Robert C. Brown, a professor of mechanical engineering at Iowa State University and a specialist in agricultural engineering, said the use of corn for nonfood purposes sounded harsher than it was. ''The impression is that we're taking food out of the mouths of babes,'' Professor Brown said. In fact, corn grown in Iowa is used mostly to feed farm animals or make corn syrup for processed foods.
 And Bernie Punt, the general manager of the Siouxland plant, said, ''It's not as big a loss as what it seems like,'' pointing out that the corn remnants that come out of the other end of the plant were used for animal feed.
 A global shift to farm-based fuel could reduce the need for oil and slow climate change. But Lester Brown is not alone in worrying about the effect on world hunger. For 20 years, the International Food Policy Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington, has maintained a computer model to predict food supplies, based on population changes, farm policies and other factors. 
 Until now, the institute's analysis had included the price of oil and natural gas only as a factor in production costs, including the price of making fertilizer, running a tractor or hauling food to markets. But last year, after Joachim von Braun, the director of the institute, went to Brazil and India, both of which make vehicle fuel from plants, he told his economists to change the model, taking into account the demand for energy from farm products. 
 Even a small shift could have big effects, Mr. von Braun said, because ''the mouth of your car is a monster compared to your family's stomach needs.''
 ''I do not just expect somewhat higher food prices, but new instability as well,'' he said in an interview. ''In the future, instability of energy prices will be translated into instability in food prices.'' 
 Gustavo Best, the energy coordinator at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said growing crops for energy could provide new opportunities for small farmers around the world and finance the development of roads and other valuable infrastructure in poor rural areas. 
 But, Mr. Best added, ''definitely there is a danger that the competition can hit food security and food availability.'' 
 Some experts scoff at the idea of corn shortages, but others say it is possible. Wendy K. Wintersteen, the dean of the College of Agriculture at Iowa State University, said that possibly as early as this summer, ''we will have areas of the state we would call corn deficient,'' because there will not be enough for livestock feed -- the biggest use of corn here -- and ethanol plants. 
 ''It's a hard thing to imagine in Iowa,'' Ms. Wintersteen said. Eventually, experts say, American corn exports could fall. 
 Nationwide, the use of corn for energy could result in farmers' planting more of it and less wheat and cotton, said Keith J. Collins, chief economist of the Department of Agriculture. But the United States is paying farmers not to grow crops on 35 million acres, to prop up the value of corn, he said, and much of that land could come back into production. 
 A change is under way that experts say will tightly tie the price of crops to the price of oil: ethanol plants are multiplying.
 Iowa has 19 ethanol plants now and will have 27 by the end of the year, said Mr. Punt, a former president of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. The Siouxland Energy and Livestock Cooperative showed a $6 million profit for 2005, Mr. Den Herder said, driven in part by the price of ethanol. 
 Many farmers here in the corn belt say they have the ability to grow the material for vast amounts of fuel. Another biofuel is a diesel substitute made from soybeans, which still leaves about 80 percent of the bean for cattle feed, advocates say. 
 Joe Jobe, executive director of the National Biodiesel Board, a trade group, predicted that more demand for soy oil as a diesel substitute would force production of meal, pushing down its price and thus making cattle feed cheaper. 
 ''I think there's a historical shift under way, not to grow more crops for energy and less for food, but to grow more for both,'' Mr. Jobe said.
 Nick Young, the president of an agriculture consulting firm, Promar, in Alexandria, Va., pointed out that corn products have been used for nonfood purposes for years, including to make fluids used to help drill oil wells. Mr. Young said it was an exaggeration to say that nonfood use of crops will make the world's poor go hungry, but he added that the use of vegetable oil as a substitute for diesel fuel had already driven up the price of canola oil. 
 ''These markets are linked,'' Mr. Young said. ''Inevitably, there's going to be some interaction on food prices.''

HEADLINE: Dictatorship in Cambodia

 BODY:
Prime Minister Hun Sen has hardly run Cambodia as a democracy. But now he seems intent on extinguishing what liberty remains. Seth Mydans reported in The International Herald Tribune recently that Mr. Hun Sen is waging political war against human rights groups and political opponents, largely through misuse of defamation laws. 
 Three prominent human rights activists have been arrested in recent weeks, joining two others facing similar charges. And several other opponents of the government have fled the country, among them the leader of the only significant opposition party. This is clearly a man working to keep his nation under the weight of dictatorship.
Unfortunately, in Cambodia, as in a growing number of other countries, whatever Western leverage was left after the 1970's is being eroded by the economic rise of China. Beijing has become the biggest investor in Cambodia, and doesn't give a hoot about human rights. Western donors are reluctant to put new conditions on aid to one of the poorest and most battered countries in the world.
 But there are still things they can do. They must make it clear to Mr. Hun Sen that they don't believe in the legal cover he has thrown over his ambition, and that they firmly oppose his campaign to curtail democracy. Western governments must make sure that the proposed United Nations human rights monitoring council does not reproduce the flaws of the current, discredited Human Rights Commission by deferring to countries that violate rights. 
 Washington supports the idea of the new council, but its envoy, John Bolton, proposed including the five permanent members of the Security Council as permanent members of the rights council. That plays into the hands of China, which would gain a secure perch from which to neutralize any U.N. action against allies like Cambodia.

HEADLINE: Anger in the West Bank Helps Hamas Win Hearts

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BIDDU, West Bank, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Even here in Biddu, a traditionally secular West Bank town a few miles from Jerusalem, the radical Islamic group Hamas is on the rise in an atmosphere of pessimism, anger and joblessness.
 The cafe near the Biddu mosque is full of jobless men of all ages, most of whom worked in Israel before the second intifada produced an Israeli crackdown and the building of the separation barrier, which snakes through some Biddu farmland.
 Politics echoes through the Friday sermon in the packed mosque, with Sheik Yakoub Kirresh, a Palestinian once deported from Israel and later arrested in Jordan as a legislator there, speaking angrily of the Israeli occupation and the need to vote in the Jan. 25 legislative elections. The walls nearby are covered with election posters for parties and candidates in the legislative elections, the first since 1996. Hamas is running, under the name ''Change and Reform,'' the banner that helped produce sizable wins for Hamas in a series of municipal elections.
 There is growing support for Hamas here in Biddu, a town of some 9,000 people, which is run by Fatah in a coalition with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. In the legislative elections, Hamas is likely to get at least 40 percent of the 132 seats at stake, but few expect that Hamas will be allowed to change matters very much, and bitterness prevails about changeable politicians. 
 ''We've heard a lot of promises from Fatah and every politician, but little has been achieved,'' said Said Saleh, 45, who has been unemployed for years. He, like most Palestinians, could not renew his permit to enter Israel after the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000 and the building of the barrier.
 ''I'm not talking against Fatah alone, but from the founding of the P.L.O. to today, what did they do?'' Mr. Saleh asked bitterly. ''They didn't bring us peace, but the reverse. If you accompany me to the Israeli checkpoint, you'll discover nothing has changed. I can't go to Jerusalem to the mosque -- even Palestinian legislators can't go there most of the time.''
 Mr. Saleh has four children, and his wife is sick. The last time he tried to sneak into Israel to find work soldiers chased him, and he nearly fell off a steep cliff, he said. 
 Hamas, he said, is an integral part of the Palestinian people, and he is glad it is running. ''But Hamas can change nothing,'' he said. ''If they are in the legislature they're under the thumb of the United States, Europe and Israel, so they'll have to change and negotiate. Someone will say, 'We won't change,' but he'll be lying.''
 Rami Kassab, 25, has contempt for politicians. ''They climb on our shoulders to get a position, then they forget us,'' he said.
 Muhammad Badwan, 52, a contractor who cannot repay his bank loans, said: ''There were elections 10 years ago, and Fatah came here and my son campaigned for Hanan Ashrawi,'' the moderate Fatah legislator now running on an independent slate. ''But when he needed something, her staff kicked him out,'' he said. 
 Murad Hamidan, 21, said: ''They give you lots of promises. But the moment they have their chair you never see them again.''
 Outside the mosque, Youssef al-Shaik, 51, said he had always been with Hamas, and had been detained twice by Israel during the first intifada. Two of his 12 children are in jail. Another two study in Egypt, but he says he cannot afford to keep both there.
 ''Hamas will make a difference,'' he said, discounting the cafe pessimism. ''If we have power inside, we can help. Running in the election is not just cosmetics; people need change and reform.''
 The Palestinian Authority seems helpless, he said, corrupt and unmotivated. Mr. Shaik said he thought Hamas was the strongest party in Biddu. ''Fatah was the majority, but they achieved nothing but the apartheid wall,'' he said in a bitter reference to the barrier Israel built. ''If they have a position, they try to help their relatives, and that's it. Hamas will be different -- if they have authority in their hands.'' 
 The barrier has been a particularly contentious issue here. Its original route cut off farmers from their land and prompted protests here and in neighboring Beit Surik in February 2004, in which two Palestinians were killed and at least 20 wounded by Israeli troops. Local lawyers persuaded the Israeli Supreme Court in June 2004 to order a halt to construction because the barrier created too many hardships for farmers in Biddu and other towns. A compromise reached last August moved the barrier closer to Har Adar, the Israeli settlement, but still incorporated some, if less, of Biddu's land.
 Israeli troops regularly sweep the Biddu area and have arrested more than 14 Hamas supporters and advocates, including three candidates. 
 It is a rare person here who will publicly agree with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, that armed resistance to Israel is counterproductive and that all militant groups should give up their weapons.
 ''You cannot ask to collect weapons while the occupation continues,'' Sheik Kirresh said in his sermon, an endorsement of Hamas's rejection of Mr. Abbas's call to disarm. Mr. Abbas has promised the United States and Israel that he will dismantle Hamas's military wing after the vote, as called for in the peace plan called the road map.
 But it is much more likely that Mr. Abbas will incorporate Hamas's military wing into a part, and perhaps the dominant part, of the bloated Palestinian security forces. Israelis fear that Hamas's military may ''disappear'' into the Palestinian forces without changing its ultimate goals.
 From inside the security forces, Hamas may be able to produce the law and order Palestinians demand. But its call for the destruction of Israel is not likely to change, even if its military wing listens to the voters and essentially continues the up-and-down cease-fire with Israel, concentrating for the near future on internal Palestinian life.
 Muhammad Mansour, 35, is a Fatah leader, and he is confident or complacent. He predicted that people would vote despite ''their anger over corruption, security chaos and the weakness of Abu Mazen,'' as Mr. Abbas is known. A chastened Fatah will retain its dominant role, he said.
 ''Of course there will have to be a national coalition with Hamas, but Fatah will lead it,'' he said. ''Hamas doesn't want to take decisions and be responsible for governing. They want to block certain matters but have the blame go to Fatah.''
 Is he afraid of Hamas? ''Hamas will have to accommodate with political reality and concentrate more on politics than on the conflict,'' he said, then reflected the usual Palestinian conviction about powerlessness. ''Israel and the United States,'' he said, ''want a Palestinian Authority that serves their interests.''

HEADLINE: First, Do More Harm

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman

 BODY:
It's widely expected that President Bush will talk a lot about health care in his State of the Union address. He probably won't boast about his prescription drug plan, whose debut has been a Katrina-like saga of confusion and incompetence. But he probably will tout proposals for so-called ''consumer driven'' health care.
 So it's important to realize that the administration's idea of health care reform is to take what's wrong with our system and make it worse. Consider the harrowing series of articles The New York Times printed last week about the rising tide of diabetes. 
Diabetes is a horrifying disease. It's also an important factor in soaring medical costs. The likely future impact of the disease on those costs terrifies health economists. And the problem of dealing with diabetes is a clear illustration of the real issues in health care.
 Here's what we should be doing: since the rise in diabetes is closely linked to the rise in obesity, we should be getting Americans to lose weight and exercise more. We should also support disease management: people with diabetes have a much better quality of life and place much less burden on society if they can be induced to monitor their blood sugar carefully and control their diet.
 But it turns out that the U.S. system of paying for health care doesn't let medical professionals do the right thing. There's hardly any money for prevention, partly because of the influence of food-industry lobbyists. And even disease management gets severely shortchanged. As the Times series pointed out, insurance companies ''will often refuse to pay $150 for a diabetic to see a podiatrist, who can help prevent foot ailments associated with the disease. Nearly all of them, though, cover amputations, which typically cost more than $30,000.'' 
 As a result, diabetes management isn't a paying proposition. Centers that train diabetics to manage the disease have been medical successes but financial failures.
 The point is that we can't deal with the diabetes epidemic in part because insurance companies don't pay for preventive medicine or disease management, focusing only on acute illness and extreme remedies. Which brings us to the Bush administration's notion of health care reform.
 The administration's principles for reform were laid out in the 2004 Economic Report of the President. The first and most important of these principles is ''to encourage contracts'' -- that is, insurance policies -- ''that focus on large expenditures that are truly the result of unforeseen circumstances,'' as opposed to small or predictable costs. 
 The report didn't give any specifics about what this principle might mean in practice. So let me help out by supplying a real example: the administration is saying that we need to make sure that insurance companies pay only for things like $30,000 amputations, that they don't pay for $150 visits to podiatrists that might have averted the need for amputation. 
 To encourage insurance companies not to pay for podiatrists, the administration has turned to its favorite tool: tax breaks. The 2003 Medicare bill, although mainly concerned with prescription drugs, also allowed people who buy high-deductible health insurance policies -- policies that cover only extreme expenses -- to deposit money, tax-free, into health savings accounts that can be used to pay medical bills. Since then the administration has floated proposals to make the tax breaks bigger and wider, and these proposals may resurface in the State of the Union. 
 Critics of health savings accounts have mostly focused on two features of the accounts Mr. Bush won't mention. First, such accounts mainly benefit people with high incomes. Second, they encourage wealthy corporate employees to opt out of company health plans, further undermining the already fraying system of employment-based health insurance.
 But the case of diabetes and other evidence suggest that a third problem with health savings accounts may be even more important: in practice, people who are forced to pay for medical care out of pocket don't have the ability to make good decisions about what care to purchase. ''Consumer driven'' is a nice slogan, but it turns out that buying health care isn't at all like buying clothing. 
 The bottom line is that what the Bush administration calls reform is actually the opposite. Driven by an ideology at odds with reality, the administration wants to accentuate, not fix, what's wrong with America's health care system.

HEADLINE: Iran Warns Against Sanctions As Move in Nuclear Standoff

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Iran said Sunday that only diplomacy, not threats to refer the country to the United Nations Security Council for possible punishment, could defuse a standoff over its nuclear work, and warned that any Western push for sanctions could force up world oil prices. 
 At the same time, Republican and Democratic senators in Washington said that the United States might ultimately have to undertake a military strike to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, but that it should be the last resort. 
 ''That is the last option,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' ''Everything else has to be exhausted. But to say under no circumstances would we exercise a military option, that would be crazy.''
 The Security Council's five permanent members and Germany planned to meet Monday in London in search of a common strategy to tackle Iran's resumption of atomic fuel research and development after a two-year moratorium.
 Iran says it wants only to make power for its energy-needy economy. But the United States and a number of other Western countries are convinced that Iran has ambitions to build nuclear bombs and they note that it had hidden nuclear work from international monitors for almost 20 years. 
 Last week, after many starts and stops in talks to meet Iran's energy requirements while satisfying Western concerns about its becoming a nuclear power, Tehran scrapped its suspension of research.
 Nevertheless, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, said Sunday at his weekly news conference: ''Diplomacy is the only clear answer to the current situation. There is no legal basis for referring Iran to the Security Council. But if that were to happen, Iran is not afraid.''
 Economy Minister Davoud Danesh-Jafari warned that any sanctions ''could possibly, by disturbing Iran's political and economic situation, raise oil prices beyond levels the West expects.'' 
 Iran is the world's fourth-largest exporter of crude oil.
 Many European Union, Russian, Chinese and developing world companies also conduct lucrative energy-related trade with Iran, suggesting economic sanctions are anything but inevitable if the Security Council takes up the matter.
 Mr. Asefi called on the countries attending the London meeting -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany -- to refrain from ''the language of intimidation and threats.''
 ''Better results will definitely be achieved by resorting to negotiations and using respectful language,'' he said.
 However, Senator McCain and other American lawmakers said force could not be ruled out entirely.
 Mr. McCain called the standoff ''the most grave situation that we have faced since the end of the cold war, absent the whole war on terror.''
 ''We must go to the U.N. now for sanctions. If the Russians and the Chinese, for reasons that would be abominable, do not join us then we will have to go'' with the nations that are willing, he said.
 Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a Democratic member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on the CNN program ''Late Edition'' that there were elements of Iran's nuclear program that, if attacked, ''would dramatically delay its development.''
 ''But that should not be an option at this point,'' he said. ''We ought to use everything else possible to keep from getting to that juncture.'' 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last week that using force was not an option ''at this point.''
 In an interview with Newsweek released on Sunday, Mohamed ElBaradei, who leads the international monitoring agency, said he could not yet confirm the peaceful nature of Iran's program.
 Dr. ElBaradei said Iran ''might not seem to care, but if I say that I am not able to confirm the peaceful nature of that program after three years of intensive work, well, that's a conclusion that's going to reverberate'' around the world.

PERSON: Michelle Bachelet

HEADLINE: A Leader Making Peace With Chile's Past

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Michelle Bachelet, who was elected Sunday as president of this male-dominated, prosperous and deeply religious nation of 16 million, is a woman and an agnostic, a guitar-strumming child of the 60's, a former exile who spent part of her childhood in the United States, and a physician who has never before held elective office.
 Running as a Socialist on a platform that promised ''change with continuity'' and showcased her warmth and affinity with ordinary people, Ms. Bachelet, a fair-haired, vibrant 54-year-old, won more than 53 percent of the vote, according to the official tally. She made few promises beyond ''social inclusion'' -- vowing to better meet the needs of women and the poor -- and preserving Chile's economy, the most dynamic in Latin America, and the country's close ties with the United States.
But Ms. Bachelet has other qualities that explain how, in barely a decade, she has gone from being a pediatrician at a humble, underfinanced clinic here to the first woman to be her country's chief of state, and one of only a handful of women elected to lead any country in the Americas. 
 Some of those qualities are personal, while others stem from her real and symbolic connections to Chile's recent history. She is a toughened survivor of the Pinochet dictatorship, which was responsible for her father's death and her imprisonment, torture and exile, and she embodies for many Chile's painful reconciliation with those dark years.
 ''Violence ravaged my life,'' Ms. Bachelet said Sunday night, in an impassioned victory speech to a jubilant crowd gathered on the main downtown avenue here. ''I was a victim of hatred, and I have dedicated my life to reversing that hatred.''
 Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria was born in Santiago on Sept. 29, 1951, the second child of an air force officer who rose to a general's rank and a housewife who became an archaeologist. Her early years were spent in the restrictive but sheltering environment of the Chilean Armed Forces, moving from one military base to another around the country.
 In 1962, her father, Alberto Bachelet Martinez, was assigned to the military mission at the Chilean Embassy in Washington. For almost two years, the family lived in Bethesda, a Maryland suburb, where Ms. Bachelet attended middle school, learned to speak English fluently and developed a lifelong love of pop and folk music.
 ''It was hard for her in the beginning,'' Ms. Bachelet's mother, Angela Jeria, recalled in an interview here last week. ''For the first three months, she cried when she came home from school, because she didn't understand any of what was being said. But after six months she was fully integrated, and so we were able to travel around and get to know the United States and Canada and visit places like Niagara Falls and Rehoboth Beach.''
 Friends and relatives recall that the pre-adolescent Ms. Bachelet was shocked by the racial segregation she saw in America and by the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She returned to Chile with her family at the end of 1963, and encountered many other influences that would mark the 60's generation, from the Beatles to the debate over the war in Vietnam and the May 1968 uprising of students in France.
 ''We were teenagers immersed in the political and social movements that were transforming Chile and the world,'' said a cousin, Alicia Galdames, with whom Ms. Bachelet formed a folk duo whose repertoire included songs of Joan Baez and Bob Dylan. ''The seeds of her ideals were planted in this period.''
 Ms. Bachelet's enrollment in college coincided with the start here of the left-wing Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende. She studied medicine at her father's urging and joined the youth wing of the Socialist Party. Colleagues remember her as holding views that were moderate for an era that became the most polarized in Chilean history.
 ''She was really studious, very disciplined and responsible and sure of herself, but with a tremendous capacity for empathy,'' said Gladys Cuevas, a fellow student and close friend. ''It was a time of black and white, but she managed to get along with everybody, no matter what their political persuasion. She wasn't one to look for fights; on the contrary, she was the one who was tolerant, always looking for consensus.''
 With food shortages growing in Chile and a black market developing, her father was lent by the air force to the Allende government and put in charge of food rationing and distribution, where he worked closely with the Socialists and other leftists. When Gen. Augusto Pinochet led the coup that overthrew the Allende government on Sept. 11, 1973, the military viewed General Bachelet with suspicion. Spurning a chance to go into exile, he was jailed, and in March 1974, after months of torture, died in prison of a heart attack.
 Months later, both Ms. Bachelet and her mother were detained and sent to Villa Grimaldi, one of the most notorious of the Pinochet dictatorship's secret prisons. While there, Ms. Bachelet was also subjected to physical and psychological torture -- being hit during interrogations, blindfolded and tied to a chair for long periods, and told that her mother would be executed. She minimized those experiences in an interview in 2002, saying, ''There were others, even in my own cell, who had it much worse than I did.'' 
 ''I haven't forgotten,'' she said. ''It left pain. But I have tried to channel that pain into a constructive realm. I insist on the idea that what we experienced here in Chile was so painful, so terrible, that I wouldn't wish for anyone to live through our situation again.''
 Ms. Bachelet and her mother were freed within months, thanks to the lobbying of an Air Force general who was a relative. They went into exile in 1975, first in Australia, where her older brother Alberto had moved, and then, after a few months, to East Germany, at the request of the Socialist Party directorate, which wanted them to take part in Chile solidarity campaigns in Europe.
 Initially, Ms. Bachelet worked as a hospital orderly and lived with her mother in Potsdam. But she resumed her medical studies at Humboldt University in East Berlin, after she became proficient in German.
 While in exile, Ms. Bachelet married Jorge Davalos, an architect and fellow exile, and gave birth to the first of her three children, Jorge Sebastian Alberto, now 27. The marriage ended in the mid-1980's, after a second child, Francisca, 21, was born here. Ms. Bachelet has not married again, though she has a third child, Sofia, 13, from a now-lapsed relationship with a doctor.
 Upon her return to Chile in 1979, as the expulsion order against her mother was being lifted, Ms. Bachelet finished medical school, specializing in pediatrics and public health. Though she graduated near the top of her class, her family name and political affiliations made it difficult for her to find employment. She ended up working at a clinic financed by Sweden that treated children from families that had been victims of torture and political repression.
 She remained there through the rest of the Pinochet dictatorship, which ended in 1990 after elections put in power the center-left coalition that still governs Chile. In 1994, after having worked in AIDS and epidemiological programs, she became an adviser to the Ministry of Health. But she retained her familial fascination with military affairs, and in 1996 enrolled in a program in strategic studies at the national war college.
 Ms. Bachelet excelled there, and was invited to study at the Inter-American Defense College in Washington. She did so in 1997, and after her return, she went to work in the Defense Ministry and was also elected to the political commission of the Socialist Party, specializing in defense and military issues.
 Six years ago this month, Chile elected a Socialist president, Ricardo Lagos, for the first time since the fall of Mr. Allende. Mr. Lagos appointed Ms. Bachelet minister of health. In that capacity, she became identified with a partly successful campaign to reduce waiting time for patients and emerged as a familiar figure at hospitals and clinics all over Chile. 
 After two years, Ms. Bachelet was shifted to lead the Defense Ministry, becoming the first woman to hold that post, and she became nationally known, photographed in an armored vehicle, inspecting troops and wearing army camouflage or an aviator's leather jacket on her official rounds. 
 The symbolism of her leadership of the institution that had killed her father appealed greatly to Chileans trying to reconcile with their bitter past.

HEADLINE: A Conservative Evolves, And Leads a Canadian Race

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HUNTSVILLE, Ontario, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
''God bless all of you, God bless Canada!'' is the way Stephen Harper finishes every campaign stump speech as he appears to be heading toward a landslide victory to become prime minister.
 It is an unusual line in a country where politicians do not customarily talk about God or their religious beliefs, where church attendance is plummeting and same-sex marriage has become legal and widely accepted despite the opposition of many religious leaders.
 ''It sounds very American,'' said Jackie Mitchell, a 45-year-old music teacher who attended a Harper rally on Saturday in this woodsy, rural community. ''But what he's saying is, let's get the country moving.'' 
 The reference to God may be a signal that Mr. Harper and his Conservative Party are preparing to take the country in a very different direction after 13 years of Liberal rule characterized by a softening of drug laws, an expansion of the rights of gays and a distancing from United States positions in foreign affairs.
 Or the mention of God may simply be a nod to his party's conservative, western base, because his entire campaign otherwise has been devised to establish himself in the minds of voters as a moderate who has shifted from his steadfast conservatism.
 ''Over the course of a decade, people's views evolve somewhat and situations change,'' Mr. Harper, 46, told reporters the other day. ''I deal with the situation as I find it.''
 So far the campaign leading up to the Jan. 23 vote has been more about recent Liberal Party scandals than about Mr. Harper, and polls indicate that a majority of Canadians say it is time for change.
 Prime Minister Paul Martin's sharply negative advertising campaign aimed at painting Mr. Harper as a fanatic friendly to American conservatives has apparently backfired, but it has left open the question of how Mr. Harper would govern.
 Mr. Harper's platform and speeches concentrate on nuts-and-bolts issues, and he rarely brings up his opposition to the Kyoto climate protocol, his past support for the United States-led invasion of Iraq and his opposition to same-sex marriage. He jokes about his lack of charisma, and his very dullness seems to play well to an electorate tired of slick politicians.
 In a recent interview with Radio Canada, he suggested that he would revisit Ottawa's decision not to participate in the Bush administration's missile-defense system. The Conservative platform calls for increases in foreign aid to bolster Canada's role in the world, as well as an additional $5 billion in military spending to recruit and outfit an additional 13,000 troops and 10,000 reservists. But Mr. Harper has largely left foreign policy out of his stump speech, and he now says his government would not contribute troops to the American-led effort in Iraq.
 His campaign refused to arrange an interview for this article.
 The main Conservative proposals are a cut in the unpopular national sales tax, a direct allowance to families that can be used for child care, longer prison sentences for criminals, and an assortment of anticorruption measures. They are stances that appear to be making headway with middle-class voters of all ages across the country, including in Quebec, where the Conservatives have done very poorly in the last several elections.
 ''We believe in families and parents, and that's who we are going to help,'' Mr. Harper told a rally in Barrie, Ontario, on Friday night. He said Canadians ''want practical, believable solutions to their problems.''
 Mr. Harper, a longtime member of the House of Commons from Alberta, worked his way up through the ranks of the Reform and Canadian Alliance parties, two conservative parties that had tried to replace the centrist Progressive Conservative Party as the main opposition to the long-dominant Liberals. He once led a conservative research organization and referred to Canada 10 years ago as ''a northern European welfare state in the worst sense of the term.''
 But his current campaign, mostly devoid of ideology, has so far worked to make him palatable to an electorate that remains largely liberal. Polls show Mr. Harper's Conservatives ahead of the Liberals by about 10 percentage points, with the separatist Bloc Quebecois leading in Quebec and the social democratic New Democratic Party well behind.
 In the 2004 campaign, the Liberals eked out a narrow victory after using negative commercials in the final weeks suggesting that Mr. Harper had a secret, right-wing agenda.
 Those commercials were made more credible by speeches and interviews given by some Conservative candidates who opposed abortion and gay rights. In this campaign the Conservative effort has been far more disciplined -- candidates' speeches are closely vetted -- and several of the most conservative candidates and lawmakers have retired.
 Mr. Harper has also made an effort to soften his image as a dour man with a legendary temper.
 The Conservative campaign has been marked by photo-ops showing Mr. Harper and his wife, Laureen, walking hand in hand in the snow.
 While on a recent tour of rural New Brunswick, an aide handed Mr. Harper a snowball to throw at photographers. The staged moment with its appearance of spontaneity received favorable front-page pictures on the very day newspapers published Mr. Harper's remarks about how he had evolved.
 Mr. Harper, who is an economist, has long been known more for his enthusiasm for policy than for an ability to kiss babies and slap backs. Just last summer, during a tour of barbecues, he was mocked in news articles and columns after he appeared at the Calgary Stampede rodeo festival in a tight-fitting cowboy vest that made him look as if he had borrowed his little brother's Halloween costume.
 ''This does not come naturally for him,'' said Marjory LeBreton, a Conservative senator and campaign adviser. ''I think he's basically shy.''
 Senator LeBreton said Mr. Harper's evolution reflected a melding of the ideas of the moderate Progressive Conservative Party and the right-wing Canadian Alliance Party which merged under his leadership three years ago.
 ''Once the parties merged he evolved because all of the sudden he was the leader of a much broader-based, pan-Canadian party,'' she said. ''There is a pragmatic side to him.''

HEADLINE: Law Aimed At Wal-Mart May Be Hard To Replicate

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
When the Maryland legislature passed a law last week requiring that its largest employers, including Wal-Mart Stores, spend at least 8 percent of their payrolls on health care, supporters of the measure claimed they had delivered a clear message to corporate America: companies cannot shirk their duty to employees. 
 ''Let's light the torch. Let us lead the way,'' said Senator Gloria G. Lawlah, a Democrat who sponsored the bill.
 Elated union leaders claim that they have lined up legislators in 30 states to introduce similar bills this year -- and that the Maryland vote is likely to give their campaign added impetus. 
 For all the unions' success in Maryland, though, it is doubtful that the campaign will steamroll across the country, policy analysts say. Because the other states' bills are written much more broadly, they are likely to draw more opposition from companies that watched the Maryland debate from the sidelines. 
 Still, the new Maryland law has already begun to raise the decibel level of the debate over how to handle the nation's growing number of people with no health insurance, which is now at 46 million. Union activists and others say the law focuses more attention on the role of employers in providing the insurance.
 ''There is now more public consciousness about how large employers do not provide health care,'' said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Health Access California, a consumer coalition that supported a similar law in California that was narrowly defeated by voters a little more than a year ago.
 Only a handful of states, among them Rhode Island, Washington, Colorado and New Hampshire, are likely to seriously consider requiring employers to provide a certain level of coverage, according to health care advocates and union activists.
 Maryland's bill, drafted to apply to companies with 10,000 or more employees, actually affects only one company in the state: Wal-Mart Stores, which has come to symbolize corporations that do not provide adequate health benefits to their employees. The laws being contemplated elsewhere, aimed at companies with a thousand or two thousand employees in that particular state, could affect dozens of other corporations, like McDonald's and the CVS Corporation, the drugstore chain.
 ''The broader the scope of the attack, the broader the counterattack that will be mounted,'' said Prof. Carl Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, who does not expect the Maryland law to lead to the passage of similar bills in many other states. 
 Retailing and restaurant chains, which are most vulnerable to any state law mandating coverage because they employ so many low-income workers, are already preparing an aggressive campaign to prevent lawmakers from passing the legislation outside Maryland. Three trade groups -- the National Retail Federation, the National Restaurant Association and the International Franchise Association -- have created a coalition to oppose legislation. 
 ''If retailers are hit with this extra cost, this is going to put them in a position to raise prices for consumers or lay off workers,'' said J. Craig Shearman, vice president of government relations at the retailers' federation. 
 The Maryland law is likely to face legal challenges to determine whether federal law allows states the authority to mandate health benefits, said J. D. Piro, the chairman of the health law group at Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm. 
 The Maryland Chamber of Commerce, a business lobbying group, argued that the Maryland bill was pre-empted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, even though the Maryland attorney general found that the bill did not violate federal law because it imposed no requirements on how companies spend their money. ''It's likely this will go to court,'' Mr. Piro said. 
 Struggling to balance their own budgets in the face of rising health care costs, some state officials are likely to look favorably on action that would force companies to shoulder more of the bill. ''I think they will be looking,'' said Helen Darling, the president of the National Business Group on Health, an employer coalition based in Washington. ''It seems to be a cheap fix.'' 
 States are searching for ways to pay for programs like Medicaid, Mr. Piro agreed. ''It's a question of who has the money,'' he said.
 Amy G. Rice, a Democrat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, said the bill that she planned to introduce next week had ''a high chance of passing'' in the Democratic-controlled state legislature. 
 ''Legislators in both parties are very concerned about the health care crisis in Rhode Island,'' said Ms. Rice, who cited a poll that found that a majority of the state's residents supported the idea of requiring large corporations to increase spending on health care. 
 Her bill would require companies with more than 1,000 employees to devote 8 percent of their payroll to health insurance. Ms. Rice estimates that of 38 employers with more than 1,000 employees, only 6 do not meet the 8 percent requirement.
 Proponents of similar bills in other states say most companies would not be affected. As a result, they say, companies that do provide coverage may be reluctant to support the efforts of those that do not. 
 ''They won't be the leaders of the opposition,'' said Mr. Wright, the California advocate who said the majority of the resistance in his state came from fast-food and retailing companies. In fact, some companies may even support the measures. In Maryland, for example, Giant Food, a regional supermarket chain that competes with Wal-Mart, came out in favor of the legislation.
 Because it is so narrowly written and may not result in coverage for significant numbers of uninsured people, policy analysts say the Maryland bill cannot be viewed as a model for any states looking seriously at gaps in health care coverage. ''The Maryland law is aimed at Wal-Mart, not the issue of the uninsured,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group in Washington.
 Wal-Mart insures fewer than half of its 1.3 million employees in the United States. According to an internal memo, 5 percent, or roughly 65,000, of its workers rely on state Medicaid plans, compared with 4 percent for other national companies. 
 Even if other laws apply to significantly more employers, some policy analysts say these measures do not represent long-term solutions to the problem of paying for health care. ''I'd rather see the state work with all employers to see if they can come up with incentives to spread the risk among a broader pool,'' said Laura D. Tyson, dean of the London Business School and former chief economic adviser to President Bill Clinton. ''This is a Band-Aid, arbitrary, firm-specific solution to one of the most important policy problems of the United States.''
 The focus on the issue of low-income workers who cannot afford coverage even when it is offered is important, said Peter V. Lee, the chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health. But, he said, the question of who pays for the care for these individuals -- the state or the employer -- does not address the fundamental problem of rising health care costs in this country, he said. 
 ''All we're doing is playing squeezing the balloon,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Culture Raises Its Head And Heart

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
While much of the grieving and arguing about New Orleans has centered on housing, a panel appointed by the mayor contends that any comeback will be driven by a fierce love of the city's distinctive culture -- from music to food to folk traditions. 
 To that end, a report to be released today by the cultural committee of Mayor C. Ray Nagin's Bring New Orleans Back Commission, proposes that the city regenerate its pool of creative talent by finding jobs and shelter for artists and cultural institutions. It must repair damaged cultural facilities and build new ones, like a National Jazz Center and an expanded and enhanced arts district, the report says; market New Orleans as a world-class cultural capital; teach the arts and cultural traditions to the city's young people; and seek investment from national and international sources. 
 After the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Katrina in late August, ''no one doubts that the first order of business for New Orleans is to rebuild the levees and address the enormous need for shelter,'' the report says. ''But it is New Orleans culture, our musical, visual, culinary, architectural, literary and graphic arts, that has always drawn people to visit, to live in, and to invest in our city. And it is our culture that will bring back the city that we love.''
 Wynton Marsalis, co-chairman of the cultural committee, said in a telephone interview: ''What gives you the will to survive? That will has to do with your soul and your spirit. That's what culture is.''
 Mr. Marsalis is to discuss the 42-page report at a news conference this morning at Tulane University. 
 For musicians, craftsmen and other artists to regain their footing, operations must be restored at arts organizations, the document says. 
 ''We need to begin rebuilding our cultural economy by investing in our creative people and our core cultural organizations and associations,'' it says, ''aiding those who are still here, bringing back those who were displaced by the storms, and attracting new people with fresh talent and energy.''
 The report calls for loans and grants to develop and market culture and for the creation of an Internet clearinghouse where audiences can learn about events, artists can exchange information and cultural organizations can promote themselves and pool their resources.
 One percent of the proceeds from bonds of most city capital projects are now used to commission works of art. The report suggests this be raised to 2 percent. 
 ''New Orleans cannot -- and indeed should not -- simply be 'put back as it was,' '' the report says. ''We need a dynamic cultural strategy that simultaneously aids the artists, organizations and associations that are currently at risk, and clears the pathway for expansion of our cultural sector and its appeal to cultural tourists and philanthropic investors.''
 Like most other industries, the city's cultural sector took a big hit from the hurricane. Fewer than 25 percent of the city's 1,000 nonprofit and commercial arts organizations are up and running again, and the cost of restoring them is estimated at $185 million over three years, the report says. More than $30 million in operating revenue will be lost by cultural organizations this year alone, the report estimates.
 About 11,000 arts employees lost their jobs, and the overall creative work force has dropped from 15,000 to less than 5,000, the report says. Three-quarters of the city's 260 nonprofit arts organizations remained closed at the end of November. The uninsured damage to cultural properties, arts businesses and artists tops $80 million, and requests for assistance exceed $512 million.
 The number of musicians has dropped from more than 2,000 to fewer than 250, according to the report, and more than 400 of these artists have sought assistance from their unions, reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment and property damage. Social aid and pleasure clubs, Mardi Gras Indian tribes and similar groups have reported losses of more than $3 million from destroyed costumes, instruments and other items. 
 Among the report's more specific proposals are the planning and construction of a National Jazz Center; a Linear Culture Park that would link important cultural sites, and an expansion of the Warehouse Arts District, with cultural thoroughfares along South Rampart Street and Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard.
 It also suggests a three-year marketing effort to promote New Orleans cultural history and offerings around the world, from the heritage of jazz artists like Louis Armstrong or Jelly Roll Morton; to writers like Tennessee Williams or John Kennedy Toole to the chef Paul Prudhomme to artists like the photographer E. J. Bellocq. In addition, the report calls for improving visitor amenities like signage and hospitality services; developing school curriculums on the cultural history of Louisiana; trying to attract investment from philanthropists and corporations; and creating a New Orleans Cultural Restoration Oversight Commission to supervise the overall effort. 
 ''When we saw our city go under water, it's like seeing something happen to your mama,'' Mr. Marsalis said. ''You wish you had something more to give it than time.''

HEADLINE: Event for Cheap Lunches Is 20% Less Cheap In '06

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
At the end of this month, thousands of people will plunk down more than $24 each for a meager tangle of salad greens, a molehill of orecchiette and, inevitably, a precious ramekin of panna cotta and be persuaded that they have gotten a New York bargain.
 When Restaurant Week started in 1992, the notion -- hatched by Joe Baum, then the owner of the Rainbow Room, and Tim Zagat, of guidebook fame -- was as startling as it was successful. 
Restaurants, many of which charged upward of $30 for lunch, offered up the same tasty nibbles for $19.92, and thousands of New Yorkers poured into restaurants they would not have been able to afford otherwise. Thus a sleepy summer week in the restaurant world was annually invigorated, and, dinner, for slightly more, was added to the program. In 2000, two restaurant weeks were added for winter. 
 But, preceded by $4 cups of coffee, $10 movie tickets and $200 jeans on Orchard Street, lunch during Winter Restaurant Week, now $24.07 a person, joins the ranks of the city's no-longer-so-cheap thrills.
 The price, nearly 20 percent higher than last year's, is yet another reminder that the sport of avoiding retail price, not so long ago as much a part of city life as hoarding a parking space or lamenting the state of the Mets, may be fading. Yes, a plate of glistening fish at Cafe Boulud followed by a sublime dessert would cost you plenty more the rest of the year. And adjusted for inflation, the price of lunch during Winter Restaurant Week -- Jan. 23 through Feb. 3 -- is not so bad when compared to the $19.92 price.
 This year's lunch price exceeds last year's $20.12 lunch price, and once a diner has added a glass of shiraz, some sparkling water and a side of spinach -- not to mention tax and tip -- the check swells far beyond what most people think of as economical. 
 And 64 of the 198 restaurants participating in the program will not be offering dinners at the special price of $35 a person -- the same as last year's dinner price -- figuring that it is simply not worth it.
 Chefs deny pushing for the higher price -- set by a committee in the city's tourism bureau in some gimmicky denomination, this year to recognize the 24/7 nature of New York. But many chefs interviewed said that the prices reflected both inflation in food and other costs in New York, and added that they still break even during the promotion, when deflated lunch prices are made up for in volume.
 ''It gives exposure to the restaurant for people who might not normally see it,'' said Herman Allenson, the restaurant director at Jovia on the Upper East Side, one of the restaurants offering the deal this year. 
 ''And it boosts lunch numbers for that week,'' Mr. Allenson said. ''But we do it for reasons more along the lines of civic duty.'' Mr. Allenson said that a diner at Jovia would get an organic chicken breast (normally $17) and white bean soup (usually $12) as part of the lunch deal.
 ''It is difficult to make any money,'' by serving lunch at the special price, said Scott Conant, the chef and owner of L'Impero, who added that the $24.07 price ''relaxes things a bit.'' But $35 for dinner he will not do. ''We just can't,'' he said, adding that the restaurant is full at dinner anyway without deflating the price. 
 Given the broad swath of participating restaurants, other chefs refrained from complaining about the high cost of heating oil and locally grown potatoes needed to produce their meals, and seemed gleeful with the new lunch price. 
 Consider Mr. K's, an upscale Chinese restaurant in Midtown, which actually charges a dollar less for its regular prix fixe lunch. ''We could have done it for less,'' conceded Edward Cheung, a partner in the restaurant.
 Lisa Mortman, a spokeswoman for NYC & Company, the city's tourism arm, said that raising the price allowed restaurants to offer patrons great food -- rather than a slab of cod and second-rate appetizers that have become a staple for many participating restaurants -- at a low price. 
 ''I think you need to look at the program as a whole and the rate of inflation,'' Ms. Mortman said. ''Restaurants typically work on small margin, so you have to make adjustments. If you really look at it, it is still a great bargain.''

HEADLINE: In Reversal, Silicon Valley Added Jobs in '05

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
A report released on Sunday said the Silicon Valley region added new jobs in 2005 for the first time in four years, providing evidence that an economic resurgence is under way in the region. 
 While the number of new jobs -- 2,000 -- was modest, the data suggested that the ''jobless'' economic recovery of the last two years in Silicon Valley may be evolving into one that creates jobs as well as revenue.
The report, issued by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a nonprofit organization, found that Silicon Valley companies employed 1.15 million people in 2005, a 0.2 percent gain over the previous year. 
 ''Finally, there's an uptick,'' said Russell Hancock, president and chief executive of the organization, based in San Jose, Calif. ''All the signs are that this will hold up.''
 The employment figure is still substantially lower than the number of people employed in the region in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, but Mr. Hancock said comparing the two periods was unrealistic. 
 ''You're never going to see the kind of job creation that you did during the dot-com boom,'' he said. ''That was Silicon Valley's job factory overheating. It wasn't real.''
 During the dot-com era, Silicon Valley gained 350,000 new jobs, only to lose 200,000 of them in the early 2000's. ''We're a region that's always been tied to boom-bust cycles,'' Mr. Hancock said. ''We've reinvented ourselves five or six times.''
 The report, which is issued annually, said most of the new jobs were high-end positions. ''They are particular kinds of jobs -- creative and knowledge-intensive,'' Mr. Hancock said. He added that much of the growth was in consumer electronics and software. By contrast, job growth in Silicon Valley during earlier periods was largely driven by business technology sales.
 As they have struggled to grow in recent years, technology companies have learned to make do with fewer people, said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, an economic research organization. He said the region's job numbers were not anywhere near the employment levels that existed even before the boom and were not likely to reach that level. ''Production is up, sales are up, and all that can exist without job growth,'' Mr. Levy said.
 The challenge for Silicon Valley now is to provide the training and education necessary to ensure that it has workers who are prepared for new jobs. Graduation rates among high school students in the region declined in 2005, and disparities persist among ethnic groups. 
 In the Joint Venture report, Mr. Hancock wrote, ''Not everyone is benefiting from the changes we're experiencing, and too many of us are unprepared to participate in a more demanding economy.'' Legal immigration rose 56 percent in Silicon Valley in 2005, compared with 2004, more than three times the increase for the United States as a whole. While the overall population of Silicon Valley grew by less than 1 percent in 2005, that was the largest increase since 2000, the report said.

HEADLINE: They're Rounding the First Turn! And the Favorite Is 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: CALCUTTA 

 BODY:
The great race of the 21st century is under way between China and India to see which will be the leading power in the world in the year 2100. 
 President Bush's trip to India next month is important, for we in America must brace ourselves to see not only China looming in our rear-view mirror, but eventually India as well. India was the world's great disappointment of the 20th century, but now it's moving jerkily forward with economic reforms, reminding me of China around 1990.
One of India's (and China's) greatest strengths is its hunger for education. Most American newspapers lure readers with comics, and some British tabloids with photos of topless women, but a Calcutta daily newspaper is so shameless that it publishes a column on math equations. Imagine titillating readers with trigonometry! 
 I visited the ramshackle Hasi Khusi Kindergarten and Primary School in a poor area of Calcutta, where most of the pupils' parents are illiterate street vendors, rickshaw drivers or laborers. Out of an average family income of $23 a month, the parents pay a one-time fee of $13 for registration and then $2.30 a month.
 ''What they didn't get, their children must get,'' explained the principal, Sampa Sarkar. Even kindergartners study English, Bengali, math, art and music -- and do 30 minutes of homework. Private schools like this one are booming all across the country.
 With India's ever-deepening pool of English speakers, its outsourcing boom will continue. Your next employment contract may be prepared by an Indian law firm, your mutual fund advised by Indian analysts -- and if you need elective surgery, you may get it at a luxurious Indian hospital that will let foreigners combine their medical care with a recuperative vacation in Agra or Goa. 
 India has a solid financial system, while China's banking system is a catastrophe. And India is in better shape demographically for long-term growth: China has already reaped most of the economic benefits of population control and is now rapidly aging, but India's population will be disproportionately working-age for many decades to come (a factor that strongly correlates with economic growth). 
 India's democracy, free press and civil society also provide a measure of political stability. Sure, India can erupt, as it did with the slaughter of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002. But the risks of social and political explosions in India are declining, while in China they may be rising.
 China will probably manage its eventual transition to democracy with bearable turbulence, as Taiwan and South Korea did, but with China anything is conceivable, including a coup d'etat, mass unrest or even civil war.
 Yet if democracy is one of India's strengths, it's also a weakness. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh knows exactly what to do, and I've rarely met a leader more competent (or less charismatic). But his reforms are stalled or slowed in the Indian political labyrinth. India's basic problem is that its economic policy-making isn't nearly as shrewd, pro-growth or farsighted as China's. 
 That's a tragedy: we should all want India to demonstrate that democracy is an advantage. But Indian lawmakers aren't helping.
 Foreigners are still blocked from directly investing in some sectors in India, like retailing. Privatization is lethargic. Food subsidies are soaring and are so inefficient that it costs 6.6 rupees to transfer 1 rupee's worth of food to the poor. Restrictive labor laws mean that companies hesitate to hire, and regulations tend to suffocate entrepreneurship.
 The upshot is that India has enjoyed a boom that has added few jobs. Only about one million people work in technology, and manufacturing, which could absorb tens of millions of poor rural laborers, trails even Bangladesh. The losers are India's poor.
 And while China has been exceptionally shrewd in upgrading its infrastructure, India has been pathetic. India's economic future is marred by its third-rate roads and ports.
 India is also horrendously mismanaging its AIDS crisis; it may already have more H.I.V. cases than any country in the world. AIDS casts a cloud over this nation's entire future.
 The bottom line is that the once-great nation of India is reawakening from several centuries of torpor, and facing less risk of a political cataclysm than China. India is poised to again be a great world power.
 But over all, my bet is that China will still grow faster and win the race of the century. I'm going to tell my kids to keep studying Chinese, rather than switch to Hindi.

HEADLINE: Europe Urged to Check Travelers To Prevent Spread of Bird Flu

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
With outbreaks of bird flu continuing in Turkey, European countries should adopt policies such as increased checks of airline passengers and their belongings to prevent the disease from spreading across the continent, a top United Nations agriculture official recommended here on Monday. 
 Samuel Jutzi, chief of the Animal Production and Health Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, said that ''Europe in particular ought to step up in this type of risk management.''
 European nations should consider requiring incoming travelers to fill out forms detailing their travel history and the agricultural products in their possession, as has long been the policy in the United States, he said. He noted that some of those products, like feathers and chicken parts, might introduce the A(H5N1) bird flu virus into countries that have had no cases of the disease. 
 There are 80 flights a day into Frankfurt alone from countries affected by bird flu, and passengers are largely unscreened, Mr. Jutzi said. When German authorities did spot checks on just over 300 flights during a three-month period at the end of 2005, they confiscated 9.5 tons ''of items that should not have been brought in,'' he said.
 As the World Bank prepared to convene a meeting of international donors in Beijing on Tuesday to solicit more than $1 billion to fight bird flu, officials here emphasized that human commerce must be better monitored and controlled.
 While the officials acknowledged Turkey's contention that it is vulnerable because it lies at a crossroads of bird migration routes, they said that was only part of the story. 
 ''It's very easy to blame bird migration, because then no one's responsible,'' said Juan Lubroth, a senior United Nations scientist who has spent the last week in Turkey investigating the outbreaks. ''Migrating birds may introduce the virus into an area, but it is human activity that spreads it.''
 Mr. Jutzi said that there was ''no reason to believe that the virus in eastern Turkey had not already passed the border into neighboring countries,'' and that delegations would be sent to investigate that possibility. The remote towns of eastern Turkey most affected by bird flu in recent weeks are on trade routes into Iran and Armenia; those countries and others nearby should take precautions, he said.
 ''Syria is at risk, Bulgaria is at risk,'' he added.
 In Turkey, Dr. Lubroth said, the simultaneous outbreaks in distant parts of the country may have been caused in part by the practice of commercial poultry farms of sending huge truckloads of old and unproductive hens to the countryside to sell to poor farmers, potentially seeding outbreaks in many villages if even one of the birds on a truck was ill.
 ''That practice has come to a standstill,'' he said. 
 Twenty people, all of whom had close contact with sick birds, are confirmed to have become infected with the virus in Turkey.

HEADLINE: Recent Outcast Is Back in Favor In Ukraine Race

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
A campaign ad, broadcast repeatedly on television here, shows a man basking in the adulation of flag-waving crowds reminiscent of the protests that overturned the fraudulent election for president in 2004. But he is not Viktor A. Yushchenko, who rode those protests to the presidency, vowing to turn Ukraine into a free and prosperous democracy.
 He is the man Mr. Yushchenko defeated, Viktor F. Yanukovich, the chosen heir of a discredited and unpopular government, who would have been president but for those huge street demonstrations and international diplomatic pressure.
 A year ago, Mr. Yanukovich appeared disgraced, abandoned even by his own supporters. Now he leads a party predicted to win the most seats in the parliamentary elections that are only a little more than two months away. 
 Mr. Yushchenko, on the other hand, has been discredited by scandals, a worsening economy and internal disputes over policy that led him to fire a popular prime minister. 
 At a minimum Mr. Yanukovich could have a decisive role in choosing the new -- and newly empowered -- prime minister. He could even become prime minister himself, sharing power with his bitter rival. ''We have set this goal: to win the election,'' Mr. Yanukovich said in an interview at his party headquarters in a 19th-century mansion here.
 The March 26 election, in which thousands of candidates from 45 parties are competing for 450 parliamentary seats, will be the first electoral test of the political changes that Mr. Yushchenko promised during what became known as the Orange Revolution. But after a year of turmoil that culminated in popular anger over his handling of a dispute with Russia over natural gas, the prospects for Mr. Yushchenko's coalition are not promising. 
 In a poll released Friday by the Democratic Initiative Fund, Mr. Yanukovich's Party of Regions was favored by 31 percent of those who responded, compared with 13 percent for Mr. Yushchenko's bloc, led by the faction Our Ukraine. That is 3 percentage points behind the bloc of Yulia V. Tymoshenko, who served as his first prime minister until Mr. Yushchenko dismissed her in September amid mutual accusations of corruption.
 ''The work of the authorities has been ineffective,'' Mr. Yanukovich said, when asked about his striking reversal of fortune. ''Everything that happened this year worsened the economic levels, increased instability inside the country and worsened the image of our state in the world. For those in Ukraine that supported Mr. Yushchenko, it was a year of disappointment. For the part that did not, it was a year of trial, including for myself.''
 The rebound of Mr. Yanukovich is, in fact, less about his successes than Mr. Yushchenko's failings since he was inaugurated a year ago.
 While Mr. Yushchenko is often portrayed abroad as a reform-minded democrat seeking to realign Ukraine toward Europe and the United States, his reputation at home has suffered from one problem after another.
 ''He has a Gorbachev syndrome,'' said Mychailo Wynnyckyj, a professor of sociology at the University of Kiev-Mohyla Academy, referring to the former Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ''He looks better abroad than he does at home.''
 In the gas dispute, for example, Mr. Yushchenko appeared to have emerged victorious, having resisted Russia's demands for a nearly five-fold increase from the $50 per thousand cubic meters Ukraine was paying under a 2004 agreement. 
 But critics soon pounced on the new deal, which set the price on average at $95, publicizing details that the government had not, including the fact that the price was fixed for only six months and is likely to rise again. Members of Parliament and industrialists warned of harm to an already feeble economy and questioned the role of a murky gas-trading company with ties to Russia's energy monopoly, Gazprom.
 Last Tuesday, Parliament voted to oust Mr. Yushchenko's prime minister and the rest of the government. At the time of the vote Mr. Yushchenko was in Kazakhstan, where he met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to praise the deal as mutually beneficial to both countries.
 In a televised interview on Friday night, Mr. Yushchenko called those who voted against the government ''the fifth column, for which a petty corporate or party interest is superior to stability in Ukraine now.''
 The political turmoil has, for now, worsened his split with Ms. Tymoshenko, the charismatic populist whose public role in the Orange Revolution was second only to his.
 Coalitions in Ukraine, however, are ever shifting, and one of her advisers, Hyrhory M. Nemyrya, said Ms. Tymoshenko still hoped for an accommodation that would reunite the forces that defeated Mr. Yanukovich, President Leonid D. Kuchma's chosen successor.
 ''The only choice for him is to choose between Tymoshenko and Yanukovich,'' Mr. Nemyrya said of Mr. Yushchenko.
 Mr. Yanukovich, in contrast to Mr. Yushchenko, has succeeded in holding together his supporters, predominantly Russian speakers in the industrialized east and south, areas where Mr. Yushchenko has been unable to gain support.
 Mr. Yanukovich, a former mechanic who rose through the ranks of regional government in Donetsk before serving as prime minister, remains his party's leader despite his defeat and other liabilities, including having served almost four years in prison after a conviction for robbery and assault as a young man.
 In the 2004 election Mr. Yanukovich had strong support from the Kremlin. He still vows not to change Ukraine's foreign policy at the expense of Russia, though he had to distance himself in the gas dispute.
 ''It was wrong to try to corner Ukraine,'' he said of Russia.
 Mr. Yushchenko's foreign minister, Boris I. Tarasyuk, contends that despite Mr. Yanukovich's seemingly stronger position, Ukrainians overwhelmingly support the course Mr. Yushchenko has set: integrating the country into the European Union and NATO, while building a democratic society and a market economy.
 He predicted a pro-Yushchenko majority in Parliament, saying, ''There will again be a coalition that supports the president.''
 Ukraine's new Parliament will have expanded powers, including the role of electing the prime minister, who has been appointed by the president.
 Mr. Wynnyckyj, the professor of sociology, predicted a different outcome: a chaotic period of political instability like Italy's ever-revolving Parliaments in the 1970's and 80's.
 He said that even if a new government could be formed, it would soon collapse, forcing new elections by 2007, if not sooner.
 ''There's no chance of a coalition because the personalities are getting in the way,'' he said.
 Much depends on the fate of smaller parties, 9 or 10 of which could each clear the 3 percent threshold for winning seats. A new one is an alliance of the Party of Reforms and Order, a liberal party that was once Mr. Yushchenko's, and Pora, the youth group that provided much of the zeal during the protests of 2004.
 One of Pora's leaders, Vladyslav V. Kaskiv, even works as a presidential adviser, but decided to run independently out of a belief that Ukrainian politics needed a new generation of leaders. He said the three most prominent ones these days all possessed ''the same values.''
 Mr. Kaskiv was optimistic, however, about one thing.
 ''Politics cannot return to what it was before,'' he said, articulating perhaps the greatest success of the Orange Revolution. ''It could be better or worse, but it will be a democratic process.''

HEADLINE: China, a Trade Superstar, Accumulates Foreign Currency (and Anxiety) 

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Bangkok for this article.; Internatinal Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
While some analysts view China's surge in foreign currency reserves as further evidence of the country's growing economic power, there are also fears that the growing hoard exposes the country to risks that could undermine future growth.
 Even the official media are beginning to question the wisdom of this policy after China's central bank announced on Sunday that currency reserves had increased almost $50 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005, to a record $819.9 billion. 
In a commentary distributed on Monday, the authoritative New China News Agency said the sharp increase was not entirely favorable because it could intensify disputes over China's trade surplus and lead to unwanted growth in the money supply.
 And James McCormack, a credit analyst with Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong, commented: ''The reserves are more than adequate. Maybe it is becoming excessive.''
 Only Japan, with $847 billion at the end of October, has greater holdings.
 But there are signs that the accumulation of foreign currency is beginning to slow. China's reserves rose by $25.7 billion last month, growing more modestly than they had in December 2004, when they climbed $36.1 billion. The flood of speculative investment that poured into China through 2003, 2004 and the first half of 2005 has abated in recent months as China held down its interest rates even as the Federal Reserve pushed American rates higher.
 Lower Chinese interest rates, together with a growing consensus in the market that officials in Beijing will not allow their currency, the yuan, to appreciate as fast as the Bush administration and the European Union want, have made it less attractive to invest in China.
 Currency reserves here usually rise faster in December than in any month, partly because foreign investment deals are often concluded before the end of the year and partly because the Chinese statisticians tend to make adjustments to many categories of data, including foreign reserves, each December.
 Still, some analysts argue that the reserves, which Beijing accumulates to maintain the yuan's link to the dollar, could lead to more trade friction with Washington because the Chinese trade surplus with the United States appears likely to exceed $200 billion in 2005.
 Some economists also worry that the central bank will find itself under pressure to contain inflation that arises from its purchases of foreign currency. Others say the government's policy of investing about 70 percent of reserves in dollar-denominated assets is selling China short.
 For example, these investments include some $247 billion in United States Treasury debt. The critics argue that these relatively low-yielding investments amount to a huge transfer of wealth from a relatively poor country to a rich one. They say the money can be invested more profitably in China's growing economy.
 Economists and others worry that the huge increase in China's foreign currency reserves is almost certain to antagonize the United States and other big trading partners.
 Since 2002, China's foreign exchange holdings have tripled, a measure of the scale of efforts here to hold down the value of the yuan and increase the competitiveness of Chinese exports.
 To keep the yuan's value steady, the central bank buys a big slice of the foreign currency flowing into China from exports, foreign investment and speculative capital.
 The growing reserves, said Chew Ping, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor's in Singapore, ''will definitely add to pressure, especially from lawmakers in the U.S., for further appreciation of the yuan.''
 In July, China responded, allowing the yuan to appreciate by 2.1 percent against the dollar. It also introduced a system in which the yuan was allowed to trade in a narrow band against a basket of other currencies.
 But this failed to silence critics of its trading policies, with some members of Congress threatening a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese imports unless the government allowed further appreciation in the yuan's value.
 So far, analysts say, there appears to be little evidence that the accumulation of foreign currency will fuel inflation. Such inflation fears arise because the Chinese government prints local currency to pay for the foreign exchange it buys.
 But then, to contain the threat of rapid inflation from the growth in the money supply, the government sells debt to soak up the yuan it issues.
 This appears to be working, with economists generally satisfied that the growth in China's money supply is in line with the expansion of its economy.
 ''There is a question about how long you can do that,'' Mr. McCormack of Fitch said, ''but it is not as if the money supply is growing too fast.'' 
 Some economists also dispute contentions that China is unwise to invest so heavily in dollar assets. They note that returns on investment in China are relatively modest compared with the potential earnings from the country's foreign reserves.
 ''If you look at what most other money going into China is earning,'' Mr. Chew of S.& P. said, ''it is not that inefficient. If you don't invest in U.S. bonds, what do you invest in?''
 Yet there are signs that the government is becoming uncomfortable with the level of China's foreign-exchange accumulation. It has recently relaxed some currency controls so that businesses and individuals can take more money abroad. And on Jan. 5, Beijing, without giving details, said it would abolish limits on the amount that domestic companies could invest offshore.

HEADLINE: Not in the Kennedys' Backyard

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Do not doubt the Kennedys' devotion to renewable energy. If they had their way and the policies they support became law, there would be new wind farms along the coasts and on Appalachian hilltops, Midwestern prairies and Rocky Mountain ridges -- more than 100,000 turbines twirling from sea to shining sea.
 Just not in the waters where the Kennedys go sailing. Their love of renewable energy does not extend to the 130 turbines proposed for Nantucket Sound. Many other environmentalists consider it one of the most promising new energy projects in America, but the Kennedys are against it. 
Robert Kennedy Jr., the environmental lawyer, warned in an Op-Ed article that the wind farm would ''damage the views from 16 historic sites,'' one of which happens to be the Kennedy compound at Hyannis Port. He didn't specify the damage, but this is what it would amount to: if you stood in Hyannis Port, six miles from the wind farm, the turbines on the horizon would appear to be a half-inch high, about the size of a fingernail.
 Senator Edward Kennedy is also opposed to the project, and his colleagues on Capitol Hill may effectively kill the project by slipping a last-minute amendment into a Coast Guard budget bill. The bill was passed earlier by both houses and is now being negotiated behind closed doors in a House-Senate conference committee. 
 Senator Kennedy says he has nothing to do with this maneuver and doesn't support it, but a committee source tells me that the Massachusetts delegation lobbied for the amendment, which would ban offshore wind farms within 1.5 nautical miles of shipping lanes. That's a dubious requirement, considering that European offshore wind farms already operate near much busier shipping lanes than those in Nantucket Sound. 
 To be fair, there are good arguments against the wind farm in Nantucket Sound. Robert Kennedy rightly complained that it wouldn't be feasible without hefty state and federal subsidies. But neither would the other renewable-energy projects promoted by him and his uncle. 
 Environmentalists have been promising for more than three decades that wind energy would be competitive if there was a ''level playing field,'' but it survives only because the field has been tilted in its favor. 
 When you add up the tax breaks and other federal aid to wind farms, the subsidy per unit of energy produced is more than double the subsidy given to nuclear and fossil-fuel power plants, according to Thomas Tanton, a fellow at the Institute for Energy Research. 
 ''Wind power is at least twice as expensive as power from conventional sources,'' Tanton says, ''and it's less than half as valuable because it's not always available when you need it.'' Even when Tanton makes allowances for what economists call externalities -- like the benefits of slowing global warming by emitting less carbon dioxide -- he finds that wind power is still nowhere close to competitive.
 Besides the federal dollars, wind farms get extra help from states, particularly states like New York and California, which have ordered utilities to generate a certain percentage of their power from renewable energy. This amounts to a hidden surcharge on consumers -- the kind of subsidy that economists loathe. If state officials want to direct money to the owners of wind farms, they should at least dole it out openly. 
 Yet this stealth subsidy is so politically appealing that environmental groups are pushing to federalize it. The Natural Resources Defense Council, where Robert Kennedy works as a senior attorney, supported legislation in Congress that would force utilities to get 10 percent of their power from renewable energy. That would probably require erecting more than 100,000 wind turbines.
 Senator Kennedy voted for that proposal and also for an even stricter version, which would have meant twice as many turbines. Fortunately, neither proposal has become law yet because some members of Congress have contemplated what would happen to the landscapes in their states. 
 Personally, I'm agnostic on the scenic merits of a wind farm. I can understand why some people hate the sight and others don't. If you equate the turbines with environmental virtue, you may find it a lovely panorama, and you (unlike me) may even be willing to pay higher taxes and electricity bills for it. 
 But this should be a decision made by you and your neighbors -- at the local level, not in Washington. And everyone should know exactly how much extra this virtue costs. Politicians and environmentalists shouldn't be trying to sneak 100,000 wind turbines into everyone's backyard but their own.

HEADLINE: Liberia's Harvard-Trained 'Queen' Is Sworn In as Leader

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Greeted by shouts of ''Queen of Africa!'' and standing before the bullet-scarred capitol of this war-torn nation, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Harvard-trained banker and stalwart survivor of Liberia's brutal politics, took the presidential oath of office on Monday, becoming Africa's first woman to be elected a head of state.
 As her words were interrupted again and again with joyful shouts of ''Yes!'' and ''Amen!'' Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, 67, told the crowd that she would bring ''a fundamental break with the past, thereby requiring we take bold and decisive steps to address the problems that for decades have stunted our progress, undermined national unity and kept old and new cleavages in ferment.'' 
It was a jubilant moment suffused with history, observed with smiles by members of the old boy's club Ms. Johnson Sirleaf now joins, the formerly all-male fraternity of African leaders. Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's president and chairman of the African Union, looked on beaming as Ms. Johnson Sirleaf was sworn in. 
 A United States delegation led by Laura Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat beneath simple woven canopies. Their presence was an indication of the long and often troubled relationship between the United States and Liberia, which was founded by freed slaves from the United States in 1847.
 In the front row sat George Weah, the soccer star who lost to Ms. Johnson Sirleaf and initially refused to concede the election, raising the grim possibility that long-suffering Liberia's opportunity for lasting peace might slip away. But Mr. Weah conceded last month, paving the way for the historic ceremony. 
 Despite the euphoria, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf faces a mountain of troubles in a nation afflicted by civil war for 14 years. Liberia's public works are in shambles; there is no piped water, no electricity grid. Its roads, schools and health centers, where they still exist, barely function. 
 An interim government that has ruled since Charles Taylor fled in 2003 was supposed to kick-start development, but corruption forced many donors to halt their programs. 
 The European Union had been supporting an effort to bring electricity to all of the capital, but withdrew because of corruption concerns. With the new president taking office, the Europeans will begin the program again, committing $70 million. The United States is committed to rebuilding the armed forces. The United Nations mission in Liberia, which includes 15,000 peacekeepers, costs about $700 million a year.
 There also remains the difficult question of what to do about Mr. Taylor, the warlord-turned-president who, with the backing of Libya and other regional powers, rampaged through his own country and much of West Africa, unleashing a cycle of war that still reverberates today. He fled to exile in Nigeria in 2003 as a condition of ending the war, but is under indictment by a court for war crimes in Sierra Leone. Nigeria has said it will hand him over only if Liberia asks. 
 Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said Liberia was bound by the United Nations resolution calling for Mr. Taylor to appear in Sierra Leone, and must weigh calls for justice against the need for peace. ''Our peace is fragile; we still have lots of Taylor operatives in the country,'' she said in an interview. ''We don't want to see us return to a state of war.'' 
 Liberians, even Mr. Weah's partisans, who had taken to the streets to protest what they said was a rigged election, exulted in the moment, relieved that war seemed to have ceased and proud that their nation had produced the continent's first woman to be elected head of state.
 ''I voted for George Weah, but I accept Ellen because she is our Ma and is going take care of us,'' said Benedict Newon, 19, a former child soldier. He first hoisted a weapon for the warlord Charles Taylor when he was 10, though he later switched allegiance to another rebel group.
 ''I never carry gun again,'' Mr. Newon said, gesturing at his 8-month-old son and his pregnant wife, Fatou. ''I have a future now. I got to protect it. I got to be patient with Ma Ellen.'' 
 That notion of president as mater familias may seem new, but in Liberia politics has always been paternalistic -- fighters for Mr. Taylor called him their ''Papay.'' 
 In an interview before the inauguration, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said that unlike some Western women in politics, she embraced the stereotypical feminine roles as part of her appeal, though she is also known as Liberia's iron lady from her years in opposition politics, which included two stints in prison. 
 ''The iron lady, of course that comes from the toughness of many years of being a professional in a male-dominated world,'' she said. ''But also the many young people we have here, and the suffering I have seen, and the despair and lack of hope, brought out the motherliness in me, and that is where the Ma Ellen comes from.''
 It is a combination -- tough and tender -- that has won women new respect in the increasingly democratic political scene in Africa. Once dominated by male autocrats, many African countries now have women in high positions, and a handful are poised to join Ms. Johnson Sirleaf at the pinnacle of power. 
 Women from across the continent flocked to Monrovia to celebrate her victory. Abena P. A. Busia, an English professor from Ghana, said she would have swum to the inauguration. 
 Euphoria was palpable in the streets, where squads of workers frantically readied this battered city for its long-awaited close-up. Lacking heavy equipment, crews painted lines in the roads using huge stencils and hand brushes. 
 Pandora Matati, 20, a former fighter, was among the crews who worked furiously to prepare for the big event. 
 ''I love Ellen because she is going to do so much for us,'' she said as she took a brief break from her job laying concrete at the capitol. ''With Ellen, anything is possible.''

HEADLINE: Russia and China Demand Iran Freeze Nuclear Activity, but Reject Referral to U.N. 

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO and ALAN COWELL; Elaine Sciolino reported from Paris for this article and Alan Cowell from London.

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Russia and China affirmed Monday that Iran must resume its freeze on certain nuclear activities, but refused a call by the Americans and the Europeans for the issue to be put before the United Nations Security Council, according to the British Foreign Office and senior European officials.
 In one conciliatory gesture, Russia and China agreed not to block a move by France, Britain and Germany to convene a special session early next month of the 35 nations that make up the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, according to the officials. At that time, the nations could decide whether Iran should be referred to the Security Council for possible censure.
 The Russian and Chinese positions were laid out during five hours of high-level talks in London that brought together the five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain -- and Germany in an effort to forge a common position after Iran's resumption last week of nuclear work at three sites.
 The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the normal diplomatic constraints of their governments. 
 Statements on Monday from both Moscow and Beijing underscored the difference with the Europeans. 
 In Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin emphasized that Russia, the other European nations and the United States have ''very close positions on the Iranian problem,'' but warned that the crisis should be resolved ''without abrupt, erroneous steps.''
 In a joint news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, on her first visit to Moscow since taking office, Mr. Putin urged caution, saying, ''We must move very carefully in this area.''
 Mr. Putin also signaled that a Russian-led initiative to enrich Iran's uranium in Russia under Russian control might still offer a way out of the crisis.
 Iran, which had seemed to reject the Russian proposal as inadequate, has expressed renewed interest in it in recent days. ''We consider it constructive and are carefully studying it,'' Iran's ambassador to Moscow, Gholamreza Ansari, said on Russian television. ''This is a good initiative to resolve the situation. We believe that Iran and Russia should find a way out of this jointly.''
 In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry also emphasized the need for negotiations, not confrontation, saying in a statement, ''China believes that under the current situation, all relevant sides should remain restrained and stick to solving the Iranian nuclear issue through negotiations.''
 The rush of diplomacy reflects the growing urgency of managing the relationship with Iran.
 ''This was a meeting to feel each other out,'' said a senior official involved in the London talks. ''I don't think our positions are that far apart. Everyone agrees we must agree; the question now is what will we agree on. Now is the time to start an intense negotiating process to persuade countries of the board to proceed by consensus.''
 Asked about the Russian and Chinese position on a referral of Iran to the Security Council , the official replied, ''That is certainly not something that is agreed to at the moment.''
 Both Russia and China have close economic and military partnerships with Iran and historically have preferred engagement with Iran as a way of moderating its behavior and opposed any action in the Security Council.
 China is particularly reluctant to use the Security Council against Iran, saying last week that such action could complicate the issue and harden positions.
 But Iran's recent behavior, combined with its history of concealment of its nuclear activities, has eroded confidence in assertions that its nuclear activities are intended for peaceful energy purposes and not for a weapons program.
 There is a growing support for the position that Iran's case should come before the Security Council, if only to register condemnation of the Tehran government.
 The seriousness of the London talks was reflected by the seniority of their delegations. R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, led the American delegation. The Russians sent Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Kislyak, a top nuclear negotiator; the Chinese sent Zhang Yan, the director of arms control at the Foreign Ministry.
 The United States, which has long been pressing for Iran to be judged by the Security Council, was particularly eager to push forward quickly, before Iran succeeds in dividing the international community.
 En route to Liberia on Monday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she wanted the governing countries of the atomic energy agency to meet ''as soon as possible,'' adding that the problem with waiting is that the Iranians will ''try to take advantage of it to start to throw chaff now and to obfuscate.''
 Still, the diplomatic initiative is remarkable in that Britain, France and Germany -- the three nations that forged a nuclear agreement with Iran in November 2004 under which it froze most of its nuclear activities -- are now in lock step with the United States.
 But the United States and the Europeans need time to conduct a global diplomatic offensive to win the maximum support from the atomic energy agency's board, a sort of mega-Security Council that includes countries as diverse as Syria, Libya, Brazil, Venezuela, Malaysia, Canada, Cuba and India, as well as the permanent Council members.
 The international atomic agency usually makes decisions by consensus, but Iran could be referred to the Security Council if a majority votes in favor, no country votes against and the rest abstain.
 The European trio had been negotiating with Iran for two and a half years as part of a plan to entice it with economic and political incentives in exchange for objective guarantees that it was not trying to produce a nuclear bomb. The Europeans have been operating with the support of the European Union and even of the Bush administration, despite its conviction that Iran was trying to become a nuclear power.
 Iran was not punished last August after it restarted operations at its uranium conversion site in Isfahan. Even though it violated the accord with the European trio, the operations were not considered sufficiently sensitive to prompt a united retaliatory response.
 Last September, the I.A.E.A . board found Iran in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty because of its deception of the agency dating back nearly two decades. The resolution passed at the time cited the ''absence of confidence'' that Iran's nuclear program was exclusively for peaceful purposes.
 But the board was deeply divided about whether to punish Iran and decided not to vote on whether to refer Iran to the Security Council.
 When Iran broke the seals on machines at its uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and two related storage and testing locations and restarted nuclear work, the Europeans said it went too far, and they felt betrayed.
 Last week in Berlin, foreign ministers of Britain, Germany and France, as well as Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, agreed that their negotiations with Iran had reached a dead end and recommended that consideration of its case at the Security Council was the next step.
 Reflecting that feeling of betrayal, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain told a security conference in London before the nuclear talks on Monday, ''The onus is on Iran to act to give the international community confidence that its nuclear program has exclusive peaceful purposes, confidence, I'm afraid, that has been sorely undermined by its history of concealment and deception.''
 Paradoxically, Iran's renewed research activities do not constitute a breach of its treaty obligations, although they violate the voluntary deal struck with the Europeans.
 Although the agency board's member nations are becoming increasingly frustrated with Iran, there may be resistance in voting for hauling Iran before the Security Council in part because it could set a precedent for other countries with nuclear programs.
 In a sign that board-member countries may have to be wooed, Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit of Egypt, a board member, issued a statement on Monday saying, ''Dialogue is the best way to get out of the current crisis, and we have many factors which help towards an exit.'' He added that Egypt's vote would depend on prior consultations and on the language of draft resolutions.
 The Saudi foreign minister, Saud al-Faisal bin Abdelaziz al-Saud, told the BBC on Monday that Western nations shared the blame in creating the impasse with Iran since it was the United States and its allies that helped Israel develop nuclear weapons.
 ''As long as you make one exception, you open the way for logical arguments of why him and not me,'' Prince Saud said. ''The West in allowing Israel to establish its nuclear capability has done the damage.''

HEADLINE: The European Economic Engine That Could (and May Again)

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HEIDELBERG, Germany, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Germany, after four years of stagnation, is showing signs of reclaiming its role as the economic engine of Europe. And much of the credit goes to old-line German companies like the printing press manufacturer named for this ancient university town.
 Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, the world's largest maker of printing presses, was flat on its back two years ago, the victim of a downturn in the media industry and of Japanese rivals that undercut its prices. Now, after painful therapy that included 3,500 layoffs, the company is humming again.
The rest of the country may soon join it. A variety of recent statistics suggests that Germany, the world's third-largest economy, is on the mend, with quickening growth, surging investor confidence, signs of a rebirth in consumer spending and even a modest decline in unemployment.
 A reinvigorated Germany would have far-reaching implications for Europe and even the global economy. It accounts for a fifth of the economic activity of the European Union, and is the world's largest exporter, a title it has managed to retain even during these lean years. 
 ''The rumors of Germany's death have been exaggerated,'' said Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank. ''We've really made lots of progress, and we've gotten off to a good start in 2006.''
 Germany has seen false dawns before, of course. There was a burst of enthusiasm here last winter before the economy relapsed and an unpopular German government felt forced to call early elections. Germany grew barely 1 percent in 2005, and even the most bullish projections for this year put growth at just 2 percent -- a pace that would qualify as a lull in the United States.
 For the first time since the tech bubble burst in late 2000, however, there is a real sense that Germany is on the move.
 For one, the Germans voted in a new government, under its first woman leader, which has helped lift the mood in this often-pessimistic country. [Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met with President Bush in Washington on Jan. 13, has gotten off to a sure-footed start, political analysts say, raising hopes that she can push through overdue economic changes.]
 For another, German industry has whipped itself into shape. By taking unpopular steps, like cutting jobs, extending work hours without extra pay and moving production to lower-cost countries, companies have pruned their costs and regained their competitive edge in global markets.
 Back in fighting trim, German industry has begun flexing its muscles overseas. The chemical giant BASF recently made a $4.9 billion hostile takeover bid for the Engelhard Corporation of New Jersey, while the steel maker ThyssenKrupp is locked in a battle for a Canadian steel giant.
 ''The strength of German companies has been hidden by a productivity and cost disadvantage,'' said Alexander C. Dibelius, a partner at Goldman Sachs who runs its German office. ''When they increase their productivity, their products are pretty much unbeatable.''
 The reversal in fortunes is evident in a visit here to Heidelberg, where its namesake company looms large, with a shimmering glass tower opposite the train station and a sprawling factory outside town.
 Earlier in the decade, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen reflected Germany's industrial decline. Its sales tumbled 17 percent in 2003, as customers put off big-ticket purchases. The rise of the euro against the dollar and the Japanese yen had the effect of making Heidelberger's printing presses 30 percent more expensive than those of Japanese competitors.
 The company's unionized work force and rigorous apprenticeships seemed hopelessly ill suited to the realities of a global economy. In fiscal 2004, it lost $840 million, on sales of $4.5 billion.
 With Heidelberger's survival in question, it took drastic action, selling two divisions -- Web presses, which print newspapers, and digital printing. It cut 3,500 jobs and extracted a deal from its union, IG Metall, to extend the workweek to 36.75 hours a week, from 35 hours, for the same pay.
 ''We went to the workers and said, 'Look guys, we've got to get more flexible,' '' Bernhard Schreier, the chief executive of Heidelberger, said. ''The times were very tough for the unions over the last two to three years, so they had to make a lot of concessions in company negotiations.''
 The same pattern was repeated throughout Germany: Siemens, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler forced their unions to accept wage freezes or modest raises, often under the threat of moving jobs abroad.
 Despite its reputation as a workers' paradise, wage increases in Germany have lagged those in other euro countries by an aggregate 10 percent since 1996, according to a report by Bank of America. That said, hourly wages in western Germany are still among the highest in Europe.
 ''Germany had priced itself out of the market by the late 1990's,'' said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''It is basically pricing itself back into the market.''
 In Heidelberger's case, the agreement will cut its labor costs by $121 million, or 10 percent, a year by 2008. This, and a weaker-than-expected euro in 2005, helped close the price gap between Heidelberger and the Japanese. And a stronger global economy revived orders from the United States and Asia.
 The turnaround necessitated a painful dose of humility. Heidelberg opted to get out of the newspaper printing business. And while it once viewed digital printing as the future, it had to accept that it could not compete with giants like Kodak, to which it sold its digital operation. 
 These days, Heidelberger is a smaller but fitter company, with a pretax profit margin of 5 percent to 10 percent. Its stock has risen 31 percent in the last 12 months, about the same as the broader German market, which was one of the world's top performers in 2005.
 ''I'm very confident we will continue to thrive from a German base,'' said Mr. Schreier, a 51-year-old mechanical engineer and career employee, whose father and grandfather both worked for the company. ''The technology we are using today is a very lasting technology.''
 Printing presses involve the kind of precision engineering at which Germany has historically excelled, and on which it built its post-World War II economy. The question is whether Germany can hold on to these industries, at a time when China and India are joining other Asian exporters in moving up the industrial curve into more advanced technologies. 
 The exodus of German companies is a perennial theme, with corporate icons like Volkswagen building plants in Slovakia. Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that, measured by the net outflow of foreign direct investment, it is more a trickle than a flood.
 Mr. Schreier is cautiously optimistic, at least as far as his franchise is concerned. Unlike the automotive industry, which is relatively easy to transplant to lower-cost countries, printing presses are a low-volume, high-technology business, which requires skilled workers.
 For all that, Heidelberger is putting the finishing touches on a factory outside Shanghai, which will start building a rudimentary printing machine by the end of this year. It will employ 200 to 300 workers.
 Back home, Mr. Schreier's message to employees is that life will never be as comfortable as it once was. ''There will be now a permanent cost discipline,'' he said, ''because it is clear that if you let all the ropes loose, it will develop in the same direction where we were before.''
 That means Heidelberg will hire only sparingly; its payroll was flat in 2005, after the earlier layoffs.
 The willingness of companies to hire is critical to solving one of Germany's other chronic problems, unemployment. The government reported in December that the number of jobless people declined by 110,000, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was better than expected, but there are still 4.6 million people out of work, close to a record in the postwar period.
 ''What we still need is for the great success of German companies to translate into employment,'' said Klaus L. Wubbenhorst, the chief executive of GfK, a market research firm in Nuremburg.
 Even so, the confidence of German consumers appears to be rebounding. GfK, which tracks the consumer climate, found that Germans were readier to make big purchases than at any time since late 2001. Their parsimony has been the biggest single drag on the country's growth.
 The German government is doing its part to encourage shoppers. It announced an increase in the value-added tax on just about all purchases, to 19 percent from 16 percent, but deferred it until 2007. Germany's merchants are pinning their hopes on a rush of people buying cars and refrigerators. The go-go atmosphere may be helped by the soccer World Cup here next summer.
 Once the tax increase takes effect, though, some experts fret that the economy will cool in 2007. The United States economy is another potential brake, since any slowdown there would hurt German exporters.
 The European Central Bank is confident enough in the growth of Germany and Europe that it lifted interest rates last month for the first time in five years, and signaled on Thursday that it might do so again.
 The German government has been among the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for a revival. It plans to revise its growth forecast for 2006 up from its original forecast of 1.2 percent. Chancellor Merkel has benefited from the good omens, winning high approval ratings.
 But the government's actions so far have been small-bore: a few fiscal initiatives like the higher value-added tax, and a $30 billion public stimulus package to help small and medium-size businesses.
 Mrs. Merkel, experts say, will have to be bolder in opening up the German labor market, as well as overhauling how Germany finances health care and pension funds. That will not be easy, given that she leads a balky coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.
 Analysts have been impressed with the early show of solidarity in Berlin. But as Mrs. Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, can attest, there are risks to being tied too closely to Germany's economic fortunes.
 ''This talk of a Merkel factor is very dangerous,'' said Elga Bartsch, an economist at Morgan Stanley. ''If you get credit for the recovery, there's no doubt that people will turn on you when things go bad again.''

VNU, Owner of Nielsen Ratings Service, Receives Offer From Private Equity Firms
VNU, the Dutch publishing and market research company that owns ACNielsen, received a buyout offer from a group of private equity investors for as much as $8.9 billion. VNU, which also owns Nielsen Media Research and trade publications like Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter, said it had been approached by a consortium of private equity firms -- AlpInvest Partners, the Blackstone Group, the Carlyle Group, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Permira and Thomas H. Lee Partners. [Page C1.] 


Regulators Review New Weight-Loss Approaches
Two new approaches to weight-loss are up for review by federal regulators. And they represent vastly different solutions to the nation's obesity epidemic -- for consumers and for the companies behind the drugs. One, called Acomplia, would be a prescription pill to control appetite. Some industry analysts predict multibillion dollars sales of the drug, which is made by Sanofi-Aventis. The other, with the proposed name Alli, is a weight-loss drug that works by blocking the body's absorption of fat. Since 1999 it has been sold in the United States as the prescription medication Xenical. GlaxoSmithKline is proposing an over-the-counter version. [C1.]

Overcoming Reluctance to Business Travel Blogs
Pressed for time, fearing unwanted notoriety among their colleagues and concerned that rivals might gleen helpful information about what they are doing, business travelers have not been inclined to write blogs. But as blogs become a tool for groups of like-minded individuals, that trend could be changing. [C1.]

Bidding for Canadian Steel Maker Intensifies
The bidding war for Dofasco, the Canadian steel maker, intensified after Arcelor increased its offer 13 percent, to $4.7 billion, and eliminated conditions attached to earlier offers. Dofasco learned about the higher bid by Arcelor on Saturday, soon after ThyssenKrupp announced a move to thwart Arcelor with its own enhanced offer worth $4.5 billion. Market Place. [C3.]

China's Foreign Currency Reserves Raise Concern
While some analysts view China's surge in foreign currency reserves as further evidence of the country's growing economic power, there are fears that the growing hoard exposes the country to risks that could undermine future growth. Even the official media are beginning to question the wisdom of the policy after China's central bank said that currency reserves had increased almost $50 billion in the fourth quarter, to a record $819.9 billion.

Japan Investigates Internet Portal Operator
Japanese prosecutors raided the offices of a popular Internet portal, Livedoor, and the home of its founder as part of an investigation of possible violations of securities trading laws. It was not immediately clear whether the investigation was focused on the company's 33-year-old founder and chief executive, Takafumi Horie, left, who has become widely known for challenging corporate Japan's stuffy ways.

It has been going on the offensive since Nobuo Kuroyanagi took over as president in 2004, even as many of the country's big banks have appeared rudderless since finally cleaning up a decade-long bad loans mess.

Italy's Move to Ease Patent Rules Worries Europe
While the European Commission tries to promote innovation in Europe by reducing the cost of registering patents, Italy, its fourth-biggest member, has gone one step further and has abolished some patent registration fees.

HEADLINE: A Bridge That Has Nowhere Left to Go

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The Tappan Zee Bridge, the most critical transportation link across the Hudson River north of New York City, is not even half as old as the Brooklyn Bridge, but its warranty has already expired.
 Started on the cheap during the Korean War, the Tappan Zee was deliberately built to last just 50 years. It passed that milestone last month, just days after transportation planners began gathering public advice about how to fix or replace it.
 But the decaying, overburdened span's anniversary was more bitter than sweet. Little love has been lost between the Tappan Zee and the tens of thousands of commuters who depend on it. They complain about the poor condition of its roadway and the backups caused by every breakdown and flat tire. 
 Even before it was built, the bridge's own designers said it would be one of the ''ugliest'' in the region. Half a century later, the Tappan Zee has not aged gracefully. There are cracks in its concrete columns, its superstructure is rusting away and its deck is nearly worn through. 
 The New York State Thruway Authority, which owns the 3.1-mile-long bridge carrying the Thruway over the Hudson, has said that the deck, some structural steel, the concrete walkway and electrical systems have ''deteriorated significantly.'' The authority plans to spend more than $100 million next year just to patch the bridge's holes and replace some of its corroded steel, a process sure to make travel even slower for commuters.
 Catching daily glimpses of the long cracks in the bridge's superstructure frightens Brett Ruskin, who drives from his home in Monsey across the Tappan Zee to Tarrytown, where he catches a Metro-North train to Grand Central Terminal. ''My biggest concern is not so much the traffic, because the big problem with the Tappan Zee Bridge is it's falling apart,'' Mr. Ruskin said. ''Every morning I go out there and I pray. I say, 'Please God, don't let the bridge come down today. Let me get across it first.' '' 
 After years of dawdling while the bridge crumbled, state officials say they are rushing to complete a review of the most feasible solutions to the problem of the Tappan Zee. But a decision is still two years off and a new bridge would require eight additional years and as much as $14.5 billion to build, they say.
 To help defray the cost, Gov. George E. Pataki intends to renew his call for giving the private sector a role in the project when he presents his budget tomorrow, people who have been briefed on his plans said. Selling the bridge, in whole or in part, to one or more companies would require legislative changes that were rejected in Albany last year.
 For many elected officials and transportation planners, the Tappan Zee, which carries about 140,000 vehicles per day, cannot be replaced soon enough. It was built between Tarrytown, in Westchester County, and Nyack, in Rockland County, at what is nearly the widest part of the Hudson River, in the 1950's, when Rockland was still largely rural and just beginning to attract New York City commuters.
 The bridge, which cost just $81 million -- the equivalent of about $550 million today -- was built using a naval construction technique that incorporated a set of hollow concrete caissons to support the main span.
 Unlike other bridges in the region -- The Brooklyn Bridge is 122 years old, and the George Washington Bridge will turn 75 this year -- the Tappan Zee was not built to last, because of wartime pressures, according to Ramesh Mehta, the divisional director of the Thruway Authority in charge of the southern Hudson Valley.
 ''The fact of the matter is that the bridge is past its usable life and no matter what repairs are done it must ultimately be replaced,'' said C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive. ''It's reached its age limit and it's reached its capacity. We're just pouring money into a bridge that ultimately will not be there.''
 Mr. Vanderhoef's counterpart at the other end of the span, Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, blames the bridge's poor condition on the benign neglect of ''screwed-up government.'' State officials consistently refused to level with the public about how much money was required to maintain critical infrastructure, like the Tappan Zee, he said.
 ''First of all, it wasn't built properly,'' Mr. Spano said. ''Second of all, it wasn't maintained.''
 Governor Pataki first mentioned the possibility of replacing the bridge in 1999, but by early last year, scant progress had been made.
 When the Thruway Authority and the two other agencies that had been charged with proposing solutions, the Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Metro-North Railroad, fell a year behind schedule last summer, Mr. Spano and Mr. Vanderhoef created a task force to spur the state into action.
 ''We thought they were dragging their heels,'' Mr. Spano said.
 The agencies had hit an impasse on the question of whether a tunnel that could carry commuter trains should receive serious consideration as an alternative to a new bridge, transportation planners and officials said.
 ''In my experience, it's always good to put some person or entity in charge that can be held accountable,'' Mr. Vanderhoef said. By the fall, Mr. Pataki ''did the right thing and said, 'Enough,' '' he said, referring to Mr. Pataki's decision to hand control of the review process to the Transportation Department.
 In late September, the three agencies announced that they had whittled the original list of about 15 alternatives down to six. Two of them involve keeping the old bridge and repairing it, either a little or a lot. A complete rehabilitation of the Tappan Zee would cost at least $2 billion, the planners estimated.
 The four remaining options call for a new bridge, which would be built alongside the old one, just north of the existing span. Each involves a different configuration of mass transit -- either commuter trains, light rail or express buses -- sandwiched between the traffic lanes. The estimates for a new bridge range from $9 billion to $14.5 billion.
 The planners ruled out a tunnel because it would cost considerably more, would have more harmful effects on the ecology of the river and would disrupt traffic patterns in Rockland County, they said. But Michael Anderson, the Transportation Department official who was installed as the team leader for the review, said no decisions have been made about what type of bridge would replace the Tappan Zee.
 At a presentation last month in Nyack, Mr. Anderson said the planners expected to choose one of the alternatives by the end of next year. If a new bridge is built, he said, it would probably be completed in 2015. In the meantime, he assured the audience that ''the roadway is safe and will be safe for the foreseeable future.'' 
 So far, not a dollar of the design and construction costs has been pledged by the federal government or by any state or local agencies. The bridge will vie for funding with a long list of major projects that would enhance the region's transportation network, not provide a transplant for one of its vital organs.
 The competitors, each of which is expected to cost more than $5 billion, include the Second Avenue subway, connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal and a proposed second passenger-train tunnel between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan. 
 Already, the Tappan Zee planners are assuming that the tunnel to Midtown, a pet project of Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Jon S. Corzine, the state's incoming governor, will be built. Mr. Anderson said the Tappan Zee project would be ''in competition for a limited amount of funds available for the next 25 years.'' To improve its chances, he said, the planners would soon take the unusual step of conducting a study of potential sources of funding, instead of waiting until they have a specific plan for the bridge.
 The federal government does not usually allocate money for projects before local officials have settled on a proposal and conducted full reviews of its economic and environmental impacts. But some elected officials have criticized Governor Pataki and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for not demonstrating a stronger commitment to replacing the Tappan Zee.
 Ryan S. Karben, a Democratic assemblyman from Pearl River, in Rockland County, said he was disappointed that no money has been included in the latest capital budgets of the Transportation Department or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for replacing the bridge.
 Mr. Karben, who is an ardent proponent of adding commuter train service from Rockland County to Manhattan, said he wrote to Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials asking them to ''give us at least a symbolic commitment, a symbolic set-aside of funds to encourage this process.'' But his appeal failed, he said. ''I find it strange to have a conversation about what the best way to replace the Tappan Zee is, independent of an available funding stream, because the funding stream inevitably constrains our planning,'' Mr. Karben said. ''Without a realistic financial strategy, the planning is for naught.''
 To secure federal funding for mass transit, the planners need to prove that the project would be cost effective, said Jeffrey Zupan, senior transportation fellow at the Regional Plan Association. He said he has pressed Mr. Anderson to be more forthcoming about estimates of how many people would ride trains or buses across the bridge and how much extra it would cost to connect trains running over the bridge directly to Metro-North tracks in Westchester for a ''one-seat ride'' to Manhattan. 
 ''What they need to do is to be very open in public about the situation and not string people along who see the holy grail, which is the one-seat ride,'' Mr. Zupan said.
 The voice of Mr. Vanderhoef, the county executive, who was born in Orangetown and graduated from Tappan Zee High School, carries no trace of sentiment when he talks about the future of the old bridge that sparked a boom in Rockland. The county's population has more than tripled, to 290,000 residents, since 1950, and is projected to increase by more than 25 percent in the next 25 years. 
 ''I don't think it's that ugly,'' Mr. Vanderhoef said of the Tappan Zee, adding that he did not care about the appearance of its replacement.
 ''The key is that it operate, that it handle the traffic,'' he said. ''If that requires a lack of aesthetic approach, then so be it. I'm not suggesting that we build an ugly bridge, but if it requires that, then fine.''

HEADLINE: The Whiff of Collusion Comes, and Goes

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
PUT these recent free-agent contracts together, and what do you get:
 Kevin Millwood, $60 million (five years); A. J. Burnett, $55 million (five); Johnny Damon, $52 million (four); B. J. Ryan, $47 million (five); Billy Wagner, $43 million (four); Rafael Furcal, $39 million (three); Jarrod Washburn, $37 million (four).
An absence of collusion, that's what. 
 The owners, flush with money in prosperous times, have given players and their union no reason to think that clubs are acting in concert with other clubs, in violation of the labor agreement. That absence of suspicion hasn't always existed the past few winters, but the union didn't have the kind of evidence it felt could make a case for collusion the way it did in the mid-1980's. 
 Two arbitrators found the clubs guilty of collusion for actions involving the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons, and the clubs settled those cases for $280 million, a bargain considering the economic impact of their conspiracy. 
 Sadly, baseball officials and club owners have never admitted guilt. A. Bartlett Giamatti, who succeeded Peter Ueberroth, the commissioner during the collusion years, said he saw the same evidence that the arbitrators saw, and he had a different conclusion.
 Fay Vincent, Giamatti's deputy and successor, also saw the evidence, and he became the only Major League Baseball official who acknowledged publicly that the owners had colluded. His honesty and candor did not endear him to his employers.
 To this day, other baseball officials and owners shun the word collusion; they would like to strike it from the English language. It brings back bad memories. Not that they wouldn't do it again if they thought they could get away with it, but guilt the next time would cost them triple damages. That $280 million settlement would become $840 million at current rates.
 Richard Moss was a prominent player agent in the 1980's. He represented some of the free agents who were victims of collusion, most prominently Jack Morris and Andre Dawson. In its attempt to prove collusion, the union really needed no other evidence than the picture of Morris walking out of George Steinbrenner's Bay Harbor Inn in Tampa, Fla., in December 1986 without a contract.
 Moss, who, as the union's general counsel, won the case that created free agency 30 years ago, knows the smell of collusion and says he had a new whiff of it a year ago.
 The reprise occurred when Moss was representing Tadahito Iguchi, a free-agent Japanese infielder looking to play in the United States. A four-time All-Star in Japan's Pacific League and the winner of three Gold Gloves as a second baseman, Taguchi might have been expected to sign a contract at least reasonably close to the deals reached by his countrymen Hideki Matsui (three years, $21 million) and Kazuo Matsui (three years, $20.1 million) when they joined the major leagues.
 Moss contacted 14 clubs about Iguchi, but only the Chicago White Sox made an offer. The Boston Red Sox had expressed interest, Moss said, but not after they signed Edgar Renteria to play shortstop. The St. Louis Cardinals needed a shortstop and a second baseman and, Moss said, ''they expressed no interest in this guy who in Japan was an all-star shortstop and second baseman.''
 Moss said he talked to the Yankees, who needed a second baseman, but said General Manager Brian Cashman told him a Yankees scout had filed a poor report on Iguchi, saying he didn't believe Iguchi could hit major league pitching.
 The Yankees might want to re-evaluate the scout because Iguchi, a .271 hitter in eight seasons in Japan, batted .278 and drove in 71 runs in 2005 for the White Sox and helped them win the World Series. Having passed on Iguchi, the Yankees signed Tony Womack to a two-year, $4 million contract and quickly became disenchanted with him. He started only 22 games at second.
 ''I was not only surprised about how clubs reacted,'' Moss said, ''but I was frustrated because I knew that's not how they should have reacted.''
 Left with no other choice and having ended Moss's representation of him, Iguchi signed with the White Sox for two years and $4.95 million with an equally cheap salary, $3.25 million, for an option year. His 2005 salary, $2.3 million, fell below the average salary in the majors.
 Moss wound up in an arbitration hearing with Iguchi over payment for his services and won it, but that aspect had no bearing on the alleged collusion that limited Iguchi's options.
 ''The experience reminded me of 1986 and '87 and what was happening then,'' Moss said yesterday. ''This, to me, was the same thing. General managers I talked to then and general managers I talked to a year ago were giving weird excuses for not being interested in a player.''
 In the arbitration hearing, Moss said, Ken Williams, the White Sox' general manager, acknowledged that they had signed Iguchi for less than he was worth. Williams, Moss said, testified before the arbitrator, Theodore St. Antoine, that the White Sox had based their offer to Iguchi on their judgment, not his value. Williams could not be reached yesterday to comment on Moss's assertion. 
 If clubs did conspire against Iguchi, they might have done so because Major League Baseball wanted to reduce the value of the contracts Japanese players were getting. Limiting a player to one club is a certain way of achieving that goal. On the other hand, Kenji Johjima, a free-agent Japanese catcher, recently signed a three-year, $16.5 million contract with Seattle, a good deal for a catcher whose command of English is questionable.
 Michael Weiner, the union's general counsel, said the union did not file a grievance at the request of Iguchi. ''If evidence came to our attention that suggested it happened, we'd always reconsider it,'' he said.
 Rob Manfred, management's chief labor executive, said no one had raised the collusion issue with him. But he declined to comment further, saying, ''I don't know enough about the facts.''
 Someone should determine the facts because it would be unfortunate for owner-player relations if the owners reverted to their nasty old habits.

HEADLINE: As Europe Tries for United Patents, Italy Moves Alone

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
While the European Commission tries to promote innovation in Europe by reducing the cost of registering patents, Italy, its fourth-biggest member, has gone one step further and has abolished some patent registration fees. 
 But Bruno van Pottelsberghe, the chief economist at the European Patent Office, said the move, far from bolstering innovation in Italy, risks swamping the patent system in that country with registrations as well as complicating efforts to reach a Continentwide solution to Europe's patchwork of patent registration.
''While other countries and the European commission are trying to harmonize the rules,'' Mr. van Pottelsberghe said, ''Italy is moving in the opposite direction by acting alone. It doesn't make sense.''
 The European Commission, which is the executive body of the union, said on Monday that it was making one final effort to forge a unionwide patent regime, with one single patent, one patent court and one litigation process for all disputes. 
 The existing system is complex and expensive. After having patents approved by the European Patent Office in Munich, inventors must register the patent in every country where they want to protect it. 
 Patent protection across the entire European Union costs around 60,000 euros, or about $72,900. Having a single patent would reduce that cost by about 60 percent, said Grazyna Piesiewicz, a patent specialist at the European Commission.
 ''This would still be more expensive than in the United States,'' Ms. Piesiewicz said, ''because patent applications are scrutinized more closely in Europe and the process takes longer, but it would be a huge improvement on the system at present.'' 
 The commission has been trying for five years to get national governments to agree on one patent regime, but disagreements over what languages patents should be translated into has blocked progress.
 While the discussion over a unionwide patent process heats up, Italy has moved ahead. Late last year it scrapped many of the registration fees for inventors seeking protection in Italy. The new rules took effect at the beginning of the month. Dropping the fees is intended to stimulate innovation, a person close to the Italian government said. 
 But the move may have the opposite effect, Mr. van Pottelsberghe said. Lowering patent costs does spur innovators to protect their inventions, he said, but removing the costs could encourage people to register patents they have no intention of using.
 ''I don't like the Italian move,'' Mr. van Pottelsberghe said, ''because it means someone could register a patent in Italy and even if they don't use it, it will be there for 20 years blocking others from doing research in the same area.'' 
 Other European countries charge a renewal fee each year to prevent dormant patents from hindering new inventions.
 If fees are set too low, the number of patents being registered will shoot up, and there is a risk that the quality of patents may slip, said Dominique Guellec, a senior economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. 
 The Italian ministry for productivity, which is responsible for drafting the change to patent registration rules, was not available to comment.
 In 2000, heads of the European Union's national governments signed on to an ambitious plan to overtake the United States and become the most innovative economy in the world by 2010, but last week the commission warned that it would take 50 years to catch America.

HEADLINE: Raising Reality-TV Stakes, Show Plans to Offer Medical 'Miracles'

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
It was a beautiful Saturday in May when Barbara Gibbs, a 37-year-old mother of four, began praying for a miracle. Again. She had just learned that her 13-year-old son had a brain tumor, discovered by doctors during treatment for an unrelated concussion from a dirt-bike fall. That news came almost a year to the day after her husband -- blind in his left eye since birth -- was found to have a brain tumor that threatened the vision in his right eye.
 ''The first thing I thought was: How is this happening? How can I take care of two?'' said Mrs. Gibbs, who lives with her son, Christopher Mertin; her 36-year-old husband, Robert; and their three younger boys in Clearwater, Fla. ''We were in survivor mode until we got help. We were alone until the show.''
 ''The show'' is a new reality series making its debut this spring on ABC, called ''Miracle Workers.'' The very name embodies both show-business hyperbole and a country in thrall to feel-good entertainment and the possibilities of transformation -- both evidenced by ABC's success with shows like ''Extreme Makeover'' and ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.'' 
 ''Miracle'' chronicles the lives of seriously ill people who lack the contacts or the money for treatment. ABC will pick up the bill, allowing a regularly featured team of doctors and nurses to steer people to the latest medical breakthroughs as cameras capture the travails of patient-hood, from consultations to surgery to recovery. 
 Along with the suspense and anguish will be explanations of medical technology. Jay Renfroe, a principal at Renegade 83 Entertainment, said the show's genesis was in the desire to showcase some of the ''miracle surgeries'' that he and his partner at Renegade, David Garfinkle, had heard about. Renegade 83 is producing the show with Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey of DreamWorks Television, whose credits include ''Las Vegas'' and ''Rescue Me.'' Those miracle surgeries included hip replacements that shorten recovery by weeks, an expandable prosthesis for a child's scoliosis and new techniques to cure blindness with artificial corneas, Mr. Renfroe said.
 ''It works on two levels for a TV show,'' said Mr. Renfroe, whose Renegade 83 credits include ''Blind Date'' and ''The Law Firm'' with David E. Kelley Productions. ''The actual surgery itself is remarkable. These are also highly relatable stories about people's lives.'' 
 Robert Kubey, director of the Center for Media Studies at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., said the popularity of the softer side of reality programs was proof that in a country rubbed raw by terrorism, war, natural disasters and other bad news, ''there's this yearning for community, for positive endings.'' 
 But house building is one thing; brain surgery is another, ratcheting up the reality-television stakes. Although Mr. Kubey applauded ''Miracle Workers'' for providing medical information, he said one critique of such shows is that they allow viewers to evade pointed questions about the fates of those without angels to provide housing or medical care. He called it a ''false consciousness'' that things are being taken care of. 
 Alison Hearn, who teaches media studies at the University of Western Ontario and is writing a book on reality television, cited another concern. ''There's humiliation embedded in all these shows in that people get exposed in ways they can't control,'' she said. The implicit tradeoff, she added, is that bills are paid and illnesses are treated in return for going on camera. Viewers see the transformation, she said, and the network gets the credit.
 ''It's almost as if they're taking over the welfare state,'' Ms. Hearn said of the networks' role. ''They do a ton of good, but they're still making these really cheap shows and making a ton of money.''
 Stephen McPherson, president of ABC Entertainment, described that kind of analysis as ''a really cynical way to look at it.''
 ''Even if the show does no rating,'' he added, ''we help a lot of people. In a day and age of mean-spirited, bug-eating shows, we've done something good. It's knowledge, it's access, it's finding people who are not aware of treatment that's available.'' 
 Unlike many reality shows, Mr. McPherson said, there is no competition involved in winning an appearance on the program. He is well aware, he said, that many people lack the wherewithal to get the best treatment -- which in his view makes the show's contribution and its premise all the more valuable.
 ABC has signed on for six ''Miracle Worker'' episodes, featuring two stories per episode. The show will be given a preview this Saturday in Pasadena, Calif., at the Television Critics Association winter press tour. Its lineup includes a 3-year-old boy with severe scoliosis, a 19-year-old woman with an extreme form of Tourette's syndrome and a blind father of four. Typically, the cameras will track patients and their families for six to nine months. 
 Given the show's name, the endings are easily imaginable, but there is plenty of drama along the way.
 During a rarely performed operation to implant an expandable prosthesis made of titanium into the chest of Adrian Keller, the toddler with scoliosis, he faces the possibility of paralysis. Earlier in the program he is seen with his family at the zoo, where he says that a giraffe ''has a bump like me.'' 
 The patients and their families, found by a staff that canvases a national network of doctors and hospitals, are also screened for their psychological fitness. The Gibbses were located after Mrs. Gibbs contacted the online support group braintrust.org. Mr. Renfroe said that the program would also seek to minimize its risk by selecting surgeries with a ''90 percent'' success rate. 
 ABC does not pay for every procedure because some of the families have insurance; the network stepped in for the Gibbs family after insurance did not cover all of the more than $100,000 in bills. Standard reality show waivers are signed, the producers said, as are standard medical treatment forms.
 Christopher and Robert Gibbs went into surgery just three days apart. 
 Mr. Gibbs's seven-hour surgery at U.C.L.A. Medical Center last September took advantage of a cutting-edge brain imaging technique. His surgeon removed the tumor without damaging his visual fiber, although a local doctor had declared he would lose half his vision in his good eye. 
 Christopher, now 14, had a three-hour surgery at the same medical center, using a minimally invasive technique that left him without any side effects. Mr. Gibbs still takes anti-seizure medication, and after months of unemployment he is now a project manager for a construction company in the Clearwater area.
 The Gibbses do not ponder theoretical questions about ''Miracle Workers.'' Without the medical team, they would not have survived their hellish sojourn, they said. The team asked the questions they did not know to ask, held their hands, made the arrangements. 
 ''We're just average people,'' Mr. Gibbs said softly, adding that he soon forgot about the camera trained on his family for five months. ''We like reality TV, and we decided it would bring awareness to brain tumors.'' 
 Mrs. Gibbs said: ''We fell in love with them. They were very compassionate. They broke down and cried with us.''

HEADLINE: A Nuclear Iran: What Can Be Done?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman is correct in calling for Russia to act responsibly to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions (''The Axis of Order?,'' column, Jan. 13). Unfortunately, until now, Russia has played a cagey game -- calling for Iran to abide by its international obligations at the same time that Moscow has promised to complete the Bushehr nuclear reactor and completed a new arms agreement with Tehran. 
 The new regime in Tehran has made Russia's strategy increasingly untenable and embarrassing. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be wiped off the earth just as the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, was in Jerusalem. The Iranian resumption of nuclear research also calls into question Russia's claim that Tehran is not in pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
Russia's foreign policy has been pursued with an eye to short-term economic gain rather than guided by longer-term strategic interest. It behooves the United States and the European Union to persuade President Vladimir V. Putin and those around him that the billions forfeited now will be more than paid back in preventing a nuclear Iran.

HEADLINE: Production at Gulf Coast Wells Bolsters Industrial Output

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Industrial output posted a solid increase in December as recovery in production of Gulf Coast oil and gas wells offset a slump in auto manufacturing. 
 The Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose by 0.6 percent last month after gains of 0.8 percent in November and 1 percent in October.
 The three strong months represented a recovery in industrial production after a 1.3 percent decline in September that reflected widespread shutdowns of oil wells, refineries and chemical production following Hurricane Katrina. 
 For December, manufacturing output edged up 0.2 percent after a 0.4 percent gain in November. Weakness came in production of autos and auto parts, which fell for a third straight month as automakers continued to scale back output to reduce the number of unsold cars. The December decline was 2.8 percent and followed a decline of 4.9 percent in November. 
 That weakness was offset by strength in the production of computers, airplanes and furniture. 
 Output at the nation's mines, a category that includes oil and gas production, rose 2.5 percent in December after having soared 4.7 percent in November. Oil and gas extraction moved up again in December but still remains more than 6 percent below the pre-Katrina levels. 
 Production at utilities was up 2.7 percent last month as colder-than-normal weather in many areas increased electricity production. 
 ''Cold weather and a rebound in oil production helped power a strong gain in output,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers. 
 Over all, American industry operated at 80.7 percent of capacity in December, up from 80.3 percent in November.

HEADLINE: Governor Pataki's Goodbye Budget

 BODY:
With a decent economy at his back, Gov. George Pataki outlined a $110.7 billion state budget that promised a little cheer for almost everybody, much of it in the form of proposed tax cuts. But the governor needs to acknowledge the large shadow hanging over his final year in office. That shadow involves the court order telling the state to pay a lot more money for schools in New York City and other high-need areas -- $5.6 billion more a year for the city alone. That makes the $2 billion surplus that Mr. Pataki was boasting about look less like a bonus and more like a down payment. 
 There were, of course, other proposals that bear watching as well. Mr. Pataki wants to stop Medicaid fraud by creating ''one of the biggest and most aggressive Medicaid fraud-fighting units in America,'' which would actually be a new independent inspector general. That sounds like a good start after an overlong delay in tackling this serious problem. Additional budget reform and a constitutional amendment to cap borrowing sound promising in general, but their details deserve scrutiny.
 And even though he proposed tax cuts for the elderly, businesses, married people and the estates of the wealthy, the governor wants to re-establish the sales tax on clothes, the most regressive levy on the books. Albany has frequently promised to get rid of that tax, but Mr. Pataki has essentially given up, offering instead two tax-free weeks a year to buy clothing under $250.
 On the education front, the governor proposed 150 new charter schools, added to the 100 that now exist. Charter schools can be a real boon, but they need to be closely monitored for quality -- something that could be a challenge if so many were added at once. Mr. Pataki also listed a number of smaller grants and scholarship programs and proposed a tax credit of $500 per child that could be used for tutoring or for alternative schooling. Opponents called it a ''microvoucher'' system; judging from early reactions, it probably has a micro chance of passing.
 In his budget speech, the governor rightly acknowledged that education financing must be done in the right way, ''by targeting those districts that have the greatest need.'' The real question is whether Mr. Pataki and his Republican colleagues in the State Senate are willing to cede enough money to do the job.

HEADLINE: PATAKI PROPOSES MAJOR TAX CUTS IN FINAL BUDGET

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki called for billions of dollars worth of tax cuts and rebates on Tuesday as the centerpiece of his 12th and final budget, proposing that the state lower income taxes, eliminate New York's tax on inheritances and abolish the so-called marriage penalty. 
 But only a small part of the package of tax cuts and rebates, $844 million, would take effect while Mr. Pataki is in office. That figure would rise to nearly $3.3 billion by the fiscal year ending in March 2009. That led Democrats to criticize the governor for presenting a budget plan that was meant to score political points as he considers a presidential run.
In addition to lowering the income tax rate paid by most New Yorkers to 6.75 percent from 6.85 percent, the governor proposed sending out school property tax rebate checks of $400 to homeowners in school districts across the state that promise to limit spending increases -- a condition that will most likely disqualify homeowners in New York City, a district that most agree needs to increase spending on education. 
 With Mr. Pataki in his final year as governor, his ambitious plans for the tax code faced an uncertain future.
 The plan for wide-ranging tax cuts represented a return for Mr. Pataki to an overriding theme of his first years as governor, when he cut taxes and tried to rein in state spending. But since he took office in 1995, his reputation for fiscal conservatism has been eroded by state spending that has outpaced inflation, with Tuesday's proposed $110.7 billion budget representing a 4.1 percent increase over the previous year's budget. [News analysis, Page B6.] 
 The budget Mr. Pataki proposed on Tuesday also includes a package of business tax cuts and a $500 per child tax credit for families with incomes below $90,000 who live in districts with underperforming schools. The credits could be used to pay for private or parochial schools, or for tutoring or after-school programs. 
 Not all taxes would be cut. His reductions would be offset by raising state cigarette taxes outside New York City to $2.50 from $1.50 per pack. Mr. Pataki also decided to continue charging sales taxes on clothing purchases under $110, eliminating a previous tax break that had been scheduled to come back into effect. The governor instead continued a far less generous two weeks with no sales tax -- one of them a back-to-school week -- on clothing purchases of less than $250. 
 The mix of election-year politics and projected budget surpluses of $2 billion could fuel competing agendas for state lawmakers. The Republican majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, called Mr. Pataki's proposal ''one of the best budgets he has submitted in his 12 years as governor.''
 ''It's good because it focuses on job creation and job retention,'' Mr. Bruno said.
 But the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, criticized the proposal to repeal the estate tax and other tax cuts as providing ''the greatest benefit to those New Yorkers who need it the least.'' 
 The governor would pay for the tax cuts in part by sharply cutting Medicaid, the largest single piece of the budget at nearly $50 billion. Mr. Pataki proposed Medicaid cuts and cost reductions of nearly $1.3 billion, with $246 million coming from the federal government's plan to have Medicare pick up prescription drug costs. However, the state's assumption of more of the share of Medicaid paid by New York City and the counties is increasing the state's burden by more than $1 billion this year.
 ''Let's stick to the guiding principles that have seen us through the challenges of the last 11 years,'' Mr. Pataki said in a speech on Tuesday unveiling his budget proposal. ''Let's remain committed to creating jobs and improving our economic climate, building up our fiscal reserves, cutting taxes, restraining spending and debt, and enacting major reforms.''
 The governor's budget plan fell far short of complying with a court order that the state sharply increase aid to New York City schools, to the tune of $2.8 billion in the coming year. Statewide, the budget included $634 million in new spending on public education. In higher education, the governor called for $200 million in cuts, including changes in tuition assistance programs; and new revenue including tuition increases of up to $500 at the State University of New York. 
 A proposal to allow three new sites for video lottery machines was also aimed at education financing.
 Mr. Silver criticized the governor for refusing to increase aid to city schools by the billions of dollars demanded by a court order. Mr. Pataki's administration is appealing that order, which stems from a lawsuit filed by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, or C.F.E.
 "The governor is passing on the challenge of C.F.E. to the next governor,'' Mr. Silver said. ''That means one more year that New York State's children will be left behind in the global race for the best jobs and the best careers of this new millennium."
 Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno -- Albany's ruling triumvirate -- all said that they were again committed to passing a budget on time for a second year after more than two decades of late budgets.
 While the size and scope of the tax cuts are sure to be contested, many budget watchers said that Mr. Pataki's budgetary swan song did not have many of the more controversial elements of past proposals, perhaps a signal that he wished to leave office with another on-time budget. 
 Many of the proposals he talked about may curry favor among Democrats, including a slate of proposals aimed at curbing oil consumption and encouraging use of alternative energy, including reinstating tax credits for some hybrid electric cars and setting aside $20 million for refineries that use a new method of producing ethanol that would be far more efficient than using corn. 
 ''He's trying to set a tone that's nonconfrontational,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director with the New York Public Interest Research Group, which criticized the proposed education cuts. ''It bodes well for getting things done on time.''
 E. J. McMahon, a budget expert at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, said: ''There's plenty that is meant to ease the way to early agreement with the Legislature. He's not really going after any sacred cows. The Medicaid piece is the budgetary equivalent of 'round up the usual suspects.' ''
 Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog group, said Mr. Pataki was ''not looking to wave any red flags in front of the Legislature, other than on the tax cuts.''
 But she was critical of the budget proposal over all, in part because Mr. Pataki's plan for tax cuts would result in deficits in future years. 
 ''He's leaving his successor with a lot of big problems, many of which were around when he started,'' Ms. Fortuna said: ''high debt, a weak upstate economy, high local taxes, a Medicaid program that's out of whack with the rest of the country and inequitable school financing.'' 
 Lawmakers predicted that with this being an election year, an on-time budget was likely.
 ''I want to be optimistic,'' said James N. Tedisco, a Republican and the Assembly's minority leader. ''We've only done that once in 21 years, so the percentages are not with us, but we're moving in the right direction. If we show up this time around and don't do it again I think there's going to be tremendous pressure at the polls, and that affects both sides of the aisle.''
 Mr. Silver said Assembly Democrats were ''wholeheartedly committed to workingwith the Senate again in a process, again, that produces a fair and on-time budget. Make no mistake about that. It's just that we do have hurdles to overcome.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. to Require More Disclosure Of Executive Pay

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission voted unanimously on Tuesday to overhaul the way companies report their pay packages for senior executives, a move that is expected to lead to greater disclosure but not to any significant decline in executive compensation.
 The proposal -- the biggest change in this area in more than a dozen years -- is the first major rule suggested by the commission's new chairman, Christopher Cox. S.E.C. officials said it would be adopted in a few months, after a few details were sorted out. It is expected to go into force for the 2007 proxy season.
The move comes after a series of corporate scandals at the New York Stock Exchange and Tyco International, among others, that drew criticism over excessive pay.
 In 1992, when the five-member commission first addressed executive pay issues, it sought to require greater disclosure as an antidote to excessive pay. But in the intervening years, many boards have come up with partly or completely hidden benefits for top executives, ranging from paying their taxes to allowing use of corporate jets for personal reasons. 
 ''Simply put, our rules are out of date,'' Mr. Cox said at a commission meeting. But Mr. Cox emphasized that the agency did not intend to produce rules that forced changes in executive pay scales, but to make them more apparent to investors.
 ''It's about wage clarity, not wage controls,'' he said. ''By improving the total mix of information available to the marketplace, we can help shareholders and compensation committees of boards of directors to assess the information themselves, and reach their own conclusions.''
 In recent years the commission has said that several companies, including General Electric and the Walt Disney Company, failed to adequately describe significant payments and benefits to top executives. Just as the accounting scandals prompted Congress and the regulators to adopt rules to invigorate audit committees of directors, the proposal on executive pay is meant to prompt compensation committees to be more exacting. 
 At the same time, large institutional investors, like pension funds, have been raising more questions about the compensation of executives at companies where they own stock. The pay of the average worker remained almost flat at $27,000 from 1990 to 2004, adjusted for inflation, while average chief executive pay has risen from $2.82 million to $11.8 million, a ratio of more than 400 to 1, according to the Institute for Policy Studies and a group, United for a Fair Economy, which has been critical of the disparity between the pay of senior executives and lower-ranking employees.
 The proposed rules would for the first time require public companies to provide a figure for total compensation, including significant perks, stock options and retirement benefits for the chief executive, the chief financial officer and three other top-paid officers, as well as all directors. 
 It is intended to prod companies into providing greater justification for pay packages, retirement plans, severance agreements and so-called golden parachutes -- large payments to executives when control of a company changes hands. And it would require companies to place a precise dollar value on grants of stock options and restricted stock.
 Many companies now do little more than provide legal boilerplate to justify the pay packages. 
 But the plan fell short of calls by some institutional investors to give a greater voice to shareholders in setting some pay packages. And it proposed to loosen at least one area of disclosure by raising the threshold to $120,000 for reporting a business transaction between a company and an executive or relative. Such disclosures are now required for transactions of $60,000 or more.
 Experts hailed the proposal for leading to greater transparency, saying that it would end up showing many hidden benefits given to top executives -- particularly the value of stock options, pension plans and a wide assortment of perks -- that are now either not disclosed or obscured.
 But they acknowledged that the changes, while they may encourage reining in some perks, would not lead to a decline in the rapidly growing pay packages of top executives at many public companies.
 ''The positive effect will be that on the margin -- and it is an important margin -- there will be a new so-called outrage constraint,'' said Lucian A. Bebchuk, the director of the corporate governance program at Harvard Law School, who has documented how executive pay is often hidden and has far outpaced compensation for other employees. ''The caveat is that even though there is an outrage constraint, shareholders have very limited power to do anything about it.''
 Professor Bebchuk said that once what he has called the stealth compensation -- pension and retirement plans in particular -- became public, the disparities between the top and bottom of a company would be even greater. His research has found, for instance, that at the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 with pension plans, the median actuarial value for pensions given to chief executives is about $15 million, or about a third of the overall total compensation.
 B. Espen Eckbo, director of the corporate governance center at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, said the new rules would give institutional investors more ammunition to use to scrutinize boards and management.
 ''There will be criticism; there will be second-guessing,'' said Professor Eckbo, speaking in part from his experience as an adviser to the Norwegian Petroleum Fund, a large pension fund. Still, he said, ''forcing people to explain what they are doing can't be bad.''
 Once the commission publishes the proposal, it will entertain comments for 60 days before voting on a final rule. Agency officials are preparing for a spirited debate over the best way to value options: some business groups have already complained that the proposal would unfairly overvalue options by giving them a full value at the time they are granted, while some institutional investors have urged the commission not to permit companies to undervalue them.
 The Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives from many of the nation's largest companies, issued a statement generally supporting the commission's proposal, although it cautioned that it wanted to examine the details. The statement, by the group's president, John J. Castellani, also asked the agency not to require companies to calculate stock options in a way that overvalues them.
 ''Our goal is to effectively balance the goal of providing shareholders with timely disclosure of accurate and complete compensation information with the need to prevent strategic company information from being revealed to competitors and damaging a company,'' he said. 
 Ira Kay, a compensation consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human resources consulting firm, said company directors now found themselves caught between highly marketable executives, who could often command huge packages, and more active institutional investors seeking greater accountability.
 ''Boards are caught balancing the interests of the executives and the shareholders,'' he said. ''It's a difficult balancing act.''

HEADLINE: Earnings Concerns and a Jump in Oil Price Take a Toll

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
United States stocks ended lower yesterday, hurt by a surge of more than $2 in crude oil prices and worries that fourth-quarter earnings may be disappointing.
 After the closing bell, Intel, a technology bellwether and Dow component, reported quarterly results that missed Wall Street estimates, pushing its shares down in extended-hours trading.
 Shares of I.B.M. fell 17 cents in regular trading. The company reported earnings that beat expectations but quarterly revenue fell below analysts' estimates. 
 Disappointment with Intel's results was likely to hurt trading today, a Wall Street money manager said.
 Speaking of Intel, Daryl Nanes, principal of Nanes Delorme Capital Management, a broker-dealer in New York, said, ''They are also guiding the first-quarter revenue downward and, being a Dow component, this does not bode well for tomorrow's trading.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 63.55 points, or 0.58 percent, at 10,896.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 4.68 points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,282.93. The Nasdaq composite index was down 14.35 points, or 0.62 percent, at 2,302.69.
 In another sign of worries about earnings, shares of Yahoo plunged in after-hours trading after it reported earnings that came in short of expectations.
 Crude oil prices soared $2.39, to $66.31 a barrel, the highest in three and a half months, amid worries about possible supply disruptions.
 The surge in oil prices followed an escalation of violence in Nigeria's oil fields and worries that Iran could withhold crude to ward off Western nations' threats of United Nations sanctions if Iran resumes its uranium enrichment program.
 Oil is rising ''within striking distance of a new high and it seems to be more sticky,'' said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''It's not a one-day deal. It's taking on bigger significance and brings back fear about how much the economy could slow.''
 The latest jump in the crude price helped push 10-year Treasury notes 6/32 higher, to 101 11/32, for a yield of 4.33 percent, down from 4.35 percent.
 The financial services sector was one of the biggest drags on the S.& P. 500 after two components of the group, Wells Fargo & Company and U.S. Bancorp, reported earnings.
 Profit growth at Wells Fargo, the fifth-largest United States bank, and at Fifth Third Bancorp, which also reported earnings, fell short of analysts' estimates. Wells Fargo lost 65 cents, to $62.60, and Fifth Third ended down 49 cents, at $38.44. U.S. Bancorp fell 56 cents, to $30.03.
 The heaviest drag on the Dow was the American International Group, the largest American insurance company. Its shares declined 1.4 percent, to $69.04, its worst one-day drop since September.
 Intel fell 27 cents at the close, to $25.52, but in after-hours trading plunged $2.42 more, to $23.10.
 Shares of Yahoo rose 21 cents, to $40.11, in regular trading but fell $5.40, or more than 13.5 percent, after hours.
 Guidant jumped 7.6 percent, to $76.22, after Boston Scientific raised its takeover offer for the medical devices company to $80 a share. Shares hit an interday record of $76.55.
 Shares of Boston Scientific, which is locked in a bidding war for Guidant with Johnson & Johnson, fell 5.2 percent, to $23.90.

HEADLINE: Developers Can't Imagine a World Without Eminent Domain

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Bank of America agreed to join the developer Douglas Durst in 2003 in building a 54-story tower in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, giving a psychological and economic lift to a city that was still reeling from the destruction of the World Trade Center.
 Mr. Durst said he would not have been able to negotiate with Bank of America or other prospective tenants had the state not authorized him to use eminent domain, a redevelopment tool that is coming under fire in the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling last June in a Connecticut case.
 Now under construction at 42nd Street and the Avenue of Americas, the Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park, as the project is known, was decades in the making as the Durst family assembled the site. Ultimately, only two buildings remained, but their owners kept raising the price, Mr. Durst said.
 Eventually, the state told Mr. Durst that if he found an anchor tenant the buildings could be condemned even though the site was not in a blighted neighborhood. That threat alone was enough to break the impasse. ''Once we had that ability, we were able to quickly come to a resolution on the two properties and meet Bank of America's schedule,'' Mr. Durst said. 
 Using eminent domain for private projects has long been a divisive issue, but never more so since the Supreme Court upheld the right of officials in New London, Conn., to condemn homes and businesses to increase the tax base of one of the state's poorest cities.
 That decision, coupled with reports of abuses in places like the predominantly African-American community of Riviera Beach, Fla., where plans called for replacing thousands of homes with upscale condos, has prompted a onslaught of legislation, both federal and state. 
 In November, the House of Representatives approved a bill by F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, that would penalize government agencies for using condemnation powers for private projects by denying them economic development funds for two years. Legislation has been introduced in 27 states, and more is coming, said Larry Morandi, the director of the environment, energy and transportation program of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 In California, where eminent domain can be used only in urban areas -- and only when there is substantial evidence of blight -- four ballot initiatives have been filed with the state attorney general's office to further limit condemnation, said John F. Shirey, the executive director of the California Redevelopment Association, a trade group. 
 The outcry has given heart to property-rights advocates. ''We lost the Supreme Court case, but we're ultimately going to win in changing the way that eminent domain is going to be used in this country,'' said Dana Berliner, a senior attorney for the Institute for Justice, the most prominent advocacy group.
 But around the country, developers and city officials say weakening or destroying the power to condemn property will seriously undermine efforts to rehabilitate decaying cities and might even hinder the rebuilding of New Orleans. Without eminent domain, the Inner Harbor, which played an essential role in Baltimore's success in building its tourist industry, could not have been redeveloped, said Ralph S. Tyler, the city solicitor. 
 Yet many developers and politicians have been loath to speak up, said Jeffrey Finkle, the president and chief executive of the International Economic Development Council, a professional group. For example, the Real Estate Roundtable, which represents the nation's largest real estate companies, has refrained from officially opposing the federal bill, said Roger Platt, a senior vice president. 
 Mr. Finkle also said the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, had not put its lobbying muscle to work on the issue. But Herb L. Tyson, a lobbyist for the council, said he had privately urged lawmakers to preserve eminent domain for economic development. ''Our feeling is that land use is a local issue,'' he said. 
 Mr. Finkle said that for many politicians, defending eminent domain was as perilous as endorsing gay marriage. ''This issue is the third rail right now,'' Mr. Finkle said. ''You step on it, you die.''
 One business group that has opposed restrictions on eminent domain is the Partnership for New York City, whose members include most of the city's top developers. Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the group, said her members opposed any efforts to alter condemnation procedures through federal or state legislation. ''When you add restrictions on development, you are never quite sure what the results are going to be,'' she said. ''We want to avoid political reaction to an issue that adds more problems and obstacles to economic growth.''
 Some lawmakers and public officials, however, are trying to carve out a moderate position, saying that reform is needed to address legitimate grievances. ''What you're seeing is a coherent attack by the right on the power of eminent domain,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a New York State assemblyman from Westchester County who is seeking the Democratic nomination for state attorney general. ''It does no one any good to pretend that things aren't going to change. If we take that view, we're going to see the extreme position triumph.'' 
 Since June, three states have passed bills banning the use of eminent domain for economic development (though a measure in Texas exempts the new Dallas Cowboys stadium in Arlington). Michigan lawmakers have approved a constitutional amendment that is subject to a popular vote. 
 In a more cautious vein, Ohio has effectively denied state funding for one year to private projects in nonblighted areas that involve condemnation. The state also created a bipartisan task force to study the issue. ''Ohio is saying, 'We need some breathing space,' '' Mr. Morandi, of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said.
 Mr. Brodsky's bills would increase protections for property owners. Homeowners, for example, would be guaranteed compensation equal to 150 percent of the value of their property. An ombudsman would oversee condemnation, which would be limited to projects that were part of a redevelopment plan approved by an elected local government. Government agencies would have to justify the taking of homes by weighing the benefits against the impact. 
 But Ms. Berliner said that requiring city council approval would not cure the abuses. ''Cities know how to jump through their own hoops,'' she said.
 One issue that has divided advocates of eminent domain is whether its use should be limited to blighted areas, as in California and other states. John D. Echeverria, the executive director of the Georgetown Environmental Law and Policy Institute, views eminent domain as a critical weapon in fighting sprawl, but he said that a finding of blight should not be a prerequisite. ''Justifying eminent domain on a finding of blight invariably targets low-income communities,'' he said. 
 The word ''blight'' is not mentioned in the Sensenbrenner bill, which does, however, allow condemnation of contaminated land, known as brownfields. The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but no hearings have been scheduled.
 That may be because Congress has already passed stop-gap legislation. A vaguely worded rider to an annual appropriations bill in November restricts use of federal funds to support condemnation that ''primarily benefits private entities.'' The measure also called for the Government Accountability Office to conduct a yearlong nationwide study.
 Economic development officials, who contend that property-rights groups have exaggerated the threat from eminent domain, said they welcomed the study. ''The public is understandably upset because they've not been told the whole story,'' said Mr. Shirey of the California Redevelopment Association.

HEADLINE: Making Wine In a Hostile Climate On Sonoma's Coast

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov

DATELINE: TIMBER COVE, Calif. 

 BODY:
IT'S the rare morning along the Sonoma County coast when you don't wake up in a fog. From the cliffs of this hamlet on the Coast Highway, you can hear the Pacific crashing on the craggy shore. You just can't see it through the mist. It's a wild, beautiful, out-of-the-way place, perfect for whale watching, collecting driftwood or beholding mesmerizing sunsets. But wine? Fine for drinking, but nobody in his right mind would plant a vineyard here.
 Of course, sanity has never been a prerequisite for the wine business. Anybody who has ever struggled up the precipitous, death-defying slope of a vineyard in the Mosel or Cote-Rotie recognizes that point right away. So it is that more and more serious grape growers have abandoned common sense to buy land and put in vineyards along the Sonoma coast, despite the fog, the incessant spring and fall rains that can destroy a crop and the isolation that requires many people to generate their own electricity.
None of the small growers expect to make a fortune on their wine, unless someday they sell a successful brand to a big corporation. They are in it for the extraordinary wines that these challenging conditions can produce. 
 These vineyards are not on the edge of the ocean, but two to five miles inland, on ridges high enough that the fog dissipates in time for the grapes to get morning sun. But others are even closer to the coast, close enough to feel the sea winds and to smell the brine. Mostly they are planted with pinot noir, a grape that is finicky and difficult to grow in the best of conditions. Here, growers obtain a tiny yield at best, half of what they might hope for in a sunnier, saner region. They have also planted chardonnay, and, notably, a bit of syrah too, though the temperature is too cool for grapes like cabernet sauvignon and merlot.
 Among the newcomers are small, idealistic operations like Peay Vineyards near tiny Annapolis; Failla and Fort Ross Vineyards near Cazadero, and also established names like Pahlmeyer, Peter Michael Winery, Kendall-Jackson, Joseph Phelps Vineyards and Benziger Family Winery, none of which have started selling wine made in these vineyards They join established operations like Flowers, which has three vineyards just a little more than a mile from the ocean, and small boutique producers like Williams Selyem, Marcassin, Kistler and Martinelli, whose wines from coastal vineyards are practically impossible to taste unless you have a coveted spot on their mailing lists or are willing to pay a few hundred dollars in a restaurant. 
 The extraordinary potential of the coastal wines first became apparent in the late 1980's, when Williams Selyem began producing ground-breaking pinot noirs from pioneering vineyards like Summa, near the town of Bodega, and Hirsch, just up the ridge from here.
 Thomas Brown, who in 2001 bought 40 acres near Annapolis, north of here toward Mendocino County, is one of many who found inspiration from the 1988 Williams Selyem Summa Vineyard pinot noir.
 ''I had never tasted anything like that before from California,'' said Mr. Brown, 33, who planted 14 acres of pinot noir in his Ridgetop Vineyard and plans to release his first commercial vintage in 2007 under a label to be decided. 
 The Sonoma coast pinot noirs have since shown themselves to be among California's best and most distinctive wines, dense and concentrated without being heavy, full of dark fruit and earth flavors and a singular structure of tightly wound acidity. The best chardonnays are simultaneously rich yet taut, with lively acidity and citrus and mineral flavors. And though only a minute amount of syrah has been made, the best show a true, delicious Rhone-like character, highly unusual in California.
 Efforts to grow grapes in this area date to the 1940's and perhaps before, but the first successful coastal grape growers began planting in the late 1970's and early 80's. Land then was cheap and easily available, and this rugged coastline, with more sea lions than humans and just a few ghostly crossroads towns on the ridges, appealed to many back-to-nature types, who began turning old sheep ranches and apple orchards into vineyards. In the last 10 years, the trickle has become a flood, with dozens of vineyards going in from the area south of the Russian River around Bodega and Occidental, up across the river through Cazadero and Fort Ross and as far north as Annapolis near the Gualala River.
 While the soils and climates offer the prospect for greatness, they also hold the potential for disaster. Growers in the sunny flats in Napa Valley, for example, have to fight to keep their yields below four or five tons an acre. Any higher, and the grapes will lose concentration. 
 Here, a ton and a half is considered a successful harvest, two tons extraordinary. And there are the bad years, like 2005, when intense June rains practically wiped out the grapes just as they were beginning to emerge on the vines. Many growers were lucky to achieve half a ton an acre, a figure that David Hirsch of Hirsch Vineyard called an economic disaster.
 Eric Sussman of Radio-Coteau, a new winery that buys grapes from several different coastal producers, makes a peppery, smoky syrah from the new Cherry Camp Vineyard near Freestone. Last year, he was not able to pick the grapes until Nov. 1, well into the risky fall season when the rains come back after a summer hiatus. Risk seems too inadequate a word for the hazards here.
 ''In properties like this there's no margin for error,'' said Mike Benziger, general partner of Benziger Family Winery, which in 2002 began planting a vineyard near Bodega, along the coast south of the Russian River. ''It's berry-by-berry, cluster-by-cluster farming.''
 Mr. Benziger's vineyard, which he started to plant in 2002 on an old sheep pasture, is adjacent to the new Kistler vineyard. 
 ''We have 24 acres of plantable land, but it was so expensive we stopped at 10 acres,'' he said. He attributes the high price -- $70,000 an acre -- partly to regulatory issues that make it difficult to plant a new vineyard without lawyers and hearings, and partly to the region's seclusion, which makes a time-consuming adventure of getting deliveries or repairs. He has yet to make any wine from this vineyard, though he has sold grapes to Radio-Coteau. By contrast, when David Hirsch began planting his vineyard in 1980, he spent no more than $4,000 an acre.
 ''That wouldn't get you through the paperwork today,'' he said. Adding to the challenge is opposition from longtime residents, who feel that vineyards and winemakers threaten the distance they have tried so hard to put between themselves and society. Near Annapolis, tough new regulations concerning tree clearing, erosion control and environmental impact are a serious obstacle to winemakers.
 ''It's just going to grind the whole thing to a halt, which is what the folks out there want,'' said Mr. Brown of Ridgetop Vineyard, who said he has given up on adding to the 14 acres he's already planted. ''I think we'll just stick with that and be done with all the fighting.''
 Aside from the legal battles, it takes a special sort of determination to hazard the coastal life. Two brothers, Nick and Andy Peay, found exactly the sort of hilltop land they were looking for, 80 acres near Annapolis with the trees already cleared, and began planting their vineyard in 1998, before tougher regulations were enacted. The land included a drafty old house, home for Nick Peay and his wife, Vanessa Wong, who is also the winemaker. Coyote and bobcats prowl the territory, electricity can fail in a high, howling wind, and the nearest grocery store is 45 minutes from the town of Annapolis, population 75. Andy Peay, who is in charge of marketing, lives in Healdsburg, more than an hour away.
 Like most of the coast grape growers, the Peays decided that it would be too difficult and expensive to construct a winery in such an isolated, rugged place. So they built theirs in an industrial park in Cloverdale, also an hour away. 
 ''It makes for an awful lot of driving,'' Andy Peay said. 
 Still, with 48 acres now planted, Peay Vineyards is making wines of rare intensity and precision. While still exploring the stylistic potential of the vineyard, Ms. Wong has turned out pinot noirs that combine lightness with intensity, and crisp attractive chardonnays. The Peay wines made from Rhone grapes shine, like beautifully spicy syrahs and a 2004 viognier, with aromas of minerals, honey and flowers.
 South of Annapolis near Cazadero, Ehren Jordan, the winemaker for Turley Cellars -- which is known for its big, burly zinfandels -- planted a small vineyard in the late 1990's on a ridge once logged for redwoods. Today, he has 10 acres and sells wines made from his own and purchased grapes under the Failla label, named for his wife, Anne-Marie Failla. His chardonnays and pinot noirs are lean and Burgundian, but the star of the Failla line is his estate syrah, a lively, peppery Rhone-style wine that is one of the best California syrahs. 
 Mr. Jordan, who lives in Calistoga in the Napa Valley, makes his wines at the Turley facility not far from there. On the coast, only Flowers has constructed a winery that resembles the sort of structures tourists are used to visiting in other parts of California. It's a testament to the resources that the owners, Walt and Joan Flowers, accumulated in the nursery business before they began planting their Camp Meeting Ridge Vineyard in 1991.
 Growers here like to call their region the ''true coast,'' to distinguish it from the deceptive label designation ''Sonoma Coast,'' an American Viticultural Area (or A.V.A.) so vast and misleading that it includes vineyards east of Santa Rosa and Petaluma, dozens of miles from the coast, with entirely different characteristics.
 ''A.V.A.'s are pretty useless,'' said Ted Lemon, who makes pinot noir and chardonnay under the Littorai label. ''That's why we use vineyard designations.''
 Mr. Lemon buys grapes from the hills of Sonoma and Mendocino, which he calls the ''true North Coast.'' He made his first coastal pinot noir from the Hirsch Vineyard in 1994.
 ''It took us until 1997 to find other pinot we wanted, from the Theriot Vineyard, which shows you how little there was,'' he said. 
 Littorai wines aim for subtlety and purity rather than hit-you-over-the-head power. His pinot noirs from the Hirsch Vineyard north of the Russian River seem more structured and slightly coarser than his pinots from the Theriot Vineyard near Bodega, south of the river, which seem smoother. ''I do think north of the river has a tendency toward firmer wines,'' he said.
 Years like 2005 can shake the confidence of bigger companies like Joseph Phelps. In the last few years Phelps has planted two vineyards along the coast with chardonnay and pinot noir, and is abandoning its sources for those grapes in the Carneros region to focus solely on the Sonoma coast. It's a daunting prospect for a company that values consistency and predictability.
 ''The low yields concern me greatly,'' said Craig Williams, the director of winemaking at Phelps. ''It makes it more inconsistent and expensive.'' 
 In the Napa Valley, where Phelps has its headquarters, winemakers can afford to be nonchalant at times, he said, but not on the Sonoma coast.
 ''It really is on the frontier,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It's an hour away but it feels like it's on the other side of the planet.''

HEADLINE: Behind Spotlight, Child Deaths Are Just One Gauge of System 

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
The fatal blow fractured his skull, but that barely begins to account for the last, gruesome hours, in 1999, of a 21-month-old boy whose family had a history of child abuse and neglect. The medical examiner found 13 bruises on his head and neck, blunt trauma injuries on his torso, arms and legs, and even human bite marks.
 In 2002, a 12-year-old girl who had been sexually abused, had missed months of school, had seen her siblings neglected and had repeatedly threatened suicide, took a fatal overdose of a drug that her mother had failed to lock up.
Just a year and a half ago, a young woman who had neglected her first child gave birth to another. Days later, the baby's grandmother threatened to stab the mother and kill herself -- all in front of a social worker. Within three months, the baby -- dehydrated, malnourished and badly beaten -- was dead. 
 The deaths all shared crucial elements: a long history of involvement between the children's families and New York City's child welfare agency, the Administration for Children's Services; caseworkers who repeatedly investigated claims of abuse and neglect, yet sometimes failed to pursue leads and follow the agency's rules for guarding children's safety; and apparently missed opportunities to avert tragedy.
 The cases, though, got brief or no news media attention, and whatever punishments or reforms they provoked took place in considerable quiet, too.
 The deaths, however disturbing and for whatever reasons, faded quickly to the complicated, often sad fabric of day-to-day life in the city's child welfare system, where each year some two dozen to three dozen children whose families had dealings with the authorities wound up dying.
 Of course, last week's death of Nixzmary Brown, a 7-year-old girl beaten to death, the authorities say, by her stepfather, has set off a much different reaction -- a storm of news media coverage, multiple investigations and angry finger-pointing.
 Today, the child welfare agency is expected to announce disciplinary actions against workers who were involved in her case.
 Nixzmary's case is roiling an agency that almost everyone agrees has made enormous strides since a significant overhaul began in early 1996. For some, then, the radically different public responses to indisputably terrible deaths of young children raises questions about just how much any single death reflects the overall effectiveness of the child welfare system.
 Douglas Besharov, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a longtime member of the independent panel that reviews child deaths in New York City, said that the number of child fatalities in any given year is an important measure of performance, but only one among many. 
 Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, said that the number of fatalities is so small and fluctuates so much that it is of limited use.
 ''You can learn useful things from studying homicides, but one thing you cannot know is whether your system is getting any better or any worse,'' said Mr. Wexler, who thinks child welfare agencies too often needlessly remove children from homes.
 In New York, though, the numbers have moved up and down from year to year. Some of the lowest totals of deaths in recent years came when the city's child welfare system was thought to be at its worst, in the mid-1990s. One of the highest totals -- 36 in 1998 -- occurred two years into a reform effort that would be hailed as a national model. 
 Over the last decade, in fact, from 22 to 36 children each year died after the child welfare authorities had looked into some allegation of unsatisfactory conditions in their homes. Most of those deaths go largely unnoticed, but occasionally, sometimes for evident and urgent reasons, a horrific example of unchecked abuse leading to death -- Nixzmary Brown in 2006, or Elisa Izquierdo in 1995 -- comes to define the child welfare system for much of the public.
 Certainly, beyond death statistics, the city's child welfare agency appears to be making progress. There are fewer children in foster care; children who are abused are much less likely to be abused again, and caseworkers are, on average, less overwhelmed by tracking large numbers of children at risk.
 To be sure, reports by an outside group of experts that reviews the city agency's handling of cases that end in a child's death reveal a sad litany of malevolent behavior and innocent mistakes by parents, foster parents and boyfriends, and of diligent caseworkers who pursue every charge and careless colleagues who do not listen to years of alarms.
 But the numbers are small in a system that monitors tens of thousands of children every year. Furthermore, there is no apparent correlation between the number of deaths and either the drop in crime in the last dozen years or the health of the economy.
 ''The numbers were already dropping when the system was probably at its worst,'' in the mid-1990's, said Nicholas Scoppetta, who was appointed commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1996 and who oversaw a multi-million dollar reconstruction of the agency. He is now the city fire commissioner.
 In fact, two years into Mr. Scoppetta's overhaul of the agency, the number of child deaths spiked, to 36. The following year, it dropped to 23, the lowest in decades.
 Yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg defended the performance of A.C.S. and its commissioner, John B. Mattingly, and he was among those who cautioned against judging the system by a single case, however tragic.
 ''No question, it failed this child,'' he said. ''No question, we all failed this child. But the agency is exceptionally well run and we want to make sure that we reduce the probabilities of anything like this ever happening again. Those two things are not inconsistent.''
 The death reports make clear that, for all the system's improvements, frequent mistakes are made by caseworkers -- some who fail to coordinate their work with the police or schools, some who do not file reports on time, and some who leave children in dangerous homes.
 In the case of the 12-year-old who killed herself, agency caseworkers had earlier investigated charges that she was often out of school and that her little brother's medical needs were neglected, and concluded that they could not prove either claim. The department's review panel called those findings inexplicable, saying there was ample evidence in both instances.
 In the case of the 3-month-old boy, a caseworker for a private agency hired by the city actually saw the grandmother threaten to kill herself and stab the boy's mother, yet left him in the home.
 ''Child welfare is enormously complicated, and that's why you see errors of judgment, even when they're going by the rulebook,'' Mr. Scoppetta said. ''You're simply not going to avoid every tragedy.''
 Some experts say a better measure of how well the system protects children is the likelihood that a mistreated child will be mistreated again. In 1998, the agency reported that 17 percent of children who were abused or neglected suffered another documented instance of mistreatment in the following year; by 2002, that had fallen to 10 percent, and in 2004, it was 12 percent.
 Mr. Scoppetta said that when attention is paid to cases like Nixzmary's, it is understandable, because ''people may not understand the intricacies of the system, but they certainly know when a child is killed.'' 
 And he and others said that while the scrutiny given to a very few abuse cases -- while thousands of others are ignored -- may seem unwarranted, it at least has the effect of focusing attention on a system that people ignore for years at a time.

HEADLINE: A Record of Increased Spending Helped Win Votes but May Need Explaining 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Eleven years ago, as a rookie governor, George E. Pataki shook up Albany by proposing a budget that cut overall state spending for the first time since World War II. That year he called for a $62.6 billion spending plan.
 On Tuesday, Governor Pataki unveiled his 12th and final state budget proposal. It calls for spending $110.7 billion in the next fiscal year. 
Over the years, spending increases helped the Republican governor win re-election twice in this overwhelmingly Democratic state, but they have sparked distrust of Mr. Pataki in some conservative circles. Now, as Governor Pataki ponders an uphill run for president, it is one of the areas he is taking pains to explain as he works to burnish his record.
 Spending has risen an average of 5 percent a year during his three terms, according to the state budget division, well above the average growth from inflation, which was 2.6 percent. So Mr. Pataki sought to put his spending in perspective on Tuesday, showed reporters a chart indicating that the 5 percent annual growth in spending was less than the average for all states (5.9 percent) and less than the average growth during the administration of his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo (7.5 percent). 
 Asked if, as a first-term governor, he had ever imagined proposing a $110 billion budget, Mr. Pataki said, ''No.''
 Then he elaborated, explaining that he believes the increase was, in a way, made possible by his early austerity. ''I've always believed that when you control spending, cut taxes and improve the economic climate, and you grow the private sector, then you have the resources to support the public good,'' he said. ''And that's what has happened.''
 All that spending has not exactly allowed the governor to put a chicken in every pot.
 Mr. Pataki is still appealing a court ruling that would require the state to increase its annual spending on schools by billions of dollars. Medicaid continues to eat up more and more state dollars, but the poor people who rely on it say that too often, their quest for good, reliable health care is undermined by voluminous paperwork, inscrutable rules and a shortage of doctors. And many big public projects are still spoken of in the future tense, from the Second Avenue subway to the rail link between Lower Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport.
 The governor's spending habits have changed over time, according to an analysis of his budgets by the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group. Through 2000, Mr. Pataki's average spending increases were smaller than the average spending increases of some comparable states, the analysis found. Beginning in 2001, it found, New York's rate of budget growth began to outpace the other states'.
 ''He came in as a belt-tightener, and over time succumbed to the pressure to add spending, a la Albany,'' said Diana Fortuna, the president of the commission. 
 Of course, governing New York State requires striking a balance among fiscal responsibility, the needs of the state and the politics of Albany, and at different times during his three terms, Mr. Pataki has found himself praised and criticized in all three areas. 
 Fiscal watchdogs applauded his early austerity but tsk-tsked his later spending. Social-service advocates praised him when he expanded health coverage, and castigated him when he proposed health and education cuts. He had success some years in striking deals with the Legislature, but in other years impasses led to record late budgets, and one year a budget was passed over his veto.
 The governor also raised some eyebrows by using his final budget address to call for overhauling the state budget process, and its debt practices. During his three terms, state debt has increased to $49.4 billion, from $36.4 billion when he took office. The state has one of the highest per capita debt rates in the nation: it is estimated to be $2,563 in the coming fiscal year, up from $1,973 when he took office, according to the state.
 Like many of the tax cuts Mr. Pataki proposed on Tuesday, the bulk of which will only take effect after he leaves office, the debt proposal will be an issue for the next governor, if it goes forward.
 ''A different set of rules for the next governor than you had for yourself,'' noted Senator David A. Paterson, the Democratic minority leader. 
 Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a project of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, was pleased to see tax cuts, and a proposal to give tax credits to some parents for educational expenses including private school tuition. 
 But he said he was concerned by the spending increase this year, and the fact that so many of the tax increases do not take effect -- or have to be paid for -- until Mr. Pataki leaves office.
 ''He's attempting to establish his legacy,'' Mr. McMahon said, ''with one foot out the door.''

HEADLINE: Conferees Call for More Money to Fight Bird Flu

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Top health officials from around the world said Tuesday that governments would have to spend heavily for years to prevent bird flu from spreading widely among humans, and can not rely just on the many stop-gap steps taken so far. 
 A two-day conference that began here on Tuesday morning is expected to produce pledges of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion to combat bird flu from the conference's sponsors, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the European Union and the World Bank, and from other donors, including the United States.
 The recent spate of 20 human cases of bird flu on Europe's doorstep in Turkey, including four deaths, has prompted criticism of Turkish officials for not spotting the disease in local poultry sooner. That has led to calls for an international effort to build up many nations' veterinary capacity so that they can spot outbreaks early, when they can still be contained fairly easily with steps like culling or vaccinating chickens.
 ''Most people see this as a long-term challenge,'' said Dr. David Nabarro, the United Nations' top coordinator for avian and human influenza. ''The short-term money is needed because we have some services that are stretched, but we need a long-term approach.''
 A succession of ministers and health experts echoed this point.
 ''We cannot only look at short-term measures; we have to look at building the infrastructure,'' said Markos Kyprianou, the European Union's commissioner for health and consumer protection. Mr. Kyprianou said in an interview that the European Union would announce on Wednesday an increase to its previous pledge of 100 million euros ($121.3 million).
 Some at the conference warned that if the bird flu virus did develop the ability to pass easily from person to person, it could spread swiftly.
 ''We have a saying in China,'' said Qiao Zonghuai, a vice foreign minister, in his opening speech: ''When a nest is overturned, no eggs go unbroken.''

HEADLINE: With Ample Supplies, Qatar Becomes Hub For Converting Natural Gas to Vehicle Fuel 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: RAS LAFFAN INDUSTRIAL CITY, Qatar 

 BODY:
In this tiny emirate near the border with Iran, the world's largest oil companies are betting billions of dollars on an obscure method for making diesel fuel that stems from apartheid South Africa's aggressive efforts to wean its economy off imported oil. 
 Yellow school buses shuttle thousands of Indian and Pakistani workers from nearby labor camps each day to work in a giant meandering knot of pipes and turbines, showcased with a logo of an oryx, Qatar's antelope mascot.
No one is angling for oil here. In fact, rising oil prices have lifted the fortunes of a once-shunned technology that converts another fossil fuel, natural gas, into clean-burning diesel. 
 Even as geologists fiercely debate whether depleting oil fields can satiate intense demand for oil in the rising economies of Asia, the actions of the international energy industry may speak louder than words. Big oil is betting on once-derided unconventional energy sources, like this stranded natural gas in the Persian Gulf and remote tar deposits in Canada and Venezuela, to help meet surging demand for transportation fuel. 
 ''It's time to take the genie out of the bottle,'' Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's energy minister, said in an interview. ''We want to be the capital of the world for this new age of fuels.'' 
 These different types of fuels may have clunky nicknames, like G.T.L. and L.N.G. But they draw big money. Mr. Attiyah rattled off a roster of ventures with Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, Chevron and Sasol of South Africa to produce a new form of diesel from natural gas and said they were expected to invest more than $14 billion in capital over the next five to seven years. 
 This new diesel fuel is far cleaner than the diesel commonly used in passenger cars in Europe and heavy trucks in the United States. Diesel is usually made from the sulfur-laden parts of crude oil and traces its origins to the sturdy 19th-century engine invented by Rudolf Diesel. 
 Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum are working together on one venture to produce cleaner diesel from natural gas that is expected to require $7 billion over the next several years. It would be the single largest investment in Exxon Mobil's history. 
 Qatar, a small peninsula nation off Saudi Arabia, is not alone in what may be the largest multination experiment with alternative fuels. Chevron is building another $3 billion complex in Nigeria to produce 34,000 barrels a day. Elsewhere, Syntroleum, based in Tulsa, Okla., is trying to advance similar ventures in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, while in Algeria, companies including Shell, Statoil of Norway and Sasol of South Africa are vying for a project focused on that country's Tinhert gas field. Energy companies are also looking at gas-rich nations like Australia, Iran, Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago for other projects.
 By 2015, overall production of this fuel may reach more than one million barrels a day, according to an estimate by Cambridge Energy Research Associates. That is roughly equivalent to Venezuela's current daily oil exports to the United States.
 Qatar has attracted the largest projects thanks to its plentiful natural gas reserves and an aggressive investment strategy that builds on a longstanding cultivation of American and European energy companies. Only Russia and Iran are believed to have more natural gas than Qatar, a nation of 800,000 people -- mostly foreign laborers -- that is already positioned to soon become the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. 
 The liquefied natural gas industry in Qatar, however, is much different from the wager on technology to convert gas to a liquid fuel. Liquefied natural gas is extremely complex to transport, requiring an elaborate system of cooling plants near gas deposits, double-hulled tankers and reheating facilities in the markets where the fuel is consumed. Liquefied natural gas is largely used to generate electricity. 
 The gas-to-liquid method, on the other hand, provides an alternative to oil as a transportation fuel. Gas-to-liquids essentially transforms natural gas into liquid diesel that can be transported and sold using existing tankers, refineries and gas stations. 
 Diesel is much more commonplace in Europe than in the United States, where consumers still think of it as a heavily polluting fuel used in big trucks and machinery. Two German scientists, Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, developed the process in the 1920's after discovering a way of converting coal into a liquid fuel. 
 Energy analysts say gas-to-liquid plants become competitive when oil prices climb above $30 to $35 a barrel, as they have during the last two years. [On Tuesday, crude oil prices closed at $66.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than double the price on Dec. 31, 2003.] 
 Gas-to-liquid producers contend the fuel might attract a premium in nations looking for alternatives that reduce toxic diesel emissions. A report by the California Energy Commission recently recommended blending the cleaner diesel with existing fuel stocks to meet stringent fuel standards.
 ''One key aspect of the fuel is its low smog formation,'' said Andrew Brown, Shell's country manager in Qatar, who has imported a gas-to-liquid-powered Audi sedan to Doha to show how the fuel burns quietly and without the smell of early forms of diesel. 
 Transforming gas-to-liquids into an environmentally-friendly fuel source is new, even if production methods have already gone through several incarnations. During World War II, Germany developed methods to convert coal into fuel for their army. And, apartheid leaders in South Africa adapted methods to convert coal into a transportation fuel to survive economic isolation. 
 The United States flirted with the method after the oil shocks of the 1970's, but eventually withdrew most funding of synthetic fuel research when oil prices fell. Then, breakthroughs enabled companies to use cleaner-burning natural gas instead of coal to produce a fuel that emits far fewer pollutants than diesel that is made from crude oil. 
 Though methods vary, the process essentially combines natural gas with water and oxygen, then exposes that mixture to cobalt to produce a transparent liquid fuel. This fuel currently amounts to a minuscule portion of total global fuel production, with Shell operating the largest such plant in Bintulu, Malaysia, a pilot operation with output of about 14,700 barrels a day. Overall global oil production, by comparison, is more than 80 million barrels a day. 
 A small experimental plant also exists in Ponca City, Okla., though gas-to-liquid production in the United States is likelier to one day come from coal since the nation's natural gas is expensive and in short supply. 
 Still, worldwide gas-to-liquid production is set to grow rapidly over the next decade. It joins fuel sources like bitumen, which is mined in vast open-pit operations in Canada, and ethanol, which is widely consumed in sugar-cane-rich Brazil, in easing reliance on crude oil for transportation. 
 Although the use of oil in factories and power plants has declined in the last two decades, the United States still relies on oil for more than 95 percent of its transportation needs. Qatar's projects capture the ambitions and risks of turning gas-to-liquid into an internationally viable fuel. The first shipments of gas-to-liquid out of the country are expected to be marketed this year with the opening of Oryx GTL, a venture by Chevron, Sasol and Qatar Petroleum producing 34,000 barrels a day.
 Shell is also forming a venture with Qatar Petroleum to produce 140,000 barrels a day of gas-to-liquid by 2009. Exxon Mobil's larger venture is aiming for production of 154,000 barrels. 
 Wayne A. Harms, Exxon Mobil's country manager for Qatar, said in an interview in Doha that the company was drilling appraisal wells for the project in the North Field, the world's largest pure natural gas field. Qatar shares the field with Iran, and there are plans to start production by 2011.
 ''Qatar is in a unique position,'' Mr. Harms said, ''in that it has a large field that's accessible, a politically stable government and a good vision of what it's doing.''
 The dizzying scale of these projects, though, presents challenges for Qatar and its Western partners. Construction costs, for instance, have been climbing in the last year as companies scramble to acquire building material not just in Ras Laffan but also in the capital, Doha, where dozens of skyscrapers are going up. The cost of a bag of cement is up more than 20 percent since the start of 2005, according to the Doha office of Davis Langdon, a construction consulting firm. 
 Higher project costs, as well as concern over managing the extraction of gas from the North Field, weighed on Qatar's abrupt move last year to delay the start of other gas-to-liquid ventures with ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil of Houston. 
 Still, huge projects are finally taking off here above all for one reason. More than any other gas-rich country, Qatar has aggressively seized on new ways of monetizing its natural gas. And Qatar's model is likely to be studied in a world that has more natural gas than oil, with global gas reserves expected to last another 67 years compared with 41 years of annual supply of crude oil, according to BP, the British energy giant.
 The ample supplies of gas, of course, are far away from the largest markets for the fuel, in industrialized countries. That explains why the investments in Qatar, Nigeria and other countries might signal an extension of the international trade in energy.
 Even as renewable energy captures the public imagination, hydrocarbons, whether found in oil or natural gas or bitumen, are growing more vital in meeting energy needs. ''It's simply a shift away from crude oil to natural gas,'' said Bernard J. Picchi, international oil and energy technology analyst with Foresight Research Solutions in New York. ''I'm not particularly concerned about the ability of hydrocarbons to survive, even thrive, well into this century.''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies Cut Into Profit at Two Lenders

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company and U.S. Bancorp, two of the nation's largest banks, said quarterly earnings rose at the slowest rate in four years as an increase in bankruptcy filings led to higher credit losses. 
 The lenders each reported an 8 percent increase in net income.
Almost 487,500 Americans filed for bankruptcy in the week before an Oct. 17 change in United States law made it harder to wipe out personal debts. While the surge in filings swelled bad loans, pushing up costs for banks, some also reported an increase in commercial and consumer borrowing, indicating that profit growth may accelerate in future quarters.
 ''The bankruptcy issue is a one-time situation,'' said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Advisors, which owns shares of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp. ''Commercial and industrial loan growth was fairly strong and should be the key driver of earnings growth this year for the regional banks.''
 Wells Fargo's net income rose to $1.93 billion, or $1.14 a share, from $1.79 billion, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Earnings fell short of some analysts' estimates. Shares of Wells Fargo fell 65 cents, to $62.60. Wells Fargo is the nation's largest home equity lender.
 U.S. Bancorp said its net income climbed to $1.14 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.06 billion, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 Credit losses related to the bankruptcy statute amounted to about $56 million, the bank said. Shares of U.S. Bancorp fell 56 cents, to $30.03. 
 A narrowing of the gap between short-term and long-term interest rates, a so-called flattening yield curve, also eroded banks' profit growth. Wells Fargo's net interest margin, the difference between the money it earns by lending and its cost of funds, shrank 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.84 percent. U.S. Bancorp said its net interest margin narrowed to 3.9 percent, from 4.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Can Holders Sue Merrill in State Courts When Traders Cannot?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Is it absurd to let an investor sue in state court if he or she held on to a stock because of a broker's fraudulent advice, but not to allow such a suit if the investor bought the stock based on the advice?
 That is an issue the United States Supreme Court will take up today when it hears arguments in a case involving Merrill Lynch and its research during the Internet bubble -- research that two lawsuits contend was fraudulent. 
At issue is whether Congress succeeded in closing recourse to state courts in a 1998 statute that was intended to limit what some in Congress saw as frivolous lawsuits, or whether it left a gaping loophole. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan ruled last year that such lawsuits could proceed. It said that Congress had not closed the state route for those who held stocks, but did not buy or sell them, while the reported fraud was under way. Merrill Lynch, supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission, asked the court to overturn that decision.
 A decision against Merrill would not mean that it had to pay any damages, merely that the lawsuits accusing the firm of fraud could proceed to trial, unless they were settled first. But it could open the door in the future to lawsuits from people who did not trade securities but who nonetheless felt they had been damaged.
 Advocates on both sides foresee a dismal future if the court rules against them.
 A ruling overturning the appeals court decision ''will foreclose most avenues of redress for many investors, particularly older persons, who tend to hold their investments for long-term appreciation,'' warned a brief filed by AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons. ''These investors may sustain losses due to a scheme to defraud that could have a significant impact on their retirement savings, yet are too small to justify the expense of an individual lawsuit.''
 From the opposite side, the United States Chamber of Commerce warned that ''under the Second Circuit's approach, holder suits will impose significant costs on defendants through fishing-expedition discovery and interruption of business, and will pose the danger of enormous liability.'' The chamber said that even meritless lawsuits would lead to large settlements, adding, ''The only winners in this system of blackmail suits and windfall settlements will be the lawyers.''
 The issue arose because Congress, in 1995, acted at the request of business to clamp limits on class-action suits in securities cases. It imposed a higher standard of evidence needed to get a lawsuit to the discovery process, where evidence can be sought. That led to many class-action suits moving to state courts. In 1998, Congress passed legislation aimed at pre-empting those cases by forcing them into federal court, where the 1995 act's rules would prevail.
 The relevant federal securities law covers frauds ''in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.'' Historically, plaintiffs sought to expand that definition, hoping to get cases into federal court, and defendants sought to restrict it. Now the roles are reversed. 
 The Second Circuit opinion was based in large part on a victory for defendants in a 1975 case involving a company named Blue Chip Stamps.
 In that case, a group of people was entitled to buy shares in a reorganized company before a public offering, but did not do so. They later argued that they had been defrauded by an overly negative prospectus issued by Blue Chip. The high court held that they could not sue because they had not bought or sold securities, and therefore had no standing under the securities law, even if the prospectus had been fraudulent.
 The Second Circuit concluded that the 1998 law, in pre-empting state lawsuits in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, did not pre-empt state suits brought by those who merely held, but did not trade, shares as a result of the research. 
 The S.E.C., in its brief, argues that the appeals court erred in not understanding that while the Blue Chip plaintiffs lacked standing to sue because they neither bought nor sold, the claimed Blue Chip fraud itself was clearly connected to the purchase or sale of securities and so was covered by the securities law.
 The Merrill fraud, if there was one, caused stocks to trade at excessive prices, the commission said. ''The misrepresentations were plainly made 'in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,' '' regardless of whether the plaintiffs did buy or sell. Therefore, the commission argued, federal law applied and state lawsuits were barred by the 1998 law.
 Quoting a Third Circuit opinion that reached the opposite conclusion on the law, the S.E.C. argued, ''It would be more than a little strange'' if the Blue Chip decision ''to block private litigation by nontraders became the opening by which that very litigation could be pursued under state law.''
 Since the issue is whether the suits, one filed in Minnesota and the other in Oklahoma, should be dismissed before trial, for purposes of the appeal the courts assume that the fraud took place. That is, of course, disputed by Merrill, and it is possible the suits would eventually fail even if they were permitted to proceed.
 The plaintiffs argue that the issue is in part a matter of states' rights. ''For more than a century,'' assert the lawyers for the Oklahoma plaintiffs, ''investors have brought claims under state law when a defendant's unlawful acts or omissions induced them to hold securities.'' They argued that ''Congress expressed no intent to extinguish an entire class of investors' claims.''
 As a practical matter, as the S.E.C. notes, the suits contend the prices of certain stocks were fraudulently inflated by Merrill's research, and that those who held the stocks should have been able to benefit from that fraud by selling at the inflated prices. It says no one has the right to benefit from a fraud.
 If the Supreme Court were to uphold the Second Circuit opinion, Congress could rewrite the law to clearly exclude such suits. But that presumably would not halt lawsuits filed before the new law took effect.
 And those lawsuits could be vast. The Second Circuit opinion appears to open the courts to those who say they held rather than bought shares while the price was inflated by the fraud. There is a large, but limited, number of those who held the stock. 
 But could it also be argued that some other investor might have sold the stocks short, but for the research, and profited when the prices later fell? There is virtually no limit on the number of people who could claim they might have done that.

HEADLINE: U.S. Halts Egypt Trade Talks After Jailing of Opposition Figure

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has halted negotiations with Egypt over a trade agreement to protest the Egyptian government's harsh imprisonment of a leading political dissident, Egyptian and American officials said Tuesday. 
 The decision highlighted a growing rift with an important Middle Eastern ally after it held an election for president last September that the United States described as highly flawed.
Egypt had been eager to work out an agreement that would reduce or eliminate tariffs and increase trade between the countries and had been pushing Washington to make a public announcement that formal negotiations were to begin. 
 But late last month an Egyptian court sentenced Ayman Nour to five years of forced labor for election law violations that American officials describe as false charges. Mr. Nour won 7 percent of the vote in the multiparty election, Egypt's first for president, placing second to Hosni Mubarak, the longtime ruler. 
 As a result, early this month, Washington told Cairo that this would ''not be an appropriate time'' to announce negotiations, a senior American official said. 
 ''They said it would be put on hold,'' said Nabil Fahmy, the Egyptian ambassador here.
 For several months, Egyptian and American officials have been in preliminary discussions. In October, Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, told Congress that the administration was considering negotiating trade agreements with Egypt and three other Middle Eastern countries. 
 After that, an Egyptian official said, the administration promised that the beginning of fast-track, official negotiations would be announced this month with the goal of completing them by summer.
 But the senior administration official said while the trade agreement ''remains on the agenda, we are looking at it as part of our overall relationship, and issues of democracy are not unrelated.'' He declined to be quoted by name, citing government rules. 
 Vice President Dick Cheney was in Cairo on Tuesday, meeting with President Mubarak, and the Egyptian government said the subject of trade talks had come up. No details were made public. Separately, Egyptian authorities denied a request by Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican, to meet with Mr. Nour, Reuters reported. The congressman was informed Tuesday that the visit would not be allowed. 
 Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, asked about the issue at a briefing on Tuesday, said that ''we have been working with them in the area of trade,'' but added that the administration was also talking to Cairo ''about our serious concerns regarding the recent elections.''
 During parliamentary elections in November and December, security forces opened fire on Egyptians while other attackers wielding machetes, knives and axes intimidated voters. 
 Mr. McCormack added, ''We believe that these things are interlocked: democratic reforms, good governance going hand in hand with the expansion of economic opportunities and the expansion of trade.''
 Egyptian officials portrayed the decision as a result of concern about public perception. They declined to be quoted by name, saying they did not want to inflame the debate. 
 The senior American official said in response that ''after the violent, flawed elections'' and then Mr. Nour's imprisonment, ''it is time to take a pause.''

HEADLINE: 2002 Memo Doubted Uranium Sale Claim

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
A high-level intelligence assessment by the Bush administration concluded in early 2002 that the sale of uranium from Niger to Iraq was ''unlikely'' because of a host of economic, diplomatic and logistical obstacles, according to a secret memo that was recently declassified by the State Department. 
 Among other problems that made such a sale improbable, the assessment by the State Department's intelligence analysts concluded, was that it would have required Niger to send ''25 hard-to-conceal 10-ton tractor-trailers'' filled with uranium across 1,000 miles and at least one international border. 
The analysts' doubts were registered nearly a year before President Bush, in what became known as the infamous ''16 words'' in his 2003 State of the Union address, said that Saddam Hussein had sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. 
 The White House later acknowledged that the charge, which played a part in the decision to invade Iraq in the belief that Baghdad was reconstituting its nuclear program, relied on faulty intelligence and should not have been included in the speech. Two months ago, Italian intelligence officials concluded that a set of documents at the center of the supposed Iraq-Niger link had been forged by an occasional Italian spy.
 A handful of news reports, along with the Robb-Silberman report last year on intelligence failures in Iraq, have previously made reference to the early doubts expressed by the State Department's bureau of intelligence and research in 2002 concerning the reliability of the Iraq-Niger uranium link. 
 But the intelligence assessment itself -- including the analysts' full arguments in raising wide-ranging doubts about the credence of the uranium claim -- was only recently declassified as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that has sought access to government documents on terrorism and intelligence matters. The group, which received a copy of the 2002 memo among several hundred pages of other documents, provided a copy of the memo to The New York Times. 
 The White House declined to discuss details of the declassified memo, saying the Niger question had already been explored at length since the president's State of the Union address.
 ''This matter was examined fully by the bipartisan Silberman-Robb commission, and the president acted on their broad recommendations to reform our intelligence apparatus,'' said Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
 The public release of the State Department assessment, with some sections blacked out, adds another level of detail to an episode that was central not only to the debate over the invasion of Iraq, but also in the perjury indictment of I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 In early 2002, the Central Intelligence Agency sent the former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV to Niger to investigate possible attempts to sell uranium to Iraq. The next year, after Mr. Wilson became a vocal critic of the Bush administration's Iraqi intelligence, the identity of his wife, Valerie Wilson, a C.I.A. officer who suggested him for the Niger trip, was made public. The investigation into the leak led to criminal charges in October against Mr. Libby, who is accused of misleading investigators and a grand jury. 
 The review by the State Department's intelligence bureau was one of a number of reviews undertaken in early 2002 at the State Department in response to secret intelligence pointing to the possibility that Iraq was seeking to buy yellowcake, a processed uranium ore, from Niger to reconstitute its nuclear program. 
 A four-star general, Carlton W. Fulford Jr., was also sent to Niger to investigate the claims of a uranium purchase. He, too, came away with doubts about the reliability of the report and believed Niger's yellowcake supply to be secure. But the State Department's review, which looked at the political, economic and logistical factors in such a purchase, seems to have produced wider-ranging doubts than other reviews about the likelihood that Niger would try to sell uranium to Baghdad.
 The review concluded that Niger was ''probably not planning to sell uranium to Iraq,'' in part because France controlled the uranium industry in the country and could block such a sale. It also cast doubt on an intelligence report indicating that Niger's president, Mamadou Tandja, might have negotiated a sales agreement with Iraq in 2000. Mr. Tandja and his government were reluctant to do anything to endanger their foreign aid from the United States and other allies, the review concluded. The State Department review also cast doubt on the logistics of Niger being able to deliver 500 tons of uranium even if the sale were attempted. ''Moving such a quantity secretly over such a distance would be very difficult, particularly because the French would be indisposed to approve or cloak this arrangement,'' the review said.
 Chris Farrell, the director of investigations at Judicial Watch and a former military intelligence officer, said he found the State Department's analysis to be ''a very strong, well-thought-out argument that looks at the whole playing field in Niger, and it makes a compelling case for why the uranium sale was so unlikely.''
 The memo, dated March 4, 2002, was distributed at senior levels by the office of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and by the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
 A Bush administration official, who requested anonymity because the issue involved partly classified documents, would not say whether President Bush had seen the State Department's memo before his State of the Union address on Jan. 28, 2003. 
 But the official added: ''The White House is not an intelligence-gathering operation. The president based his remarks in the State of the Union address on the intelligence that was presented to him by the intelligence community and cleared by the intelligence community. The president has said the intelligence was wrong, and we have reorganized our intelligence agencies so we can do better in the future.''
 Mr. Wilson said in an interview that he did not remember ever seeing the memo but that its analysis should raise further questions about why the White House remained convinced for so long that Iraq was trying to buy uranium in Africa.
 ''All the people understood that there was documentary evidence'' suggesting that the intelligence about the sale was faulty, he said.

HEADLINE: Higher Valuation of Stock Causes Tension at United

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The 10 million shares that 400 United executives are expected to divide up when the airline comes out of bankruptcy next month could be worth about $480 million, significantly more than an earlier estimate of $150 million.
 For Glenn F. Tilton, chief executive of United's parent, the UAL Corporation, the sharply higher value could mean a stock package of more than $40 million instead of about $15 million.
The $480 million valuation -- based on recent trading in unsecured debt of United, which converts into common stock when the company exits bankruptcy -- is expected to be the most rancorous issue at a hearing Wednesday in Federal Bankruptcy Court. 
 The actual amount that the 400 executives will eventually receive will depend upon the share prices over the next four years as the stock vests.
 Union officials have sharply criticized the allocation, even at the lower estimates, because their members have made roughly $4 billion in annual compensation concessions.
 ''Executives have richly rewarded themselves,'' Greg Davidowitch, president of the Association of Flight Attendants at United, said. ''In medieval times, people guilty of this kind of greed would have been boiled in oil.''
 United defended the plan as reasonable and customary for a company emerging from bankruptcy. It reduced the amount last week to 10 million shares, or 8 percent of the company, after creditors objected to the initial proposal of 18.75 million shares, or 15 percent. 
 A United spokeswoman, Jean Medina, said the plan would help retain talented people. She added, ''The value of these grants is theoretical.''
 Indeed, the stock awards would vest over four years and the price of United shares can be expected to be volatile. According to the court filings, 20 percent of the grants will vest after six months, another 20 percent after one year and 20 percent in each of the following three years.
 As United prepares to exit bankruptcy, about $28 billion in unsecured claims held by workers, businesses and the federal agency that took over United pension plans will be converted into 125 million shares of common stock, including the shares that go to management. 
 Trading in those claims is a way, before the bankruptcy exit, to invest in United stock. The airline earlier estimated, based on the expected overall value of the company, that the claims would be worth 4 to 8 cents on the dollar. 
 But with the industry on the mend, investors have been willing to pay more. Last week, on behalf of about 2,000 United pilots, Athena Advisory Group auctioned unsecured claims with a face value of $720 million, receiving slightly more than 24 cents on the dollar, said Stephen Presser, a senior partner at Athena and the financial adviser for the pilots.
 That is up from about 11 cents on smaller sales by creditors other than pilots about six to eight weeks ago, Mr. Presser said. 
 ''We're happy with that result,'' he said. ''It probably means the stock is going to trade out of the box pretty robustly.'' Old UAL shares are being canceled and have no value.
 The pilots' claim sale was earlier reported by a Standard & Poor's newsletter, Leveraged Commentary & Data. Mr. Presser said hedge funds interested in owning United shares had been buying the claims. Deutsche Bank bought the claims on behalf of clients. Deutsche Bank would not comment.
 The sale price for the claims translates into about $48 for each of the 125 million new shares to be issued upon exit from bankruptcy. That implies a value of about $6 billion for the company, Michael Linenberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote after the pilots' claims sale. He added that the management stake of 8 percent would be valued at $480 million.
 A United adviser, Rothschild, had estimated the postbankruptcy value of the stock at $319 million to $3.45 billion. 
 Mr. Presser said a senior United pilot could have a claim of as much as $600,000 for lost pension and wages and could have realized in the claims sale close to $150,000 cash.
 About 20 percent of the pilots holding claims chose to sell. The others are holding on, apparently hoping the airline does well enough to send its new shares higher. Other United workers also hold unsecured claims.
 Steve Derebey, 54, a union official who has been a United pilot for 17 years, said he sold his claims. Pilots formerly owned a big stake in United and watched it become worthless. Also, the termination of United pension plans means that Mr. Derebey will receive monthly payments of about $2,200 when he turns 60, mandatory retirement age for airline pilots, instead of the $6,000 he had anticipated, he said.
 ''I have a bad feeling about airline stocks in general,'' Mr. Derebey said. ''I have no interest in it as an investment. I've been burned in the past. This is a lump sum I can put into my retirement account.''
 United has projected a modest profit for 2006, excluding one-time gains related to the bankruptcy, and rising profit each of the next four years. 
 Other airline stocks have rallied in recent months on improved industry conditions, even as high fuel costs and bankruptcies have produced some big losses. But the industry remains highly vulnerable to any economic slowdown, labor battles, another surge in fuel costs or any terrorism event that frightens travelers.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's New Governor

 BODY:
Jon Corzine wanted to become New Jersey's governor so much that he nudged aside a popular incumbent, gave up his seat in the United States Senate and spent $38 million campaigning for the job. It will all be justified if he is able to muscle through the changes needed to pull New Jersey out of its current political and fiscal funk. His inaugural address on Tuesday struck most of the right themes, but it gave no clue as to whether Governor Corzine has the will and the ability to make the hard choices he has been ducking up to now. 
 For all practical purposes, the state is broke. While many states are posting budget surpluses for the year, New Jersey has a shortfall of nearly $6 billion. Mr. Corzine's success as a chief executive on Wall Street notwithstanding, that is a lot of gap to close. His inaugural address covered some of the hardest tasks ahead: reforming a corrupt political culture, restoring public trust in government and producing honestly balanced budgets without the gimmickry of recent years.
No one expected Mr. Corzine to come up with controversial specifics on his inauguration day, and he certainly mentioned ''tough choices.'' But a speech that promises better transportation, fully financed state pensions, school construction, health care for children and affordable housing without mentioning any new source of revenue except a general promise to make the state economy grow isn't exactly a harbinger of steely resolve. He called for a constitutional convention to reform the current tax system, which has given New Jersey the highest property taxes in the nation. But in the current fiscal mess, it's irresponsible to promise an increase in property tax rebates.
 Mr. Corzine has endorsed the idea of an elected state comptroller to help keep government honest, and that would be a good start toward dismantling corruption. But he could have promised in his speech to cut off the political bosses and power brokers -- including those who helped elect him -- who have yet to meet a self-serving deal they couldn't love. His inaugural address could have been a declaration of independence, and that would have brought voters to their feet.

HEADLINE: Stirred by Flashy Entrepreneur, Tokyo Market Hits Panic Mode

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; G. Thomas Sims, in Hong Kong; Martin Fackler in Seoul, South Korea; and Jenny Anderson in New York contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Takafumi Horie, an Internet entrepreneur in Japan, has captured attention with his unconventional American-style approach to business. 
 Zipping around Tokyo in a silver-blue Ferrari with his bikini-model girlfriend, Mr. Horie was often on television quiz and talk shows, and enjoyed thumbing his nose at Japan's business elite. [Page C1.]
But this week, the flamboyant Mr. Horie was in the spotlight for a more somber reason: An investigation of his business, the Livedoor Company, on suspicion of securities fraud had helped to kindle a near panic in Japan as investors withdrew billions of dollars from the Tokyo stock market in the last two days.
 In an attempt to calm the frightened investors, a parade of government officials, including Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, offered reassurances that economic fundamentals were in order. The chief government secretary, Shinzo Abe said, ''It is desirable that stock prices firmly reflect economic fundamentals and move in a stable manner.'' 
 The tactic appeared to work on Thursday. With the market rebounding, buyers came in, seeking to scoop up stocks they saw as undervalued. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks was up about 350 points, or about 2.3 percent, by late afternoon. 
 Trading was extraordinarily heavy and was close to being suspended by late Thursday in order to avoid overloading its computers, which happened Wednesday when the market closed 20 minutes early. 
 The frantic quality of the last several days took on a grim aspect when an executive of a securities firm suspected of involvement in corporate takeover deals by Livedoor was found dead on the southern island of Okinawa, apparently having committed suicide, the police, quoted by the Kyodo news agency, said. 
 The executive was identified as Hideaki Noguchi, 38, a vice president of HS Securities, one of the companies raided by prosecutors this week in connection with the investigation.
 Analysts watched the market closely Thursday, afraid that the earlier tumult could return and threaten the Nikkei, which soared more than 40 percent last year, and perhaps undercut the nation's fragile economic recovery after years of stagnation. 
 In a blow to the nation's pride, the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed early on Wednesday because an old computer system failed to keep up with the rush of trading orders. The exchange operated on a shortened schedule on Thursday, and was nearing the trading limit -- four million transactions -- that would trigger an early close.
 On Wednesday, markets around the world fell, ending down 1.2 percent in Frankfurt and 0.6 percent in London. In New York, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index market slipped 0.39 percent. 
 The development that set off ''Livedoor shock,'' as the Japanese news and entertainment media call it, occurred on Tuesday, after prosecutors marched into the home and the office of Mr. Horie, who has endeared himself to admirers with a boyish pudgy face and spiked hair, but has enraged Japan's financial establishment with his aggressive tactics. The raid was carried live on the evening news.
 Senior Japanese officials sought to minimize any potential impact on the recovering economy, as well as embarrassment to a country trying to regain leadership in critical fields of advanced technology.
 James Fiorillo, an American who advises the Japan Natural Selection Fund, one of many foreign funds that heavily expanded its investments in this country last year, commented: ''This thing has taken on greed, panic and fear. Banks and trading companies are getting hammered, and their businesses are doing well in this economy.''
 In the meantime, Japanese regulators widened their investigation into Mr. Horie and Livedoor. The company is reportedly being investigated for violating Japan's security laws by spreading false information. According to Japanese newspaper reports Thursday, prosecutors are also investigating whether Livedoor's parent company falsified figures for financial statements in 2004 to make an $8.7 million loss look like a $12.2 million gain. 
 Livedoor issued a statement just before trading started on Thursday morning, saying its own investigation had found no problems in two areas thought to be under investigation, an affiliate's takeover of a publisher and its stock split.
 In the last two years, Mr. Horie has made headline news with a success story that has turned him into the Bill Gates of Japan. He seemed to revel in tweaking the country's clannish business elite, whom he once dismissed as a ''club of old men.'' 
 He especially raised hackles by attempting a hostile takeover of a radio network and by trying to buy a baseball team. Hostile takeovers are rare in Japan. Though the radio network, the object of a bid last spring, was small, it was an affiliate of the Fuji Television Network, the country's largest private broadcaster. Both attempts failed. But they did not seem to dent his ability to make money from his conglomerate comprising a popular Internet portal and about 40 related ventures.
 Mr. Horie has built Livedoor into one of Japan's most heavily trafficked sites, offering everything from free e-mail, travel reservations, consumer financing, lists of used cars for sale and even a blog he wrote. In five years, Livedoor's stock value soared 150 times, to $6.34 billion at the beginning of the week. 
 Livedoor shares did not trade on Wednesday or Thursday. Still it shares were marked down Wednesday by the daily 100-yen limit, to 496 yen. At that price, more than $1.8 billion of the company's market value was wiped out.
 ''We need more updated information and better disclosure,'' Taizo Nishimuro, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said of Livedoor.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Nishimuro raised the possibility of delisting Livedoor. 
 Mr. Horie's casual style and bold business practices have alienated many old hands in this country. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, said this week, ''Since listing his company in 2000, Horie has been accruing a reputation as an eccentric, aloha-shirted president who dodges questions from analysts.''
 By some accounts a geek version of Donald Trump, Mr. Horie wrote an ode to greed, titled, ''Earning Money Is Everything: From Zero to 10 Billion Yen, My Way.'' 
 While he ruffled some, he enchanted many small investors, who accounted for half the trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange last year. That enchantment snapped on Wednesday. Investors put in a vast number of trade orders stretching Tokyo's computer-based market. Part of that high volume was a result of Internet trading, a popular pursuit enabled by one of Mr. Horie's companies.
 Compounding investor anxiety, exchange officials announced in advance on Wednesday that the order volume was expected to reach the system's capacity of 4.5 million trades a day, forcing an early close. After normally instantaneous trades started to take five minutes and more, exchange officials closed the market 20 minutes before the normal 3 p.m. closing time. 
 ''The recent spike in orders is extraordinary,'' Mr. Nishimuro said. As long as these extremely high volumes last, he said, Tokyo's trading day will be cut by 30 minutes. 
 Last week, the exchange increased the market's order capacity by 20 percent, to nine million orders a day. On Jan. 30, trading capacity is to increase by 11 percent, to five million trades a day. On Wednesday, when the market closed 20 minutes early, the exchange had recorded 4.38 million trades and 7.3 million orders. 
 Belying Japan's high-tech, clockwork image, the exchange lost almost an entire day of trading in November because of a computer breakdown. In December, computers stymied a brokerage firm's attempt to reverse a botched trade, an error that led to $350 million in losses and brought down the president of the exchange, Takuo Tsurushima, who resigned to take responsibility. 
 To settle investors before Thursday's trading began, government officials made comments timed for the Wednesday evening television news. ''I think it's of a temporary nature as economic conditions are solid over all,'' Prime Minister Koizumi said. 
 Kaoru Yosano, the financial services minister, reassured investors at a news conference: ''We do not fear a chain reaction.''
 Hours earlier, the alarm over Livedoor had spread to other Internet stocks. Yahoo Japan fell by almost 10 percent. Softbank fell by 13 percent, both near their maximum allowable price movement.
 ''Our fund managers think that the next couple of days will be choppy,'' Alexander M. Prout, president of Invesco in Japan, said after trading ended Wednesday. Mr. Prout, who said he managed $5.3 billion in Japanese equities, blamed ''media hysteria'' for the turmoil.
 ''Anytime there is a quick run-up in the marketplace, there is that breathing pause,'' he said, referring to the Tokyo market's recent surge. ''But because there is nothing fundamentally wrong, when the lull settles you will see buying opportunities.''
 Wall Street traders said Wednesday that there was little noticeable concern in New York over the shutdown of the Japanese market, which came on top of a sell-off over disappointing results from American technology companies. They noted that the Tokyo exchange has a limited capacity to handle orders and that Livedoor has a large number of small individual investors and many of them were trying to sell shares. Some traders saw the two-day drop in Tokyo as a buying opportunity.
 But many feared that they might be hearing the popping of a miniature Internet bubble. 
 ''If Livedoor did not disclose correct data for their financial statement, that is big, sort of a similar situation to Enron,'' Nobuo Sayama, a business professor at Hitotsubashi University, said after the market closed Wednesday.
 Referring to the Internet companies that have clustered in a new Tokyo hotel and office tower, he predicted: ''This event is a start of big problem that will expand to other Roppongi Hills companies. They will be attacked later on.''
 But Mr. Sayama, like the Americans interviewed, said he believed that Japan's economic fundamentals were sound.
 Some analysts said Tuesday and Wednesday would eventually be seen as a speed bump on the way to the Nikkei breaking 20,000, a level substantially below its high of 38,915 in December 1989.

HEADLINE: Shaving With Five Blades When Maybe Two Will Do

BYLINE: By NICK BURNS

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, razors with multiple blades were a joke. The first broadcast of ''Saturday Night Live'' included a mock commercial for the ''Triple Track,'' a three-bladed razor, featuring the slogan: ''Because you'll believe anything.''
 But that was 30 years ago. Three-blade razors are now as common as contoured toothbrushes and deodorant body spray. Schick's four-blade Quattro has been selling well for more than two years. And with Gillette preparing to begin selling its five-blade Fusion next month, razor manufacturers seem to be trying for the last laugh. 
Still, men who are about to witness the multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for Fusion may wonder: Is the fifth blade really a sharp turn in shaving technology? Or is blade inflation only a marketing gimmick?
 Some are already skeptical. ''I would run and hide if it's anything like my experience with the three-blade,'' said Richard Stapler, 31, a political aide in Sacramento, Calif. He has used the double-blade Gillette Trac II for 10 years, and said that when he tested the company's three-blade Mach 3 Turbo a few years ago, he was not impressed. 
 ''It felt like a cheese grater,'' Mr. Stapler said. ''I had terrible razor burn, discomfort and pimples. I swore off trying anything new.''
 Some dermatologists say the five-blade design smacks of overkill, because more blades mean more friction, and friction irritates the skin. ''When you add more blades, there's a greater chance of nicks and razor burn,'' said Dr. Ezra Kest, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills. ''I always tell my patients not to use more than two blades.''
 But some early testers of the new razor say they like it. And given how many consumers have come to accept three-blade razors -- Gillette's M3Power is the No. 1 selling razor in the United States, according to Information Resources Inc., a market research firm, and the Quattro is No. 2 -- it may turn out that for some men five blades is not too many.
 Selling the new razor will mean persuading men to spend $9.99 on the model; $1.50 more than the Quattro and $2 more than the Mach 3 and the two-bladed Gillette Sensor Excel. A four-pack of replacement cartridges will cost $12 to $13.
 For the Fusion Power, a battery-operated model that vibrates -- to ''improve the shaving experience,'' said Michele Szynal, a Gillette spokeswoman -- customers will be charged $11.99, and $13 to $14 for four new cartridges.
 (Exactly how vibration improves the shaving experience is in question. Last May a federal judge in Connecticut, acting on a lawsuit brought by Schick, issued an injunction prohibiting Gillette from claiming that the vibration feature of its M3Power lifts hair ''up and away from skin'' to allow for a better shave. The judge ruled there was not enough scientific evidence to prove the claim.) 
 The idea behind the five blades is what Ms. Szynal calls the ''hysteresis effect,'' which is a razor maker's way of saying that the blades work in concert to pull whiskers out from the skin as they slice into them. 
 ''The second and subsequent blades engage the hair further down the hair shaft,'' Ms. Szynal said, so that each passing blade cuts closer than the one before. By the time the fifth blade comes along, she said, ''the hair is actually cut a little below the skin's surface.'' Ms. Szynal acknowledged the common wisdom that more blades mean more irritation but said the new razor has features that minimize that problem. For one thing, she said, the distance between the blades is 30 percent narrower than the Mach 3, so that the blades flatten the skin before slicing the hair. Also, the blades are coated in a Teflon-like polymer that reduces friction. And a rubberlike ''flexible comfort guard'' in front of the blades is meant to help smooth the skin during shaving.
 Thanks in part to the comfort guard, the Fusion's cartridge is larger than those on any other men's razors. That may make the razor difficult to maneuver, Dr. Kest said. ''Anything more than two blades is like trying to drive a big rig truck,'' he said. ''It's a control issue. It's difficult to use larger razors under the nose and chin.''
 But Harry Trantham, a project manager for a magazine publishing company in New York City who tried the Fusion at a reporter's request, found reason to praise the many blades.
 A 36-year-old with a thick, black beard, Mr. Trantham has enthusiastically kept up with blade inflation, recently switching from the Mach 3 to the Quattro in order to get longest-lasting possible shave. He found that after shaving with the Fusion, his 5 o'clock shadow did not show up until hours past 5 o'clock. And he experienced no irritation.
 ''It was unbelievable how close of a shave I experienced,'' he said.
 Mr. Trantham's only problem was the cost. 
 ''It's about 20 percent more than I'm paying now, and I go through cartridges about every five shaves,'' he said. ''I don't know if the benefits will outweigh the cost.''

HEADLINE: The New Spinners: Yarn Is the Least of It 

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
THERESE CRUZ is a newcomer to the ancient art of spinning, and she is hooked. She began learning to spin last June, already has two imported wooden spinning wheels and is getting ready to buy an even nicer one.
 ''It saves me from being addicted to anything else,'' Ms. Cruz, 51, said with a laugh as she pressed her bare feet, one after the other, against wooden pedals and steadily fed puffs of colorful fleece into her turning wheel.
She and a dozen other avid spinners had gathered at a fiber workshop in Alexandria, Va., in early January to celebrate St. Distaff's Day, the ancient English holiday when household chores resumed after the 12 days of Christmas. The spinners had come with their own wheels, from large wooden machines to small Indian charkhas, and were diligently producing yarn thick and thin, colorful and plain, wool and silk.
 Spinning, these days often associated with quaint demonstrations by costumed ladies at historic sites like Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia, is moving into the mainstream. From knitters who want to take a step back and create their own yarn to those who simply want to be soothed by spinning's repetitive rhythms, more people are taking it up. 
 Unlike their colonial counterparts, whose clothing often depended on what was spun at home, many of today's spinners are not concerned about turning their handiwork into fabric. Nor are they claiming to follow in the footsteps of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who spun every day to persuade Indian villagers to renounce imported textiles and resume making their own cloth.
 Many spinners say they have no intention of making anything at all. They churn out skeins of wool, cotton or more exotic fibers like alpaca or camel, and pile up skeins, in their varied colors and textures, for display. Or they give them away to friends and relatives. It is the calming, rhythmic and even meditative effects of spinning that have won many people over.
 ''It is like taking a trip,'' Ms. Cruz said. ''It is so tranquilizing to do this at the end of a day.''
 Randy Scheessele, 43, who sat beside Ms. Cruz at the gathering, held at the Springwater Fiber Workshop, was making yarn on a drop spindle, an early spinning method that relies on a dowel topped by a hook, a piece of wood or even a CD. ''When you come home after a day's work,'' said Mr. Scheessele, an economist at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, ''spinning helps you wind down.''
 Rain Klepper, a chiropractor and naturopath in Paonia, Colo., who works with cancer patients, said of spinning, ''It's what I call 'pleasure cruising.' '' She is so enthusiastic that she now raises her own sheep. ''We can all go to Wal-Mart and buy a sweater,'' Ms. Klepper, 47, said. ''I'm not spinning because I need clothes.''
 Many people believe that rhythmic activities help reduce stress and soothe people. ''Activities like spinning are meditative,'' explained Dr. James S. Gordon, a professor of psychiatry and family medicine at Georgetown University. ''You get absorbed in the rhythm, and it is that rhythm and repetitiveness that is relaxing because all the thoughts that crowd the mind can be put aside and the mind is in a neutral state.''
 ''It is like taking a little vacation from the way our mind works,'' added Dr. Gordon, who founded the Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington to aid trauma victims. 
 No one officially tracks the number of spinners, who like weavers and knitters, are not organized. Some, however, connect through Internet spinning sites. Spin-Off, a magazine devoted to spinning, had a 46 percent increase in newsstand sales in the past four years, its publisher reported, and spinning wheel manufacturers have recorded a steady uptick in sales.
 ''In the past year we have really seen a lift in interest in spinning,'' said Marilyn Murphy, president of Interweave Press, which publishes Spin-Off. ''Our subscriber numbers are up.'' Ms. Murphy said that over the last three years revenue had grown by about 75 percent, not only from the magazine but from sales of how-to books, especially combination titles, pairings of, say, spinning and knitting, or spinning and dyeing.
 Sales of Interweave's spinning book for beginners, ''Hands On Spinning'' by Lee Raven, have increased by 15 percent in the past five years, she said. In 2000 the quarterly Spin-Off estimated there were 100,000 hand spinners in the United States. 
 The revival of knitting, said Amy Clarke Moore, the editor of Spin-Off, which is based in Loveland, Colo., has gone hand in hand with spinning as people have become intrigued by luxury and unusual fibers like angora, linen, cotton, cashmere, silk and alpaca. 
 ''We have people who read the magazine who don't do anything more with what they've spun,'' Ms. Moore said. ''They do it because it is very relaxing to end the day by sitting at their wheel, and they mostly spin for the sake of spinning.''
 Spinning's under-the-radar growth can be found in the details. For example Ms. Cruz, a senior program assistant at the World Bank who lives in Cabin John, Md., said she had to check Web sites vigilantly last year to find an opening in a beginner's class. 
 She was introduced to spinning last year at the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, a sprawling two-day gathering each May that draws 60,000 people to watch sheep-shearing and herding, to buy bags of fleece and yarn and to choose among hundreds of spinning wheels of every shape, size and price.
 ''I knew right away I had to learn,'' Ms. Cruz recalled.
 While fiber arts like spinning were once viewed as hopelessly old-fashioned, they are attracting younger people like Lisa Neel, 26. At a friend's urging, Ms. Neel started spinning in 2001 while a senior at Yale, astounding her mother, a lawyer in Oklahoma whose idea of Ivy League-educated daughters did not encompass traditional arts like spinning.
 Ms. Neel began using a drop spindle, then lucked into a secondhand wheel made by Norman Hall of Oxford, N.Y. Wheels vary in price, but some of the most exquisite are made by craftsmen like Mr. Hall out of woods like cherry and maple. They can cost as much as $5,000. Simpler wheels made out of polyvinyl chloride cost a few hundred dollars.
 Now working in McLean, Va., as a project manager at Native American Management Services, which provides services to Indian groups, Ms. Neel spins to relax and gives most of her considerable output to her twin sister, Lara, a photographer in South Dakota who is an expert knitter. Even so, in 2002 Ms. Neel spent about 100 hours spinning yarn for a friend's wedding chuppa.
 When she began spinning four years ago, Ms. Neel said, she felt isolated. But she now frequently taps into blogs to connect with other spinners, who she said are often people with technical backgrounds like nurses and laboratory technicians.
 She also cruises the Web to find different types of fleece for her projects. ''There were few vendors when I started spinning,'' she said, ''but there are many more now and it is much easier to find specialized items on the Web.''
 Part of the fun is tracking down small sheep farmers like Maureen A. Kane of Barneswallow Farm in Dewittville, N.Y., who breeds Lincoln Crossbred sheep for their shiny, soft and strong fleece, which she sells at festivals.
 ''I've noticed a lot more interest recently, especially in the last four or five years,'' Mrs. Kane said. ''A lot of it is word of mouth.'' 
 Some who follow spinning say its attraction is part of the nesting trend that followed 9/11 or a second wave of the 1960's back-to-the-earth movement.
 Spinning, Ms. Klepper said, ties its practitioners to long-ago times. She felt those ties deeply after she took up the craft and began raising Icelandic sheep, introduced to Iceland by Vikings in the Middle Ages.
 ''There is something about reaching back through centuries of time,'' Ms. Klepper said. ''Knowing that, for example, the Vikings spun fleece from Icelandic sheep for the sail and rope. Of course they used that to go out and pillage.''

HEADLINE: Everybody Stops In For Everything

BYLINE: By Alex Kuczynski

 BODY:
KETCHUM, Idaho, is a rare, strange small town. Home to the Sun Valley ski resort, Ketchum is populated by two types of people: the rich and the not-rich.
 In the first category are the super-stratospherically wealthy, who own ranches and huge houses and no longer even associate with people who fly commercial; the Hollywood stars, who may be famous but truth be told are generally pretty poor compared to the previous group; and the plain vanilla well-to-do, who own a condo for family ski vacations.
 Then there are the nonrich. These are the middle- and lower-income people who cook meals, knead shoulders, sell real estate, design jewelry, teach yoga and provide ski equipment. The rich and nonrich in Ketchum are not separated by vast discrepancies in looks, talent, education, family provenance or intelligence. Just money.
 Because of Ketchum's Manichean economy, it enjoys the best of both worlds. It remains a classic small town with a couple of stoplights and all the charms of semirural America -- you don't lock your doors at night, and if you can remember four sequential numbers, you can call anyone in town -- yet it also enjoys the powers of wealth and curatorial prerogatives. 
 The wealthy who own homes in and near Ketchum would never, for example, allow a Costco on their streets. There is one in Twin Falls, two sludgy hours away. And there will never be a Wal-Mart -- or a Kmart, Sears or Target -- in Ketchum. While mass retailers have emptied out the centers of small towns across the American West, this will not happen here. It's just not picturesque.
 Which is why the physical, cultural heart of Ketchum, Idaho, is the local drugstore, Chateau Drug. It is the anchor of Giacobbi Square, the closest thing Ketchum will get to a shopping mall. The ''square,'' actually a complex of several stores, is dominated by Chateau, Atkinson's grocery store and Jane's Paper Place. 
 Chateau Drug is a misnomer: it does sells cough syrup and has an excellent pharmacy, but the store also sells hardware, panini presses, lip gloss, fishing lures, mobile phones, bathing suits, coffee makers, tile grout, greeting cards in both English and Spanish (''!Acuerdate bien, hermano, hay cosas mas importantes en tu cumpleanos que los regales!'') portable barbecues, books, organic dog shampoo, silver jewelry, luggage, nursing pads and rifle ammunition. 
 Chateau is the crossroads of Ketchum; you will see anyone you need to see if you stop in once a day, as most people do. There are no nicer people anywhere in the world than those behind the pharmacy counter and working the sales aisles.
 People in town still talk about the lengthy paean to Chateau that a famous Movie Star delivered at a 2003 dinner to raise money for the Wood River Valley Y.M.C.A. (The Movie Star owns a house in the area.)
 I called the Y and got a tape of the dinner. ''I am totally addicted to Chateau Drugs,'' the Movie Star announced. He wore an untucked plaid shirt and scruffy jeans; his hair was uncombed. This is about as dressed up as anyone gets in Ketchum. ''I try to pull myself away,'' he continued. ''I've been in Fiji, Moscow, London, Paris, Rome, Berlin, and I'll wake up thinking I need something between baby shoes and barbecues, and I have to get to Chateau Drug as soon as possible.''
 I ONCE saw the Movie Star in Chateau. I immediately set down my basket and marched over to say hello. After all, I had met him once before, in Los Angeles on Barry Diller's lawn. It had been a very meaningful 20 seconds. Wouldn't he like to know me better? I bet he'd like to invite me over to dinner. I bet he'd like to be my new best friend!
 Barreling forward, I spotted my quarry. The Movie Star was standing in front of the deodorant section, in a rumpled black ski suit, puzzling in the way that any other shopper would (Musk? Citrus? Long-lasting?) His outfit was saggy and stretched out in the back, as a ski suit would get after a day of damp, snowy exertion. And it was one of those old-fashioned, one-piece ski suits with the belt around the middle. Staring at the Movie Star shopping for deodorant in his unchic ski suit, I realized what it would be like to live in a world where every moron believes he or she has the right to engage you in conversation as you decide what unguent to roll on your armpits.
 Rather than be a bother, I did what any good journalist would do. Sure, some people call it stalking. I call it observing.
 I followed the Movie Star around Chateau. He paused and chatted with other shoppers. He called a salesman in the hardware section by name, and they discussed wrenches. It was one of those touching but ultimately really pathetic conversations between men in which they say one thing (''I like the 12- or 15-inch headset wrench, but you can just as well go for the adjustable spud wrench'') but mean another (''I wish my dad had taken me to more baseball games as a child instead of spending all those Sunday afternoons with my mother's best friend'').
 The Movie Star put a protein bar in his basket. An older man stopped him to deliver a monologue about how much he had liked the Star's most recent movie, but what he, personally speaking, if you asked his opinion, would have done differently in the movie. If I were the Star, I would have told the guy to go to film school and call me in 10, no make that 20, years, by which point the man would with any luck be long deceased, but the Star nodded and listened as patiently as a second-grade teacher, then shook the man's hand and thanked him for the helpful advice.
 The Movie Star got to the counter and waited in line. No one else bothered him. He took his items out of his basket and addressed the checkout girl by her first name. She didn't bat an eye.
 This is what makes Ketchum such a marvelous place. There are some ski towns where every $2 starlet in fur boots and a fake tan shows up for the camera. In Ketchum the celebrities cruise Chateau to try to regain some sense of what the real world is like by wandering among the wrenches and the meat thermometers, the tile grout and diaper cream.

HEADLINE: The Comic Strip as a Fashion Statement 

BYLINE: By Julie Bosman

 BODY:
THE sportswear company Perry Ellis has long employed the traditional formula for men's fashion advertising: take one handsome man, photograph him posing in an exquisite setting, and repeat.
 But now Perry Ellis has decided to replace its leading man (most recently, the actor Jerry O'Connell; before him, the actor Paul Rudd) with something less predictable: a comic strip.
The new campaign features a male character in a series of settings that emulate real life, from pondering a job offer in a new city to approaching an attractive woman in a bar. (Naturally, the star of the comic strip is trim, good-looking and dressed in what appears to be Perry Ellis.) The ads are scheduled to run as four-page inserts beginning in the March issues of more than a dozen magazines, including GQ, Cargo and Esquire. 
 Using comics in advertising is an old strategy that may be on the verge of a revival, thanks in part to the rising popularity of graphic novels among young men. Even Hollywood has caught on in recent years, adapting the graphic novels ''Sin City'' and ''A History of Violence'' to commercially successful films. And the customer Perry Ellis aims for is typically a 30-something man the company hopes will be drawn to the playfulness of a comic strip with the grown-up content of a graphic novel.
 ''Our guys are right on the fringe of Gen X, and they've grown up with this type of thing right in front of them,'' said Neil Powell, the chief creative officer for Margeotes Fertitta Powell in New York, which created the campaign. ''And we were also looking to create an ad campaign that was a form of entertainment.''
 The $15 million campaign is the most visible effort for the agency since last summer's merger of Margeotes Fertitta & Partners with Powell. It is also the first major fashion account for an agency that is known mostly for its creativity in other areas, including work for Bacardi, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. (Margeotes Fertitta Powell's parent company is MDC Partners, the same holding company that owns part of Crispin Porter & Bogusky and Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, two agencies known for their quirky creative work.)
 In addition to running in magazines and on billboards, the comics will eventually appear in a nontraditional place: imprinted on escalator handrails in about 20 shopping malls in major cities nationwide. 
 Pablo de Echevarria, the senior vice president for marketing at Perry Ellis International, said that while the company had created three installments of the comics so far, it hoped that the strategy would be effective enough in the long term to continue the series.
 ''It can become our own language,'' Mr. de Echevarria said. ''But when you do something, however groundbreaking it might be, the consumer becomes inured to it. One of the problems with originality is that you have to keep being original.''
 Comic strips in advertising peaked in popularity in the 1930's and 1940's, catering largely to people whose grasp of English was poor, but could follow the actions of comic strip characters. More recently, comics have appeared in campaigns to promote less-wholesome products (R. J. Reynolds once tried to lure away Marlboro smokers to Camels with comic-striplike ads, and the Miller Brewing Company ran a short-lived ad campaign for Miller Lite in men's magazines).
 But in today's advertising climate, most marketers are condensing their messages to match the shortening attention spans of readers. Perry Ellis is asking readers to do the opposite: linger over a comic strip to absorb the message and even follow the continuing series in several monthly installments.
 ''We're challenging several conventions about fashion advertising and communications in general,'' said Michael Kantrow, the president and chief executive at Margeotes Fertitta Powell. ''It's hard to get people to pay the same attention to advertising that they do to content, but we're hoping that this will blur the line there.''
 Later this spring, the comic strip ''Dilbert'' is to appear in a direct-mail advertising campaign for the Postal Service. Scott Adams, the creator of ''Dilbert,'' said in an e-mail message that comics can be effective for advertising a service that has no obvious physical form.
 ''The comic makes visual some aspect of each service so people can get their brains around it,'' Mr. Adams said. ''And if they laugh, that's a good association too.''
 ''Comics are a good match for products that are not inherently fascinating,'' he added. ''Men's pants look pretty much alike to me.''

HEADLINE: Sliding Technology Shares Pull Major Indexes Lower 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks suffered their first two-day drop of the year yesterday as disappointing earnings from Intel and Yahoo caused a slide in technology shares.
 ''A lot of people were swept up in the excitement of this year, but expectations were far too high,'' said Andrew Abrams, a money manager at Abrams Investment Partners and an executive director of Avian Securities in New York. Mr. Abrams owns shares of Intel.
The Nasdaq index, which gets almost half of its value from technology companies, dropped 23.05 points, or 1 percent, to 2279.64. Apple Computer and eBay fell in advance of earnings reports after the close that produced further disappointments. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,277.93 for its first two-day drop since Dec. 30. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 41.46 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,854.86.
 Overseas, the Nikkei 225-stock average in Japan slid 2.9 percent, its biggest retreat since April, bringing its loss over three days to 5.7 percent. A surge in orders overloaded computer systems on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which halted trading. Stocks in Europe had their biggest drop since October.
 Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips, dropped $2.92, to $22.60, and was the heaviest drag on the Dow average and the S.& P. 500. Intel said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter profit was 40 cents a share on sales of $10.2 billion, below expectations.
 Yahoo, the most-visited Internet site, tumbled $4.93, or 12 percent, to $35.18 for the worst performance in the S.& P. 500. The company said fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, was 16 cents a share, below estimates. 
 The impact of the announcements from Intel and Yahoo was limited by government reports yesterday that suggested inflation was in check, reinforcing optimism that the Federal Reserve may soon halt its series of interest rate increases.
 Apple, the maker of the iPod music player, dropped $2.22, or 2.6 percent, to $82.49, then fell another $2.84 to 79.65 in extended trading. Profit this quarter, excluding some costs, is forecast to be 42 cents a share on sales of about $4.3 billion. Apple was expected to report earnings of 48 cents on sales of $4.63 billion, according to the average of analysts in a Thomson survey. 
 EBay, the world's largest online auctioneer, fell 97 cents to $44.44, then dropped another $1.29 to $43.15 in after-hours trading. The company forecast 2006 earnings, excluding items, might be as low as 96 cents a share. The average analyst estimate from Thomson was $1.02. 
 Google declined after Standard & Poor's cut it to sell from hold. The shares dropped $22.20, or 4.8 percent, to $444.91, the steepest retreat since Nov. 16, 2004.
 Not all technology shares declined. I.B.M. added $1.46, to close at $84.46. I.B.M. said fourth-quarter profit, excluding a $267 million restructuring expense, was $2.11 a share, beating the $1.94 expected by analysts in a Thomson survey.
 A gauge of oil and gas stocks slid 1.3 percent as crude prices retreated from a three-month high. Crude oil for February delivery fell 0.9 percent, to $65.73 a barrel, in New York on speculation that a government report will show that United States distillate fuel and gasoline inventories surged last week. February contracts touched $66.93 during the day, the highest since Sept. 30.
 Exxon Mobil slid 45 cents, to $61.09. Exxon said it expected global gasoline and diesel production to expand faster than demand over the next five years, squeezing refining profits, which set records last year. Sunoco, the largest oil refiner in the Northeast, fell 84 cents, to $88.22.
 McDonald's added 7 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $34.66. Bill Ackman, a hedge fund investor in McDonald's, called for it to form a new company out of the restaurants it owns and sell 20 percent of that entity's stock to the public.
 Treasury securities were either slightly lower or unchanged yesterday. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, to 101 10/32. The yield was unchanged at 4.33 percent. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.692
High Rate: 3.950
Coupon Yield: 4.017
Low Rate: 3.890

HEADLINE: Little Saigon Exports Its Prosperity

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
Three decades ago immigrants from Vietnam started coming in sizable numbers to the United States, fleeing the rule of the Communist government after the Vietnam War. 
 The newcomers arrived with little money or possessions, but they have built a beehive of commerce bridging two cities in Orange County, Calif. -- Westminster and Garden Grove. The two cities are home today to more than 150,000 Vietnamese-Americans and more than 5,000 Vietnamese-owned businesses.
 Yet, there was no Vietnamese-owned bank in the community -- known today as Little Saigon -- until last year. The banking needs of the immigrant companies were served by major institutions, like the Bank of America and Wells Fargo, or by Chinese and Korean banks. 
 But now, two new banks with investors and owners from the Vietnamese community have opened, indicating the rising prosperity of Vietnamese businesses in America and growing economic connections with a vibrant entrepreneurial sector back in Vietnam. 
 First Vietnamese American Bank raised more than $11 million in capital and opened in May. ''We can provide leadership to this community,'' said Hieu T. Nguyen, the bank's president.
 ''When Vietnamese businesspeople come to this bank, they can deal with the bank president personally. They can come home,'' said Mr. Nguyen, who has worked for banks in California and Asia since immigrating to the United States in 1980. 
 More than pride is at stake for ethnic groups in having banks of their own, said John J. Kennedy, president of the other new institution, Saigon National Bank, which opened in November. ''When the local people put money in a bank like this, they know that it understands their community and its opportunities,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''Its loans and activities, in turn, help to further the community's economy.''
 Mr. Kennedy, who has 31 years leading small banks in California and other states, was hired to get Saigon National going by its founding investors, led by Kiem D. Nguyen, owner of one of the largest supermarkets in Little Saigon, as well as fertilizer and plastics businesses in Vietnam. 
 The new banks answer a need for California's Vietnamese population, which numbers close to half a million people -- 55 percent of America's total. An estimated $8 billion a year in cash remittances and trade in goods and services flow between ethnic Vietnamese in America and relatives and business partners in Vietnam. Sending cash to relatives through informal transfer agencies can be expensive for the families and a source of concern for bank regulators worried about irregularities. That is one reason state and federal authorities welcomed the new banks.
 ''At the very least, we can handle those money transfers more efficiently and at a lower cost to the families,'' said Walter L. Hannen Sr., a director of the First Vietnamese American Bank. 
 Also, there is plenty of business to do. The economy of Vietnam, a country of 83.5 million people, has been growing at 7 percent to 8 percent a year for almost a decade. A bilateral trade agreement with the United States in 2001 has helped accelerate that expansion, according to George A. Baker, who opened a bank branch 13 months ago in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, the city formerly known as Saigon, for Far East National Bank, a Los Angeles institution that is owned by a Taiwan banking company.
 ''Few people realize that Vietnam is one of the world's largest exporters of coffee and rice and that it has special capabilities in garments and high-tech components,'' Mr. Baker said.
 For example, Jocelyn Tran, who worked in the fashion industry in Southern California for 20 years, now runs a subsidiary of Limited Brands in her native Vietnam and ships more than 200 million garments a year to the company's chains, which include Victoria's Secret, Limited and Henri Bendel stores. ''China does large mass-merchandise orders, but for hand-beading and intricate needlework, Vietnamese workers' skills give us a good niche,'' Ms. Tran said. 
 Vietnamese immigrants also found work in Silicon Valley in the 1980's and '90s and now are employing their expertise in the both the old country and the new. Thinh N. Nguyen, for example, founded Pyramid Development Software in 2001 after working for 20 years for start-ups in California. The firm has its headquarters and a small marketing staff in Milpitas, Calif., about 45 miles south of San Francisco, but 60 engineers in Ho Chi Minh City do software support for American companies including Novellus Systems and Motorola. 
 Similarly, Nguyen Huu Le, who worked for 22 years in research and development for Nortel Networks, is today chairman of TMA Solutions, a company in Ho Chi Minh City that does software engineering for clients like Lucent Technologies, Nortel and NTT-Data of Japan. ''Vietnam today is the most optimistic country in Asia for 2006,'' Mr. Le said, citing a CNN poll. 
 American entrepreneurs, too, see a lot of potential. Rick Bakanoff, of Capitola, Calif., on Monterey Bay about 25 miles west of San Jose, Calif., has built the Machinery Corporation of America over three decades by buying up cannery equipment, refurbishing it and selling it to the food processing industry in Thailand. Now Mr. Bakanoff is expanding operations in Vietnam. ''It could be big in fruit and vegetable processing, if its small farmers formed cooperatives to combine crops and feed a processing plant,'' Mr. Bakanoff said of Vietnam. 
 Walter Blocker, formerly of Louisville, Ky., has lived in Ho Chi Minh City for 12 years, representing global consumer product companies, including L'Oreal and Walt Disney. His company, the Gannon Group, has built a beverage processing plant and now is organizing the construction of an electric power plant. ''Industry is growing here, and the greatest need is for electricity, roads and airports,'' Mr. Blocker said. 
 Vietnam's economic progress is cheered these days in California. To be sure, the bitterness of immigrants who fled the aftermath of the war in the mid-1970's has not entirely faded; one still sees Vietnam Republic flags -- three red stripes on a yellow field -- waving in some front yards in Orange County. But business beckons. 
 ''I want our bank to serve all the Vietnamese communities in America and one day serve business in Vietnam, as well,'' Mr. Nguyen of First Vietnamese American Bank said.
 One of the bank's major clients supports the idea. ''It is great that we have First Vietnamese Bank for our community,'' said Paul Nguyen, owner of the Pacific Machinery Company, an airplane parts supplier, in Garden Grove. 
 The success of Pacific Machinery speaks loudly of the spirit that enabled once-penniless immigrants from Vietnam to build prosperous communities in America -- and undoubtedly is helping other Vietnamese to build entrepreneurial companies in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam today. 
 A former first lieutenant in South Vietnam's army who was educated in the United States, Mr. Nguyen was imprisoned in Vietnam for 10 years when North Vietnam won control of the South. He said he returned to America in 1985 at age 37. 
 While working in machine shops, Mr. Nguyen taught himself computer-aided design and manufacturing. In 1992, he opened his company and qualified as a minority contractor, supplying parts to Boeing. ''I work hard, 12, 13 hours a day,'' Mr. Nguyen said. Today, he owns three buildings and a company employing 70 people, with annual revenue of $10 million, supplying Northrop Grumman and Raytheon as well as Boeing. 
 Mr. Nguyen, now 58, said he was ready for the next phase. ''I am going to invest $5 million to buy a larger plant and machinery so I can supply Boeing's new planes,'' Mr. Nguyen said. Raising capital is no obstacle, he said. ''I can raise $5 million,'' he said. ''Bankers are happy to lend to me. The people from Boeing say, 'Paul, you are the American dream.' I say 'thank you, America.' ''

HEADLINE: Weighing the True Costs and Benefits in a Matter of Life and Death

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the co-author, with Ben S. Bernanke, of ''Principles of Economics.'' E-mail: rhf3@cornell.edu

 BODY:
''DO the poor deserve life support?'' asks the economist Steven E. Landsburg in an article published under that title in Slate this month (www.slate.com/id/2133518/?nav=fo). The subtitle says: ''A woman who couldn't pay her bills is unplugged from her ventilator and dies. Is this wrong?'' Mr. Landsburg invokes ''economic considerations'' to suggest that the answer is ''no.'' 
 Many commentators have attacked his argument as morally preposterous. Well, yes. But it is also economically preposterous. The two judgments are related. But before an attempt at explaining why, here are some details of the case, from the Slate article and the Dallas-Fort Worth television station WFAA: 
The patient was Tirhas Habtegiris, a 27-year-old legal immigrant being kept alive by a ventilator as she lay dying of cancer last month in the Baylor Regional Medical Center in Plano, Tex. Physicians offered no prospect for her recovery. She was hoping, however, to hang on until her East African mother could reach her bedside.
 Ms. Habtegiris had little money and no health insurance. On Dec. 1, hospital authorities notified her brother that unless another hospital could be found to treat his sister, Baylor would be forced to discontinue care after 10 days. But even with Baylor's assistance, the family was unable to find a willing hospital. True to its word, Baylor disconnected her ventilator on Dec. 12, invoking a law signed in 1999 by George W. Bush, then governor of Texas. The law relieved doctors of an obligation to provide life-sustaining treatment 10 days after having provided formal notice that such treatment was found to be medically ''inappropriate.'' 
 Unlike the comatose Terri Schiavo, Ms. Habtegiris was fully conscious and responsive when she was disconnected, according to her brother. She wanted to continue breathing. Her brother and several other family members have described the agonizing spectacle of her death by suffocation over the next 16 minutes. Her mother never got there. (Baylor officials have said their decision had nothing to do with financial considerations.) 
 In Baylor's defense, Mr. Landsburg argues that Ms. Habtegiris's treatment would have failed the economist's basic cost-benefit test, which says that an action should be taken only if its benefit exceeds its cost. The cost of care is relatively easy to calculate, but measuring its benefit is more difficult, and it is here that Mr. Landsburg stumbles.
 In general, economists measure the benefit of an action as what its beneficiaries would be willing to pay to see it taken. To place a rough upper bound on the benefit of supporting Ms. Habtegiris, Mr. Landsburg asks us to imagine that before her illness, she had been given a choice between free ventilator insurance and $75 in cash (his illustrative estimate of the cost of providing a healthy young person with such insurance). He assumes, plausibly, that she would have chosen the cash. The implication, he believes, is that the benefit of extending Ms. Habtegiris's care must be less than its cost. 
 He is mistaken for multiple reasons. For one thing, he ignores the economically compelling reasons for having social safety nets in the first place. Even those who are not poor recognize that catastrophe is only one unlucky break away. One might lose one's job and be unable to afford health insurance, for example, or be stranded by a mountain blizzard and unable to afford a helicopter rescue. With such prospects in mind, most people favor collectively financed rescue efforts. That a poor person would not, or could not, buy private insurance against such contingencies is entirely beside the point.
 Even more troubling, Mr. Landsburg completely ignores moral emotions like sympathy and empathy. As economists since Adam Smith have recognized, economic judgments are often tempered by these emotions. The upshot is that large numbers of people benefit when a patient in imminent mortal danger receives treatment. Had the opportunity presented itself, many would have eagerly contributed to Ms. Habtegiris's care. But organizing an endless series of individual private fund-raisers for such cases is impractical. So, we empower government to step in when the need arises. 
 Mr. Landsburg's argument finesses the important distinction between a ''statistical life'' and an ''identified life.'' The concepts were introduced by the economist Thomas C. Schelling, who observed the apparent paradox that communities often spend millions of dollars to save the life of a known victim -- someone trapped in a mine, for example -- yet are often unwilling to spend even $200,000 on a highway guardrail that would save an average of one life each year.
 This disparity is not economically irrational, Mr. Schelling insisted, because the community values what it is buying so differently in the two cases. It is one thing to risk one's own life in an unlikely automobile accident, but quite another to abandon a known victim in distress. 
 By offering a transparently unsound economic argument in defense of the Habtegiris decision, Mr. Landsburg unwittingly empowers those who wrongly insist that costs and benefits have no legitimate role in policy decisions about health and safety. Reducing the small risks we face every day is expensive. The same money could be spent instead on other pressing needs. We cannot think intelligently about these decisions without weighing the relevant costs and benefits.
 But using cost-benefit analysis does not make one a moral monster. In the wealthiest nation on earth, a genuine cost-benefit test would never dictate unplugging a fully conscious, responsive patient from life support against her objections. Mr. Landsburg's argument to the contrary is wrongheaded, not just morally, but also economically.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Declined in December 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index fell unexpectedly in December as energy prices dropped for the third consecutive month, the Labor Department reported yesterday, easing worries about sharply higher inflation last fall.
 Another report, released by the Federal Reserve, said that the economy expanded at a moderate pace in the last several weeks of the year, with employment and retail sales broadly higher and prices, except for energy, up modestly.
In December, gasoline, electricity and natural gas fell, causing the Consumer Price Index to decline by 0.1 percent for the month, the Labor Department said. Excluding the food and energy sectors, however, the index's core rate rose 0.2 percent for a third month, in line with analysts' expectations. 
 Energy prices fell 2.2 percent in December and warmer weather and better-than-expected supplies of natural gas so far this year should keep heating costs in check, though they will still be higher than last winter, analysts said.
 ''Frankly, the risk of a major pickup seems to have faded lately,'' James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS, the investment bank, said about the overall inflation rate. ''We haven't gotten more action from energy prices.''
 Over all, the Consumer Price Index was up 3.4 percent in 2005, the highest since 2000, largely reflecting an increase in energy prices even before hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast in late summer. The core rate was up 2.2 percent, the same as in 2004.
 For consumers, 2005 was a year of price increases. Energy prices were up 17.1 percent for the year and transportation, which is heavily influenced by energy, was up 4.8 percent for the year. The price for medical care, a persistent source of worry for Americans and their employers, jumped 4.3 percent last year. Rents climbed 3.1 percent and the cost of sleeping in a hotel room rose 3.5 percent.
 Those cost increases wiped away the gains that many Americans saw in their paychecks. Average weekly wages in manufacturing and nonsupervisory jobs, which were up 3.1 percent in 2005 in nominal dollar terms, fell by 0.4 percent when adjusted for inflation, the Labor Department said in another report.
 But consumers could buy more clothes, cars and computers for their dollars last year, as prices for those goods fell.
 While the December consumer prices report puts to rest the worries about sharply higher inflation that flared up in the months immediately after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted energy supplies, they do not completely eliminate concerns for the coming year.
 Economists said policy makers at the Federal Reserve would view the increase in nonenergy costs with some anxiety, especially if the increases continue at their current pace. ''You are getting to a point where you are quite close to their toleration threshold on inflation,'' said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
 Many investors and analysts expect that the Fed -- which is expected to get a new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to succeed Alan Greenspan on Feb. 1 -- will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate, currently at 4.25 percent, to 4.5 percent or 4.75 percent and then stop. But Mr. Greenlaw and other economists said a continuation of 0.2 percent increases in monthly core prices, which when annualized amount to an inflation rate of about 2.4 percent, could prompt the Fed to raise rates above current expectations.
 The Federal Reserve will consult its beige book, the survey released yesterday that painted a broadly positive picture of the economy, when its interest-rate setting committee meets again on Jan. 31. On inflation, the survey characterized wage increases as moderate and raw material price increases as ''less intense at year-end than earlier.'' 
 The Fed also observed that most of the nation was experiencing a slowdown in housing, though sales and construction activity in Texas, parts of the Midwest and on the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast was ''brisk.'' Holiday retail sales were described as higher than last year and manufacturing was experiencing a ''robust expansion,'' the survey said.

HEADLINE: A Need for Wind Power

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 John Tierney (''Not in the Kennedys' Backyard,'' column, Jan. 17) is wrong about the economic merits of wind power and other renewables. 
 Shrinking supply and rising demand for imported oil translate into higher costs. 
 The United States economy is already suffering from the effects of recent increases in gas prices, and fully one-quarter of the United States trade deficit is associated with oil imports.
 The proposed Cape Wind project would produce enough electricity to meet nearly 75 percent of the electricity demand on Cape Cod and nearby islands. 
 It would replace up to 113 million gallons of oil per year and save New England more than $800 million in energy costs over the next two decades. 
 What's more, it would create up to 1,000 new jobs and be a crucial springboard for renewable-energy development in America.

HEADLINE: Local Groups Sue to Halt Big Project In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
In the first legal test for the largest real estate project in Brooklyn history, a coalition of community groups filed suit yesterday against a state agency, charging that it wrongfully approved the demolition of six buildings on the site of the proposed Atlantic Yards development. 
 While the immediate purpose of the lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan against the Empire State Development Corporation, is to stop the demolition, plaintiffs said it was also intended as a broader challenge to the agency's environmental review of the project. The review is still under way, and opponents say it has been overtly friendly to the developer. 
Forest City Ratner Companies, the developer, and the opponents have been locked in a two-year struggle over the 9.1 million square-foot residential and arena complex. 
 The lawsuit also seeks the disqualification of the agency's outside lawyer, David Paget, because he previously represented Forest City Ratner. The plaintiffs -- 11 community groups and a variety of individuals -- are also seeking to block the Empire State Development Corporation from issuing a final environmental impact statement until an independent lawyer has reviewed it for potential conflicts of interest. 
 ''The rubber-stamping of this request for demolition has pointed up the fact that E.S.D.C. is not an impartial reviewing agency, but is in league with Forest City Ratner to push this project through,'' said Candace Carponter, a spokeswoman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, one of the groups in the lawsuit. ''We want to let the E.S.D.C. know that they're going to be held accountable and that we will be watching for any missteps in the future.'' 
 A spokeswoman for the state development agency, Deborah Wetzel, said it had not received legal papers, but added: ''We intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. Beyond that, it is our policy not to comment on pending litigation.'' 
 The lawsuit comes one month after Forest City Ratner officials announced that it planned to destroy six buildings on the site, saying an engineer hired by the company declared the buildings to be so dilapidated that they were a threat to public safety.
 Opponents of the project have said that engineer's report overstated the deterioration of the buildings. Razing them, they argued, was meant to give the Atlantic Yards project momentum and to bolster Forest City Ratner's claim that the site meets the state standard for ''blighted,'' which would make it possible for the developer to force reluctant residents to sell their property. 
 City Councilwoman Letitia James, whose district includes the site and who is an outspoken opponent, asked the company to allow her to inspect the buildings with a different engineer. At first, Forest City Ratner officials agreed to the inspection, but said later that Ms. James could not bring an engineer. 
 State law forbids developers to alter the site of any proposed project until it has been approved, but the law makes an exception for ''emergency actions.'' According to the lawsuit, the Empire State Development Corporation, in consultation with Mr. Paget, declared that the buildings qualified for emergency demolition without independently examining them. The suit also says that the agency did not consider alternative measures of ensuring public safety.
 In a statement, Bruce Bender, an executive vice president of Forest City Ratner, defended its initial engineering report and said the lawsuit amounted to ''delay tactics.'' 
 ''While the opponents have another agenda,'' Mr. Bender said, the developer ''will not play games with the public safety and is proceeding as any responsible property owner should and must.'' 
 The project is in the midst of an environmental review and must go through extensive review before it can be approved by state agencies. Forest City Ratner is a development partner for the new Midtown office tower being built for The New York Times.
 Philip Weinberg, a professor at St. John's University and an expert on the state's environmental review law, said the lawsuit faced ''an uphill battle'' in trying to get Mr. Paget disqualified. ''There's nothing in the law or the regulations saying they can't have the same counsel,'' he said.
 In general, he said, courts have tended to defer to public agencies on questions of fact, which might include whether the buildings are unsafe enough to warrant demolition. Still, Mr. Weinberg added, the agency ''is supposed to play it down the middle,'' and ''courts are supposed to step in if it doesn't pass the smell test.''
 During the 1980's, he noted, a federal court blocked the Westway highway project in Manhattan after finding that an environmental review by the Army Corps of Engineers failed to document the project's likely effect on striped bass in the Hudson River.

HEADLINE: Big Earners Gain More In Budget Plan

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki said this week that his budget proposal would bring relief across the economic spectrum, with a multibillion-dollar tax cut plan that ''unleashes opportunity by further reducing the tax burden on our working families and job-creating businesses.'' 
 But the fine print shows that 24 percent of his personal income tax cuts, credits and rebates would go to New Yorkers who earn $200,000 or more, while more than half would go to the roughly 10 percent of New Yorkers who earn more than $100,000. 
Republicans nevertheless stressed that there were enough tax cuts to go around, with savings that could amount to several hundred dollars or more for taxpayers with incomes in the five figures. 
 Democrats, however, criticized the governor for a plan they said disproportionately favored the rich, and their focus was mostly on two proposed tax revisions outside of Mr. Pataki's slate of income tax measures. One was the elimination of the state's portion of the estate tax, now levied on estates worth more than $1 million. The other was the governor's proposal to cancel a planned year-round sales-tax break for clothing purchases of less than $110, a form of tax relief felt most by the poor. 
 ''There's a class-warfare element to it,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said the governor's package would ''provide the greatest benefit to those New Yorkers who need it the least.''
 In a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Pataki responded to such criticism by saying that the cuts were ''targeted very fairly.'' At the same time, he and his top aides made it clear that their plan reflected classic supply-side economic theory, the idea that cutting taxes on the wealthy and businesses promotes economic expansion. They also said the state placed an increasingly heavy tax burden on the likes of Donald Trump and his peer group, and also has an estate tax that chases the super-rich out of the state. 
 ''New York's tax base is a little scary -- four-tenths of one percent of our taxpayers provide us with a third of our income tax,'' said John Cape, the governor's budget director, in an interview on Wednesday. ''You can't afford to have the Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers move to Arizona, because our tax base is so narrowly focused on this razor-slice of people who pay so much of our taxes.''
 Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat who represents many of the state's wealthiest citizens, argues that the increasing tax burden on the rich is largely a sign of how the gap between classes is increasing and a reflection of federal tax policy shifting the burden away from the well-off. 
 ''The rich are dramatically richer and the poor are that much poorer,'' she said.
 How many of Mr. Pataki's proposals survive the Legislature remains to be seen, especially considering that the financial burden of the cuts would fall after Mr. Pataki leaves office. That would leave the next governor, and the Legislature, to make up for deficits projected to be nearly $4 billion in the fiscal year ending in March 2009, stemming largely from $3.3 billion in proposed tax cuts that year. 
 The proposals range far and wide, from rebate checks of $400 on homeowners' property taxes in school districts that promise to limit spending, a likely disqualification for New York City, and a $500 tax credit for parents with incomes below $90,000 in districts with underperforming schools that could be used for private school tuition, tutoring or after-school programs. 
 There is even a tax credit for people who renovate their historic homes and new credits for buyers of hybrid electric vehicles. A $1.1 billion tax cut package is aimed at both corporations and small businesses.
 Elderly residents with incomes under $75,000 would also get a credit equivalent to 25 percent of their home heating expenses, up to $500 a year. 
 One of the more prominent changes would cut the top income tax rate to 6.75 percent from 6.85 percent. The income level that pays that top rate would also increase to $30,000 from $20,000 for individuals, and to $60,000 from $40,000 for families. 
 Another important change would alter a complex provision of the state tax code, known as the recapture rate, which effectively increases tax rates for people who earn more than $100,000. 
 How does it work? Currently, people making less than that pay less than the 6.85 percent tax rate on their first $20,000 in income if they are single, or $40,000 in the case of married couples filing jointly. 
 But that relief is taken back by the state for the more well off, starting with people who earn more than $100,000 and phasing in fully for people who earn as much as $150,000. In other words, people who earn $150,000 or more essentially would pay the top tax rate on every dollar they earn. The same threshold applies for both single filers and married couples, leading to what is known as a marriage penalty because an unmarried couple with two incomes could face higher tax bills if they were married.
 Mr. Pataki's proposals would increase the floor on the recapture rates to $120,000 and the ceiling to $170,000 for individuals. He also proposes to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty by doubling the threshold for couples, to a range of $240,000 to $340,000.

HEADLINE: Pataki Political Contributions Showing a Downward Turn

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
The flow of contributions to Gov. George E. Pataki's Virginia-based political action committee dwindled sharply in the last quarter of 2005, continuing a trend that began last summer, when New York's governor announced that he would not seek a fourth term. 
 The committee, based in Virginia because it allows larger campaign contributions than New York does, has been a tool for the governor to try to burnish his national reputation as he weighs a run for president. But after contributions totaled $630,475 in the first quarter of the year, they began to fall off in each quarter that followed. An aide to the governor said last spring that Mr. Pataki would be shifting his fund-raising attentions to his federal political action committee.
The latest campaign filings show that from October through the end of the year, the governor's committee, the 21st Century Freedom State PAC, raised $105,938, according to records filed with the Virginia State Board of Elections. During that same period the committee spent nearly $90,000 on ''fund-raising consulting fees,'' the records show, and more than $300,000 over all.
 The downturn came during a quarter when Governor Pataki took several political trips, and held fund-raisers for the committee in California and Chicago.
 Some of those who did contribute to it had interests before New York State. 
 On Dec. 5, the governor's committee reported raising more than $20,000 from nine out-of-state wineries, at a time when many wineries were urging his administration to approve a shipper so they could begin selling wine directly to New Yorkers. The state approved a shipper the following week. An aide to the governor said that he has held fund-raisers with wineries for years, and that the December event was unrelated to the shipping decision.
 The committee reported a $2,500 contribution from Archer Daniels Midland, whose Web site says is the ''largest producer of fuel ethanol in the United States'' and a leader in the area of biodiesel, another alternative fuel. This month the governor called in his State of the State address for making ethanol and biodiesel available at gas stations along the New York State Thruway, and for incentives to produce more ethanol. 
 David M. Catalfamo, a spokesman for the governor, said that the committee was administered in compliance with the law. ''The funds allow the governor to support candidates who share his belief in economic freedom, lower taxes and keeping America safe and secure,'' he said. ''New Yorkers know that any decisions we make are based solely on the merits, sound public policy and what is in the best interest of the state.'' 
 Although the governor campaigned for a number of candidates, and held fund-raisers for some of them, his political action committee made few direct contributions. All told, it gave $10,000 to the Manchester Tax Relief PAC in New Hampshire, home of the first presidential primary, and another $10,000 to the New Jersey Republican Party. 
 The committee spent nearly $100,000 on political consulting fees, including several thousand dollars to a consultant with an address in Iowa, home of the first caucus.

HEADLINE: For Whom Will the Foghorn Blow?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Red Hook could've been a contender, just like Marlon Brando's character in ''On the Waterfront,'' a film that immortalized the bleak, harsh atmosphere of the Brooklyn docks (even if it was filmed in Hoboken).
 With acres of piers for hauling cargo, and sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline, Red Hook should have become a leading industrial port or another charming Brooklyn village like nearby Carroll Gardens.
But a series of government miscalculations -- like cutting the neighborhood off from the rest of Brooklyn with the Gowanus Expressway and the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, and shifts in the waterfront economy to containerized cargo -- left the square-mile peninsula with forlorn blocks pocked by tumbledown houses, unkempt lots and hollow-eyed factories.
 In recent years, however, Red Hook has become a vigorous place again, so much so that it is now a contested ground for apartment developers wanting to cash in on the views, artists and restaurateurs looking for cheap space, factories seeking a haven from gentrification elsewhere and old-line residents wanting to keep the old-time flavor. 
 Red Hook is poised to receive stores like Ikea and Fairway, million-dollar condominiums, humming factories and bustling docks, and even a pier for the 1,132-foot Queen Mary 2 and other cruise ships. Yet, its future is caught up in a battle royal. 
 Developers want to convert waterfront warehouses and factories into apartments, even though the areas are zoned for manufacturing. But factory owners and cargo haulers fear that well-heeled apartment dwellers would not take kindly to their trucks barreling through Red Hook's narrow cobblestone streets or their middle-of-the-night foghorns and bright lights.
 ''You're going to be doing something they don't like, even if it's interfering with a guy barbecuing on the block,'' said Michael DiMarino, owner of Linda Tool and Die Corporation, a precision metal fabricator with clients like NASA and Boeing. ''I don't blame him, but we were here first.''
 Many factions dread the prospect of big-box stores like Ikea, which plans to build a waterfront furniture emporium with 1,500 parking spaces by 2007. Blue-collar businesses fear that Ikea's shoppers would clog Red Hook, stalling their trucks. Homeowners worry that Ikea would shatter the quiet. 
 Yet residents of the housing projects, whose 8,000 tenants represent three-quarters of Red Hook's population, are eager for the 500 jobs Ikea is dangling. Dorothy Shields, 74, the president of the Red Hook Houses East Tenants Association, who has taken a liking to Ikea's Swedish meatballs, supports the store because one of every four of the projects' tenants is unemployed.
 ''It's the jobs,'' she said. ''I have so many people who needs jobs.''
 Artists and craftsmen trickling in from Dumbo and Williamsburg fear any change because they suspect they will end up priced out of another blossoming neighborhood. Madigan Shive, a 29-year-old cellist, moved from San Francisco into a rental house with three other artists. 
 ''There's a good chance we could lose our house in the next year,'' she said. ''If I lose this space, I don't know that I can stay in New York.'' 
 The neighborhood quarrel is embodied in two men, John McGettrick, co-president of the Red Hook Civic Association, and Gregory O'Connell, a former city detective turned millionaire developer and one of Red Hook's largest property owners. 
 Mr. O'Connell, who supports expanding blue-collar businesses, is a ubiquitous figure who uses the paper-strewn dashboard of his pickup as his desk and file cabinet. Mr. McGettrick, whose father slung cargo on the docks but who favors housing, manages an investigations agency. 
 The two antagonists tap into different elements of Red Hook history and are backed by rival civic groups. Mr. McGettrick contends the city hurt Red Hook in 1961 when it zoned as industrial numerous blocks in which frame or brick houses had always been mixed in. Homeowners could not expand and banks would not offer mortgages, and the result, he said, was abandonment and arson. ''There is a desperate need to rebuild the population that was lost,'' Mr. McGettrick said. 
 Mr. O'Connell has revamped Civil War-era warehouses set on waterfront piers but filled them with blue-collar trades like wood and glass workers. Those tenants will be joined this spring by a Fairway, the grocery cornucopia, which is also on Manhattan's West Side and in Harlem.
 Much of the tension has crystallized around a mammoth concrete warehouse at 160 Imlay Street that a Manhattan group bought in 2000 for $7.2 million and for which it received a zoning variance allowing conversion into 144 condominiums. Standing on the windswept sixth floor overlooking the harbor, with the building shrouded in netting, the developer, Bruce Batkin, said: ''We're not here to rape and pillage. We're going to do something beautiful. How can we do something worse?'' 
 But the project, supported by Mr. McGettrick, has been mired by stop-work orders resulting from a two-year-old lawsuit brought by opponents including more than 80 local businesses, as well as Mr. O'Connell. 
 ''Imlay Street could be the tipping point that affects all the zoning in Red Hook,'' Mr. O'Connell said. ''You pay $1 million for an apartment, you don't want to hear trucks loading or unloading early in the morning.'' 
 In court papers, the opponents contend that the city's Board of Standards and Appeals was improperly swayed into believing that the building could not attract industrial tenants. A lawyer described a meeting between a lobbyist for the owners and Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, which the lawyer said resulted in a $100,000 gift to Mr. Doctoroff's favorite cause, NYC2012, the group that bid unsuccessfully for the 2012 Olympics.
 In an interview, Mr. Doctoroff described the claim as ''completely absurd,'' adding: ''I'd isolated myself from the fund-raising effort. I didn't even know there was a contribution.''
 He described Red Hook as the city's ''single most complex land-use issue'' because it has potential in retailing, housing and manufacturing. ''Every conceivable issue is wrapped up in this one community, which makes everything you do there very sensitive and very difficult,'' he said.
 The outlook for industry in Red Hook is no longer bleak. According to Phaedra Thomas, executive director of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, the number of industrial businesses has grown 60 percent since 1991, to 455, and jobs have increased 19 percent, to 5,000. 
 Waterfront activity has also rebounded. The Erie Basin Bargeport was vacant 15 years ago, but it now provides staging for 500 barges used for repairing bridges or shooting off Macy's Fourth of July fireworks. 
 Another pier operator, John Quadrozzi Jr., president of the Gowanus Industrial Park, has taken a 46-acre complex of grain silos and docks and uses it, in part, to unload hundreds of thousands of tons of Chilean salt for de-icing the city's streets. He says he opposes Ikea but is finding it hard to resist offers from megastores that want to move in nearby. ''If I'm a salmon, I can only swim upstream so long,'' he said. ''I get tired.''
 Factory owners also fret when they see the kind of shops new to Red Hook sprouting on the commercial spine of Van Brunt Street: Baked, a SoHo-like bakery; 360, a French restaurant; and LeNell's, a specialty liquor store that sells 100 brands of bourbon.
 Until now, the Bloomberg administration has encouraged residential and commercial development along the waterfront. The city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey gave American Stevedoring Inc., which operates gantry cranes for moving large containers, only a short lease extension on Piers 8, 9 and 10 that expires in April 2007 and removed the company from Pier 6 and 11. Pier 7 is in litigation. 
 But a year ago, the administration, apparently responding to a reaction against rezoning to residential in Dumbo and Long Island City, mapped out 15 ''industrial business zones'' where rezoning would be forbidden. Such a move would protect companies like Linda Tool from speculative landlords who might raise rents and offer only short leases. What is not yet clear is how many factories would be vulnerable in a murky ''ombudsman'' zone, where the city could consider zoning changes for housing. 
 For developers like Joseph Sitt of Thor Equities, who eyes the waterfront ravenously, the problem is that his property is in the industrial zone. Last year, he paid $40 million to acquire the crumbling pier that holds the old Revere sugar plant. 
 He has told city officials that he is considering a residential project that would include a marina. The officials say he may retain Revere's steel funnel silo as a memento of the industrial past. In the coming weeks, Mr. Sitt will lobby the city to pull in the borders of the industrial zone so he can consider other uses. 
 Many old-timers want to see the neighborhood livened up with more apartment dwellers. Sue and Annette Amendola, two of the 10 children of an immigrant longshoreman who hauled bags of coffee on his back, live in the apartment where they were born in the 1940's and do not want the neighborhood moribund any longer.
 Sunny Balzano, 71, a painter whose family has owned a bar on Conover Street since 1890, wants more housing, too, but worries that development that would attract big-box stores would also destroy the neighborhood's singular character. He remembers when the noon whistle blew for lunch and children had to escape the sidewalks because of the stampede of beefy dockworkers trying to grab lunch or a shot of whiskey at one of the 40 bars in the neighborhood. 
 ''In the summer, you can hear the water lapping against the docks and the foghorns and the ships going by,'' he said. ''But if you're going to have thousands of cars, the quality of life is about to change.''

HEADLINE: Council Critic of 3rd President Gets Seat in Jefferson's Shadow

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Councilman Charles Barron has long objected to a life-size statue of Thomas Jefferson prominently displayed in the City Council chamber, saying the founding father was a ''white, slave-owning pedophile.'' 
 So when his assigned seat was moved across the room yesterday, right next to the statue, the point was hardly lost on Mr. Barron, a black Brooklyn Democrat. ''That's my punishment for acting up, practicing democracy,'' he said.
During the last Council meeting, Mr. Barron criticized the new speaker, Christine C. Quinn, for her close relations to county political bosses. He was the only one of the 51 members who did not vote for Ms. Quinn for speaker, choosing to abstain.
 In response, Ms. Quinn did not strip Mr. Barron of his position as chairman of the Higher Education Committee, as many Council members had expected. Instead, she merely moved Mr. Barron next to the statue, widely seen as a more subtle form of retaliation.
 But Ms. Quinn's aides denied that putting Mr. Barron next to the statue had been intentional.
 In her first test as speaker, Ms. Quinn yesterday doled out dozens of committee assignments and leadership roles among her many supporters. The coveted positions carry stipends, ranging from $4,000 to $18,000 for committee chairmanships, in addition to a member's $90,000 salary. 
 Some Council members seemed to have fallen out of favor. Councilman James Sanders Jr. of Queens was removed as chairman of the Economic Development Committee. He has opposed the Queens Democratic Party, which played a crucial role in backing Ms. Quinn for speaker.
 In other reshuffling, Councilman Michael C. Nelson of Brooklyn lost his seat in the first row after supporting a Quinn rival for speaker. Mr. Nelson will now sit in the back row, though he did receive a chairmanship, of the Waterfronts Committee. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 19 about a dispute between Councilman Charles Barron and Christine C. Quinn, the new Council speaker, referred imprecisely to the vote for Ms. Quinn, from which Mr. Barron abstained. Mr. Barron was not in fact the only one of the 51 Council members who did not vote for Ms. Quinn; Councilman Simcha Felder, who says he supports her, was not in the room when the vote was taken.

HEADLINE: Space at Ground Zero, and Better Views

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
NEW vistas have opened at the World Trade Center site.
 The architectural firm Snohetta has radically redesigned what was once to have been the cultural center at ground zero. The new version, occupying about 30 percent of the area of the original, will create an entry plaza at Fulton and Greenwich Streets that will guide visitors to the twin memorial pools beyond, rather than blocking the view from the north and the east.
It will also allow skylights, set in the plaza pavement, to illuminate the underground mezzanine of the PATH terminal and transportation hub designed by Santiago Calatrava. 
 The Snohetta building should be much easier to engineer -- and therefore less expensive -- with its bulk shifted away from a location directly over the column-free PATH mezzanine.
 Absent the Drawing Center and the International Freedom Center museum, which have been removed from the project, the Snohetta building is expected to shrink to about 50,000 or 60,000 square feet from 250,000 square feet. It is to serve as a visitors' center, an orientation center and as a ''center for Sept. 11,'' said John P. Cahill, who oversees downtown redevelopment as Gov. George E. Pataki's chief of staff.
 ''It is a building that will hopefully tell the story about Sept. 11, the uplifting stories of Sept. 11,'' Mr. Cahill said yesterday. ''It will be a place where people can discuss the events of Sept. 11.'' In that way, he said, it will pick up where the underground memorial museum leaves off, by focusing on how New York, the nation and the world responded to and recovered from the attacks.
 Craig Dykers, a founding partner of Snohetta, said the change in program permitted greater flexibility in locating the building on the site.
 ''We've attempted to create an open and welcoming atmosphere that will allow the memorial quadrant to complete itself toward the corner of Fulton and Greenwich Streets,'' Mr. Dykers said, ''but will also allow for new and more open orientation space.'' 
 As originally envisioned, the cultural center would have run about 240 feet along Greenwich Street and 160 feet along Fulton Street, creating a wall between the memorial and the PATH terminal, the performing arts center by Frank Gehry and Tower 2 of the office complex, which is being designed by Norman Foster.
 Now, the Snohetta building will have only 65 feet of frontage on Greenwich Street and none on Fulton Street. It will also be shorter than the original, said Stefan Pryor, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
 Its long axis, perpendicular to Greenwich Street, will align with the angle of Dey Street, with one edge of the PATH terminal and with the north end of the memorial museum entrance building, also being designed by Snohetta. Mr. Dykers said these three buildings would form ''a string of pearls: smaller, pavilionlike structures that filter across from West to Church Street.
 ''They allow the memorial quadrant not only to have an identifiable form but to connect it to the surrounding urban character.'' 
 The newly created open space is one of the first recent design refinements that actually pushes the trade center project a bit closer to the master plan laid out three years ago by Studio Daniel Libeskind, which showed a ''Sept. 11 Place'' at that intersection. Mr. Libeskind said yesterday that he thought the latest Snohetta design was a ''very, very good solution.''
 So did Raphael Samach, a principal in DMJM Design, which is associated with Mr. Calatrava and STV in the PATH terminal project for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ''We're obviously delighted by this,'' Mr. Samach said of the revised Snohetta design. ''It is a very good thing from an urban planning perspective, as well as functionality.''
 State officials and the project architects would not discuss the aesthetics of the new design -- nor provide a rendering -- reserving that for what will undoubtedly be a ceremonial debut in the near future.
 But they agreed to describe the structure in broad outlines after Governor Pataki's announcement last week that he would set aside $80 million for the visitors' and orientation center. That announcement meant either that the building was being redesigned to fit a predetermined budget or that the redesign -- which has been kept under wraps for months -- was in fact far enough advanced to yield a meaningful construction budget.
 Four companies have submitted proposals to serve as construction manager for the memorial and memorial museum, the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation announced this week. They are Bovis Lend Lease, Turner Construction Company and Sciame-Skanska, a joint venture of F. J. Sciame Construction Company and Skanska USA Building. The selection will be made in early February, a foundation spokeswoman said.

HEADLINE: Double Nesters

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
TO Pat and Kevin Fox, the character of home is found in a large window seat, glass-fronted kitchen cabinets, white bedspreads and boxy white night tables in the master bedroom. So that's why all these features appear in their two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights and in their four-bedroom house in Tallahassee, Fla., along with identical bathroom fixtures and nearly duplicate wardrobes in the closets.
 ''We love the fact that as soon as you walk in the door you know you're home,'' said Ms. Fox, 60, who works as a consultant to elementary and high school teachers interested in improving student writing skills. She travels back and forth between the residences at least 10 times a year, and Mr. Fox, 59, a developer with the St. Joe Company in Florida, makes the trip five to eight times a year.
Enabled by cheap airfares, flexible work schedules and technology like cellphones, BlackBerrys and the Internet, a growing number of people are shuttling between two or more homes, blurring the age-old distinction between the primary and the vacation home. 
 Unlike previous generations, these ''splitters'' do not think of themselves as living and working in one place and relaxing in another. On the contrary, they come and go as they please, making friends and doing business in places hundreds, even thousands, of miles apart. 
 ''I don't have a summer house. I don't have a winter house,'' said Lynn Schnitzer, a former interior designer who now splits her time between a loft in SoHo and a condo in Aventura, Fla. ''I just have two all-the-time houses.'' 
 Of course, this new lifestyle is largely open to people who have outgrown the obligations of young families. Many splitters are in their late 50's or early 60's, closer to retirement than to mandatory attendance at P.T.A. meetings. But instead of the traditional snowbird migration, they are electing to travel between their homes throughout the year.
 Part of the reason more people divide their time between homes is that more people own second homes. According to the National Association of Realtors, buyers purchased 2.82 million second homes in 2004, up 16 percent from a year earlier. 
 According to a recent survey of 408 second-home owners commissioned by WCI Communities, a homebuilder, half the splitters visit their second homes at least five times a year, with many visiting more often. Kyle Reinson, a WCI spokesman, said about 30 percent of its buyers were splitting their time between two homes. 
 As a result of this back-and-forth lifestyle, second homes now tend to have more elaborate kitchens, home offices and extra bedrooms. The splitters tend to consider themselves full members of both communities, joining clubs, doing volunteer work and serving on homeowner associations.
 Ms. Schnitzer, 60, serves on the neighborhood relations committee in the Florida building where she and her husband, Arthur, 62, own a three-bedroom condo. Mr. Schnitzer, also retired, is president of the co-op board in Manhattan. 
 But commuting between two homes can also create a sense of rootlessness. The Schnitzers do not keep to any regular schedule, but may spend six weeks in one place, then a long weekend in another, followed by a two-month stint in either place. 
 Because Florida and New York are new to the couple, who for 27 years lived in San Jose, Calif., Ms. Schnitzer said, ''In some respects it's sort of always like I'm visiting and never planted in both places.'' 
 She said that in Florida she is making a big effort to make friends, taking classes in art history and political science. 
 Of course, keeping up two houses means more maintenance costs. In some areas, an underground economy has sprung up to help splitters make the transition from one place to the next, and even the homebuilders are starting to offer services like dog-walking and grocery shopping. ''It can be things as stupid as taking the newspaper in if you don't want to cancel your subscription, to somebody who walks through the house a couple of times a week and flushes the toilets,'' said Peter S. Rummell, chief executive of St. Joe, a Florida homebuilder.
 The increasing popularity of condos in markets like Miami and Las Vegas has also helped fuel the trend, since condos require less upkeep than a single-family house. 
 Some splitters are buying second homes in places where they conduct substantial business, while maintaining another home in a place they prefer. Arthur Pfizenmayer, a retired F.B.I. agent who now runs a business selling Internet kiosks and prepaid cellphones in casinos, owns a town house in Las Vegas, where he spends as much as two weeks of every month. The rest of the time he is in Encinitas, Calif., near San Diego, where he and his wife, Kathryn, own a four-bedroom house with a pool. Ms. Pfizenmayer rarely accompanies him to Las Vegas, he said. ''I'm busy, so she would essentially be there alone,'' he said. 
 But they are starting to split their time between Encinitas and a condo they bought in Chicago a year and a half ago. Although their son is using it while he is in law school, they plan to spend more time there once he moves out.
 The increasingly flexible workplace has helped smudge the lines between primary home and vacation getaway. Toting a laptop and a cellphone, people can keep in touch with the office from the pool or the ski lodge. ''It's become increasingly easy to manage your business affairs and even your lifestyle affairs from more than one location,'' said Ken Dychtwald, co-author of ''The Power Years: A User's Guide to the Rest of Your Life'' (Wiley, 2005). 
 Mr. Dychtwald said that upper-middle-class baby boomers, who make up a significant chunk of second-home buyers, are more likely to work later in life than previous generations, often as freelancers not tethered to a specific location. 
 Some homeowners are even tailoring their work to fit their preferred locations. When Mason Walsh, 70, retired five years ago from his job as a foundation director in Pittsburgh, his wife, Gil, 15 years his junior, was not ready to quit her job as an interior designer with a Pittsburgh-based firm. But Mr. Walsh wanted to move to the couple's vacation home in Jupiter, Fla. So Ms. Walsh asked her bosses if she could help open an office in Palm Beach Gardens, not far from the couple's custom-built home in a gated golf community. 
 The firm agreed, but because Ms. Walsh still meets with clients in Pittsburgh, she alternates, spending two weeks in Florida and two weeks in Pennsylvania. Though her husband has shifted his permanent residence to Florida for tax reasons (he pays no state income tax), Ms. Walsh said she still considers Pennsylvania home, and she retains her full residency status there. ''You were born in one state and it's an emotional decision to leave,'' Ms. Walsh said.
 Sometimes the back-and-forth can lead to mislaid clothing or other items. Ms. Walsh recalled a meeting last year for which she showed up in one navy blue and one black pump, because she had dressed in the dark in Jupiter before flying to Pittsburgh. 
 Paying for all the flights can add up. No discount airlines fly from Pittsburgh to Palm Beach, Ms. Walsh said, so she either has to book far in advance or pay as much as $1,000 for a round-trip ticket. She said that over the course of a year she spends an average of $12,000 on airfare.
 Some splitters become experts at sniffing out discounts, though it often means traveling at inconvenient times. Ben Lloyd, 60, and his girlfriend, Phyllis Johnson, a kindergarten teacher, are dividing their time between her town house in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, and a concrete cottage that Mr. Lloyd bought in Vieques, P.R., for just $90,000 last year.
 For one trip last February, Ms. Johnson found $300 round-trip tickets, but that meant flying out of San Juan at 3 a.m. The gates at the airport were closed before the flight took off, and the only seats in the waiting area were in a McDonald's, so Mr. Lloyd and Ms. Johnson drowsily parked themselves in a couple of wheelchairs. 
 Mr. Lloyd said that such episodes were a ''pain in the neck.'' But the low costs and beautiful landscapes, he said, make the divided lifestyle worth it for now. ''One day you say this is the greatest idea, this is fantastic, it's inexpensive,'' he said. ''And on other days you say it could all implode.''
 Many people who bought vacation homes years ago have added features so they can use them throughout the year. Since Bill and Eileen Larkin bought a summer house in Minerva, N.Y., in the Adirondacks, 12 years ago, they have replaced a spring house whose pipes froze in winter with a well and added electric baseboard heating to the house. Now Mr. Larkin, a retired New York City police officer, tries to go up at least one week a month. Ms. Larkin, who still runs an interior design business near the couple's other home in Palisades, N.Y., accompanies him in the warmer months.
 Mr. Larkin said facetiously that he escaped to the Adirondacks to spend time away from his wife. But Ms. Larkin said she understood, and agreed. The Adirondacks house provides a needed getaway for Mr. Larkin, who had been so invested in his job and now found himself at loose ends. ''I think it's very important when men or women retire that they have some other kind of outlet -- either they volunteer, or have a hobby or another house to get away to,'' she said. ''Thank God for Minerva.''

HEADLINE: North Korean Leader Ends Visit to China

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN; Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, for this article.

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, completed an eight-day visit to China on Wednesday that was notable for his intensive focus on China's booming economy and for the enigmatic air of secrecy that enshrouded his every move.
 Chinese and North Korean state media made nearly simultaneous announcements of Mr. Kim's visit late Wednesday afternoon after more than a week of rampant speculation in regional media about the North Korean leader's itinerary, which both countries repeatedly declined to confirm or deny. 
Both sides called the clandestine trip unofficial but gave no reason why they chose to use that term. China's main national television news detailed Mr. Kim's schedule in China, which it said included separate meetings with President Hu Jintao and all other eight members of the governing Politburo Standing Committee as well as high-profile tours of two Chinese provinces. It had the trappings of an elaborate state visit that would normally involve extensive media coverage.
 The stealthiness may underscore North Korea's insecurity, but it also shows China's determination to coddle its neighbor and perhaps coax it to embrace Chinese-style economic reforms, regional analysts said.
 Beijing is also eager to keep North Korea engaged in multinational talks about its nuclear program, which have proceeded sporadically over more than two years and have yet to achieve a concrete result. Both countries reiterated their commitment to the talks but offered no tangible sign that they would resume soon after a long hiatus. 
 North Korea's state news agency said the two countries ''unanimously agreed to maintain the stand of seeking a negotiated peaceful solution'' to the nuclear issue. Mr. Hu reiterated that the stalled six-nation talks remained the ''correct way'' to solve the nuclear standoff, the New China News Agency said.
 The North Korean agency said Mr. Kim mentioned that the talks faced difficulties. The country has declined to set a date for a new round of talks unless the United States agrees to withdraw financial sanctions imposed over what Washington says is rampant counterfeiting of dollars by North Korea.
 But it quoted Mr. Kim as saying that North Korea ''would join Chinese comrades in efforts to seek a way of overcoming the difficulties lying in the way of the six-party talks.''
 Separately, the top American negotiator in the talks, Christopher R. Hill, made a brief and apparently unscheduled return trip to Beijing on Wednesday at the tail end of a visit to the region, prompting speculation that China arranged a consultation session between him and Kim Kye Gwan, his North Korean counterpart, who was thought to be traveling with Kim Jong Il.
 Mr. Hill declined to confirm or deny that he met North Korean officials shortly before departing Beijing on Wednesday afternoon.
 Some South Korean analysts said the confluence of discussions about the nuclear issue held out hope that the talks would be revived, though few expect them to make much progress soon.
 ''Kim Jong Il knows that he can't get more economic help from China while sticking to his nuclear weapons program,'' said Koh Yu Hwang, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul. ''So he was reaffirming that he intends to give it up when some obstacles are removed.''
 During his extended trip, which began Jan. 10, Mr. Kim visited Hubei Province in central China and Guangdong Province, China's export-oriented economic powerhouse in the south, as well as Beijing.
 Chinese state television showed him touring high-tech factories and the massive Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. Mr. Hu accompanied Mr. Kim to a crop-research institute, where scientists are exploring a hybrid breed of rice and wheat. Mr. Kim fired questions at researchers, though no audio of the exchange was provided.
 Both Chinese and North Korean media said Mr. Kim expressed appreciation for what China has achieved economically. 
 ''The progress made in the southern part of China, which has undergone a rapid change, and the stirring reality of China deeply impressed us,'' Mr. Kim said at a dinner with Mr. Hu, the North Korean news agency said.
 Among his stops were the bustling port of Yantian on the coast of Guangdong and Shenzhen, the special economic zone where China began its earliest experiments with capitalist-oriented policies in the 1980's, Chinese and South Korea media reported.
 His focus raised expectations, especially in South Korea, that Mr. Kim planned to undertake a new round of economic liberalization.
 North Korea introduced some market-oriented changes in 2002, shortly after Mr. Kim made a similar trip to Shanghai. Although North Korea has suffered a severe economic slump, a recent uptick in its food supply and economic activity has led some South Korea analysts to predict that the country may be ready for a new round of experiments.
 ''There is a debate in North Korea as there was in China at one time about how far and how fast they should go,'' said Chung Jae Ho, an international relations expert at Seoul National University. ''But I think this is a signal that this is the right time for a new opening.''

HEADLINE: Australian Bank Pursues Toll Roads and Other Public Works 

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
In late 2004, Goldman Sachs advised the city of Chicago on the $1.83 billion sale of a 99-year concession for its Skyway toll road. For its work, the firm received a nice $9 million fee. More important, Goldman also got inspiration.
 Across the negotiating table was an Australian bank that until recently was little known outside its home country: Macquarie Bank. In recent years, Macquarie has become the envy of Wall Street by buying the rights to operate infrastructure projects including ports, tunnels and airports, as well as toll roads, packaging them in funds and reselling the stock in those funds to the public, minting money at each stage along the way.
Now Goldman is raising a $3 billion fund to invest in similar public infrastructure deals. Another unit of the bank recently bid on a public-private partnership to run the Dulles Toll Road outside Washington. Mark B. Florian, the municipal finance banker who advised Chicago on the Skyway deal, has moved to New York to oversee the bank's efforts to advise on, invest in and better understand infrastructure assets. 
 And Goldman is not alone. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the best and brightest of Wall Street are for once not complimenting each other, but an outsider on the rise. Credit Suisse, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS are all in different stages of exploring how to make money on public infrastructure, both as an adviser to others and as a principal in investing in the deals. 
 Credit Suisse is looking at how to leverage its expertise in buying real estate and advising on the sale of airports; both UBS and Credit Suisse are trying to gauge whether their big private banking clients would be interested in the assets. 
 ''Before anyone else, Macquarie saw the potential of the U.S. market,'' said Robert W. Poole Jr., the director of transportation studies at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian research group. ''They have the most robust model of highways as a new utility that can be an investor-owned utility like gas and electric utilities.''
 With local and state governments in the United States in search of ways to increase revenue without raising taxes or issuing bonds, public-private partnerships have recently become a hot-ticket investment idea.
 During the last 12 months, more than $20 billion worth of private sector proposals have been submitted to transportation departments from Georgia to Oregon, according to a study by Mr. Poole. Just last night, bankers from Wall Street firms were working late to polish bids for the Indiana Toll Road.
 ''There's opportunity popping up all over the U.S.,'' said Greg Hulsizer, chief executive of California Transportation Ventures. In 1991, the company won a concession to build the South Bay Expressway, a 10-mile tollway in San Diego, and it is now owned by a Macquarie fund.
 ''It's not uncommon to see public-private partnerships for infrastructure around the world, especially in Europe,'' he said, ''Here in the States, it's a new, emerging trend.'' 
 Macquarie came into its own only in 1985, when, as a subsidiary of Hill Samuel & Company, a British merchant bank, it received an Australian banking license. It is now a deal powerhouse; in 2004 and 2005, it bought $17 billion worth of global infrastructure assets, according to Thomson Financial. 
 Its model looks particularly alluring to Wall Street. Using a small capital base, Macquarie acquires giant assets by borrowing other people's money, then packages the assets into funds, which are sold to investors through public offerings or as unlisted funds. Along the way, it makes a killing on fees.
 ''It's an obvious gold mine,'' said one competitor who asked not to be named because his bank is working on its own infrastructure strategy. 
 The pitch to governments is simple: Macquarie will look after the assets -- maintaining the roads or ports, raising toll road fees to make the investment more profitable -- then give them back, in 99 years or so. 
 ''It's not a sell-off of the family silverware,'' says Murray Bleach, head of Macquarie's North American infrastructure advisory business. ''You leave it with someone who can polish it up and earn more money for the use of it.'' 
 Unlike private equity funds, which look for rates of return of 20 to 30 percent, these funds expect returns in the low to high teens, according to Macquarie officials, or 6 to 12 percent, according to competitors. 
 Macquarie has recognized that global investors have a seemingly insatiable appetite for dependable returns of 5 to 10 percent, especially since government bond yields have been lower of late. 
 The potential for fees in these public infrastructure deals is astounding, even by Wall Street's obsessive and excessive fee standards. Bankers can make advisory fees on the sale of the often-large assets. Then, once packaged into funds, the assets earn Macquarie management fees (1 to 1.5 percent) as well as incentive fees: 20 percent on profits above a certain threshold. The thresholds vary, based on benchmarks appropriate to the assets in the funds.
 The model has risks. Low interest rates have provided flush financing for Macquarie. In essence, its deals are like leveraged buyouts: it provides the equity, borrows the debt and rakes in rich fees. Higher interest rates would make debt financing less attractive and could affect returns across the board. 
 This week, Macquarie's chief financial officer told Bloomberg News that the bank would earn no performance fees for any of its infrastructure or specialized funds for the six months that ended Dec. 31, which will reduce the bank's revenues. 
 ''The rush into this will create some opacity around risk,'' said one Wall Street executive who is also looking at this strategy and insisted on anonymity because his bank did not yet have its strategy developed. ''There will be other shoes to drop on this.'' 
 For its part, Macquarie welcomes Wall Street's crashing its party. ''We've been saying it's a great asset class and now some of our dear friends are joining,'' Mr. Bleach of Macquarie said. ''The market is not static. There will be plenty of assets to buy.''
 The Australian bank's model is a result of national circumstances. A 1992 law required employers to set aside a percentage of their employees' income for retirement. Today, workers are required to set aside at least 9 percent, which has helped build a national retirement nest egg of $591 billion, with $70 billion to $80 billion added every year -- providing a huge cushion of capital to Australian banks.
 Macquarie bankers had been advising the Australian government on the sale of public assets when it started a privatization drive in the early 1990's. Nicholas Moore, the head of investment banking in Sydney, decided the bank should get in on the action. In 1996, a Macquarie fund made an investment in an Australian toll road. 
 Today, Macquarie has roughly $23 billion invested in what the bank calls specialized infrastructure funds. The specialist funds have contributed heavily to the bank's bottom line. For the half-year that ended September 2005, corporate finance, which includes the specialist funds as well as advisory and financing work, contributed 41 percent of the bank's profit of 482 million Australian dollars ($360.5 million). Macquarie shares have risen more than 900 percent since they made their debut on the Australian Stock Exchange in July 1996. Macquarie's funds are invested all over the world and trade on various global exchanges: Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust trades on the New York Stock Exchange, for example. 
 Macquarie's name is everywhere -- its deals have been called Macquisitions -- including a listing as a lead bidder for the London Stock Exchange. Recently, Macquarie has bought cooling systems in Chicago, satellite parking lots at various American airports and, most recently, with Black Diamond Capital Management, the Smart Carte Corporation, the concessionaire for baggage carts and strollers at airports across the United States.
 The bank is frequently accused of overpaying. When it bid $1.83 billion for the Chicago Skyway with Cintra, a Spanish private sector developer of transportation infrastructure, the next closest bid was $700 million. 
 ''Our view was we didn't overpay,'' Mr. Bleach said. ''The market says we didn't.'' The bank refinanced about $1 billion of the debt in 2005, recouping about half of that for the equity partners.
 The Chicago Skyway deal sheds some light on why such a concession might be attractive to governments. When Macquarie, together with Cintra, won the 99-year concession to run the Skyway, the city set aside a rainy day fund of $500 million, paid down $855 million in Skyway and city debt, set up an eight-year $375 million annuity and even had some money left over, which it will use to deliver heat to the city's neediest people. 
 In exchange, Macquarie and Cintra will operate the toll road, which generates about $20 million in cash flow a year, for 35 years. The concessionaires will be able to raise tolls and will be required to maintain the tollway. 
 ''The economic analysis in favor of doing the deal was overwhelming.'' said John R. Schmidt, a lawyer from Mayer Brown Rowe & Maw who represented the city.
 California has also seen advantages in doing a deal with Macquarie. In 1991, California Transportation Ventures won the right to build Route 125, a 10-mile toll road connecting one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, Chula Vista, to a major thoroughfare. But it took more than a decade to have environmental permits approved -- the Quino checkerspot butterfly was discovered on the land -- forcing the company to look for an infusion of capital. In two deals, Macquarie bought 100 percent of the partnership rights to the concession, and the toll road is under construction. 
 ''We get a much-needed facility without having to divert funds from other projects to build it,'' said Laurie Berman, deputy district director for the California Department of Transportation. 
 Now that most of Wall Street is rushing in, it is unclear whether there will be enough investors who want to put their money in public infrastructure funds. And more competitors may just raise the prices of available assets.
 As it grows, Macquarie will face its own challenges. It has had only two major mistakes, investments it has since sold: a power station and a fiber optic network, both in Australia. It cannot afford many more. 
 ''It's not like we will make 50 percent on one asset and zero on another,'' Mr. Bleach of Macquarie said. ''It's more like 13, 14, 15. We can't have any zeros.''

'APARTMENT 3A' Previews start today. Opens Monday.

Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255.

'ZOMBOID!' Opens Wednesday. Richard Foreman, a downtown institution, tries multimedia in his latest experimental event, which features large projections shot in Australia (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101.

Broadway

'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). (On Tuesday, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.) Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater; 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)


* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodovar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)

'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

*'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)

* 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'ANTON' It is one thing to write a play about Anton Chekhov's last four years, quite another to attempt the master's style, then produce and direct it and portray the title character. Though Pierre van der Spuy's reach far exceeds his grasp, he deserves some credit for trying (2:15). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, between Charlton and Vandam Streets, South Village; (212) 352-3101.(Andrea Stevens)

*'THE END OF REALITY' Violence isn't pretty in the listless but eventful world of Richard Maxwell's hypnotic new play. It's not ugly, either. In this latest work from the king of affecting disaffection, violence doesn't so much explode as drip, like water from a leaky faucet, into the lives of lonely, hapless security guards. Mr. Maxwell's most eloquent statement to date about the blurring of despair and apathy in American lives (1:40). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793. (Brantley)

'GONER' The president is shot, and the world's worst doctors get the job of trying to save him in this very funny bit of sketch comedy disguised as a play. Bad taste seems not to be an issue for the author, Brian Parks, but most of the lunacy is inspired enough that you can forgive the insensitivity (1:15). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'HOUSE OF DESIRE' This 300-year-old farce, written by a nun, mostly proves that Baroque women were just as capable as Baroque men of producing forgettable plays. It's sometimes fun watching the energetic young actors trying to breathe life into it, though, especially during a smashing sword fight conducted in semi-darkness (2:10). Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'MAJOR BARBARA' George Bernard Shaw's polemic against the military-industrial complex and organized religion is still timely 100 years later, and though the director Brooke O'Harra's Kabuki-tinged version lands on the mark and misses it about equally, there is something true and real about the production that is worth seeing (2:35). La MaMa Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. (Stevens)

'WHAT THEN' Even if Rinne Groff's playful play about environmental disaster is occasionally labored, there's never any doubt that there's an active, lively intelligence at work (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Last Chance

* 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)

'THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY' Sounds like Shakespeare, bleeds like a ''Friday the 13th'' movie. Authorship of this 400-year-old play is uncertain, but the Red Bull Theater's interpretation, adapted and directed by Jesse Berger, is definitive, anchored by a dynamite performance by Matthew Rauch as a fellow bent on avenging his love's death in a dukedom full of degenerates (2:05). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)

* 'CACHE (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)

* 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)

'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)

'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)

'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true-story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western college bastkeball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott)

* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)

* 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)

'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee)

'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)

* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)

'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis)

* 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)

'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)

'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)

* 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)

* 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)

* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)

'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture cliches. (Scott)

'TRISTAN & ISOLDE' (PG-13, 125 minutes) The lovers of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and Wagnerian libretto fall for each other far from the violent, Dark Ages machinations plaguing their two warring peoples. A pleasant entertainment from the director Kevin Reynolds that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more. (Dargis)

'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)

* 'WHEN THE SEA RISES' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Graced with a magnetic lead performance by Yolande Moreau, this French-Belgian movie is a serious romantic comedy with surreal touches that follows the road tour of a middle-aged solo comedian through the small towns of northern France.(Holden)

'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)

(Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

CYRO BAPTISTA & BEAT THE DONKEY, LUMINESCENT ORCHESTRII (Tomorrow) Led by the percussionist Cyro Baptista, who has collaborated on some of the world-beat forays of Paul Simon and Sting, the ensemble Beat the Donkey plays ecumenical music with a Brazilian flavor, integrating samba, forro and maracatu as well as jazz, rock and funk. Luminescent Orchestrii makes similar cultural mash-ups with a Balkan base. 8 p.m., Steinhardt Building, Makor, 35 West 67th Street, (212) 415-5500; $15. (Laura Sinagra)

BELL ORCHESTRE, CLOGS (Sunday) The Montreal band the Bell Orchestre mixes traditional orchestral sounds with machine atmospherics. In contemplative moments, its music recalls the Tindersticks' work for film, although it is sometimes more stately. Like-minded associates Clogs also play. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)

BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Thursday) This Canadian collective makes heartbreak music that sounds like a fuzzy, drunken party. Some prefer its diffuse anthemic feints to the straight-up anthems of its countrymen Arcade Fire. Members have included the Stars' Evan Cranley, Metric's Emily Haines and the multitalented singer-songwriter Leslie Feist. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25. (Sinagra)

CAKE, TEGAN AND SARA, GOGOL BORDELLO, EUGENE MIRMAN (Tonight) The Sacramento-based alt-rock band Cake uses its Unlimited Sunshine Tour as a chance to perform with musicians its members admire. This time out they asked the Canadian folk-pop twins Tegan and Sara, as well as the manic Gypsy punkers Gogol Bordello. The music-loving hipster comedian Eugene Mirman will tie it all together. 7:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212) 485-1534; $34. (Sinagra)

CALEXICO (Tuesday) Calexico plays desert rock bathed in pedal-steel mystery and orchestral ambience. Lately the group has collaborated with the quiescent folk-rocker Iron and Wine (a k a Sam Beam), striking a balance that made it sound more intimate and him more expansive. The group plays without him this weekend but is joined by the multi-instrumentalist Rob Burger. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)

EDITORS (Tonight and Tomorrow) Another in the line of British post-punk bands joining the dark, danceable Joy Division parade, the Editors have strong singles, like the propulsive ''Munich,'' but none that top the best from its closest sonic cousin, Interpol. Tonight at 8, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door (sold out). Tomorrow at 11 p.m., the Annex, 152 Orchard Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side; $10 (sold out). (Sinagra)

ELEPHANT MAN (Tonight) Nicknamed Energy God, the Jamaican D.J. Elephant Man has been one of the dancehall artists most successful in terms of crossing over to the hip-hop scene, lending his gruff, kinetic voice to so many rap and R&B tracks that at times it has felt like overkill. He appears here at a party put on by Hot 97's Angie Martinez and DJ Enuff. 9 p.m., Exit, 610 West 56th Street; free to all on guest list before midnight, $25 after. Call (212) 582-8282 for details. (Sinagra)

FLAMENCO IN THE CITY (Sunday) Part of the New York Guitar Festival, presented in partnership with the New York City Classical Guitar Society, this night of flamenco music and dance features the guitarists Dennis Koster, Jose Ramos, and Ivan and Juan Gomez. 3 p.m., American Youth Hostel Concert Chapel, 891 Amsterdam Avenue, at 103rd Street, newyorkguitarfestival.com: $20 to $25. (Sinagra)

SOPHIE B. HAWKINS (Tomorrow) Most famous for the radio hit ''Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover,'' the intriguingly gutsy Ms. Hawkins now plays the singer-songwriter circuit. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100; $23 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)

HOGAKU: NEW SOUNDS OF JAPAN (Sunday) Hogaku, a Japanese traditional music, is experiencing a revival of sorts, propelled by musicians who bring pop, rock and jazz into the mix. Performers include the lutenist Shinichi Kinoshita, along with the taiko percussionist Hiroshi Motofuji and the flutist Sayuri Ono; the guitar and zither duo Aki & Kuniko, with Sachio Suginuma on shakuhachi (bamboo flute); and the shakuhachi trio Han'nya Teikoku. 8 p.m., Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742; $25, $20 for society members. (At 7 p.m., there will be a lecture on hogaku and its instrumentation.) (Sinagra)

BILLY JOEL (Monday and Thursday) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra)

HOWARD JONES (Monday) The 80's synth-pop hitmaker behind the giddily uplifting ''New Song'' and the vaguely spooky rouser ''Things Can Only Get Better'' scored big by being more human than Thomas Dolby and more optimistic than the Fixx. 7 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $25. (Sinagra)

KARSH KALE & REALIZE LIVE FEATURING VISHAL VAID, GLOBESONIC SOUND SYSTEM (Tonight) The tabla player Karsh Kale has branched out into production, exploring East-meets-West beat culture. The vocalist and harmonium player Vishal Vaid draws his inspiration from South Asian ghazal, modally sung improvisatory love poetry. Globesonic Sound System spins a dance party at 12:30. 9, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $18. (Sinagra)

CURT KIRKWOOD (Tonight) In the Meat Puppets, the 80's band he led with his brother Cris, Curt Kirkwood proved himself a punk guitar mystic, integrating punk and classic rock with a lolling profundity revered by Kurt Cobain. 11 p.m., the Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; $10. (Sinagra)

LANGHORNE SLIM (Tonight) With an old-timey shtick and indie-rock influences, this urban-folk songwriter helps young scenesters cleanse the sonic palette after too many nights of beeps and blare. 11:30, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra)

COLIN MELOY AND LAURA VEIRS (Thursday) The sharp-voiced frontman of the Decemberists, Colin Meloy will soon release some of his college band Tarkio's material, the strength of which proves he's always been a master tunesmith inclined toward earnest literary name-checking. He plays solo this time, sharing the bill with another evocative songwriter, the ethereal but edgy Laura Veirs. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536; $23.50. (Sinagra)

MF DOOM, LITTLE BROTHER (Thursday) MF Doom is a purveyor of imaginative raps that glower and shimmer, creating a sense of poetic pain. Little Brother is a soul-grounded rap group from Durham, N.C., that forgoes Southern crunk in favor of blending the free-form experimentation of OutKast with the kind of jazzy tracks that characterized the East Coast hip-hop of the mid-90's. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $33. (Sinagra)

THE MOONEY SUZUKI, ABERDEEN CITY (Wednesday) The bluesy garage-rockers the Mooney Suzuki play this open-bar party on a bill that also includes the art-pop hopefuls Aberdeen City. 9 p.m., Shindig Party, 60 Gansevoort Street, near Washington Street, Meatpacking District, shindignyc.com; $15. (Sinagra)

R. STEVIE MOORE, ODAWAS (Tonight) The rarely seen R. Stevie Moore plays denatured California-flavored pop. Odawas makes arty folk-rock that sounds as if it's being strummed at a campfire on a desert moon, against the baying of mechanical wolves. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra)

THE ROLLING STONES, METRIC (Tonight) The Stones' newest album is their most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages, the Stones even seem politically relevant. Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Haines, Metric finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Haines's shuddering alto functions as both a weapon and a come-on. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra)

LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tonight) Led by the singers Allyssa Lamb and Emily Hurst, this band mixes musicians from the United States, France and Colombia, who mine their Latin heritage in the performance of boleros, cha-chas, cumbias, huaynos and cowboy songs. 11, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $10. (Sinagra)

SISE (Thursday) SiSe is a multiple-identity New York band, formed by a singer, Carol C, and a keyboardist-disc jockey-programmer, Cliff Cristofaro, as well as a pair of viola players and a rhythm section. Its songs touch down variously in down-tempo Sade territory, pop-flamenco, reggae, trance, drum-and-bass and various Latin hybrids. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $18 Advance, $20 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

RICKY SKAGGS & KENTUCKY THUNDER (Sunday) Ricky Skaggs's fingers fly over just about anything with frets, especially the mandolin; he's no slouch on the fiddle, either, and he has the high tenor voice of a singer steeped in bluegrass. He did well in the Nashville mainstream in the 1980's, working as a producer and making a hit on his own with ''Country Boy'' in 1984. He has recently returned to more traditional Southern gospel and bluegrass. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Pareles)

LUCIANA SOUZA (Monday) The jazzy singer Luciana Souza performs her new, poetry-inspired, Brazilian-inflected songs as a duo with Romero Lubambo, and with a quartet featuring guitar, bass and drums. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)

LEWIS TAYLOR (Thursday) To call the British songwriter Lewis Taylor neo-soul is to shortchange an arduous history. He has been recording throwback psych-soul odes to love and pain since the 80's, with far less recognition than he is entitled to. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)

THREE FLOORS OF SKA (Tonight) Tonight the Knitting Factory is filled with ska bands of many persuasions, from the Toasters, the New York Ska Jazz Ensemble, Go Jimmy Go and Eastern Standard Time to the Rotterdam Ska Jazz Foundation, the Bluebeats, the Rudie Crew, Hub City, Bigger Thomas, Bombtown and the Vicars. 7 , 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

THE DEREK TRUCKS BAND (Sunday) Derek Trucks, the nephew of the Allman Brothers Band's drummer Butch Trucks, is now a full-time member of his uncle's band and leads his own blues-rocking band between Allman gigs. 7 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com; $35. (Pareles)

WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Tonight) The pointy guitars and firecracker drums of this local band propel the tremulous pleas of Keith Murray into a full-on lust panic. Where similar bands can sound too studied, We Are Scientists makes its precision seem inspired. The trio Oxford Collapse's shaggy art-rock recalls that of acerbic forebears like the Embarrassment. 9, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10 in advance, $12 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra)

JAH WOBBLE (Thursday) Once the bassist for Public Image Ltd., he has built a solo career on imaginative collaborations and solo work that mines global rhythms and traditions for answers to spiritual questions. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $19.50. (Sinagra)

Cabaret

Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden)

ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)

'SINGING ASTAIRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This smart, airy revue, which pays tribute to Fred Astaire, has returned, featuring Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. 5:30 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum. (Holden)

* ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday through Thursday) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue about her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30. (Holden)

MICHAEL ATTIAS AND RENKU + 2 (Monday) As on the recent album ''Renku'' (Playscape), the saxophonist Michael Attias embellishes compositional miniatures with help from the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Satoshi Takeishi. For this engagement, they're joined by Tony Malaby on saxophone, and Russ Lossing on Fender Rhodes piano. 10 p.m. and midnight, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)

MATT BREWER QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) The bassist Matt Brewer has lately distinguished himself in a handful of sideman settings; leading his own group here, he features the tenor saxophonist Chris Cheek, the pianist Frank LoCrasto and the drummer Rodney Green. 10, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $15. (Chinen)

HENRY BUTLER (Tonight) New Orleans has turned out more than a few great jazz pianists, Mr. Butler among them; this solo concert should be a good showcase for his style, powerfully and persuasively rooted in the blues. 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $45. (Chinen)

DON BYRON'S IVEY-DIVEY (Monday) This trio -- Mr. Byron on clarinet and tenor saxophone, Jason Moran on piano, and Billy Hart on drums -- pays homage, directly and obliquely, to a 1946 recording session featuring Lester Young, Nat King Cole and Buddy Rich. Results range from the sparsely poetic to the blusteringly emphatic, but the group's imaginative energies never ebb. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $25. (Chinen)

ROY CAMPBELL'S PYRAMID TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Campbell, a trumpeter ensconced in free-jazz circles, uses this group to engage in improvisation from the perspective of global folk culture; he has the ideal collaborators in William Parker, on bass and assorted wind instruments, and Hamid Drake, on drums and percussion. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Wednesday through Jan. 29) Bright and breezy yet unfailingly precise, Mr. Charlap, the pianist, has come to exemplify jazz's modern mainstream. So has his working trio, which keeps a Tin Pan Alley repertory percolating in the present tense. 8 and 10 p.m. with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50 and $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

ANDREW D'ANGELO'S I WILL SURVIVE (Tonight) Mr. D'Angelo, an expressive and often entertainingly frenetic multi-reedist, joins forces with the Norwegian tenor saxophonist Kjetil Moster, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jim Black. 9 and 10:30, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762; no cover. (Chinen)

E.S.T. (Through Sunday) The initials stand for Esbjorn Svensson Trio, a popular acoustic jazz-crossover group from Sweden; taking its lead from Mr. Svensson's piano, the ensemble favors somber harmonies and skittering electronic textures. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)

* HENRY GRIMES AND ROSWELL RUDD (Tomorrow) The bassist Henry Grimes and the trombonist Roswell Rudd were fellow travelers in jazz's 1960's avant-garde, though they followed separate career paths in the ensuing years, Mr. Rudd plunging into obscurity (in the Catskills) and Mr. Grimes into oblivion (in California). Both have been back on the scene and making up for lost time; this duo engagement should evoke some historical echoes but resist the tug of nostalgia. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $20 each set; $35 for both sets. (Chinen)

CURTIS HASSELBRING'S BTH (Wednesday) Mr. Hasselbring, a trombonist and guitarist with a mischievous sense of humor, introduces a promising ensemble with a typically inscrutable title; his bandmates are Shane Endsley on trumpet, Andrew D'Angelo on alto saxophone, Trevor Dunn on bass and Ches Smith on drums. 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

* DAVE HOLLAND FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) Closing out a weeklong club engagement, Mr. Holland introduces a new sextet, with the trumpeter Alex Sipiagin, the alto saxophonist Antonio Hart, the trombonist Robin Eubanks, the pianist Mulgrew Miller and the drummer Eric Harland (tonight and tomorrow) and a standards-oriented duo with the vibraphonist Steve Nelson (Sunday). 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

* THE JABANE ENSEMBLE (Tuesday and Wednesday) Like the Robert Glasper Experiment, which features the piano playing of Mr. Glasper and the drumming of Chris Dave, this young ensemble, presented by the producer Jill Newman, draws from rhythm and blues, gospel and hip-hop; along with Mr. Glasper and Mr. Dave, its members are the guitarist Lionel Loueke, the harmonica player Gregoire Maret and the bassist Derrick Hodge. The silk-toned singer Bilal and the trumpeter Roy Hargrove will alternate as special guests. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $25 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $15 at the bar, and a one-drink minimum. The Robert Glasper Experiment plays on Thursday at 10 p.m. at 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8. (Chinen)

* STEVE LEHMAN (Wednesday and Thursday) Celebrating the release of ''Demian as Posthuman'' (Pi), his bracing and fiercely imagined new album, the saxophonist Steve Lehman performs in three overlapping ensembles: his Blueprint Trio, with the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Eric McPherson; a duo with the drummer Tyshawn Sorey; and a quintet featuring Mr. Brewer and Mr. Sorey alongside Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet and Mike Moreno on guitar. 9 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15, members, $10. (Chinen)

MULGREW MILLER AND WINGSPAN (Tuesday through January 29) Mr. Miller is a pianist with roots firmly planted in jazz tradition, especially the blues; but his ensemble Wingspan pursues a distinctly airy sensibility, with help from the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the trumpeter Duane Eubanks and the vibraphonist Steve Nelson. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

* NYC WINTER JAZZFEST (Sunday) This six-hour smorgasbord, produced by Brice Rosenbloom, purposefully coincides with this week's Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference. Occupying all three floors of the Knitting Factory, it showcases almost 20 groups; highlights include Me'shell N'degeocello's Spirit Music Jamia, Marc Ribot's Spiritual Unity, the Dave Burrell Trio, Rez Abbasi's Snake Charmer and Terence Blanchard's Flow. 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; cover, $25.(Chinen)

WILLIAM PARKER (Tuesday through next Saturday) Mr. Parker is a pillar, musically and morally, of modern avant-garde jazz culture; he leads three different ensembles in three days next week, beginning with a quartet with the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the trumpeter Lewis Barnes and the drummer Hamid Drake (on Tuesday), moving on to a trio with Mr. Drake and the multi-instrumentalist Daniel Carter (Wednesday) on Thursday and Friday with the quintet from his recent album ''Raining on the Moon'' (Thirsty Ear) and concluding next Saturday with a program including poetry and dance. Tuesday and next Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m., Wednesday through next Friday at 10 p.m. , the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

DAFNIS PRIETO QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto, an essential fixture on New York's Latin-jazz scene, has gradually been establishing his reputation as a composer; his cohesive band includes Manuel Valera on piano, Yosvany Terry on saxophone and his brother Junior Terry on bass. This concert, presented by the Williamsburg Jazz Festival, also features a prelude (the guitarist Gerry Eastman, at 9 p.m.) and a postscript (a late-night jam session, led by Mr. Eastman). 10:30 p.m., Williamsburg Music Center, 367 Bedford Avenue, at South Fifth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 384-1654, www.wjazzfestival.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

LUCIANA SOUZA QUARTET AND BRAZILIAN DUOS (Monday) Ms. Souza, an exceptional singer originally from Sao Paolo, divides her attention between these two ensemble settings, rarely presenting them in tandem. Her quartet interprets jazz standards as well as poems by Pablo Neruda, Elizabeth Bishop and others (with music composed by Ms. Souza); her Brazilian Duos project showcases an intimate and highly intelligent dialogue with Romero Lubambo, another transplanted Brazilian, on acoustic guitar. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Wednesday through Jan. 28) Mr. Tolliver leads an upgraded edition of his acclaimed orchestra of the 1970's; among the top-shelf talent involved are the saxophonists Billy Harper and Craig Handy, the trombonist Clark Gayton, the drummer Victor Lewis and the pianist John Hicks. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

TONE COLLECTOR (Sunday) The tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jeff Davis make up this experimental acoustic threesome, which released a bristling debut last year on Norway's Jazzaway label; they're joined here by a fellow traveler, Ben Gerstein, on trombone. 8 and 9:30 p.m., BAR4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; cover, $5.(Chinen)

JEFF (TAIN) WATTS SHOW (Through Sunday) Mr. Watts, a drummer whose locomotive drive is matched only by his attunement to the dynamics of a group, leads one consisting of the tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland, the pianist Lawrence Fields and the bassist Eric Revis. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

MIGUEL ZENON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Jibaro'' (Marsalis Music), Mr. Zenon's last album, affirmed this alto saxophonist's credentials as a young composer with vision; his quartet includes Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Henry Cole on drums. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15, members, $10. (Chinen)

 Opera

'AINADAMAR' (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) The exuberant, genre-bending music of the Argentinean-born composer Osvaldo Golijov is the focus of a monthlong festival at Lincoln Center. It starts this week with the New York premiere of his lushly scored flamenco opera ''Ainadamar'' (''Fountain of Tears''), loosely based on the life and legacy of the Spanish writer Federico Garcia Lorca. Peter Sellars directs the production, with Dawn Upshaw, Kelley O'Connor and Jessica Rivera in the principal roles. Miguel Harth-Bedoya conducts. Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65. (Jeremy Eichler)

'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Thursday) Vincent La Selva can either break your heart or make you want to wring his neck: why on earth is a conductor this good, of a certain age, conducting a free performance at an Upper West Side church rather than at the Met? Well, whatever the reason (and there are reasons), lovers of Verdi can go hear him and his cast of little-knowns -- often surprisingly good -- with relish. 7:30 p.m., Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, West End Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 245-8837. (Anne Midgette)

Bronx Opera (Tomorrow, Sunday) There are some -- O.K., maybe it's just me -- who consider Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' the perfect opera: a wrenching story, spectacular vocal and ensemble music, and it all clocks in at about 50 minutes. The enterprising Bronx Opera has paired this story of royal passion and supernatural mischief with Chabrier's ''Incomplete Education,'' a light piece about a young newlywed's search for information on how to proceed. 2 p.m., Heckscher Theater, El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (718) 960-8833; $20 to $35. (Allan Kozinn)

'COSI FAN TUTTE' (Wednesday) This is the ultimate ensemble opera, and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production this fall was an impressive effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. ''Cosi'' returns with that cast almost intact. The bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties takes the place of Barbara Frittoli as Fiordiligi. The engaging mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena again sings her sister Dorabella. The lyric tenor Paul Groves (taking the place of Matthew Polenzani) and the robust baritone Mariusz Kwiecien portray the young men who cruelly test the fidelity of the two sisters. The veteran baritone Thomas Allen sings the jaded bachelor Don Alfonso. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)

'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Thursday) Franco Alfano's almost-forgotten ''Cyrano'' is musically not much of an opera. But this 1936 work does provide a meaty role for the ageless tenor Placido Domingo, who gave a vocally fervent and poignant portrayal of Cyrano, the fearless and noble guardsman cursed with an absurdly huge nose, when the production was introduced last season. It returns for six performances, with Mr. Domingo and a strong cast starting Thursday night. Francesca Zambello's production is stylish, handsome and effective. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Tommasini)

'DESPERATELY SEEKING THAIS' (Thursday) This conceptual take on Massenet's ''Thais'' is worth a look if only to check out the silent film, with the golden-age soprano Mary Garden, that will run along with the live musical excerpts provided by the latest incarnation of L'Opera Francais de New York. 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Francaise, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $25. (Midgette)

'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tomorrrow and Tuesday) The Met seems to have a big hit on its hands with Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's fairy-tale opera, which opened last season. But the production is so packed with nonstop stage effects and so peopled with dancers, extras, gargantuan puppets and kitelike animals of every sort that during last season's presentations, the fine musical performances by the conductor James Levine, the Met orchestra and the strong cast took a back seat to the stage show. Maybe the new conductor, Paul Daniel, and the promising new cast that takes over when the production returns tomorrow afternoon (including Mary Dunleavy as Pamina, Eric Cutler as Tamino and Nathan Gunn as Papageno) will fare better. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $21 to $80 on Tuesday, with limited tickets. (Tommasini)

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) This floating concert hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River offers the intimacy that chamber music needs, as well as a wonderful view of Lower Manhattan through the bay windows behind stage. This weekend the Fine Arts Quartet offers installments of a Shostakovich string quartet cycle -- Nos. 4, 11 and 14 tonight, Nos. 1, 5 and 8 tomorrow and Sunday. Patrycja Piekutowska, a violinist, and Jonahan Yates, a pianist, take over on Thursday with a program of contemporary Polish music, including works by Krzysztof Penderecki, Grazyna Bacewicz, Szymanowski and Lutoslawski. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Kozinn)

BERLIN PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday, Thursday) Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliners return to New York with a four-concert series that runs through Jan. 28. Typically one of the highlights of the Carnegie Hall season, this outstanding orchestra gets rolling on Wednesday with Haydn (Symphony No. 86), Schoenberg (Variations for Orchestra) and Strauss (''Ein Heldenleben''). Thursday's program features Mahler's Fourth, with the mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena and the New York premiere of Hanspeter Kyburz's ''Noesis.'' 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $58 to $195. (Eichler)

BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Conductors looking for a leg up in their careers have founded orchestras before, but even Ivan Fischer could hardly have imagined that both he and the Budapest Festival Orchestra would have risen so well together. This year's Carnegie Hall appearance for the orchestra is part of the pianist Richard Goode's ''Perspectives'' series, and Mr. Goode will join the orchestra for Bartok's Third Concerto. 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $74. (Midgette)

CASSATT STRING QUARTET (Sunday) A striking Eastern European program includes the nocturne from Borodin's second quartet, Dvorak's Quartet in A flat and a piano quintet by the 19th-century Polish composer and pianist Juliusz Zarebski, for which they will be joined by Roman Markowicz. 3 p.m., Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 734-2130; $25; $20 for students and 65+. (Midgette)

'CHAMBERFEST' (Tonight and tomorrow night) You might think that the Juilliard School has enough to handle with its ambitious continuing musical celebration of its 100th anniversary, not to mention the annual ''Focus'' festival, coming up at the end of the month. But this week the school has also been presenting ''Chamberfest,'' a series of free concerts of diverse works performed by accomplished student musicians. The series ends with concerts tonight (works by Bartok, Schoenberg and Brahms's stormy Piano Quintet in F minor) and tomorrow night (Copland's ''Appalachian Spring,'' Berg's String Quartet and Messiaen's mystical ''Quartet for the End of Time.'') 8, Paul Hall, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406. (Tommasini)

COMPOSER PORTRAIT: BONGANI NDODANA (Tonight) The adventurous Miller Theater begins a three-day ''Focus on Africa'' series with a concert featuring works by Bongani Ndodana. Born in Queenstown in 1975, Mr. Ndodana is considered the most prominent young South African composer working today. His works draw both from traditional African and contemporary classical heritages. The soprano Dawn Padmore and the African Exchanges Ensemble will perform, conducted by the composer. 8, Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20. (Tommasini)

GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri soldiers through another season as the de facto quartet-in-residence at the Metropolitan Museum. Each of the group's six concerts features a Mozart quartet, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Flute Quartet (K. 285), with Carol Wincenc, as well as Schumann's String Quartet No. 3 and Richard Danielpour's String Quartet No. 5. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler)

HOUSTON SYMPHONY (Tuesday) The noted soprano Barbara Bonney joins the Houston Symphony under Hans Graf for a program of Mozart, Shostakovich and the Houston composer Pierre Jalbert. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $87. (Eichler)

DMITRI HVOROSTOVSKY (Wednesday) The great silver-maned Russian baritone offers a program of works from his homeland, with opera arias by Borodin, Rachmaninoff and Rubinstein alongside 20th-century popular songs. Supporting him are the Philharmonia of Russia, conducted by Constantine Orbelian; the Cathedral Choral Society; and Style of Five, a Russian folk ensemble. For the perplexed, a preconcert lecture by Maya Pritsker should sort it all out. 8 p.m. (lecture at 6:45), Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $60. (Kozinn)

JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) Now that Leonard Slatkin has stepped aside for medical reasons, James DePreist will conduct the student orchestra in Shostakovich's ''Leningrad'' Symphony, as well as in music by two former Juilliard presidents: William Schuman and Peter Mennin. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $10 to $20; free tickets for students and 65+. (Eichler)

NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday) This year's winter festival is devoted to Mozart -- not surprisingly, given that this year marks the 250th anniversary of his birth and is glutted with Mozart concerts. The second program of the three-week ''Many Faces of Mozart'' event is called ''Mozart and the Voice,'' and includes excerpts from ''The Magic Flute'' and the Requiem. Bernard Labadie conducts. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 3 p.m. at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark; tomorrow night at 8, War Memorial, Memorial Drive, Trenton, (800) 255-3476; $20 to $75. (Midgette)

NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS (Tomorrow) Harold Rosenbaum's finely polished chorus specializes in contemporary music, and turns its attention this time to composers who either worked in or were influenced by Minimalism. Included are choral scores by John Adams, David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Michael Gordon, Jeffrey Schanzer and Steve Martland. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Kozinn)

ORCHESTRE REVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE (Sunday and Monday) Sir John Eliot Gardiner and his fine period-instrument orchestra contribute two concerts to this year's Mozart celebration. On Sunday, the Monteverdi Choir joins the ensemble for two great liturgical works that Mozart left unfinished: the Mass in C minor (performed here in the Alois Schmitt edition, touched up by Sir John), and the Requiem. On Monday, the orchestra plays Mozart's three final symphonies, Nos. 39, 40 and 41. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $35 to $69. Monday at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; $56; (212) 721-6500. (Kozinn)

RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Tomorrow) The composer Anthony Korf and the conductor George Rothman, who founded this innovative orchestra, have championed several inexplicably overlooked 20th-century composers. One is the Romanian-born Frenchman Marius Constant, who died in 2004. Constant is probably fated to be remembered best as the composer of the theme for ''The Twilight Zone.'' But he has a large catalog of strong symphonic works, ballet scores and chamber music. The Riverside will perform his ''103 Regards Dans l'Eau'' on an all-French program with works by Rameau, Ravel and Poulenc. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 and $45. (Tommasini)

EMIO GRECO/PC (Tonight through Sunday) This Netherlands-based company is run by the Italian choreographer Emio Greco and the Dutch theater director Pieter C. Scholten.

Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve.

(La Rocco)

BEN MUNISTERI DANCE PROJECTS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Munisteri was one of the most compelling of Doug Elkins's performers many years ago; now he makes dances that match his unpredictable, frisky stage presence. You also have to appreciate the range of his musical tastes: A new work, ''Tuesday, 4 a.m. and other dances,'' is set to Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, while the older ''Turbine Mines'' is set to the ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack. 10 tonight and 7:30 tomorrow night, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 9224-0077; $25; $15 for students, 65+ or artists.

 Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)

International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Felix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (Cotter)

* MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. (See above.) (Glueck)

* MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Johnson)

* Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored, Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of American Modernists who were active between World Wars I and II. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter)

School Zone Martinez Gallery isn't a place; it's a collaborative network of several graffiti artists, two architect-designers, a curator and a dealer. The gallery has taken its graffiti star artists into a public high school for this show, for which, with the help of students, they've covered the walls and ceilings of a classroom with art, alternately brash and delicate, exclamatory and introspective. Martinez Gallery at Julia Richman High School, 317 East 67th Street, Room 222, (212) 619-2149, through Jan. 28 (Cotter)

* 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: 57th Street

* Katy Grannan: 'Mystic Lake' Ms. Grannan continues to make exceptionally intimate photographs of nonprofessional models posing outdoors partly or fully unclothed. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

Douglas Anderson: 'New Old Robots' Painted in grayed colors and a brushy, cartoonish style that recalls the Ash Can School and 1930's-era Social Realism, Mr. Anderson's comical and mournful small paintings depict old shoes, plumbing, brick walls, junk cars and outmoded industrial machinery in states of dreamlike animation. Blue Mountain, 530 West 25th Street, (646) 486-4730, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

DEBORAH BUTTERFIELD Ms. Butterfield continues to make horses out of weathered branches and scrap steel that are, at best, magically lifelike. In the big one lying down in the gallery, the metal seems just as alive as the illusory animal. Three horses on the Park Avenue median, however, are out of their element -- too delicate to compete with the traffic and the giant buildings, but perhaps because of that, poetically poignant. Edward Thorp, 210 Eleventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets; and on the Park Avenue median between 52nd and 54th Streets; (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Gene Davis: 'Three Decades' A key member of the Washington Color School, which included Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, Davis was known for expansive canvases filled by narrow, vertical colored stripes. The best examples in this show are radiant. Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-8999, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

* ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)

'Head Over Hand: Pushing the Limits of Paint' This well-selected and cohesive 15-artist show presents finely wrought abstract paintings that mix, in most cases, a hedonistic materialism and a spacey, illusory dimension. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

* Guillaume Pinard: 'expresso' Surrealistic, darkly comical black ball-point pen drawings evoke a childlike mind under the influence of Gumby, the Muppets and Japanese anime, and an animated video follows the adventures of two eyeballs with arms and legs through shape-shifting landscapes. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

* JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea (212) 929-7000, through Jan. 28. (Smith)

Kyle Staver Influences of Matisse, Bonnard, Marsden Hartley and Milton Avery are conspicuous in Ms. Staver's playful, lushly painterly pictures of people enjoying holiday or domestic pleasures. Her hedonistic verve, humor and feeling for human relationships keep academic stuffiness at bay. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 675-2656, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

ROBERT STONE Made with a loose, watercolorlike touch, this young British artist's oil-on-canvas paintings depict enigmatic and vaguely comical scenes, like tiny Canadian Mounties having a secret funeral in the woods, or a pair of travelers in oddly mixed costumes posing with a coffin. They are just sweet and peculiar enough to give you pause. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

MARTIN BEAUREGARD, 'SOMNAMBULIC' Old videos of absurdist performances and a new one about meditating and dreaming are eclipsed by two large stuffed-animal sculptures: a sumptuously furry teddy bear the size of a real cub made from a real bearskin, fearsome big claws and all; and a real moose head with majestic, silver-leafed antlers. Location One, 26 Greene Street, (212) 334-3347, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

Richard Tuttle: 'Constructed Relief Paintings' Among the most appealing works in Mr. Tuttle's current retrospective at the Whitney are the eccentrically shaped, single-color paintings from the 1960's. This show presents more of those playfully Minimalist pieces, which, with their wavering outlines and thick sides, look as if they were cut from slabs of colored rubber. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, through Jan. 28. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

* 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck)

Tom Folland: 'Death-defying Dervish Gangbuster Rebel' This follower of Paul McCarthy appears in his own ridiculous, hyperactive videos wearing an athletic outfit and a gold, hairless head mask as he manically operates machines designed for destroying paintings. The machines are also on display, including a catapult for throwing a midget dummy version of the artist at paintings. Jack the Pelican, 487 Driggs Avenue, between North 9th and 10th Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 782-0183, through Feb. 5. (Johnson)

* Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson)

'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Francoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* SAUL LEITER: 'EARLY COLOR' In their painterly concentration on shadows, reflections, light and color, the distinctive color photographs that the fashion photographer Saul Leiter took in New York in the 1950's reform street photography by concentrating less on pedestrians than on what they might see. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: El Presidente's New Clothes

BYLINE: By Edmundo Paz Soldan. 
Edmundo Paz Soldan, a professor of Hispanic languages and literature at Cornell, is the author of the forthcoming ''Turing's Delirium.''

DATELINE: Ithaca, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THE day after Bolivians elected the populist Evo Morales as their first-ever indigenous president, a colleague of mine back in New York called to ask about the fate of my relatives still in the country. ''I mean,'' he said, ''now that the machete-wielding, coca-chewing campesinos have taken over, shouldn't they leave before it's too late?'' He also asked me to describe what was happening in the streets of La Paz, which I was then visiting. Were white middle-class owners boarding up their shops? Had they stopped wearing Western clothing and, as a cartoonist suggested, flocked to buy ponchos? 
 I normally would have complained about his stereotypical view of Bolivians -- a people with such a penchant for coups and civil unrest that governing them has become an impossible feat -- but this time I could not. I was too shocked by the maturity of Bolivians' reaction to Mr. Morales's election. Only seven months ago, the country was on the brink of civil war and regional disintegration, and Mr. Morales was seen by the urban, non-indigenous middle class as a rabble-rouser who, by ordering former miners, trade unionists and community activists to blockade roads and airports, had paralyzed the economy, isolated Bolivia from the rest of the world and toppled two elected presidents. People in the wealthy, eastern, lowland state of Santa Cruz, complaining of the ''unruly Indians back in the West,'' were already demanding more autonomy from the central government; some were even calling for secession.
 But when Evo Morales is inaugurated on Sunday, it will be thanks to the support of the educated middle class who used to be scared of him. Even in Santa Cruz, where middle-class white youngsters frequently pelted Mr. Morales with eggs upon his arrival at the airport, his Movement Toward Socialism party garnered enough votes on Election Day last month to acquire a seat in the national Senate. In truth, I had underestimated the ability of Bolivians to adjust to a new situation -- indeed, to any situation. 
 I should have known better. When I was growing up in a fairly affluent neighborhood of Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, I blithely rearranged my soccer games and dating adventures around each new ordinance or curfew imposed by the revolving military juntas. ''There never are solutions in Bolivia,'' says my father, a retired doctor. ''But there are always exits.'' 
 And this time Mr. Morales offered an artful exit from what had come to seem like an endless economic and political crisis. The politicians of the traditional parties did not realize how weary Bolivians had grown of the corruption of the white-collar establishment, and of a 20-year-old neoliberal model that had been able to stabilize the economy but could not make it grow. 
 As my uncle reminded me shortly before the election, Mr. Morales was likely to win in some measure because one of the indigenous people's three main commandments was ''do not steal'' -- a rather surprising comment from my uncle, a retired general who, in 1993, had urged me to pray for the sitting president's health after an Aymara Indian had been elected vice president. All Mr. Morales had to do was to say time and again that while he was going to change the political and economic model, he would respect private property. He said that in plazas full of campesinos in the countryside, and in five-star hotel restaurants brimming with anxious businessmen. 
 Perhaps this is why some of my friends and relatives in Bolivia, even those who sometimes worried out loud about the coming Indian revenge against their former criollo rulers, willed themselves to pay attention only to the part of Mr. Morales's message that they wanted to hear. And Mr. Morales made it easy for them by quickly learning the main rule for a politician aspiring to the presidency: to adapt his message so that he can be whoever his listeners want him to be. 
 Thus, in his first trip abroad as president-elect, he was the old-school radical leader when in the company of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Cuba's Fidel Castro, but a reassuring voice in Spain and France, countries with interests in the Bolivian gas and oil industry who fear a nationalist confiscation of their holdings. At home, Mr. Morales has tempered his promise to abandon the neoliberal model with warnings that ''we cannot undo in five years something that has been in place for decades.'' 
 Now, Bolivians have been fixating on what Mr. Morales will wear when he is invested as president Sunday. Will he choose traditional Indian dress, or, as a cousin of mine who voted for him wants, a ''more appropriate'' Western-style suit? Judging by what he has done and said lately, Mr. Morales seems likely to find a sartorial compromise aimed at pleasing as many voters as possible.

HEADLINE: Oil Markets Are Jittery Over Possibility of Sanctions Against Iran

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As world leaders and diplomats debate how to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions, the worry among analysts these days is the fate of the country's oil sector. 
 The prospect of sanctions against Iran might have been easily shrugged off a few years ago, when the world sat comfortably on millions of barrels of untapped oil capacity. But the picture today is quite different. Iran exports more oil than the world's current spare capacity.
The lurking fear among many oil analysts is a darker version of what happened in Iraq: a diplomatic or military confrontation with a major Middle East oil producer that again leads to disruptions in supplies and provokes a spike in oil prices. 
 If for any reason exports from Iran, which pumps twice the oil Iraq does, suddenly stopped, other producers would not be able to make up the loss -- in contrast to 2003, when Saudi Arabia and Kuwait cranked up output to make up for the drop in Iraqi exports after the American-led invasion. 
 These concerns are not completely ill-founded. Over the weekend, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hinted that his country might be willing to use the ''oil weapon'' -- that is, curbing oil exports -- if faced with international sanctions. At the same time, some members of the United States Senate said Iran should be sanctioned regardless of the consequences for oil prices. 
 Such talk may turn out to be part of the negotiating tactics on both sides. But it is fanning waves of anxiety in oil markets, which have been rattled since Jan. 3, when Iran announced its decision to resume a nuclear research program that had been suspended since an agreement was reached with France, Germany and Britain in late 2004. 
 The announcement led to a breakdown with European negotiators and raised the likelihood of international action against Iran.
 While American and European negotiators are campaigning to have the standoff handled by the United Nations Security Council, Russia and China are urging more talks.
 Oil markets have reacted strongly to the breakdown. Crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have risen 9.5 percent since the beginning of the year. They closed yesterday at $66.83 a barrel, up $1.10, or 1.7 percent. Oil prices, which dropped to $55 in November, are again headed toward record levels.
 To be sure, other factors have contributed to the recent price rally. Nigeria's main oil-producing region is experiencing unrest, and forecasters expect strong growth in demand this year. But as the confrontation over the nuclear research program swells, Iran is turning out to be the biggest risk for oil markets this year. 
 With 10 percent of the world's reserves, Iran is the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose pricing policy it helps shape (Saudi Arabia is No. 1). 
 The country pumps four million barrels of oil each day and exports two-thirds of it, mainly to Japan and China. Analysts said Iran's standing in the oil markets permits it to assert itself more than others seeking to develop a nuclear program.
 ''Why are the Iranians pushing so aggressively instead of biding their time, like North Korea did? The obvious answer is that Iran is in a far stronger position,'' said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy based in New York. ''Iran can respond in ways that can be very painful to the international community. Iran has leverage.''
 Frank Verrastro, the head of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the international community had to answer some very tough questions when it considered Iran's position. 
 ''How do you punish an international actor when it produces a commodity that everyone needs? What can get Iran's attention without inflicting pain on everyone else?'' Mr. Verrastro said. ''Up until now, it has been a huge game of chicken.''
 Given the overall tightness in global energy supplies, analysts said, it is unlikely that Iran's oil exports will be embargoed if the dispute is taken to the Security Council. But alternatives, like banning foreign investments in Iran's oil business or transfers of technology for that industry, might still cripple Iran's struggling petroleum sector.
 ''The best punishment, because it would be the most effective, would be to deprive Iran of its oil exports,'' said Muhammad-Ali Zainy, an energy economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. ''But the problem is that this would create a big shortage on the oil markets and lead to a price explosion. It would be disastrous. It is something no one can afford.'' 
 ''On the other hand, Iran can't afford to use its oil weapon, either,'' he said. ''It relies on its oil revenue too much.'' 
 Iran derives about 50 percent of its government revenue and most of its foreign currency earnings from oil sales. Thanks to high prices, it is expected to earn more than $40 billion from oil sales in 2005. 
 At the same time, the Iranian regime is betting that the global markets cannot afford to live without its oil. That may prove to be a miscalculation. While the world may go through a short spike in prices if Iran curbs exports, analysts say that oil markets have shown resilience, as they did last year after the loss of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico. 
 In recent years, Iran has played on differences between the United States, which has barred its companies from doing business in Iran, and Europe or China, which have invested heavily in Iran's oil industry. 
 Iran has also been paying close attention to Asian customers, particularly China and India, to offset the growing hostility from the West, and has awarded exploration licenses to companies from France, Russia, Japan and China. 
 The strategy has not been completely successful. BP, which is based in London, said early last year that it would avoid doing business in Iran because of the American sanctions. Also, because of harsh contractual terms, oil companies have become wary of investing in Iran. The result has been sluggish production growth. 
 While most producers are pumping at full capacity to meet record world demand, Iran has been unable to reach its nominal production quota assigned by OPEC, 4.11 million barrels a day.
 In the United States, the standoff is increasingly perceived as the top foreign policy and security challenge for President Bush's second term. On Sunday, Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, speaking on CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' said the United States should press for international sanctions against Iran. He added, ''If the price of oil has to go up, then that's a consequence we would have to suffer.''

HEADLINE: Rhythm Melodist

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
THE drummer Paul Motian doesn't get on airplanes anymore. Once, in the mid-90's, he took a three-week tour with 35 flights. By 2003 he was booking himself with three different bands all over Europe and Japan. He decided he was sick of traveling. 
 It's not just long distances. ''I don't even go to New Jersey or Brooklyn anymore, man,'' he said defiantly one recent rainy midday, looking west toward the Hudson River from the window of his Central Park West apartment. He is 74, and has lived in the same spot for nearly 37 years, most of that time alone.
Now, Mr. Motian wants only to hear his own drum sound clearly. He has found that at the Village Vanguard, where he will play next week, he can. 
 It is an unusual sound. It does not limit any part of the drum set to a particular role. Mr. Motian has two ride cymbals, one of which he has been using since the 1950's; he gets a rich, dark, nuanced sound from it. He uses no padding or muffling in his 20-inch bass drum, and with it he can get a remarkable, deep, loud, loose noise, almost a splat -- a reminder that a bass drum is an instrument of emphasis, not just timekeeping. And for timekeeping, he plays whatever moves into his imagination. Four beats could be marked by a few snare-drum hits, a few clenches of the high-hat and a couple of combinations; in the next bar, he might play small military rolls and one lone cymbal. He has a careful style, but he is free within it.
 He works mostly with three of his own groups: his trio with the guitarist Bill Frisell and the saxophonist Joe Lovano, which has grown steadily more influential over 21 years; Trio 2000 + 1, with the bassist Larry Grenadier and the saxophonist Chris Potter, the plus-one being the enigmatic Japanese pianist Masabumi Kikuchi (or lately, the singer Rebecca Martin); and the group formerly known as the Electric Bebop Band, now called the Paul Motian Band, with the odd structure of three guitarists, two tenor saxophonists, bass and drums. That is the group that will play next week at the Vanguard; simultaneously, it will be releasing a new album, ''Garden of Eden,'' on ECM. 
 Small and bald, with excellent posture -- he runs a few miles in Central Park nearly every day -- Mr. Motian practices rapid, streetwise self-deprecation, cussing constantly. That, and a nail-gun laugh, give him the demeanor of an old-school hipster. I have heard him call a room full of people, at one time, ''man.'' (As in ''Hey, thanks for coming, man!'')
 But he can't be reduced that easily. History has shaken him out as one of the greatest drummers in all of jazz -- a select group that would include, say, Max Roach and Roy Haynes. These days, Mr. Motian's playing seems to get beyond styles particularly associated with any era of jazz. Spare and never facile, as natural as breathing, Mr. Motian's constant flow of improvisation can seem to get beyond thinking in general. At the moments of the highest abstraction in his playing, there is the greatest sensitivity, and always the implication of a pulse. Jazz, mostly, is about testing the integrity of a song's frame. Mr. Motian appears to feel that if you truly respect the frame, you can put anything inside it. 
 About half of one of his sets tends to be original compositions. An amateur pianist since the middle of his tenure as the drummer in Keith Jarrett's quartet during the late 1960's and 70's, he has written dozens of excellent melodies, flowing and terse. (The other half consists of tunes by jazz composers he admires, Thelonious Monk or Bud Powell or Charles Mingus, or popular standards.) He doesn't overcompose, likes hearing his music liberally interpreted, and lets his band members do what they want. 

'I Know Your Secret'
 Mr. Motian is not advancing any great theories about his style. One day during a recording session a few years ago, Hank Jones, the wise old pianist, took him aside. ''I know your secret,'' he whispered. Mr. Motian told this story with a baffled shrug. ''I wish I knew what he meant,'' he said. ''Wow!'' 
 Asked to listen to some recordings and talk about them, he came up with a fantastically judicious list. He kept claiming not to have an aptitude for thinking about music analytically. Then it was clear that he knew exactly what to talk about: he just wanted it to drift up on its own, without his having to point it out.
 Mr. Motian grew up in Providence, R.I., hearing big bands at the Metropolitan Theater in downtown Providence and at Rhodes on the Pawtuxet, a dance space just outside the city. He entered the Navy in 1950 during the Korean War, as a better option than being drafted into the Army. It first enabled him to attend the Navy School of Music in Washington, which he attended briefly and remembers as ''a farce.''
 He sailed around the Mediterranean for two and a half years in the admiral's band of the Seventh Fleet, and then was stationed in Brooklyn in the fall of 1953. Discharged a year later, he moved to Ninth Street in the East Village. His share of the rent was $12.50 a month. He collected unemployment, ate potato knishes and played at jam sessions.
 The first piece Mr. Motian wanted to hear connected to the days of playing marches in the Navy. It is from Baby Dodds's ''Talking and Drum Solos,'' a documentary record made for Folkways in 1946 by the jazz historian Fred Ramsey. Baby Dodds was the great New Orleans drummer of the 1920's and 30's who worked with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton and Johnny Dodds, his brother; he became celebrated a second time in New York during the 1940's Dixieland revival. The 10-inch record, on which Dodds discusses his history and technique, is a little primer on different rhythms for different drums. Cueing up the record on his turntable, Mr. Motian started with Dodds's solo version of the traditional New Orleans march tune ''Maryland.''
 His point, in singling out ''Maryland,'' was not about surface flash, technique or speed. It was much simpler. While playing a march rhythm on the snare drum all the way through, Dodds delineates the verse from the bridge by pumping a bass drum on the bridge but not on the verses. That's all. ''I guess my point is that it makes a difference,'' he said. ''He's in a different part of the song.''
 What about that cymbal sound, I asked, the one tap at the end of each section. Why is it so soft? Was Dodds, who worked during the earliest days of jazz recording, just respecting the sensitivity of the microphones? ''No, I don't think so,'' Mr. Motian replied. ''You know, the drummers in those days -- I don't think they bashed the cymbals like they do now. It's delicate. It's a cymbal, man. It's not a jackhammer.''
 He took the needle off the record. ''The first drum set I had was made during World War II. It didn't even have metal. It had wooden rims. My drum sound was closer to that than it is to my sound now. I wasn't that aware of sound. Not like I am now.''

Piano Trio
 In 1955 Mr. Motian met the pianist Bill Evans. A few years later Evans formed his own trio, with Mr. Motian and eventually Scott LaFaro on bass, which destabilized the pyramid structure of the normal piano trio, increasing the mobility of the bassist and drummer around the leader. Mr. Motian loved it, especially when LaFaro was in the group, and it was steady work: his diaries from 1962 show that he played 251/2 weeks with Evans that year. Among their recordings was a genuine 20th-century landmark, ''Sunday at the Village Vanguard.''
 That period, the late 50's and early 60's, was the busiest of his life. Mr. Motian played often with other bandleaders too -- Stan Getz, Lee Konitz, Lennie Tristano, Martial Solal, Zoot Sims, Eddie Costa, Johnny Griffin. For one week in Boston, in 1960, he got to play with Thelonious Monk. (Elvin Jones was supposed to be the drummer, but he went missing.) 
 Mr. Motian chose Monk's version of ''Carolina Moon,'' an old waltz commonly understood as cornpone. Monk rethought it when he recorded it in 1952. He plays the end of the waltz melody as a short piano introduction, and then bass and drums crash in, playing a speedy four-four. In the middle of the tune the drummer, Max Roach, slows down to midtempo four-four, but the soloists, Lou Donaldson, Kenny Dorham and Lucky Thompson, continue to play in three. Listening to it, Mr. Motian turned on like a lamp. He didn't have much to say; instead, he clapped and counted all the way through, laughing. 
 Monk was an easy boss. He paid Mr. Motian $200 for the week, good wages, and didn't demand much. One night he asked Mr. Motian to sing him his cymbal beat. He did, and Monk thought about it and sang a corrected version back to him, with a tiny bit more emphasis on the last stroke of the triplet. 

One of His Idols
 Max Roach used to live a few blocks away from Mr. Motian on Central Park West, and has long been one of his idols. (Mr. Roach is seven years older.) When Mr. Motian finally joined the New York jazz scene, in 1955, Mr. Roach, who was the great drummer of bebop's first wave, was already taking that music into a new territory with the Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet. 
 Mr. Motian saw the band play a lot. ''I went to hear them once,'' Mr. Motian said of that group, ''and I think Sonny Rollins was on tenor. I was with this bass player I used to play with a lot, Al Cotton, and he said: 'Look at Max. Watch: when he's playing he uses his whole body. He's exercising when he's playing. He's moving around. He's not just sitting there. It's not just in the wrist, in the hands. It's the whole body.' It was the mid-50's when I got turned on to that: the drums and me should be one thing, you know. It's part of me. From head to fingernails to the end of my toes, man. The drums, it's all me.''
 He wanted to hear the Victor Young movie theme ''Delilah,'' a midtempo minor-key ballad, from the Brown-Roach band's first album, recorded in 1954. It has incredible clarity: the definition of each section makes it shine like a hit pop song. ''It's so organized, man,'' Mr. Motian said. ''Arranged so beautiful. Simple, but great.'' 
 There's a Max Roach solo in the middle, for an entire chorus. Just as Baby Dodds did -- and just as Sid Catlett did on another tune Mr. Motian played for me that day, an out-of-print recording of ''I Found a New Baby'' -- the drummer indicates the structure of the composition in his solo, changing his patterns to mark its divisions. I suggested that a thread was emerging here, kind of an unusual one. He smiled a little bit, and raised one eyebrow, and kept talking about Max Roach. ''He plays different sections of a song, he points it out to you. No confusion at all. You know what I mean?'' 
 Kenny Clarke and Mr. Roach were the first great drummers of bebop, lining out the pulse on the ride cymbal rather than the bass drum; suddenly jazz drumming became higher-pitched, and more flexible. Mr. Motian idolized Clarke, too, and got to know him in Paris in the 1980's, a few years before Clarke died. Clarke played with a Miles Davis group for the 1957 soundtrack to the Louis Malle film noir ''Ascenseur Pour l'Echafaud,'' and Mr. Motian is partial to the album. We listened to ''Motel,'' a fast trio improvisation with trumpet, bass and drums, based on the chords of ''Sweet Georgia Brown.'' Clarke plays with brushes on a snare drum, varying his patterns within the same rhythm all the way through. There's not one cymbal crash, no bass drum, but Clarke is dazzling. For a musician who likes to boil things down, it is justification.
 ''Just to get so much music and so much feeling and so much swing from the minimum amount of drums, man: that's incredible,'' Mr. Motian said. ''There's so much music there, just on a snare drum. It's like a symphony to me.''

HEADLINE: December Housing Starts Declined Sharply 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
New housing starts fell sharply in December and building permits fell to their lowest level since May, the government reported yesterday, reflecting a slowing in the housing market from a peak last summer. 
 The Commerce Department said the number of homes that builders began constructing last month fell 8.9 percent, to an annual pace of 1.93 million. The number of permits issued dropped 4.4 percent, to a pace of 2.07 million.
Economists had expected housing starts at an annual pace of 2.04 million and a permit pace of 2.1 million, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. Cooler weather than normal and heavy rains in the West last month may have been a factor in the depressed construction activity, analysts said.
 ''Of that 8.9 percent, maybe a third of it was weather-related,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a forecasting and data gathering firm in Lexington, Mass. ''The rest of it is an underlying trend of weakness in the housing market. You are seeing pervasive signs of weakness.''
 For all of 2005, housing starts rose by 5.6 percent, to 2.06 million, a level exceeded only in 1972. Of those starts, 1.71 million were single-family homes, a record. Permits issued rose 3.4 percent, to 2.14 million homes.
 Housing sales dipped and inventories rose through the last several months of 2005 after a booming spring and summer. Several large home builders have said they are offering promotions to sell properties that were previously attracting multiple offers.
 In December, housing starts dropped the most in the Midwest, falling by 23.6 percent, and in the West, where they dropped 21.7 percent. Construction activity in the South rose 5.2 percent, possibly reflecting the increase in construction in areas damaged by last fall's hurricanes along the Gulf Coast. In the Northeast, starts fell 14 percent.
 Home prices, however, have not fallen from comparable levels a year earlier and few economists expect them to do so, in large part because mortgage rates still remain near historic lows.
 Analysts caution that housing data becomes less reliable at the end and beginning of the year because sales trail off significantly in the winter. The state of the market will become far clearer in the spring and summer months when most home sales occur.
 The home construction data are particularly unreliable; the housing start statistic carries a margin of error of plus or minus 8.6 percentage points. The new permits figure has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. The National Association of Home Builders estimates that housing starts will drop about 6 percent, to 1.94 million, in 2006. ''Builders are both reporting and expecting to see slowing demand,'' Michael S. Carliner, an economist at the association, said. ''It's no longer quite so much of a sellers' market.'' But he added that ''2005 is a pretty high standard of comparison.''
 Separately, the Labor Department reported yesterday that new claims for unemployment insurance fell by 36,000 last week, to 271,000, their lowest level in nearly six years. The number of continuing claims fell by 158,000, to 2.53 million; that is down about 6.3 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Market Regains Its Composure, Closing Up 2.3% as Stock Plunge Ends

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
After aggressive Internet orders by individual investors contributed to a near-collapse of stock trading here Wednesday, executives of the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced plans on Thursday to nearly double the system's capacity for trading and clearing stocks by year's end.
 Volume again approached the exchange's ceiling, and officials said they would again shorten trading hours by 30 minutes on Friday, as they did Thursday. Despite the curtailed session, the market bounced back smartly, rising 2.3 percent, and erasing much of the 2.9 percent drop on Wednesday. The percentage point gain was the biggest here in three months. 
The bounce came as investors saw a chance to take profits in a market that had fallen 6.8 percent in the first three days this week. Analysts said many of the buyers might have been foreign investors, a group responsible for about half the trading on the exchange last year. In 2005, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks gained 40 percent, drawing new investors from the United States, Europe and Asia.
 ''After the smoke cleared, I am sure some foreigners saw this as a buying opportunity,'' Peter J. Morgan, chief economist of HSBC Securities Japan, said Thursday. ''The Livedoor incident says virtually nothing about the overall economy. The stock market did have a stunning run from May of last year, so it was due for a breather.''
 Early in the week, live television news footage of prosecutors raiding the offices of the Livedoor Company, a highflying Internet-based business, set off a panic among individual investors. Until this week, many of Japan's day traders traded through the Internet, using Livedoor shares as collateral. 
 On Wednesday, the wave of selling overwhelmed the exchange, forcing officials to close 20 minutes early. But the day's volume, made up of 4.38 million transactions, was part of a steady rise in the average number of daily trades here since the summer. Over the last six months, that number has doubled.
 Individual traders are fueling this greater activity, their combined transactions increasing last month to 44 percent of the total value of trades from 18 percent in 2001. According to the leading daily Asahi Shimbun, 80 percent of individual trading is done on the Internet. And the larger share of individual investor transactions are thought to have contributed to the skittishness and the wide swings in the marketplace.
 ''They make credit transactions in extremely short time,'' Seiichi Miura, investment strategist of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, said in an interview on Thursday, ''and once the market starts falling, as we saw yesterday, the market wildly goes up and down. Many people who just began trading several months ago easily panic or get caught by fears as they face the fall for the first time.''
 Members of Parliament from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party gathered for an economic caucus Thursday and criticized Taizo Nishimuro, the stock exchange's new president, for tarnishing Japan's reputation. 
 ''A stock exchange that can't carry on trading simply doesn't deserve to exist,'' Kaoru Yosano, the financial services minister, told reporters later. ''The exchange should make it a top priority to bring business back to normal.''
 In November, a computer system failure knocked out the exchange, the second-largest in the world, for most of the day. Then in December, officials were embarrassed by an errant trade that cost a brokerage house about $330 million. The two incidents led to the resignation of the exchange president, Takuo Tsurushima, and two other executives.
 The new president, Mr. Nishimuro, comes with years of computer knowledge gained while serving as president and then chairman of Toshiba.
 On Thursday, he announced year-end goals of nearly doubling the exchange's daily trading capacity, to 8 million, and of increasing order capacity by about two-thirds, to 14 million. As a first step, trading capacity is to be increased to 5 million on Jan. 30. The New York Stock Exchange currently handles about 5 million transactions a day.
 Also easing market anxiety was a monthly government report saying that Japan's economy continues to recover, invigorated by personal spending and the growth of exports to Asia.
 ''The economy is recovering at a moderate pace,'' the Cabinet Office said in its report for January. Private consumption is ''increasing moderately,'' and industrial production is ''picking up.''
 Some analysts also took a calm view of Livedoor, a 10-year-old conglomerate that many people say aggressively exploited loopholes but did not engage in significant fraud. After Takafumi Horie took his company public on the Tokyo exchange's start-up market in 2004, Livedoor acquired at least 18 other companies, largely Internet-related.
 ''More and more, as the days go on,'' said Tatsuya Tamura, co-chairman of the Japan Independent Directors Network, a private group dedicated to improving corporate governance, ''people will begin to realize that this is not the big scandal that is the end of the world.'' 
 The company has been accused of massaging its 2004 financial results, turning a $8.7 million loss into a $12.2 profit. According to newspaper reports, prosecutors believe that the conglomerate also failed to disclose in a timely fashion its purchase of a publishing house last year. 
 On Thursday, before trading started, Livedoor issued a statement denying all financial wrongdoing. But during the day, there were virtually no buyers for its shares, and they automatically fell by 80 yen, or 70 cents, the mandated amount for shares of their category. Since Monday, their price has fallen 40 percent, paring $2.6 billion from the company's market capitalization.
 The investigation of Mr. Horie does not seem to be politically motivated. In September, he was backed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi when he ran, unsuccessfully, as an independent candidate in Japan's elections for Parliament. Prosecutors have said that they were acting on information from inside the company.
 On Mr. Horie's popular blog, 2,800 messages had been left by Thursday.
 Most were from fans. But one angry investor wrote: ''Idiot! Hurry up and get yourself arrested. Pay for the market's losses and never come on TV again.''

HEADLINE: Shares Turn Around on Brighter Technology Outlook

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks turned higher yesterday and regained most of the ground they lost in the previous session after the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices presented a bright first-quarter outlook and a broker upgraded oil services stocks. 
 Advanced Micro's forecast heartened technology investors who were disturbed Wednesday by disappointing earnings forecasts from the Intel Corporation, Yahoo and Apple Computer.
 ''People are happy that the Intel bad news didn't translate to other semiconductor stocks,'' said Robert N. Streed, a portfolio manager at Northern Trust Select Equity Fund in Chicago. 
 Investors also cheered the announcement by Schlumberger, the oil services company, that it would split its stock 2-for-1. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average added 25.85 points, or 0.24 percent, to 10,880.71. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.11 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,285.04. The Nasdaq composite index gained 22.17 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,301.81. 
 The earnings season is off to a nervous start, with investors reacting strongly to earnings or forecasts that fall short of analysts' estimates. 
 ''The market has been weak in the last few days on a number of worries,'' said Joseph Lisanti, editor of Standard & Poor's weekly newsletter, The Outlook. ''One of them has been earnings. We think that despite a couple of warnings and misses, earnings in general for the fourth quarter of 2005 are going to look pretty decent.'' 
 The day's economic news was mixed. Construction of new single-family homes surged to a record high in 2005, but construction activity fell sharply in December, sending a signal that the nation's long housing boom could be waning. 
 Separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to 271,000 last week, an unexpectedly large drop of 36,000 from the previous week, indicating strength in job markets. Investors are watching employment numbers closely for any hint that wages could rise, which they fear would be inflationary. 
 In company news, Advanced Micro rose $2.98, to $37.13, after it reported a fourth-quarter profit on a 45 percent increase in sales, reversing a loss from the previous year and handily beating Wall Street expectations. The company also forecast a solid first quarter, saying sales could rise as much as 70 percent over last year. 
 EBay rose $2.33, to $46.77, after Friedman, Billings, Ramsey upgraded it to outperform, from market perform, saying its outlook was overly cautious. 
 Shares of Schlumberger, one of the world's largest oil field services companies, rose $5.76, to $114.87, after it declared a 2-for-1 stock split and said it was increasing its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share, up from 21 cents a share. Halliburton rose $2.35, to $71.75. Baker Hughes rose $3.13, to $72.47, and the Noble Corporation rose $4.35, to $82.35, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stocks. 
 While Apple Computer reported a record-breaking first quarter, its shares dropped $3.46, to $79.04, after its second-quarter outlook fell short of analysts' expectations. 
 Walt Disney is in talks to buy Pixar Animation Studios, the maker of the hit movies ''Toy Story'' and ''Finding Nemo,'' after months of exploring how to continue their profitable film distribution partnership. Disney rose $1.04, to $26.24. Pixar rose $1.61, to $58.87. 
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, to 101. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.37 percent, from 4.33 percent late Wednesday. 
 The dollar was mixed against other currencies in European trading.

HEADLINE: Deal for Meadowlands Stadium Gives the Teams Reason to Cheer

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In his farewell address last week as governor of New Jersey, Richard J. Codey highlighted his deal to build a new stadium in the Meadowlands and singled out the team owners in the audience: John K. Mara and Steve Tisch of the Giants and Woody Johnson of the Jets.
 ''We watched a new day rise in the Meadowlands with the Giants and the Jets working together to build a new stadium at no cost to the taxpayers,'' said Mr. Codey, who has described the deal as a win-win for the football teams and for New Jersey residents. 
But as any fan knows, some wins are more lopsided than others. The new, 80,000-seat stadium promises to be a gold mine for the teams, and something less than that for the taxpayers. 
 The Giants and the Jets expect to make a killing: a combined $183.9 million a year from advertising and premium seats, according to a confidential financial document the teams are circulating among Wall Street bankers interested in financing the project. 
 That number does not include more than $100 million for each team in annual media revenues; more than $55 million in ticket sales for each team, plus millions more in profit from the halls of fame, restaurants, health clubs and stores they plan to build next to the stadium.
 The teams estimate that they could get a total of $17.5 million a year for the stadium's naming rights alone, which would be the most lucrative deal of its kind in professional sports in the United States. The document estimates the teams together could earn an additional $35 million a year in fees from corporate sponsors and advertisers whose logos will adorn the stadium.
 The Jets and Giants estimate that the 9,000 planned club seats, up from a mere 125 today, will generate a combined $30.8 million a year, after league revenue sharing. And the 200 or more luxury suites would bring in another $102.8 million, which the teams would share.
 With revenues like that, analysts say, the Jets and Giants would vault to the top ranks of professional sports teams.
 ''Based on these numbers, the Jets and Giants would be among the top three or four most profitable clubs in the National Football League,'' said Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp, a sports business consulting firm.
 Officials with the Jets and Giants, who declined to comment, are interviewing prospective lenders this week. The numbers in the financial document are only initial projections for the project, which is to be completed in 2009, but they do provide a rare glimpse inside the world of sports franchise and stadium financing.
 The agreement Mr. Codey signed with the Jets and the Giants fixes the rent at a total of $5 million a year for the next 25 years; the teams' payments in lieu of taxes are set at a combined $1.3 million for the next 15 years.
 The teams, in turn, got another perk that they do not have now: the ability to develop the property they control, with 520,000 square feet of sports stores, entertainment facilities, health and fitness centers and halls of fame. 
 One analyst estimated that the teams would each pay about $35 million a year in debt service on the money they borrow to build the stadium. To reduce their costs, each team plans to seek $150 million from the N.F.L.'s stadium building program, according to the documents.
 In addition to the $6.3 million in rent and fees that the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority would receive from the teams for the use of 75 acres -- they now control 30 acres -- the state would receive millions of dollars in sales tax revenue from tickets, merchandise and concessions, and in income taxes from the players for the days they are in the state.
 The authority would be stuck with $100 million in debt on the old stadium and would have to pay $30 million for utilities, sewers and other infrastructure for the new stadium.
 In addition, although the teams would be playing on publicly owned land, taxpayers would not get a cut of parking, luxury suite or advertising revenues, as they do under the current lease.
 In the past, team executives have said the Jets and the Giants are assuming a big risk by agreeing to privately finance a $1 billion stadium, a task no other sports team has taken on. They therefore did not want to give up revenues from parking, luxury boxes or anything else.
 The state must also acquire 20 acres in northern New Jersey for a Jets headquarters and training facility.
 Carl J. Goldberg, the chairman of the sports authority, has said that the cost of the land will be more than offset by the tax revenues derived from the team's training camp, which would move from Long Island.
 The Giants, whose offices are already at the existing stadium, are also getting the free use of 20 acres in the Meadowlands for training fields.
 George Zoffinger, the chief executive of the sports authority, was a vociferous critic of what he described as the one-sided nature of the new deal. But he was overruled by Mr. Codey.
 ''My job is to implement the board's decision, whether I agree with it or not,'' Mr. Zoffinger said yesterday. ''Everybody knows my thoughts on the financial terms.''
 Mr. Zoffinger and three of the authority's 14 commissioners -- Zulima V. Farber, who is the state attorney general designate; Joseph Buckelew; and David Jefferson -- voted against the agreement. 
 But both Mr. Ganis of SportsCorp and Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist who teaches at Smith College, say that Mr. Codey struck a good deal for the public with the Jets and Giants, by N.F.L. standards. 
 Cities including San Diego, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Buffalo used public money to cover 70 percent or more of the cost of new stadiums, while allowing the teams to reap most of the benefits.
 In this case, the two observers said, New Jersey will not subsidize either the construction or the maintenance of the stadium.
 The new stadium would allow the Giants and the Jets to exploit more fully their presence in the largest and most lucrative market in the country. Experts expect ticket prices to jump and the cost of luxury boxes to set a record.
 Indeed, the teams anticipate a naming rights deal that would exceed the current record holder -- $10 million a year at Reliant Stadium in Houston--by $7.5 million.
 ''That would be incredible,'' said Rob Bressler, editor of ''Inside the Ownership of Professional Sports Teams,'' an annual survey of the business. ''It would be the biggest by far.''

HEADLINE: Crunching Numbers to Keep Budgets Honest

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
A PLASTIC figurine of a talking yes-man sits grinning idiotically on a bookshelf in Diana Fortuna's Midtown office at the Citizens Budget Commission, the nonpartisan policy group she has led since 1998. The voice-activated gag gift utters comforting and mindless non sequiturs like, ''I couldn't agree with you more'' and ''I'm behind you all the way.'' Out of place in such a serious space? Definitely. But if Ms. Fortuna agreed to check her politics at the door when she left the White House Domestic Policy Council to run this government watchdog organization, she did not surrender her sense of humor. 
 Ms. Fortuna is, by current job definition, a thorn in the side of New York State's governor and New York City's mayor -- her agency uses classic number-crunching to lampoon and lambaste their budgets and policies. So the yes-man, a gift from colleagues during her stint in the city budget office in the Koch administration, provides the type of pep talk she rarely hears anymore. 
From the politicians she critiques -- well, what she mainly hears is indignation. (The possible exception is Councilman David Yassky of Brooklyn, whom she married in 1990. He is an equal partner in the raising of their two daughters, doesn't complain when she sneaks off to sing her workplace tensions away with the Grace Choral Society, and knows enough to let her balance their checkbook).
 ''You can't be afraid to get yelled at,'' she says with a little smirk of recognition. When she worked for Mayor Edward I. Koch, she remembers him howling over the way the Citizens Budget Commission carped about his budget. 
 ''This agency is like a burr to government, and needs to be one,'' Ms. Fortuna adds. ''What we do is focus on how government can be better; we also exist to tell the truth about government policies.'' She combines know-it-all elocution with unvarnished enthusiasm. Cynical she is not. 
 ''I love government, but government is inherently political and interested in looking as good as it can to potential voters,'' she says. 
 Like a good fiscal watchdog, Ms. Fortuna lugged the entire compendium of Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed $110.7 billion swan-song budget back from Albany this week. Where someone else might place a vase of flowers for visual relief from the paperwork that smothers the rest of the surfaces, Ms. Fortuna, adrenaline-fueled at 49, positioned the budget like sculpture. And yes, she considers it a must read.
 ''We come from the perspective of being firmly rooted in the numbers,'' she says. ''Our basic product here is research. To us, every number tells a story.''
 It seems like only yesterday -- actually, it was 2004 -- when Ms. Fortuna, irritated by Albany's 20th consecutive year of belated budgets, and the sixth on her commission watch, went from watchdog to attack dog and assailed the state budget process as ''a landmark case of lousy government.'' Last year the budget was approved in a timely fashion, which she optimistically regards as ''a glimmer of reform activity.'' 
 This year she has been gentler in her reaction to Mr. Pataki's 12th and last state budget.
 ''It's a hard one to characterize,'' she says. ''It's good in that it seems pretty legitimately balanced with a real minimum of gimmicks'' -- she despises gimmicks --''with even a small amount allocated for debt reduction,'' she says, alluding to the state's $49.4 billion debt, which she terms a fiscal danger zone. ''Debt is of particular concern to us: it is the ultimate political temptation to announce good works and pass the cost off to future generations.''
 She is also annoyed that Mr. Pataki's budget ignores a court order, which the state is appealing, that the state must increase aid to New York City schools, beginning with $2.8 billion. ''That's the giant unresolved issue hanging over both the state and city budgets,'' she said.
 MS. FORTUNA says her agency's relationship with City Hall is open, if not cordial: ''I don't think the mayor is always happy with us, but we've managed to keep the lines of communication open, which has historically not been a given.'' Both the Koch and Giuliani administrations retracted the welcome mat when the Citizens Budget Commission came calling and often boycotted its events.
 But if Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg feels a tad of gratitude toward Ms. Fortuna for introducing him to his companion, Diana Taylor, at a commission luncheon in 2000 -- ''I sat and thought a lot about which of our trustees should sit next to the media tycoon who was thinking of running for mayor'' -- he has not verbalized it. Not even a thank-you note!
 She does keep one piece of political memorabilia framed above her desk: a generic but generous thank-you note from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to her maternal grandfather, a city treasurer in Hamtramck, Mich.
 Ms. Fortuna was raised in Detroit in a working-class household where the political ticket was split between her father, who was a Republican and a Teamster, and her mother, a party-line Democrat who died of a brain tumor when Ms. Fortuna was 16. Nudged by her father toward government, she received an economics degree from Harvard and an M.B.A. from Columbia.
 ''At business school I stuck out like a sore thumb,'' she says. ''Everyone else wanted to make millions, and I wanted to change the world.'' Which explains the wording on her Martin Luther King poster: ''Everybody can be great because everybody can serve.'' Her interpretation? ''It's all about the effort to use public power to improve people's lives; that has always seemed like the highest calling. Sounds corny, but it's how I feel.''
