HEADLINE: Here's a Great Tax

BYLINE: By Fritz Hollings; Fritz Hollings, a Democrat, is Senator from South Carolina.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At his inauguration as President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel declared, "We have been lying to one other for 40 years . . . saying one thing and believing another." President Clinton echoed a similar sentiment in his own inaugural, challenging us to "break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing." We Americans have been lying to one other for 12 years, saying one thing and believing another. The mother of all lies in the Reagan-Bush era was the claim that there is a free lunch -- that deficits don't matter or that they can be eliminated painlessly, strictly by cutting spending. 
 Yet even if we eliminate domestic discretionary spending in its entirety -- some $214 billion -- we would still end up with a deficit of nearly $200 billion. Then cut $50 billion from defense and we are down to a $150 billion deficit. If we deny cost-of-living increases for Social Security and most entitlements, the money saved stays in the trust fund. We still have a $150 billion deficit and have done nothing to eliminate the debt.
We should provide an investment stimulus package, but it must be financed solely through budget freezes and cuts so it doesn't raise the deficit. We would still need taxes. And we can't afford to dally with political gamesmanship, such as demanding two-thirds in spending cuts for every one-third in tax increases. A trillion dollars is needed to eliminate the deficit in five years, and a cut of two-thirds of a trillion would destroy the Government.
We will never have a more determined spending cutter than Ronald Reagan, yet not even he could stanch the deficits through spending cuts alone. Mr. Reagan raised taxes repeatedly, as did George Bush -- taxing gas, tobacco, liquor and luxuries, while raising user fees and closing loopholes. Even this was utterly inadequate; the deficit continued to soar.
Today, it would be a mistake to launch yet another exercise in inadequacy by taxing the rich -- raising the top income bracket from 31 percent to 36 percent -- and levying an energy tax. These are half-measures. If President Clinton chooses this route, he will still end up with a deficit in 1996 almost as big as the one he inherited from Mr. Bush.
Face facts. The deficit and debt are growing faster than the economy. Interest costs are eating us alive. On this year's $400 billion deficit, additional interest costs alone will increase by $30 billion. So we find ourselves echoing Lewis Carroll: "It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast."
It will take real money to get rid of the deficit and debt, yet we must act with caution to avoid killing the recovery. A value-added tax, which is much like a national sales tax, is just what the doctor ordered. It would take at least a year after enactment to carry out a VAT, which would tax a good's increased value at each stage of production. This period would give the economy a chance for a firm recovery. At the same time, financial markets and Americans would know that we are finally on the road toward a pay-as-you-go government. Once instituted, a 5 percent value-added tax would bring in more than $100 billion. Every dollar of revenue would have to be put in a Deficit and Debt Reduction Trust Fund; not a dime would go for new spending programs.
A VAT is a tax on consumption. The more you consume, the more you pay. Yes, it is regressive. But nothing is more regressive than interest costs. And the economies of our international competitors certainly have not been hobbled by VAT taxes.
In Europe, the average value-added tax is 16 percent; in Korea it's 25 percent. And under the GATT rules of international trade, the tax is refunded on goods leaving a country. So a foreign good can be cheaper here because the value-added tax was eliminated by the time it got to the U.S. Thus, the huge disadvantage the U.S. now suffers in world trade could be alleviated if we had a VAT. Under current trade rules, the economist Lester Thurow says, any nation that does not have one is "stupid."
Best of all, this one-shot jolt avoids special-interest lobbying and is politically attainable. It calls for sacrifice from all. If we really want to promote investment, create jobs and restore confidence in government, now is the time to hit the problem head on, once and for all.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
Words Got The Best of Cal Coach

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., Feb. 14

 BODY:
Lou Campanelli's post-game tirades, for mature audiences only, were ultimately what got him dismissed here last week from his job as the University of California's head basketball coach.
His words were perhaps no coarser than Coach Bob Knight's at Indiana. But the Cal athletic director, Robert Bockrath, inadvertently listened in on Campanelli one night recently, and that made the difference. 
 In essence, Campanelli was ruined by the strong acoustics of a locker room in Tempe, Ariz. On the evening of Feb. 4, after a loss to Arizona State, Bockrath entered "a wrong door by accident," he said, and found himself only a partition away from the locker room. He overheard a profane lecture by Campanelli to the team.
Bockrath once played football for Bo Schembechler at Miami of Ohio and maintains "I can swear with the rest," but he found himself appalled by what he called Campanelli's "personal attacks" on the players.
"There were things that were unwarranted and inappropriate and inexcusable," Bockrath said Friday. "It was so incredibly bad, I said, 'Sheesh, something must be done.' The players were beaten down and in trouble psychologically. Every other word was a four-letter one. Let me tell you, if I hadn't made that wrong turn, I wouldn't have known the fix the team was in."
Four days later, last Monday, Campanelli was a deposed coach.
The action was a further example of what appears to be a new, less-tolerant attitude toward college coaches with severe styles.
Just days before Campanelli was dismissed, Army fired its basketball coach, Tom Miller, for "publically degrading" his players even though he had been given two warnings. In November, Earle Bruce was fired as football coach at Colorado State for what school administrators called the physical and mental abuse of players.
Bockrath said he simply would not tolerate behavior by a coach that could be considered abusive. "Times have changed," he said.
The 54-year-old Campanelli, of course, sees the issues surrounding his dismissal very differently.
"What you say in a locker room should be between the coach and the players," Campanelli said Friday. "No one else's business. I may have used some curse words. From George Raveling to Bobby Knight to Dean Smith, there's not a coach in the country who doesn't."
 
Coaches Wonder: What the Heck?
 Across the country last week, coaches concurred with Campanelli. "If you fired every coach who swore or yelled, unemployment in this country jumps up 10 percent," said Raveling, the Southern California basketball coach.
Last Tuesday, Knight telephoned Pete Newell, the eminent former Cal coach, and offered his help to Campanelli.
Most of all, other coaches were concerned that Bockrath, hired by Cal in August 1991 after 11 years at Arizona, had removed Campanelli without giving him an opportunity to soften his caustic tongue.
"He wouldn't have changed," Bockrath, 49, said last week. "If you'd have heard him go off on these guys, you wouldn't have told him to lighten up, either. You'd have just wanted to put a cork in the dike."
Campanelli said: "Well, I did nothing immoral. When you commit a crime, you at least get a trial. All I got was a bullet to the head."
 
The Business of Winning
 The crux of the matter might be that Campanelli, a successful head coach at James Madison from 1972 to 1985 before joining Cal, acted like Knight but did not win like Knight. In his seven previous seasons here, his teams managed only one trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
Also, Campanelli wasn't even aware he had driven such a wedge between him and his players. Last Monday, speaking with Bockrath, he could not even accurately name his allies on the team.
"When I told Lou last Monday he was fired," said Bockrath, who had received reports of player dissatisfaction with the coach for several weeks, "he sat in my office and said: 'Why? Why Bob? Go ask Jason Kidd about me. Go ask Brian Hendrick.' And I'm thinking: 'Lou, if you only knew. Jason and Brian aren't for you.' "
Hendrick is the senior captain of the team, Kidd its star freshman guard.
The discord traces to last season. Players say Campanelli had belittled the 1991-92 team, which finished with a 10-18 record. "We finally tuned him out the last two games and won them both," Alfred Grigsby, a starting forward, recalled Friday.
 
First a Loss, Then the Lunch Boxes
 Cal swept its first five games this season to gain a rare top 25 ranking. Then on Dec. 29, the team lost to James Madison, Campanelli's previous employer. In the locker room, Campanelli swept the team's box lunches off a table and kicked them. According to his players, the coach, who grew up in Springfield, N.J., said, "You have embarrassed me in front of my family," and then refused to ride in the team bus.
"We're like, 'Oh, uh-huh, he can't be with us now that we lost,' " Grigsby said. "And we were like: 'Wow, it's starting again like last year. We're getting the blame for everything.' It should be all of our faults, not just the players' fault."
Campanelli said of the lunch-box incident: "I just knocked them off the table. Come on. After the way we played back there, sure, I was upset."
As a result of Campanelli's explosion at the Meadowlands, the players were listless in a loss to Cornell the next evening. "Nobody wanted to play," Grigsby recalled.
By January, the friction had reached a new level. Although Bockrath didn't know it at the time, Stevie Johnson, who was redshirted as a freshman last season, had called his father in Baltimore and accused Campanelli of what Johnson considered a racist comment.
"I'm not suggesting my son's a saint," said Johnson's father, Leroy, a history professor who commutes to Boston to teach at Northeastern University. "And I don't know what Campanelli's intentions were because I wasn't there, and I don't know if it was intended to be a racist remark. But he told my son before I came out to visit this year: 'Stevie, you better get your dunks in when your father comes, because next year you might be back in Baltimore working in a factory or driving a pickup truck.'
"I got out there and my son was still talking about it. There are other ways to motivate people than to denigrate them."
 
'Gave Love and Care'
 Campanelli recalls the "factory" statement. When told that Stevie Johnson considered it a racial comment, the coach said: "Are you serious? I did everything to help that young man. Spent hours with that young man. Gave love and care. He was flunking out, and I was trying to spur him on. I said: 'What are you going to do when you're back in Baltimore? That's real life.' Stevie laughed."
Leroy Johnson said he has told his son not to discuss the incident. Bockrath said, "Part of Lou's problem is his way of spurring people on was kicking them down."
In a home game on Jan. 30 against Washington State, Cal allowed a 3-point shot at the end of the first half that reduced the Golden Bears' lead to 17. Campanelli berated them during intermission.
"We can take constructive criticism, but not destructive," Grigsby said. "We're up 17. He came in there yelling like we were losing."
Then they did lose that game, by 8 points. In the locker room, Campanelli called Kidd, widely considered the best high school player in the country the year before, a "prima donna."
"You think you know everything about the game," the coach said.
Kidd said last week: "I'm not saying coach wore out his welcome, but his tactics weren't working. We were a plane about to crash and burn, and we could've easily fallen to the cellar."
"Listen," Kidd continued, "Coach Campanelli had nothing to do with my decision to come to Cal. It was the assistant, Todd Bozeman, who got me. If not for Todd, I'm at Kentucky or Kansas."
Bozeman was named last week as Cal's interim head coach.
 
'A Dummy'
 It was also during the Washington State game that Campanelli called Murray, a starting forward, "a dummy" for not stalling when the coach had signaled for a slowdown. "Lamond just didn't see his message from the bench," said Murray's mother, Phora. "Lou pulled him out and called him a dummy in front of the whole team."
A week before the Washington State game, the team had managed to defeat U.C.L.A. by 22 points at Pauley Pavilion, leading observers to believe Cal was in unison. But sophomore forward Monty Buckley said the team was focused in Los Angeles only because the father of freshman Jerod Haase had died two days before.
"We blocked out Coach Campanelli and just played," Grigsby said.
Campanelli said Friday that Bockrath wrote him an encouraging letter after the U.C.L.A. rout, which he claimed made his firing more atrocious. But Bockrath said he simply passed along to the coach a nice letter from a Cal alumnus.
"I just wrote, 'Great game, keep up the good work,' down in the corner of it," said Bockrath. "There was no personal letter from me."
In January, Bockrath had begun to hear snippet accounts of Campanelli's player-bashing. Johnson and reserve guard K. J. Roberts spoke individually to him of the goings-on, and Roberts's father, Ken, called the athletic director as well.
Then, Bockrath heard Campanelli's wrath for himself at Arizona State.
 
Another Partition, More Words
 Bockrath said he contemplated dismissing the coach that night. Then, three days later, on Feb. 7, Cal lost to Arizona, and the athletic director heard Campanelli use more expletives in his post-game speech.
Bockrath listened to the coach through a partition -- "I walked in another wrong door by accident, I'm telling you," he said -- and heard Campanelli issue somewhat of an ultimatum to the team, telling players to "decide where they were going to go from here."
Straight to see Bockrath, as it turned out.
On a bus ride home, the players called a team meeting. Then, in the privacy of their locker room here, they voted to alert the athletic director of their discontent as a group.
"That day, that's when we knew it was time for a change," Grigsby said. "We said if one person didn't agree, then we wouldn't go to the athletic director. But nobody disagreed."
Hendrick, the team captain, alerted Bockrath last Monday that the team wanted to see him. Then Hendrick and Bockrath drove together to meet the rest of the team in the office of Vice Chancellor Daniel Boggan Jr. Ten of the team's 12 players were present, and the two who were not at the meeting -- Kidd and Haase -- told their teammates they would have been there if it had been possible. Kidd was ill that day, and Haase had a class he could not afford to skip.
What the players did not know was that Bockrath had already decided late Sunday night that he would fire Campanelli.
"There's the impression that the players came to me with threats of mutiny and all this kind of thing, which did not happen," Bockrath said. "As a matter of fact, I made the recommendation to dismiss Campanelli Monday morning, and I didn't know about meeting with them until 1 o'clock in the afternoon. I simply listened to them, and all they did was reaffirm in my own mind that what I did was right.
"They did not say that they wanted Lou fired, and they did not threaten to boycott or walk out. None of that happened."
 
Sparing the Censors
 At a news conference that night, Bockrath did not tell reporters he had fired Campanelli because of abusive language.
"I couldn't," he explained. "The TV censors would've had a hard time dealing with the copy if I'd described it."
Instead, Bockrath was initially vague, saying the program was going in the "wrong direction."
So, from afar, considering that Cal then had a 10-7 record (now 12-7 after a rout of Stanford today), the dismissal reeked of dirty pool. The National Association of Basketball Coaches got in touch with Bockrath to investigate.
Also, Campanelli was telling his coaching friends that the 29-year-old Bozeman, his top recruiting assistant coach, had undermined him to gain the interim job.
When Bozeman telephoned Campanelli to deny this, Campanelli refused to talk to him. Campanelli was so incensed that he asked the two other remaining assistants -- Jeff Wulbrun and Eric Hughes -- to resign, but only Wulbrun did. Hughes did not, he said, because he did not believe Bozeman orchestrated a player revolt.
 
A Freeze-Out for Coach?
 Bozeman said he has taken the interim job "because I've got a family to support." Bockrath said Bozeman may face a boycott within the coaching community.
"It has been suggested to Todd that he should bail out or his future in coaching is in jeopardy," Bockrath said. "I'm telling you, Todd had nothing to do with the firing."
Meanwhile, a skeptical Campanelli fumes. "I was fired over abusive language? That's ridiculous," he said. "Ask Brian Hendrick. He was with me five years. Ask Brian Hendrick."
Hendrick, the captain, rounded up later that day, said in a monotone: "Well, Coach was a screamer, to say the least. I'd grown numb to it myself, but it was to the point that the other guys felt it was getting too personal. I'm with them."

HEADLINE: CLINTON TELLS MIDDLE CLASS IT NOW FACES A TAX INCREASE BECAUSE DEFICIT HAS GROWN

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
For the first time, President Clinton told middle-income Americans tonight that it was necessary to raise their taxes to help cut the deficit and put the nation on the path to prosperity.
Setting aside economic intricacies, Mr. Clinton used plain language in his first televised address from the Oval Office to prepare millions of viewers for the speech he will deliver Wednesday night, when he will lay out his often-painful remedies for the economy to a joint session of Congress. 
 Looking directly into the camera, his hands clasped on his desk as he delivered what he described as "a call to arms," Mr. Clinton delivered a message that was a far cry from the tax relief and other programs he promised in last year's Presidential campaign.
 
More Must Contribute
 "I had hoped to invest in your future by creating jobs, expanding education, reforming health care and reducing the debt without asking more of you," he said.
"But I can't -- because the deficit has increased so much beyond my earlier estimates and beyond even the worst official Government estimates of last year. We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today so that all Americans can do better tomorrow.
"But I can assure you of this: you're not going alone, you're not going first, and you're no longer going to pay more and get less."
 
Blaming His Predecessors
 Seeking to leaven the blunt warning of sacrifice by taking aim at the wealthy, Mr. Clinton went on to say, "Seventy percent of the new taxes I'll propose -- 70 percent -- will be paid by those who make more than $100,000 a year."
The 10-minute speech was long on atmospherics and an appeal to long-held expectations. "Once, our living standards doubled every 25 years," Mr. Clinton said. "But at the rate we're going today, our living standard won't double for another hundred years, until our grandchildren's grandchildren are born. That's too long."
Mr. Clinton only hinted at the specific sacrifice that middle-class Americans would have to make. Without mentioning his Republican predecessors directly, Mr. Clinton sought to lay blame on those two men, who presided over a deficit that "roared out of control."
"But in the 26 days I've been your President," he added, "I've already learned that here in Washington common sense isn't too common, and you've paid a lot for that loss of common sense."
Seeking to play down the notion that the nation was in an economic recovery, Mr. Clinton noted that more than nine million Americans were still jobless. "If this were a normal recovery," he said, "more than three million would be back at work."
And Mr. Clinton seemed to define anyone who might criticize his plan as part of a "special interest" and questioned the patriotism of those opponents.
"Within minutes of the time I conclude my address to Congress Wednesday night," he said, "the special interests will be out in force." He declared that "every step of the way, they'll oppose it -- many have already lined the corridors of power with high-priced lobbyists."
 
Borrowing From Reagan
 He added, "When I was a boy, we had a name for the belief that we should all pull together to build a better, stronger nation. We called it patriotism, and we still do."
Mr. Clinton was borrowing heavily from the playbook of President Ronald Reagan, who presented his plans for a tax cut to the country in his first address from the Oval Office in 1981 before he gave them to Congress. But the charts Mr. Clinton used to make his points (with deep red for the soaring deficit) could not help but recall Ross Perot, who sometimes overshadowed him during last year's Presidential campaign by his repeated emphasis on taming the deficit through personal sacrifice in homespun talks to voters as he pointed to visual aids.
Asked about Mr. Perot, George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said today that "we'll make sure that that he understands the economic program."
In a response that was taped before the President's speech, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said, "We want to cooperate with President Clinton." But he warned: "We'll be working with you to make certain that 'sacrifice' isn't just a Presidential code word for more taxes, more spending and more mandates from Washington."
Though Mr. Clinton spoke mostly in general terms, many details of the plan have emerged in recent days, including increases in financing for programs like Head Start and a $31 billion package to stimulate the economy in the short term through jobs and public works projects. The most painful part of the program is a long-term effort to curb the deficit with about $500 billion in tax increases and spending cuts over four years.
 
'What He Stands For'
 Although Mr. Clinton had already delivered speeches and two radio addresses on the economy, White House officials said they believed that by speaking directly from the formal setting of the White House the President could most effectively communicate to the public the gravity of the situation and the importance of his economic program. The President has devoted hundreds of hours to line-by-line analysis of economic proposals, but his aides said they did not want him to talk in specifics tonight.
"It was important to establish a context and for Clinton to tell something personal about his values and what he stands for," said Rahm Emanuel, the White House political director. "He wanted to talk about where we are, rather than have people see the economy in a mechanical way."
The President consulted many political and economic advisers about the speech, and as is his way, he was still working on it moments before it was broadcast. It was quite a departure from the last 12 years, when the Oval Office addresses of Mr. Reagan and George Bush were almost always written in enough time to give copies of prepared remarks to reporters before they were delivered.
"He fiddles, he's a fiddler," said one White House adviser who helped fine-tune the speech tonight. "I was in there at 7, and he was still working through it."
Mr. Clinton's talk tonight was a prelude to a week of barnstorming that in turn begins a selling process that will continue as long as it takes for the plan to wend its way through Congress. Continuing his courting of lawmakers, the President had two more White House meetings today with groups of Democrats and has scheduled more meetings for Tuesday. Several lawmakers who have emerged from the sessions said they were generally supportive of the President but would stay noncommittal until they examined the entire economic package.
 
Question Session Possible
 White House officials said they were still considering an offer from Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, that the President appear in the House chambers on Thursday and take questions from lawmakers, much as the British Prime Minister does in Parliament.
White House officials said that Mr. Clinton was leaning toward making the appearance, but that some advisers were divided about the wisdom of such a move. Some were concerned that it would set a precedent, leading members to expect the President to appear in person on other major issues.
On Thursday and Friday, the President has scheduled a speaking tour, stopping first in St. Louis, then Chillicothe, Ohio, and probably Hyde Park, N.Y. The President will fly to the West Coast on Sunday for a two- or three-day trip.
One element of his program is very likely to be an energy tax, and Mr. Clinton suggested today that he was leaning toward something broader than a gasoline tax. He said today that he favored a broad system that would tax each unit of energy, no matter what the source.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Schools: Hobbled and Hurting

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Like the city it is supposed to serve, the Los Angeles public school system is a stricken giant, hobbled by financial problems, a threatened teachers' strike and racial and ethnic strife.
Overcrowded classrooms, leaky roofs, outdated textbooks, metal detectors and police officers patrolling schools are common in America's inner-city schools. 
 But no urban education system has faced as sudden a demographic and economic upheaval as the Los Angeles Unified School District, which serves a city reeling from immigration and recession.
And no other district must solve its problems in the tinderbox atmosphere that prevails here less than a year after rioting revealed the jagged fault lines between rich and poor, white and nonwhite, American born and foreign born in the nation's second-largest city and its suburbs.
 
Diversity vs. Divisiveness
 Volatile issues abound: the impending strike, a debate about dividing the behemoth district and a decision about a superintendent. The timing of these difficulties could not be worse, said John W. Mack, president of the local chapter of the Urban League.
"Diversity has almost become synonymous with divisiveness here," Mr. Mack said. "We don't need any more flash points."
Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, a lobbying group in Washington, said that part of the problem in Los Angeles is endemic to urban education. But part, he said, is "the scale of their operation and the complexity and diversity of their student body."
The Los Angeles school district, which sprawls over 708 square miles, includes all or part of 28 cities and, unlike the even larger New York City system, does not have a decentralized structure.
California's fiscal crisis, the most intractable in the nation, has eroded school spending statewide and turned a bellwether system into an also-ran, with spending per student now at $4,187, compared with about $7,300 in New York City. But even compared with other strapped cities in California, the toll has been harsh here, where immigrants, both legal and illegal, have swelled school enrollment to 641,000.
Nowhere is the impact of immigration more evident than in the district's classrooms, which absorbed 45,000 newcomers from 1989 to 1992, an 8 percent increase. Many of these new students are impoverished, illiterate Latin American or Southeast Asian immigrants who have never read a book or worn a pair of shoes and whose special needs are taxing the mostly white teaching corps.
"You feel inadequate if you don't speak another language," said Ed Zschoche, a sixth grade teacher at Gage Middle School. "You're accused of racism if you use discipline."
Even bilingual teachers are under stress. Irene Barillas, a native of El Salvador who teaches at Belmont High School, said, "I thought I would be doing what I learned in college, you know -- 'Let's read a novel.' " She said she empathizes with the white teachers, but added, "Wallowing isn't going to do anybody any good."
 
Still Losing Ground
 In the areas where two, three and four immigrant families live together in inadequate housing, school officials have been unable to keep pace. They have watched class sizes grow to more than 40 in high schools. They have put up portable classrooms, opened schools year round, adopted staggered schedules and bused 16,000 students to the less-crowded San Fernando Valley, clear across a mountain range and nearly two hours away on clogged freeways.
A particularly hard-hit area is Huntington Park, a Hispanic enclave southeast of the city. Within a few blocks of each other are an elementary school with 2,500 students, a middle school with 3,200 and a high school with 3,800 -- a combined student population bigger than most districts in the state.
The huge grade school remains hospitable. But the high school and junior high school are dirty, noisy places. Gail Rolf, a high school health teacher, said her room had not been swept for more than five weeks. And Mr. Zschoche's (pronounced SHOCK-ee) middle school students use rank bathrooms and a library without shelves.
Parents say their children deserve better. "If the place isn't half decent looking, you're not going to do your best work," said Sergio Palos, a printer with five children.
 
Strike Pends This Month
 Facing a 12 percent pay cut, teachers have called a strike for Feb. 23 unless Willie Brown, the shrewd Speaker of the California Assembly, succeeds in his mediation efforts. The cuts in pay and benefits would close half the $400 million gap in the district's $3.9 billion budget and would lower the teachers' salary ranking from first in the nation to seventh. The average teacher in Los Angeles is now paid $38,700, down from $44,000, compared with $41,000 in New York City.
Resentful Los Angeles teachers, who got a 26 percent increase over three years after a 1989 strike, say they are spending less of their own money on classroom supplies and less of their own time tutoring and supervising children. Parents, even those supportive of union demands, are angry.
 
'My Expectations Diminish'
 Students, for their part, seem sympathetic toward the teachers and well-versed in the sad saga of state budget cuts. "The government, they're the ones with the money, and they're hurting us a lot," said Ernesto Fuentes, a senior at Belmont High. "It just makes me not believe in the system. My expectations diminish."
Civic leaders worry that a long strike would coincide with verdicts in two trials related to last spring's riots: the Federal civil rights trial of four white police officers accused of beating a black motorist, Rodney G. King; and the state trial of three black men charged with beating a white truck driver, Reginald O. Denny, during the riots.
When schools were shut down during the April riots, high school and middle school students were among the looters.
Added to this already tense mix is the emotional debate about breaking up the school district.
Leaders of the breakup movement, based in the middle-class San Fernando Valley, argue that the sheer size of the system makes efficient management impossible. Critics, based in Hispanic and black inner-city neighborhoods, counter that dismantling the district would mean de facto segregation, more by class than by race.
 
The 'Black-Brown Thing'
 While black and Hispanic residents generally speak as one on the matter of dividing the district into smaller parts, they will compete fiercely for the superintendent's post. Sidney A. Thompson, who is black, got the job temporarily after the abrupt resignation in October of Bill Anton, the district's first Hispanic leader.
The interim selection of Mr. Thompson stirred up what he and others called the "black-brown thing." And that was only a dress rehearsal for the ultimate sweepstakes, which now includes Joseph A. Fernandez, a noted educational reformer of Hispanic descent who has been dismissed as chancellor of the New York City schools.
Administrators, teachers, parents and students have divided opinions about the strike, the break-up proposals and the search for a superintendent. But they share a sense of alarm about the day-to-day realities in and around their schools.
 
Disturbed, Sad, Embarrassed
 All are disturbed that teen-agers grind metal into weapons in the machine shop at Manual Arts High School because they feel a need to defend themselves in the streets.
All are saddened that the teachers' union locks its supply room during meetings so its members do not steal the paper and pencils that they have run out of at school.
All are embarrassed that deferred maintenance costs for the school buildings have balloonedto $611 million, with painting and roofing on 40-year cycles.
And all are frightened by the violent deaths of two fourth graders at Belvedere Elementary School in the space of a year in a neighborhood that is home to 31 gangs.
But this unanimity breaks down when the subject turns to the ethnic and racial fissures in Los Angeles, America's new port of entry.
 
Cultures in Collision
 Students on lunch break at Belmont High School, virtually all of them Hispanic, segregate themselves according to nationality and length of time in this country. For some reason, only the athletes speak English among themselves.
Some parents and Hispanic activists at Gage Middle School claim that white and black teachers are not suitable educators for their children.
And teachers throughout the district debate whether it is best to celebrate the language and culture of immigrant youngsters or to force them to adopt American ways.
Some complain that they spend more time commemorating Cinco de Mayo, the Vietnamese New Year and Kwanzaa than teaching reading, writing and arithmetic. Others counter that such criticism is sour grapes from those who are not certified to earn the extra $5,000 a year that goes to bilingual instructors.
Some point out that bilingual certification depends on passing a test about Mexican culture and history, with no mention of El Salvador, Nicaragua or other Latin American countries whose citizens have recently flocked here. And others yearn for seminars on how to teach these children or for sabbaticals to attend language school.
To Mike Roos, a former State Assemblyman who was an author of a plan to restructure the Los Angeles schools and whose daughter attends a public high school here, it is the district's ethnic makeup that is so confounding.
"If these were Euro-American kids, regardless of how they were doing, there would be less of a sense that things were going wrong," Mr. Roos said. "We don't know how to reach Salvadoran refugees, Vietnamese boat people, African-Americans whose neighborhoods are full of crack. There is a widening gulf between those of us in charge and the successor generation. We can't relate to their reality."

HEADLINE: People Are Ready for Sacrifices, Poll Finds, and Expect Fairness

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
Although Americans are more judgmental about President Clinton's performance than they were about his two predecessors at this early stage, most remain open to the prospect of dramatic changes in taxing, spending and the way the White House is run, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
While the new President irritated many Americans by giving a lot of attention after his inauguration to the issue of homosexuals in the military, he still has the confidence of most people, who seem ready to make some sacrifices to fix the bedeviling deficit. 
 And in his prime-time television address last night, Mr. Clinton reached out directly to those people, saying the middle class would have to pay more taxes to restore the nation's economic health. In the poll, conducted last week, most Americans said they did think it would be necessary for the Government to increase their taxes, that they expected that it would be done fairly and that they would be willing to postpone any cut in taxes for the middle class.
 
Support for Hillary Clinton
 The poll found that there was applause for the revolutionary role of the First Lady, with 6 out of 10 Americans saying Hillary Rodham Clinton is qualified to head the President's health-care commission and a similar number saying it is appropriate for the President to appoint his wife to that post. By contrast, Vice President Al Gore seems to be suffering from "a Quayle effect," with the number of Americans who hold any opinion about him shrinking substantially since the election.
Although a majority of Americans still think the economy is in bad shape, the proportion who think it is getting better has continued to creep up. The country is still jittery about unemployment, with 40 percent of those polled saying the chances were high that an adult in their family would be out of work and looking for a job in the next 12 months. By comparison, in April 1991, in the afterglow of the Persian Gulf war, only 22 percent expressed that same anxiety.
"We own two small hardware stores, and times are tough," said Nancy Bowald, 30, a mother of four from Eureka, Ill., one of a number of people called for a follow-up interview to the poll. "I don't know if Clinton will cut the deficit or turn around the economy, but I'm optimistic that he's trying. He's not just in there to push a bunch of buttons and play at being powerful."
Sixty-seven percent of those polled said job creation should be even more of an immediate priority than deficit reduction for the new Administration.
The new poll, which included 1,154 respondents nationwide interviewed by telephone Feb. 9-11, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Asked to Give More
 In his speech from the Oval Office, the President warned the majority of Americans, "those of you who gave the most in the 1980's," that higher taxes were coming. He said that while 70 percent of his new taxes would come from people making more than $100,000 a year, the remaining 30 percent would be from the bulk of the population with incomes below that.
The poll suggests that he was speaking to a receptive population.
Mr. Clinton said he was taking the difficult steps because the Federal deficit was so much worse than he thought during the Presidential campaign. In the poll, two-thirds of Americans said that if the President was to back out of campaign promises it would be because he discovered that problems were worse than he had thought.
A 54 percent majority said they expected it would be necessary to increase their taxes to reduce the deficit, and 56 percent said they expected that any tax increases would be carried out in a way that was fair to people like them.
 
Generosity Has Limits
 During his campaign, Mr. Clinton promised to cut taxes for the middle class, but the poll found that 7 in 10 Americans said they would be willing to delay such a cut to help reduce the deficit.
But while the public seems more receptive now to the idea of paying more taxes to cut the deficit, its generosity has limits.
In 1990, 47 percent of the respondents in a Times/CBS News poll said they would be willing to pay $100 more a year in Federal taxes to reduce the deficit, but in the latest poll, that percentage jumped to 58 percent.
When asked if they were willing to pay $500 more a year in taxes to reduce the deficit, however, the percentage who said yes melted to 14.
 
Energy Tax Unpopular
 And Americans are touchy about the kinds of taxes they are willing to accept, with an energy tax getting thumbs down from 57 percent of those polled compared with 41 percent who gave it thumbs up.
While any meddling with Social Security has long been viewed as political suicide, nearly half the respondents supported increasing the portion of benefits subject to tax.
The debates over taxes and Social Security seem not to have hurt Mr. Clinton. Fifty-three percent of Americans approved of the way he has been handling his job as President, while 30 percent disapproved and 17 percent expressed no opinion.
That level of approval is about the same as the 55 percent Ronald Reagan had in a February 1981 Gallup poll and a bit lower than the 61 percent rating George Bush earned in a February 1989 Times/CBS News poll.
 
Disapproval Is Higher
 But opinion seems to be solidifying or crystallizing sooner for Mr. Clinton than for recent past Presidents. His level of disapproval is markedly higher than those of his predecessors: Mr. Reagan had just 18 percent disapproval in his first act, and Mr. Bush had only 9 percent.
Unlike Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, who won a majority of the popular vote, Mr. Clinton entered office with much more fractured support, since a majority of voters in November preferred either George Bush or Ross Perot.
In his debut months, Mr. Reagan was talking tax cuts, not tax increases. And because Mr. Bush did little of substance in his first 100 days, there were few major initiatives to stir up the public, one way or another.
What is striking about Mr. Clinton is that while he still has a cache of good will, people seem to be taking sides for or against him at a faster pace than they usually do. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan had a much higher proportion of people reserving judgment about their performance at this stage.
 
Misplaced Emphasis Is Seen
 No single event or theme jumped out in terms of what people liked best about the new President so far. Mr. Clinton received spontaneous praise from 9 percent of respondents for being a leader who cared about the people, from 8 percent for cutting the White House staff and from 5 percent for passage of the family-leave bill. His more liberal stance toward homosexuals, including his push to allow them to serve in the military, was also volunteered in a positive way by 5 percent.
When asked what they liked least about what Mr. Clinton had done so far as President, one answer swamped all the others: 31 percent spontaneously cited homosexuals in the military, with respondents upset by the priority and prominence given to the issue by Mr. Clinton, as well as by the issue itself.
"Let's be honest -- Clinton has a bunch of issues on his plate," said Scott Dunbar, 38, a salesman from Naperville, outside Chicago. "We have world hunger, terrorism, kids shooting each other in the inner city, the deficit, education, and the very first priority is getting gays in the military? He's not doing much of a job taking the pulse of the people."
Only 5 percent of the respondents mentioned being disappointed by the "clatter of campaign promises being cast off," as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, put it, and another 5 percent mentioned the Administration's clunky efforts to find an Attorney General.
 
'Business as Usual'?
 A majority indicated that they were less than inspired by Mr. Clinton's appointments so far: 24 percent said Mr. Clinton had brought people with higher standards of conduct and public service to Washington, but twice as many, 53 percent, said the new people were just like all the rest.
"Lloyd Bentsen? More business as usual," said Steve Smiley, 40, the vice president of operations of a manufacturing company who lives in Mequon, a suburb of Milwaukee.
Nancy Bowald of Eureka gave the President a better grade: "I think he's trying for a higher standard, not the same old rich, elite silver spoons."
While 35 percent said that the women nominated for high office by Mr. Clinton have been subject to stricter standards than the men, 51 percent said there was not much difference. There was a gender gap on this issue, with 41 percent of the women seeing a stricter standard being applied compared with 28 percent of the men who saw that.
 
On Illegal Aliens
 On the issue of "Nannygate," 18 percent said they knew someone who at some time employed an illegal alien. But Americans were narrowly split on whether this should disqualify a person from high office: 44 percent said yes, while 47 percent said no.
Nineteen percent said someone in their household might at some time have paid domestic help $50 or more in a three-month period without paying Social Security taxes. And a majority, 54 percent, was eager for a change in the law requiring Social Security taxes to be paid even for occasional baby sitters and cleaning people.
Mrs. Clinton's use of her family name, her high profile in a West Wing previously dominated by the old boys' network and her lobbying on Capitol Hill have not yet produced the slings and arrows predicted by Republicans for the first career woman in the White House. She received a 45 percent favorable rating and 18 percent unfavorable one. By contrast, Barbara Bush premiered with a 34 percent favorable rating and a 3 percent unfavorable one, and initial readings for Nancy Reagan were 28 percent favorable and 10 percent unfavorable.
"I think it's really neat that Hillary has her own office and something of her own to do," said Jane Browning, 30, a waitress at the Leaf & Ladle in Columbus, Ohio. "They do share the same bedroom at night, so they can work out any differences privately rather than have them documented in memos that can later be leaked to the press."
Jewel Hutson, the 67-year-old owner of the Downtown Diner in Antlers, Okla., where the special is smothered steak, creamed potatoes and a salad bar for $3.75, took a more traditional view. "I think Clinton should have waited a while before he really threw Hillary at the people," she said. "There's a lot of talk around here in Antlers. They love First Ladies, but the want them kind of behind the President, not in front."
 
Silver Lining in Obscurity
 In the Incredible Shrinking Vice President category: In October, only 14 percent of registered voters said they did not know enough about Al Gore to express an opinion. That rose to 33 percent in January and to 44 percent in the latest poll. Dan Quayle suffered a similar disappearing phenomenon, going from 16 percent who said they did not know enough to express a view about him in October 1988 to 47 percent a little more than a year later.
There is, however, a silver lining for Mr. Gore. Those who had an opinion were, on balance, positive: 32 percent expressed a favorable view, while only 12 percent were unfavorable. By contrast, Mr. Quayle's negative rating remained higher than his positive throughout the Bush Administration.
 
How the Poll Was Taken

The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Feb. 9 to 11 with 1,154 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups of the population the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for black respondents it is plus or minus 10 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Traveling High-Tech Agents Help Update Small Factories

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DORNSIFE, Pa.

 BODY:
High technology arrived here one recent morning in a silver Volkswagen van with 107,000 miles on the odometer and James Bodnar at the wheel.
Mr. Bodnar, an engineer, and his partner, Zane Patalive, a computer specialist, turned up at Keim's Machine and Tool Company to tinker with Dave Keim's computer-operated lathe and one of Bill Clinton's industrial policy goals. 
 Like the agricultural extension agents who take their expertise up and down the dusty roads of America's farm country, the two men travel with similar intent. They respond to pleas for help from small manufacturers in the hills and valleys of central Pennsylvania who are trying to get more out of their computers, their production equipment and their workers.
 
 
A Possible Model
 The two are in the business of rendering technical assistance, and what they do is low key at this point. But government officials are looking closely at their program and others like it, seeking models for a high-stakes Federal and state effort to eke more productivity out of the small manufacturers who are so important in the food chain of American competitiveness.
On this afternoon, however, Washington seems very far away from Keim's Machine and Tool Company. Operating in the service area of a defunct Chevrolet dealership by the side of a lightly traveled road, Keim's embodies the "small" in small business. Mr. Keim has one full-time shop worker and two part-timers on his payroll. His wife, Nancy, manages the two-desk office that is one symbol of the company's progress. Until last year, when the office and the shop shared the same space, Mrs. Keim had to shout "turn off the machines" whenever the telephone rang.
The company produces precision parts that go into industrial tools and is what industrial analysts call a foundation firm -- one of the 360,000 or so small and medium-sized manufacturers that are the supply base for major corporations.
What has been troubling Mr. Keim is the single computer-controlled lathe that sits in his shop of mostly manually operated machine tools. The Hitachi Seiki lathe can automatically turn out parts following the instructions of a program, and Mr. Keim has taught himself how to write computer code to instruct it. But the controller's memory is so small that producing new parts requires Mr. Keim to kill out programming covering old parts. He does not want to do that in case customers reorder old parts. So he has called in Mr. Bodnar and Mr. Patalive to help him figure out a way to transfer the programming onto a high-capacity disk drive on his office computer.
The two men work for the Industrial Modernization Center Inc., a state-backed consulting and training firm in Williamsport, near here. It is one of eight not-for-profit corporations established by the State of Pennsylvania to provide hands-on services to small and medium-sized companies that probably could not afford private consultants, even if they knew the right ones to call.
Although many states offer some form of technological assistance to small manufacturers, only about a dozen provide the services of field representatives who, like agricultural extension agents, call on manufacturers and offer help. Besides Pennsylvania, they are Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, according to a compilation by the National Governors Association.
 
 
State Connection Played Down
 Given the suspicion that many small-business people have about government, the state connection is not heavily advertised. "If I showed up with a business card saying, 'I'm from the state and I'm here to help you,' I'd get tossed out on my ear," said one technical extension agent in another state.
Mr. Bodnar and Mr. Patalive bring technical credentials and practical operating experience to their clients. Mr. Bodnar is an industrial engineer with an M.B.A. degree, who spent 19 years in the steel industry before joining the center about four years ago. Mr. Patalive has a degree in computer science and worked as a consultant to I.M.C. and others before joining the staff early this year.
When they arrive, Mr. Keim does not mince words.
"We want to go from an all-manual operation to computerized without hiring a lot of computer people," he said. In addition to linking the office computer with the automated lathe, he wants to harness the computer's power to keep books and analyze the business.
"I want software to keep track of shop time so I can know which jobs are profitable," he said. "I want to know where to raise my prices and where to lower them."
Mr. Bodnar offers the services of I.M.C.'s demonstration center in Williamsport, where there are computers and software packages that Mr. Keim can test before buying. Mr. Patalive said he could start with a program called Shoptimizer, developed by the Industrial Software Company of East Providence, R.I., for operations like Keim's.
The ability to use computers effectively is one of the two great divides that separate old-fashioned, mostly small, manufacturing operations from those that are at the forefront of technology, said Robert W. Vandine, the executive director of I.M.C. The other is the ability to reorganize and retrain workers so they become participants in factory operations, rather than just automatons. If American manufacturers do not improve technology and workplace organization, they will not be able to compete internationally, he said.
 
 
Speaking From Experience
 "I feel passionately about this," he said, his own history coming through. In an earlier job, he had been manager of Bethlehem Steel's wire rope plant in Williamsport -- until the company was driven out of the business by imports.
"One of our major goals has been the development of understandable packages of computer-based technology," Mr. Vandine said. Most small manufacturers, he said, are too busy pushing products out the door -- to keep the cash flowing in -- to fight their way through the software jungle.
But their need for that equipment is evident. Small and medium-sized manufacturers are 25 percent less productive than big companies, a 1990 Census Bureau study found, largely because they are half as likely to use computer-controlled equipment.
Although strict free-market advocates will probably scream, the Clinton Administration plans to stimulate job and economic growth by increasing the technical assistance available to manufacturers. It is backing legislation that would expand the existing seven technology assistance centers operated by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology to a nationwide network of 170. Financing would grow from a modest $17 million this year to $150 million in the 1994 fiscal year.
Legislation to expand the network was passed in different forms by both houses of Congress last year -- without Bush Administration support -- but died before the House and Senate versions could be sorted out. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, chairman of the Commerce Committee, has pledged early action this year.
"One of the functions will be to support state technical extension services," said Philip Nanzetta, director of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of the National Institutes.
The various centers work in different ways. In Pennsylvania, recognizing that cutting and bending metal is a way of life in the central part of the state, Mr. Bodner's Industrial Modernization Center focuses on helping companies in those businesses. It helped PMF Industries, a company that forms stainless-steel products, with training in statistical process control to improve quality. Playworld Systems, which makes playground equipment in New Berlin, got help in converting hard-to-understand engineering drawings into renderings for sales pitches.
But that's not all the center does. In a gesture to the small cut-and-sew apparel operations that dot the area as well, it has bought automated machinery to generate the large paper markers used to guide cutters. Robert Cross, the president of Equinox Ltd., which makes camping equipment, said the center gave him access to equipment he could not afford on his own.
A Pennsylvania grant of $688,000 for the year allows Mr. Vandine to keep the prices of his five consultants' services down. "If it's a qualified project, for every $1 I collect from the client, I'll get 25 cents from the state grant," he said. He said the need to hustle business kept the center entrepreneurial and more attuned to the needs of the region than more formalized state programs would be.
At Keim's, the two technology agents and Mr. Keim walk out into the shop to take a closer look at the troublesome machine. Mr. Keim makes it clear he is thinking beyond a single used 1986-vintage lathe. "We need to develop more computer-controlled machinery in here," he said. "That's the way manufacturing is going in the United States."
Hence the problem.
"If I go to Hitachi Seiki, they will want to sell me a box to put on this machine," he said, referring to a specialized data storage unit. That would probably work well enough, but would not meet his goal of writing instructions in the office while the machine is operating and then quickly loading them to begin a new production run as soon as the previous one is finished. "You have no idea how much time that would save," he said.
Nor would it help control the other machines he hopes to add. Mr. Patalive closely eyes the lines of code displayed on the lathe's control unit and pronounces the problem solvable. The control unit has a cable port to connect with the office computer. Now all he must do is find software that will allow the two units to talk to each other.
 
 
A Proposed Solution
 A few weeks later he is ready to write a proposal for Mr. Keim. He has found software that will link the office computer to the lathe for about $500 plus a $250 installation fee. But he hopes to persuade him to spend a total of $1,000 for added programming that will let him simulate the cutting paths of tools on a computer screen to speed operations and to control multiple machines -- a strategy even more advanced than Mr. Keim thought possible.
Mr. Patalive said he would negotiate with the software supplier to get a fixed price for Mr. Keim, instead of the costs-plus-expenses formula the vendor prefers. I.M.C. does not charge a fee for its consultants' first visit, and is paid modestly for services rendered, like the software installation.
As for Mr. Keim's problem, Mr. Bodner considered it straightforward, easy to solve -- and typical.
"A lot of people have bought a computer and some software because they have been told they need one," he said, "but they do not know how to use them. That's where we can add some value."

HEADLINE: FEUDS AND KILLINGS IN NICARAGUA MAR DEMOCRATIC RULE

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Three years after President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in elections, Nicaragua has fallen into a tangle of crises that are spreading fear of an upsurge in violence.
Despite Government efforts to pacify the countryside, unsolved killings with political overtones occur almost daily in the explosive northwest, scene of most of the fighting during the civil war. There, a dozen or more armed bands, mostly disgruntled former anti-Sandinista rebels or their families, are hunted alternately by the Army, which is still under Sandinista control, and by Government negotiators. 
 The latest threats to peace coincide with corruption charges against Mrs. Chamorro's Government and seemingly intractable political differences that have led to a rupture between Mrs. Chamorro and the political leaders who helped put her in office.
 
'We Can't Get Along'
 Resentment also still runs high among non-Sandinistas about the influence -- and at times the dominance -- that the Sandinistas exert throughout the Army and the Government.
"Unfortunately, we Nicaraguans can't get along, and we are doing our best to destroy Nicaragua," said Ramiro Gurdian, a banana grower who is president of Cosep, an influential group of business executives.
Frank Lanzas, the Mayor of Matagalpa, near the most unsettled area, said, "Family and personal feuds prevent the Government from dealing with the problems; everyone is always thinking about how to neutralize his opponents."
Unhappy with the growing influence of the Sandinistas, the Bush Administration last year suspended $104 million in aid to Nicaragua. About half was released toward the end of last year.
The Clinton Administration, which still lacks a chief policymaker for Latin America, has yet to address the issue of releasing the other half and risks a confrontation in Congress, where many Republicans and Democrats are critical of the continued Sandinista influence. The critics also want Nicaragua to move faster to resolve claims of people whose property was confiscated in the Sandinista period.
 
When Hopes Were High . . .
 Hopes for stability were high when accords were signed three years ago allowing 22,000 anti-Sandinista rebels, known as contras, and their families to return from Honduras, give up their arms and resettle in their home areas with assistance from the Organization of American States.
In return, the Sandinista Government of Daniel Ortega Saavedra held elections under international inspection.
Although most former contras have accepted the resettlement package, negotiators have had to deal with armed groups of contras who are dissatisfied with the settlement program or fear persecution. The O.A.S. says 173 former contras have been killed since July 1990. Most cases are unresolved, but a recent study of 10 deaths traced all of them to the Army or to other Sandinista-controlled groups.
 
Assessing the Chance of War
 Government officials, particularly Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's chief minister and son-in-law, see less potential for new warfare than do their critics outside the executive branch, but they do not deny that their political dreams are turning into nightmares.
For example Alfred Cesar, the recently ousted president of the National Assembly, said in an interview that he saw "the real possibility of the reinitiation of war." He cited recent conversations with former contras who, he said, felt they had nothing to lose in taking up arms again.
While saying that he thought a new war would gain nothing, Mr. Cesar added that if war came again, it would be "an autonomous guerrilla war directed by regional peasant leaders" without foreign backing and with no inclination to obey national figures.
The Government estimates the number of armed contras at about 700; a foreign diplomat who closely follows the pacification process estimated them at "550 and growing."
 
It's the Economy, Senora
 Mr. Lacayo says many problems with the former contras and the almost equally dissatisified ex-Sandinista soldiers are a result of the economic disaster inherited by the Government after more than a decade of Sandinista rule and civil war.
William Baez, an active critic of the Sandinistas who was recently appointed to the new post of Minister of Social Action, said Nicaragua was in a more difficult situation than the rest of Central America because "besides having had a war, we are changing from socialism to market capitalism -- a more dramatic change."
Unemployment is 40 percent, there is almost no investment, exports are a fraction of what they were in the 1970's and the country lives on foreign aid.
There are a few encouraging signs: the economic stabilization program that Mr. Lacayo started two years ago to halt runaway inflation is still working. But the Government says it needs a resumption of United States aid to keep the program going.
 
And Corruption, Too
 Mrs. Chamorro's Government is also beset by corruption charges, a complete break with the coalition that once backed her and a constitutional crisis brought on when she intervened at the National Assembly and ordered the election of her own leaders.
Early this month, the National Opposition Union, which ran Mrs. Chamorro for President in 1990, formally declared itself in opposition to the Government, accusing Mrs. Chamorro of abandoning her commitment to government by consultation. The next election is due in late 1996, but with the current turmoil, it is not even clear now what coalitions will form.
The rupture culminated a long-running dispute over corruption investigations and how to satisfy property claims by 6,000 people whose holdings were confiscated by the Sandinistas. Another source of contention was the Government's susceptibility to the influence of the Sandinistas, particularly its retention of Gen. Humberto Ortega as head of the Army.
 
A Particular Killing
 The National Opposition Union and many other non-Sandinista groups were also embittered by the killing of Arges Sequeira Mangas, who defended people seeking the return of confiscated property, and by the subsequent identification of three former army and police officers as the killers.
Mr. Sequeira was shot dead last November by three men who walked up to him while he was talking with workers on his farm in Leon. With technical help from the Spanish Government and a witness willing to testify, the police quickly identified the alleged killers, but no arrests have been announced.
The rebellion by Mrs. Chamorro's allies has left her largely dependent on the Sandinistas to govern. But the Sandinistas, most of whom support state control of the economy and class warfare, are unlikely to be reliable votes for a President who seeks free markets and respect for private property.
 
Accusations of Vote-Buying
 The Sandinistas are able to form a majority with a small group of breakaway legislators from Mrs. Chamorro's former coalition, though the National Opposition Union says the renegades were bribed by people working for Mr. Lacayo, the chief minister.
The ouster of the former Controller General, Guillermo Potoy, was a response to his efforts to investigate the allegations of bribery. The alleged corruption has been linked specifically to a former vice minister, Antonio Ibarra, who has since fled to Bolivia.
In interviews from Bolivia published and broadcast here, Mr. Ibarra has leveled a nonstop barrage of charges at Mr. Lacayo, claiming among other things that he ordered or suggested payoffs. Mr. Lacayo, in an interview last week, refused to respond directly to the allegation.
Mr. Lacayo was Mr. Ibarra's immediate superior, and after Mr. Potoy failed to obtain access to some of the minister's files as part of the investigation, Mr. Potoy invoked his independent powers to tell Mrs. Chamorro to dismiss Mr. Lacayo.
 
Antonio Stays, Guillermo Goes
 But Mr. Lacayo did not budge; Mrs. Chamorro, who has relied on Mr. Lacayo to run the Government, has stood by what she said when the bribe accusations first surfaced in mid-1992: "If Antonio goes, Violeta goes."
So Guillermo Potoy went. Earlier this year, Mr. Lacayo used the new majority of Sandinistas and the renegades from Mrs. Chamorro's coalition to remove the Controller General.
The political crisis is further fed by an undercurrent of struggles within and between families, which are a staple of Nicaraguan politics. Many Nicaraguans call the struggle "The War of the Brothers-in-Law" because it involves Mr. Lacayo and two of his brothers-in-law, three ambitious, fortyish men from families accustomed to power, each dreaming of becoming President someday.
For example Mr. Cesar, whom Mr. Lacayo ousted as president of the Assembly, is the husband of one of his sisters. And Mrs. Chamorro's elder son, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, also weighs in against Mr. Lacayo from his post as assistant editor of La Prensa, the family newspaper. With Mr. Lacayo's wife, Cristiana Chamorro, holding another high-level post at the newspaper, La Prensa often seems to have a split personality.
 
Cesar's Allies Ousted
 An outgrowth of the feud between Mr. Lacayo and Mr. Cesar has been the removal from high-level Government posts of most of the people politically close to Mr. Cesar.
But one Government official suggests a longer-term view to help explain today's woes.
"There's always been a pendulum swinging here," he said. "In the early years, when the Liberal Party won a war or an election, the Conservatives had to leave the country. When the Conservatives won, it was the Liberals who had to leave. Then when the Sandinistas took power, the bourgeoisie had to leave or lie low.
"Now, for the first time, we are all trying to live together in the same country."

HEADLINE: Dollar Mixed in Limited Trading Overseas

BYLINE: The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against leading currencies yesterday, while European stocks languished and United States Government bonds rose slightly in limited activity overseas.
Markets in the United States were closed for the observance of Washington's Birthday, which affected many foreign dealers who usually take their cues from their counterparts in the United States. 
 Foreign market participants were also reluctant to trade heavily yesterday ahead of United States economic data due later this week and President Clinton's speech last night previewing his plan for the economy. Details of the economic stimulus package will be disclosed in an address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday.
The dollar began its holiday-shortened trading day in Tokyo by rising 0.70 yen from Friday, to close at 121.15 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 129.95 yen. The British pound was unchanged at $1.4180 in late London trading.
Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with Friday's late quotes, included: 1.6587 German marks, down from 1.6615; 1.5410 Swiss francs, down from 1.5415; 5.6108 French francs, down from 5.6225; 1.8682 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8705; 1,551.00 Italian lire, up from 1,547.00, and 1.2531 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2551.
Prices were mixed on the London Stock Exchange in light trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 2.9 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,845.9, and the 30-stock index rose 0.2 points, to close at 2,187.8. The 500-stock index finished up 1.85 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,523.68.
In Paris, the CAC-40 index drifted down 12.48 points, to finish at 1,899.49 points.
In foreign trading of United States Treasury securities, the bellwether 30-year bond added 1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 in face amount, while its yield declined to 7.10 percent, down from 7.12 percent in New York on Friday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities traded on foreign markets, short-term maturities were unchanged to up 1/16 point, while intermediate securities gained 3/32 point to 5/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $328.55 an ounce, from $328.35 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $328.30, from $328.50 Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.74, to close at $329.36.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $3.68 an ounce, from $3.70.

Stocks Lower in Japan
 TOKYO, Feb. 16 (Reuters) -- Stocks ended lower here today on arbitrage selling and profit-taking, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues falling below the psychological barrier of 17,000. Brokers said that buying by public pension funds was likely to limit further declines.
The Nikkei fell 201.67 points, or 1.18 percent, to 16,916.32, shedding most of its 266.48-point gain on Monday. An estimated 220 million shares were traded.
"It has been fairly predictable recently that, when the market rises one day, it falls the next day," one analyst said.
In Hong Kong this morning, stocks continued to gain after soaring on Monday amid speculation that China was ready to start discussing the colony's political future after months of bitter deadlock.
The blue-chip Hang Seng index jumped 67.71 points, or 1.12 percent, to 6,117.15, and the broader All Ordinaries index gained 25.70 to 3,248.23.
The Hang Seng had surged more than 200 points Monday afternoon before slipping slightly near the close of trading.
Brokers said the scramble began after local newspapers reported that Beijing, which regains control over Hong Kong in 1997, was ready to drop its demand that Chris Patten, the Governor of the British colony, must scrap his democratic reform proposals before any talks can begin.

HEADLINE: Transcript of President's Address on the Economy

 BODY:
Following is President Clinton's address on the economy last night, as transcribed by The New York Times:
Good evening. I have chosen this day on which we honor two great Presidents to talk with you about the serious problems and the great promise of our country, and the absolute necessity for change if we're to secure a better future for ourselves and for our children. 
 On Wednesday evening, I'll address the Congress about the specifics of my plan, but first I turn to you for your strength and support, to enlist you in the cause of changing our course.
This is a momentous time for our nation. We stand at the end of the cold war and on the edge of the 21st century. For two decades, we've moved steadily toward a global economy in which we must compete with people around the world, a world which requires us to work hard and smart, a world in which putting people first is more than a political slogan -- it's a philosophy of governing and the only path to prosperity.
For 12 years, we followed a very different philosophy. It declared that Government is the problem, that fairness to the middle class is less important than keeping taxes low on the wealthy, that Government can do nothing about our deepest problems -- lost jobs, declining wages, increasing inequality, inadequate educational opportunity and a health-care system that costs a fortune but does too little.
During those 12 years, as Governor of Arkansas I followed a very different course, more like what you've done at home and at work. I invested in the future of our people and balanced the state budget with honesty and fairness and without gimmicks. It's just common sense.
But in the 26 days I've been your President, I've already learned that here in Washington common sense isn't too common and you've paid a lot for that loss of common sense. The typical middle-class family is working harder for less. Despite the talk of a recovery, more than nine million of our fellow citizens are still out of work. And as this chart indicates, if this were a real, normal recovery, three million more Americans would already be back at work by now.
In fact, there are more jobless people now than there were at what the experts call the bottom of this recession.
 
The Deficit's Effect

All during this last 12 years, the Federal deficit has roared out of control. Look at this -- the big tax cuts for the wealthy, the growth in Government spending and soaring health-care costs all caused the Federal deficit to explode. Our debt is now four times as big as it was in 1980. That's right. In the last 12 years, we've piled up four times as much debt as in the previous 200.
Now, if all that debt had been invested in strengthening our economy we'd at least have something to show for our money: more jobs, better educated people, a health-care system that works. But as you can see, while the deficit went up, investments in the things that make us stronger and smarter, richer and safer were neglected: less invested in education, less in our children's future, less in transportation, less in local law enforcement.
An awful lot of that money was just wasted. This matters. When you don't invest in jobs and education and economic opportunity, unemployment goes up and our incomes go down. And when the deficit gets bigger and bigger and bigger, the Government takes more of your money just for interest payments, and then it's harder for you to borrow money for your own business or to afford a new home or to send a child to college.
That's exactly what's been happening. Once, our living standards doubled every 25 years. But at the rate we're going today, our living standard won't double for another hundred years, until our grandchildren's grandchildren are born. That's too long.
We must act now to restore the American dream. Despite the enormity of this crisis, believe it or not, the status quo still has its defenders: people who point to hopeless statistics like the recent increase in productivity and consumer confidence and say we should do nothing.
Well, American business has been forced to become more competitive in this global economy. And I'm glad that consumer confidence is up since the election, but we're not generating jobs or making headway on these other long-term problems.
My message to you is clear: The price of doing the same old thing is far higher than the price of change.
After all, that's why you sent me here: not to keep this seat warm but to work for fundamental change, to make Washington work for all Americans, not just the special interests, and to chart a course that will enable us to compete and win in this new world.
 
More Cuts and More Taxes
 Here's the challenge I will offer the Congress and the country on Wednesday. We'll invest in our future by nurturing our children and supporting their education, by rewarding work and family, by creating the jobs of the future and training our people to fill them. Our every effort will reflect what President Franklin Roosevelt called "bold, persistent experimentation," a willingness to stay with things that work and stop things that don't.
Change must begin at the top. That's why I cut the White House staff by 25 percent and ordered Federal agencies to cut billions of dollars in administrative costs and to trim 100,000 Federal positions by attrition.
And in my budget there'll be more than 150 specific cuts in Government spending programs. Then, I'll ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.
That brings us to those of you who gave the most in the 1980's. I had hoped to invest in your future by creating jobs, expanding education, reforming health care and reducing the debt without asking more of you. And I've worked harder than I've ever worked in my life to meet that goal.
But I can't -- because the deficit has increased so much beyond my earlier estimates and beyond even the worst official Government estimates from last year. We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today so that all Americans can do better tomorrow.
But I can assure you of this: You're not going alone anymore. You're not going first and you're no longer going to pay more and get less.
Seventy percent of the new taxes I'll propose -- 70 percent -- will be paid by those who make more than $100,000 a year and, for the first time in more than a decade, we're all in this together.
More important, here's the payoff: Our comprehensive plan for economic growth will create millions of long-term, good-paying jobs, including a program to jump-start our economy with another 500,000 jobs in 1993 and 1994.
And as we make deep cuts in the existing Government programs, we'll make new investments where they'll do the most good: incentives to business to create new jobs, investments in education and training, special efforts for displaced defense workers, a fairer tax system to insure that parents who work full time will no longer raise their children in poverty, welfare reforms to move people from welfare to work, vaccinations and Head Start opportunities for all children who need them and a system of affordable, quality health care for all Americans.
Our national service plan will throw open the doors of college opportunity to the daughters and sons of the middle class and then we'll challenge them to give something back to our country as teachers, police officers, community service workers taking care of our own right here at home. And we'll do it all while reducing our debt.
 
Calling for Support
 Change this fundamental will not be easy nor will it be quick, but at stake is the control of our economic destiny.
Within minutes of the time I conclude my address to Congress Wednesday night, the special interests will be out in force. Those who profited from the status quo will oppose the changes we seek -- the budget cuts, the revenue increases, the new investment priorities. Every step of the way they'll oppose it. Many have already lined the corridors of power with high-priced lobbyists.
They are the defenders of decline, and we must be the architects of the future. I'm confident in our cause, because I believe in America. And I know we have learned the hard lessons of the 1980's.
This is your country. You demonstrated the power of the people in the last election. I urge you to stay informed and to stay involved. If you're vigilant and vocal, we can do what we have to do.
On this Presidents' Day, we recall the many times in our history when past Presidents have challenged this nation from this office in times of crisis.
If you will join with me, we can create an economy in which all Americans work hard and prosper. This is nothing less than a call to arms to restore the vitality of the American dream.
When I was a boy, we had a name for the belief that we should all pull together to build a better, stronger nation. We called it patriotism and we still do.
Good night and God bless America.

The Economy
 
 President Clinton used plain language to appeal directly to the American public to support the tax increases and spending cuts he proposes. In his first televised address from the Oval Office, Mr. Clinton seemed to be preparing millions of viewers for the speech he will deliver tomorrow, when he will lay out to a joint session of Congress his often painful remedies for the economy. [A1.] 
 Most Americans remain open to President Clinton's changes in taxing, spending and the way the White House is run, according to a New York Times/CBS News opinion poll. [A1.]
President Clinton's health-care reform was to have balanced regulation and free-market competition. But so far, Federal health policy seems to emphasize price regulation. [A14.]
A Pennsylvania program to help small manufacturers eke out more productivity is being considered by the Federal Government as a model for larger efforts. [A1.]
California is considering a new system of car insurance that drivers would pay for through gasoline fees, so the cost would depend more heavily on how much they drive. [A12.]
Joint ventures by private companies and Federal laboratories shifting away from weapons development have been hobbled by bureacratic infighting and opposition in some industries. [D1.]
 
Companies
Xerox has been one of the most aggressive and innovative large companies pursuing lower health-care costs. But it continues to face jumps in health costs that it considers unacceptable. [D1.]
Sales of motor vehicles built in North America rose 6.3 percent in early February. While car sales were down 2.7 percent, truck sales were up 20.6 percent for the seven companies reporting. [D2.]

New problems are brewing for Steven Hoffenberg, the potential buyer of The New York Post. Shawmut Bank, a trustee for $200 million in bonds in Mr. Hoffenberg's company, Towers Financial, is said to be seeking an accounting of bondholders' money. [B3.]
 
International
Adidas is being taken over by a group that includes Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who for the last three years has helped stabilize Saatchi & Saatchi, the giant British advertising company. [D1.]
Japanese electronics companies are discussing digital VCR's, which would use computer technology to provide clearer pictures than existing VCR's, much like digital compact disks offer music free of the hisses and pops of conventional records. [D2.]

Markets
Interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds could fall to 7 percent or lower if the credit markets believe that President Clinton can really cut the budget deficit. If it believes he cannot, the rally of 1993 could be dissipated in a hurry. [D1.]
The dollar was mixed, European stocks languished and Treasury bonds rose slightly in limited activity overseas. Markets in the United States were closed for Washington's Birthday. [D9.]

HEADLINE: Big Change Sought in Auto Insurance

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
California is considering a new system of car insurance that drivers would pay for through fees at the fuel pump, so the cost would depend more heavily on how much they drive than on traditional factors like what type of car they use or where they live.
Insurance companies and trial lawyers hate the idea, which is intended to ease out-of-control increases in insurance costs and the huge problem of uninsured drivers. 
 Environmentalists have high hopes that the concept will catch on here and around the country, because, they say, it will raise the price of driving to reflect its cost more accurately, and that will discourage traffic.
State Senator Art Torres of Los Angeles, a Democrat who heads the Senate Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee, said he would introduce "pay-at-the-pump" legislation calling for a fuel surcharge of 30 cents a gallon, as well as additional vehicle registration fees. The plan would provide a basic insurance policy to all drivers, although people who own expensive cars would probably choose to buy additional coverage privately, which would be permitted under the plan.
 
Addressing Uninsured Drivers
 The proposal's backers say it will address a crisis in automobile insurance in California, which has the one of the highest auto insurance rates in the nation. As many as 6 million of the state's 20 million motorists are uninsured, driving illegally because of the cost.
The new plan grew out of a book, "Auto Insurance Alert!" (Fireside-Simon & Schuster, 1993), by Andrew Tobias, a financial columnist for Time magazine. The current system is "horribly unfair and terribly wasteful," he said in an interview. "This plan would do away with all the selling, do away with all the lawyers and do away with uninsured motorists. I think that's a powerful concept."
Supporters say the new concept will also eliminate billions of dollars in waste. The California Department of Insurance says 44 cents of every dollar in insurance premiums actually pays for losses like medical expenses, lost wages and repairs. Under the proposed plan, that will increase to 72 cents of every premium dollar, the department estimates.
The proposal has won the support of the state's insurance commissioner, John Garamendi, who estimates it will save California drivers $4 billion a year, slashing the average amount a motorist spends on auto insurance by one-third. Although rates vary widely depending on a host of factors, the average driver 30 years old with no violations now pays about $556 a year for basic coverage. Under the plan, such a driver would pay $311, the insurance department said.
 
Support by Consumer Groups
 Some consumer and environmental groups have also endorsed the plan, praising its simplicity and its potential for unclogging roads and reducing air pollution with economic incentives for people to cut down their driving and switch to fuel-efficient vehicles.
But opposition to the plan has created an alliance between insurance companies and trial lawyers. They characterize the idea as unfair, unrealistic and rife with unanswered questions.
The pay-at-the-pump idea is not new. Maryland considered such a plan in 1972. Legislation was introduced in the California Assembly in 1975 but failed. Unlike the current proposal, that one would not have provided for insurance coverage regardless of which driver was at fault in an accident.
Under this "no fault" provision of the new plan, the insurance would provide a ban on lawsuits for pain and suffering, 100 percent coverage of medical expenses, up to $25,000 for lost wages and $5,000 in collision coverage. Additional coverage could be bought privately.
Although other states, including New York, currently have forms of "no-fault" insurance, they permit lawsuits for injuries of a specified severity or if damages exceed a certain amount. In Connecticut, which considers itself a a no-fault state, lawsuits are allowed if damages exceed $400.
 
Limits to Proposal
 New Jersey also has one of the highest automotive insurance rates in the nation. But most experts say a pay-at-the-pump plan would be impractical there, unless all neighboring states also had such programs, because it would be too easy for motorists to drive to New York, Pennsylvania or Delaware and buy fuel without the extra fees.
Under the California proposal, additional fees would be collected through vehicle registrations, These would vary depending on the car and the driver's record. A "good driver," one with no more than one moving violation in the last three years, would pay an additional $20 a year for a driver's license. That group would include 80 percent of all motorists. Drivers with tarnished records could pay hundreds of dollars more, depending on how many accidents and violations they had.
Backers estimate that the average car would cost an additional $195 to register, but that would vary with the model.
 
'It's a Good Idea'
 Though the state would collect all the money, the insurance would operate as a private system, with companies bidding to provide coverage for blocks of 2,500 to 5,000 motorists.
"It's a good idea," said Nettie Hoge, a staff lawyer with Consumers Union's West Coast regional office.
Ms. Hoge and other consumer advocates have expressed concern that the plan might create a disproportionate economic burden on low- and moderate-income motorists, but they said it could be remedied by offering lower registration fees to people below a set income level.
As to fears that motorists would drive out of state to avoid the fuel fees, Senator Torres's aides said the losses would be insignificant because 98 percent of California's population was too far from a border for such a strategy to be practical. They added that they had received inquiries from seven other states about the legislation, including neighboring Arizona and Nevada. They said that if California enacted the plan, other states would follow.
Many insurance industry officials welcome the no-fault component of the plan but complain that big-car owners will unfairly pay more for coverage, even though their inefficient fuel consumption does not constitute an insurance risk.
Trial lawyers, on the other hand, reject the no-fault component of the proposal. "In essence you are saying take money away from innocent victims and use that money to pay the people that caused the accident," said Will Glennon, a legal analyst with the California Trial Lawyers Association in Sacramento.
Should the legislation pass, it will ultimately be put before voters as a constitutional amendment. That is because the fuel charge is considered a tax, and the state Constitution limits the use of fuel taxes to road construction and repair and similar transportation expenditures.

HEADLINE: The Xerox Health-Care Model

SERIES: A Search for Limits -- A periodic look at prescriptions for an ailing health-care system.

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
Marie T. Lyons, a 28-year-old computer operations trouble-shooter at the Xerox Corporation, joined a health maintenance organization for the first time in late 1991, largely because the price seemed right.
As a single person, she pays $6.33 in monthly premiums, while her employer contributes the balance of the $183.43 a month that her H.M.O. charges. The big office machine manufacturer provides the subsidy to encourage workers to join H.M.O.'s that have met Xerox's standards for quality of care and service and, even more important, have held down costs. 
 Xerox, a $17 billion company with 55,000 employees in 47 states, has been one of the most aggressive and innovative large companies in the pursuit of lower health costs. It has given its employees strong incentives to join H.M.O.'s, in which care is offered for a prepaid price and patients are limited in their choice of doctors, and the company has fostered competition among H.M.O.'s for its contracts.
 
Rewards and Limits
 In its stress on managed care and competition, the Xerox method includes several elements of an approach known as managed competition that has gained the interest of many economists and President Clinton.
Yet Xerox, which has been refining its strategy since the mid-1980's, still faces jumps in health costs that it considers unacceptable.
Although one company with employees spread around the country cannot make the sweeping changes in the health system that many experts think are needed, its experience offers lessons about both the potential rewards and limits of managed care within the current system.
More than 60 of the 190 H.M.O.'s that serve Xerox employees are limiting their price increases for Xerox workers this year to an average of only 5.5 percent, well below the rise in health costs most companies face. But most of the H.M.O.'s have not held down cost increases as extensively.
And 16,500 Xerox employees -- 30 percent of the company's work force -- still choose to remain in traditional insurance plans despite the extra cost.
Like many Americans, including Xerox's chairman, Paul A. Allaire, they want to be able to choose any family doctor or medical specialist, rather than being limited to a list of H.M.O.-approved physicians who would control the patients' access to specialists.
"I love my doctor; he's the best," said Nancy-Jean Bono, a 29-year-old administrative assistant at Xerox headquarters in Stamford. To keep him, she pays $137.83 a month to cover her family. She could get similar coverage in an H.M.O. for less than $20 a month. But then she would need a new doctor. She said that her current physician prefers to remain independent.
So while nearly two-thirds of the company's employees have selected the prepaid health plans (and about 7 percent are covered by their spouse's benefits), Xerox's overall medical costs are expected to rise by a burdensome 12.7 percent in 1993, quadruple the projected national inflation rate. Projected costs per active employee jumped to $4,324 this year from $3,154 in 1990, the first year of the company's current system.
Even a company as large and profitable as Xerox blanches at the prospect of facing 12 percent annual increases, doubling its expenses every six years. If this continues, Mr. Allaire, the chairman, said, "it would clearly make us less competitive internationally." His main competitors are Japanese companies that spend far less than their American counterparts for employee health care.
The company uses many of the country's most admired health maintenance organizations, including the Kaiser Foundation's national network and two in Rochester, where the largest cluster of Xerox employees live.
 
'Not the Magic Bullet'
 Health maintenance organizations are the cornerstones of most proposals to address the nation's growing medical problems. But most have yet to demonstrate significant, steady savings. "H.M.O.'s are not the magic bullet," said Dr. Robert Brooks, health sciences director at the Rand Corporation, an independent research center in Santa Monica, Calif.
Following a practice called shadow-pricing, H.M.O. charges usually rise steadily at a rate that is just a bit lower than traditional health plans. Kaiser, for example, has increased its rates by an average of 12.8 percent a year since 1990, while national rates for traditional fee-for-service medicine were rising about 16 percent annually.
And too often, economists and other experts add, H.M.O.'s attract the younger and healthier members of a group who need relatively little care, but this is not reflected in lower rates. The fee-for-service plans, meanwhile, get more than their share of people who believe they have medical needs, said Helen Darling, Xerox's health-care strategy manager.
Kaiser, which is under pressure from large customers like the California Public Employees Retirement System and employers hit by the recession in its California stronghold, is raising its 1993 rates only 6.8 percent, on average, across the country. In several regions, Kaiser is wooing Xerox employees with 5.5 percent increases.
In Rochester, where Xerox has joined with other large employers to restrain medical spending, prices are 25 percent to 35 percent below national averages. But Rochester Blue Cross has also posted H.M.O. rate increases averaging about 12 percent for the last four years. In the same period, its fee-for-service increases averaged 17 percent a year.
Contrary to the common perception of health maintenance organizations as the lower-cost choice, Xerox said H.M.O. rates for its Rochester employees were currently higher than fee-for-service charges there.
 
Traditional Care
 Traditional medicine is expensive for Xerox and getting more so. It is expected to cost $6,322 per active employee in 1993, up 15.4 percent from last year. Xerox projects $3,846 per employee for H.M.O.'s in 1993.
And even though participants in the traditional health plans face steep deductibles before the company starts picking up most of the costs (they have to pay all charges until they reach 1 percent of their income), Xerox estimates it will spend nearly half of its $235 million health-care budget to cover these employees.
Xerox promotes enrollment in its lowest-cost H.M.O.'s by paying more than 90 percent of the charges. These H.M.O. members pay only $239 a year for full family coverage, which includes expensive items like fertility therapy as well as free checkups and other preventive care.
To steer people away from H.M.O.'s that charge more, the employees' share of the costs is increased. Employees pay the most, $1,654 a year for family coverage, for the company fee-for-service plan, which covers 80 percent of physician fees but only after the employee has paid 100 percent of the deductible.
 
6 Picked to Direct Network
 Patricia M. Nazemetz, Xerox's benefits director, chose six H.M.O.'s, including some of the nation's largest, to direct the network. The goal, she said, was to concentrate the company's buying clout, which had been dispersed across 250 Xerox offices and 180 H.M.O.'s.
"It struck me that I wasn't able to have a relationship with 200 H.M.O.'s," she said.
With the smaller group of H.M.O.'s, Xerox was able to insist on improvements in quality of care as measured by surveys that asked employees to assess their health plan's performance. "Some are doing a very good job," she said, "but it doesn't mean they couldn't get better."
"Can they say to a member, for example, 'You've just passed your 40th birthday; it's time for your mammogram?' " she asked. "Are they saying, 'the last time you had your blood pressure checked was 12 months ago; it's time to come back in?' "
 
The Choice at Headquarters
 Employees at Xerox headquarters in Stamford have a choice of three of the six H.M.O.'s in the company system: Kaiser Foundation Health Plans; U.S. Healthcare, whose home office is in Blue Bell, Pa., or Prucare, which is owned by the Prudential Life Insurance Company in Newark.
The other H.M.O. contractors are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rochester, where Xerox has 13,000 workers; FHP International, based in Fountain Valley, Calif. and the HMO Group in New Brunswick, N.J., an association of several nonprofit plans. Besides their own enrollees, these six also supervise the scores of independent Xerox-approved H.M.O.'s around the country, so employees usually have a choice.
Xerox is ready to "share our ideas with the Clinton Administration, if they're interested," Mr. Allaire said. But he avoided making specific recommendations. "I'm not sure we could say that what Xerox did is right for the country," Mr. Allaire said. "It sure isn't perfect."

HEADLINE: Swords to Plowshares: The Bureaucratic Snags

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
At first glance, it seemed like the perfect collaboration between Government and industry -- just what President Clinton championed, in fact, during his campaign.
With great fanfare, James D. Watkins, then the Secretary of Energy, announced plans in October for a $70 million venture among two major national weapons laboratories and Cray Research Inc. to develop a new generation of supercomputers. The project would advance technology, improve American competitiveness and benefit the environment with programs to map climate change. 
 But the project has drawn criticism from rival companies, which attack it as a sweetheart deal giving unfair advantage to one player in the supercomputer field. And now, the Energy Department says it is merely in "initial discussions" with Cray.
 
The Problems of Conversion
 The dispute highlights the difficulties that confront the new President in reaching his goal of redirecting Government research away from weapons development. Mr. Clinton has said that with the cold war over, and the economy in need of a competitive lift, the laboratories should designate as much as 20 percent of their combined budget of $25 billion for research ventures with private industry into new technologies.
Problems are presenting themselves, though, and not only with choosing one company over another or with picking the right project. Bureaucratic infighting at the Energy and Defense Departments, which share control of the nation's research laboratories; budget battles, and patent-rights disputes have created obstacles that even lab officials say make it hard to work with industry.
Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and chairman of a House Small Business Committee panel that held hearings on the issue in December, says that much of the nation's economic health depends on overcoming these hurdles. "Taxpayers pay a fortune for all these labs, but unless we can excavate the fruits of all those dollars we're not going to be tapping our potential," he said.
Despite years of earnest prodding by both Congress and the Bush Administration, there are few demonstrable results from technology transferred out of the nation's biggest energy and military laboratories.
"There has always been a civil war between the labs and D.O.E. on technology transfer," one White House official involved in technology policy said. "The labs have been straining at the bit to be involved with industry, because they saw their old mission dying. But the central bureaucracy at D.O.E. didn't want that to happen."
Federally sponsored research and development goes on in hundreds of labs. The Energy Department oversees 21 huge labs, with a combined budget of roughly $6 billion and a work force of more than 70,000 people. These range from the Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories in New Mexico, which have been primarily devoted to weapons research, to the Oakridge National Laboratory in Tennessee that works primarily on energy projects.
The Defense Department also operates a vast network of laboratories with a combined budget of about $7 billion and more than 60,000 employees. In addition, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration runs 10 labs, and the National Institutes of Health finances more than $9 billion in medical research, mostly through universities and other outside organizations.
The biggest debate focuses on the Energy Department, because its labs are huge and their expertise has potentially wide industrial applications.
In December, officials at three weapons labs -- Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California -- urged the new Administration to formulate a series of "grand challenges," modeled after the Apollo moon program. Among the suggested projects were creation of a high-speed national communications "superhighway," development of an automobile that burns far less fuel and an effort to understand global climate changes.
"We feel the national labs have a significant amount to contribute," said Kay Adams, director of the Industrial Partnership Center at Los Alamos. Sandia, in Albuquerque, has formed 71 cooperative research and development agreements, or cradas, as they are known, covering $191 million in work, of which industry partners will finance at least 50 percent.
One prominent example, involving a number of laboratories, is research on battery technology for electric cars. There, the Energy Department is contributing $130 million over four years to the Advanced Battery Consortium of businesses, car companies and equipment manufacturers, and much of that money will pay for research at the Federal labs.
 
Lack of a Corporate Culture
 But experts in technology policy say the labs often suffer from a cultural gap that makes it hard for them to address business concerns. The biggest complaint is that the labs focus heavily on fundamental research while industry is market driven and has needs that are much more short term. Worse still, these experts say, the labs do not have enough authority over their operations so that even when they try to forge ahead, the agencies overseeing them often hold them back.
For example, officials of Motorola Inc. reported to Representative Wyden's Subcommittee on Regulation, Business Opportunities and Energy that they had often spent more than a year negotiating agreements with Federal laboratories -- and then simply gave up on many proposed agreements because of legal disputes.
Lab officials say they can accept only a small fraction of the industry proposals they receive, because they lack the authority to redirect money from other work. "I have in front of me 70 proposals for about $250 million in work over the next three years, but I have an available pool of $30 million," Daniel Arvizu, head of Sandia's technology transfer office, said.
A report last fall by the Council on Competitiveness, a nonprofit organization in Washington formed by corporate executives, academics and labor leaders, called for major changes in how Federal labs are controlled. The council urged that Congress require labs run by the Energy Department and NASA to assign at least 10 percent of their budgets to technology transfer programs. It also urged that lab directors be given the authority to negotiate and carry out joint research agreements on their own.
But lab officials say there is a strong reluctance in the Energy Department to shifting gears. "We haven't been real successful in re-allocating money," Ms. Adams of Los Alamos said. "It's sort of like changing the direction of a battleship."
Roger A. Lewis, director of technology utilization at the Energy Department, said the Government had improved its deal-making. Working with the computer industry, the Government drafted a model contract for collaborations that has speeded up the process of negotiation and approval. "A lot of the complaints are based on data that is a year or two old," he said. "A lot has changed."
In addition, Energy Department officials contend that they now think about technology transfer to industry much more broadly than before. Mr. Lewis noted that fully $1.5 billion of research money, in fields like clean coal technology and renewable energy, involve industry partners and the labs can often tap into this money even though it is not part of their official technology transfer budget.
 
Industry Rivalries
 Finally, there are the issues of fairness posed by the Cray controversy. When the Energy Department announced the "preliminary agreement" for a $70 million jointly financed program on Oct. 29, it said that Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos labs would work with Cray on supercomputer programs for a range of environmental, industrial and military tasks.
What outraged rivals was that the Government also indicated that it would work on operating systems, the basic instructions that would run programs on Cray's new computers. Some of the rivals took that to mean that the Government would be underwriting Cray's next computer and giving Cray valuable business.
Those objecting included the Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., Convex Computer of Richardson, Tex., and Ncube of Foster City, Calif. "We are incensed," Michael Mierer, president of Ncube, said. "They are effectively getting a $35 million Government contribution, and that gives us a competitive disadvantage."
Mr. Lewis of the Energy Department acknowledged the controversy but defended the plan. "When you are dealing with the private sector, you are going to have some folks object to having relationships with their competitors," he said, adding that other companies are still free to propose their own deals.
Nevertheless, Energy Department officials have retreated from the fanfare of the original announcement. They now say they are only in initial discussions and have made no decision about what form the collaboration with Cray would take.

Amerikans Ask Help, but Americans Pay No Heed

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMERIKA, Germany

 BODY:
After long years of proud success, Amerika is in evident decline. Years of misrule by short-sighted ideologues have led to economic collapse. Unemployment is chronic, and many residents fear that worse times lie ahead.
"We may all have to leave," groused Hans Friedrich, a leading specialist in Amerikan history. "Then we would have an Amerika without Amerikans. How would that look?" 
 The problems afflicting this Amerika are not likely ever to find their way to Bill Clinton's desk. It is not a vast continent but a quiet Saxon village 35 miles northwest of the Czech border. Its residents complain not about politicians in Washington, but about those in Bonn and Berlin.
Amerika's story is a microcosm of Central Europe's economic and political history. From its founding more than 150 years ago through its boom years to its ultimate collapse, it reflects the fate of many small industrial centers in what was once the Communist world.
 
100 Good Years
 According to Mr. Friedrich, who is reputed to know more about Amerika than anyone, the spinning mill around which this village was built opened in 1836. For generations it produced high-quality wool, much of which was used to manufacture rugs for export.
The mill was built beside a wide stream, and workers' housing was put up on the opposite side, with only a rickety, narrow bridge in between. Workers had to struggle to keep their balance as they crossed. On windy days it seemed as perilous as an Atlantic crossing, and workers setting out on such days would joke to each other, "We're off to America."
"The town didn't have a name, and after a while they just decided to call it Amerika," Mr. Friedrich said.
Amerika prospered for more than a century, but as the textile industry changed, the town was unable to change with it.
After World War II, Amerika and the rest of Saxony became part of East Germany, which had little money to invest in modernization. When the two Germanys reunited in 1990, the thousands of state-owned businesses became the property of the Treuhand agency, a new public corporation charged with selling the businesses to private bidders.
In Amerika, Treuhand inherited not simply the mill complex, but the entire village. The outmoded mill survived only a year after unification, and Treuhand began to seek a buyer who would remake Amerika.
Hoping that the village's name might attract foreign interest, Treuhand ran a small advertisement in several investment journals in the United States. It was headlined, "Amerika for Sale."
The advertisement described a 200-acre parcel of land in an "idyllic river valley" with about 40 buildings and 700,000 square feet of usable floor space. It suggested that investors might want to create a research institute or a "leisure time and adventure town" here.
 
Clinic 'Our Best Hope'
 "We thought maybe some American company would want to come and set up a theme park or a western saloon or something like that," said the Mayor, Gerald Merkel, who likes to call himself the first democratically elected leader in Amerikan history. "There was a little interest, but nothing really firm. Now it looks like the clinic idea is our best hope."
When it became clear that there would be no money-generating offers for Amerika, the Saxony state government stepped in. Officials were looking for a place to build a new hospital for patients with lung and respiratory ailments, and Amerika, a pristine and quiet spot, seemed ideal.
Saxony recently reached a quiet agreement to buy Amerika for $3 million, half the original asking price. If health agencies approve, the deal will be officially concluded soon.
"Ultimately there will be some jobs for local people there," Mr. Merkel said. "The clinic is going to need various support services, and there will probably be a hotel and restaurant to go with it. Everybody is happy that at last something is going to happen."
For many Amerikans, however, relief is tempered by fear that they may lose their homes. All of the village's 108 residents, 80 percent of whom are unemployed, live in two apartment blocks that are likely to be torn down. They are trying to organize a fund to buy the two buildings, but their financial resources are very limited.
As they await word of their fate, Amerikans maintain the quiet lives to which they have been accustomed since the mill closed more than a year ago. A few have jobs in nearby towns, but most spend their time puttering in their gardens or trading stories at the train depot.
 
Trains Still Pass Through
 The depot is nothing more than a small shed with a sign that says "Amerika." The rail link was built in 1870 to serve the mill, and several trains still pass through every day. Each weekday morning, the village's few children ride one stop to the next large town, Penig, for school.
Everyone at the depot has an Amerikan story to tell. There's the one about the woman from nearby Thuringia who sent a package to her son here, only to receive it back six months later covered with postal stamps from the United States. And there's the one about Gerd Hofmann's first day in the East German Army, when he was jailed for insubordination after telling an officer that he lived in Amerika.
Like many Amerikans, Mayor Merkel has had some depressing times lately, but is finally hopeful that life here is going to improve.
"Amerika has a long history and a positive history," he insisted. "A place like this does not simply die."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Tied To Clinton Deficit Cut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
For the bond market, this is the first important week of Bill Clinton's Presidency. Last night, from the Oval Office, he began a campaign for support of an economic program that he will outline tomorrow in more detail to a joint session of Congress.
So investors, traders and speculators will now be able to begin judging whether the President can really do what he has promised -- cut the record Federal budget deficit. 
 That judgment is crucial for interest rates over the next several months. If Mr. Clinton is believed, interest rates on the 30-year Treasury bond could fall to 7 percent or even lower. If he is not, a lot of the surprising rally of 1993 could be dissipated in a hurry.
 
Market's Bias
 Currently, the market's bias favors lower interest rates. Even those who have been astonished by the 1993 Clinton rally agree.
"I thought there would be more cynicism," said Joseph Liro, the chief economist at S. J. Warburg, referring to President Clinton's promises about cutting the Federal budget deficit, which has climbed back to record levels despite similar promises by Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan. "But the market wants to believe."
Mr. Liro had forecast late last year that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond would fall to around 7.2 percent by midyear, but that it would be pulled down mostly by the market's growing confidence that inflation would continue to be minimal for some time to come.
 
Near a 7-Year Low
 But the 30-year bond's yield is already below 7.2 percent. It closed at 7.12 percent Friday, the lowest in almost seven years and just a normal day's trading away from 7.10 percent, the 1980's low reached in April 1986. Below that, one has to look back to the 1970's, when the long bond was a 20-year bond and carried yields close to 7 percent.
For the record, however, here are some of the concerns that skeptics like Mr. Liro and others have that could alter the market's bias toward lower rates.
One is the economy. Recent signs, from orders for durable goods to retail sales, show that the economy is picking up a little steam. That means instead of growing at a 2 to 2.5 percent pace at the beginning of this year, which would be slower than the 3-percent-plus rate for the end of 1992, the economy appears to be in a similar 3 percent stride.
This leads Donald Fine, another economist who has been surprised by the rally, to conclude: "Maybe rates will move lower now. But they won't end the year there; they will be higher."
The reason that Mr. Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., predicts this resurgence in interest rates is that traders and investors will eventually pay attention to the stronger economy, something they have chosen to ignore for now. Then their expectations about inflation will rise as they calculate that stronger growth will lead to price increases. And that worry should bring down Treasury bond and note prices and push yields, which move in the opposite direction, higher.
But more immediately, the concern is President Clinton. He has brought on much of the bond rally by saying what the market regards as the right things about cutting spending and the Federal budget deficit. He is challenging all to sacrifice to reduce the deficit. Last night, he indicated that he had backed off his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut, and he directly asked the middle class to pay more. This has all spelled commitment to many in the bond market.
Now the question is whether the President can actually achieve deficit reduction. Washington is littered with believable promises that could not be fulfilled. "He has said the right words," Mr. Liro said. "Now, the deeds have to follow."
As for this week, if the President gives the nation broad outlines and not much else, some in the bond market could get impatient. It appears that the hard details of his deficit-cutting may not be out until late March, when his budget is due in Congress.
 
Details and Reactions
 In addition to possible damage from waiting more than a month for real details, there will be the reactions from Congress and elsewhere to contend with. If they are not positive, that could hurt because it would make bond traders remember that it is much easier to propose deficit reduction than approve it.
And on Thursday, after Mr. Clinton's addresses to Congress, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, will deliver the central bank's annual policy statement to Congress. He has been very supportive so far but he will be asked to comment anew on the President's ideas.
There is also doubt over whether Mr. Clinton has the ability to push a deficit-reduction program through Congress. "I have become somewhat more skeptical about how much credible deficit-reduction we can get from Clinton," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "For a President to be effective he has to be feared by Congress."
Mr. Jones is not sure Mr. Clinton is. He noted that the "most credible" proposal mentioned by the new Administration was a freeze on the cost-of-living increase for Social Security recipients. But that was dropped quickly when the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said, "No."
Patrick Rothstein, a managing director at Merrill Lynch Government Securities, took a contrary view, arguing that Mr. Clinton's speech to Congress tomorrow should not be that important. He said the market is being driven now by what traders call technicals. In this case, it is the simple fact that the Federal Government has to borrow billions of dollars less than expected for the next several months.
As a result, there is a smaller supply of Treasury bonds to meet a steady demand. And this shortage is expected to support prices.
"The market right now is so myopic it is not even thinking about inflation," Mr. Rothstein said.
Yet, echoing the theme of Mr. Fine of Chase Securities, he sees some early inflationary signals, including a turn upward in the Commodity Research Bureau index and a rise in gold prices. And by the fall, he adds, the Government's borrowing needs will be increasing again. "Behind the scenes the seeds of discontent are being sown," he said.

In Tough Times for Business, Videos and Much, Much More

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE , N.J.

 BODY:
BOB HAINES sold some Lotto tickets, then he weighed and took payment for a U.P.S. package to be shipped, and reminded the man at the copying machine to make sure he picked up his original.
Then he got back to his point, which was, "In the video business, you either grow or go out of business." 
 Even the big video-rental chains are selling compact disks, renting cameras and selling video games. Mr. Haines, the owner of Village Video here, is an independent in a world of franchise operations, however, and for every move the big guys make, he figures he has to make seven just to stay alive.
He sells another Lotto ticket. The jackpot is up to $15 million, and that is bringing the bettors in. A woman spends $60, of which 5 percent is his share.
Clinton Administration economists looking for ways to revive the national economy might consider business people like Mr. Haines, a 55-year-old entrepreneur who got out of the heavy-truck sales-and-service business six years ago and answered an ad for the video movie rental business. Macroeconomic policy may be made in bold strokes at the highest levels, but Mr. Haines operates at the micro level, in the slow working out of dozens of educated guesses as he and thousands like him try to stay ahead of the big operators on their way to becoming -- it could happen -- big operators themselves.
Mr. Haines's latest decision was to start a Tuesday special, three titles from the cheaper "B" list for three days for $4.99, a promotion that should bring the customer back into the shop on Friday evening, maybe with a couple of kids tugging at the sleeves and begging for one of the more expensive new-release "A" titles, "because there's no school tomorrow."
The Tuesday Special is just the latest effort to bring customers in the door. Besides the Lotto, the United Parcel Service and the copying machine, Mr. Haines rents Nintendo video game cartridges, sells and develops film, and operates a fax service. Mr. Haines said of his fax machine: "Income $30, expenses $90. I wondered, do I really need to be in the fax business?"
Moreover, Mr. Haines repairs video equipment, and sells money orders, movie posters, shipping boxes, used movie videos and candy and soda pop. Let the big chains go into compact disks, he said: he worked out a deal with Varsity Pizza next door to have the pizza delivered with a video.
(Another package for U.P.S. goes out. Mr. Haines collects and keeps about $1 over the standard cost.)
"The worse the economy gets, the more you have to try to keep ahead of what people want," Mr. Haines said in a moment of calm. "People used to come in and take out two or three titles for the weekend, but now they're talking about the General Motors plant closing in Ewing, there are some state workers who are hearing about layoffs, and more and more I see them coming in saying to the kids, 'O.K., we're getting one family movie tonight and that's it! O.K. one Nintendo cartridge too, but for one night, not three.' "
Because these are the suburbs, which are a kind of made-up world anyway, the local preference runs heavily to comedy and drama. Still, a steady number of men slip behind the embarrassing little walled-off area at the back of the store labeled "Adult Movie Room," where, instead of selecting the lurid tape in its box, they take little numbered tags that they discreetly hand over to Mr. Haines, who pulls the title from behind the counter.
(Lotto.)
(Film developing.)
(Two titles out: "Old Yeller" and "The Little Mermaid.")
"Rainy days in the middle of the week," Mr. Haines said, answering an awkward question about the smutty titles. "The construction workers get sent home early, the kids are at school and their wives are out working."
The rest of us also have our doubtful video habits, apparently. Many simply forget their tapes under the mail in the front hall or under the front seat of the car. This dilatoriness is part of a wider observed habit of the video renter, which is that everyone likes to go pick out the weekend movie, but after it has been enjoyed, no one wants to bring it back.
(Lotto.)
(U.P.S. box.)
Still, Mr. Haines often ends up forgiving part of the late charges, relying on the shopkeeper's oldest and hardest truth: "You make a choice," he said a little grimly, "to lose a little on the rental to keep a customer."
(Two tapes out: "Universal Soldier" and "Victoria Principle," not to be confused with the star of "Dallas.")
With the part-time help of three Rider College students from up the road, and his wife as the business's bookkeeper, Mr. Haines puts in about 55 hours of work, seven days a week, shipping packages, punching up lottery tickets, fiddling with the copying machine and renting about 1,000 titles. His last vacation was two years ago, and it amounted only to three days at the Jersey Shore.
This is a schedule that has him thinking from time to time about surrendering the splendid drudgery of being a sole proprietor and joining a video franchise. Why? "Forty-hour weeks," he said.
But a few square feet of unoccupied wall space next to his U.P.S. counter has given him one more idea to try first.
"Mailboxes!" he said.

HEADLINE: Health Initiative Tilting Toward Price Regulation

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton's health-care initiative was to have been a delicate balance between Government regulation and free-market competition. But so far, a rush to monitor and regulate prices has been the policy's most conspicuous new twist, health-care experts say.
Late last week, the President and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, criticized drug companies and the prices they charged for vaccines. Over the weekend, Administration officials like Leon E. Panetta and George Stephanopoulos made clear that the President wanted to impose cost controls on health-care providers as a way to hold down Medicare outlays and as a prelude to sweeping changes in the health-care system. 
 "You have to lead with cost controls," said Mr. Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. Mr. Panetta, the budget director, said that with spending of well over $200 billion a year on Medicare and Medicaid, "you've got to enact some cost controls in those areas, particularly aiming at the providers."
Such comments suggest that Clinton Administration officials think the Government can squeeze the revenues of doctors, hospitals and drug companies without adverse effects on patients.
 
Savings Before Access
 Concern about the Federal budget deficit has, for the moment, overtaken concern about how to guarantee access to health care for the 35 million Americans who have no health insurance. And the idea of regulating prices, perhaps by extending Medicare rates to private patients, looks much easier than the complex business of designing a system of "managed competition," in which networks of doctors and hospitals compete to offer high-quality care at reasonable prices.
Vaccines are cited by Federal officials and corporate executives as a test case. On Friday, a day after Mrs. Clinton attacked drug prices and profits as excessive, her husband took up the same theme, describing vaccine prices as "shocking." He complained that drug companies spent too much on advertising and lobbying and invited them to negotiate the supply and price of their products with the Government.
Today, executives from four vaccine manufacturers -- Merck & Company, Connaught Laboratories, SmithKline Beecham and Lederle-Praxis Biologicals, a division of American Cyanamid -- met with White House officials. Even as they lamented the attack on their industry, Mrs. Clinton met today with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Dennis Rivera of the hospital workers' union, who applauded her efforts.
But Barry P. Bosworth, who was director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability in the Carter Administration, warns Clinton Administration officials to "think long and hard before trying to impose price controls" on doctors or hospitals.
 
Warning of Distortions
 Such controls, he said, are not easy to design or enforce. He said that in the health-care industry "price controls can work for a short interim period, but at a cost."
"They cause distortions, which will make it difficult to introduce a more comprehensive health-care plan at a later date," Mr. Bosworth said.
In a special issue of the quarterly journal Health Affairs, two of Mr. Clinton's advisers, Prof. Paul Starr of Princeton University and Walter A. Zelman, an aide to the California Insurance Commissioner, say states should have "contingent authority to regulate rates" if managed competition fails to control costs.
But Clinton Administration officials, seeing an urgent need to control health costs and reduce the deficit, say they want to take immediate steps to limit payments to hospitals and doctors.
Dr. Jim Bob Brame, a family doctor in the small West Texas town of Eldorado, said today, "I fear we will be faced with more regulation, more ratcheting down, more restrictions on physician payment."
 
Expects Insurers to Pay Less
 Dr. Brame said he expected the Government to put "some strict expenditure caps" on Medicare payments for doctors' services, and he said he would not be suprised if the Government tried to freeze or reduce such payments.
And private health insurers may follow suit. "Unfortunately," Dr. Brame said, "the private health insurance industry will have no problem accepting a national fee schedule similar to the one used in Medicare. That would reduce their costs."
Private health insurers often pay hospitals and doctors more than Medicare pays. As a result, private patients and their employers indirectly subsidize Medicare. In some regions, for example, doctors charge private patients $28 or more for a routine office visit, while Medicare pays $19.
In their economic analysis of the drug industry, Hillary and Bill Clinton echoed Harry S. Truman's indictment of the steel industry. In 1952, just before moving to take over the steel mills to avert a strike, Truman complained of "outrageous prices" and said, "The steel industry has never been so profitable as it is today." Likewise, on Friday, Mr. Clinton said vaccine prices were excessive, and he declared, "We cannot have profits at the expense of our children."
 
A Difficult Transition
 Whatever changes are made in the health-care system, the transition will be difficult.
John T. Dunlop, who led the Cost of Living Council, which enforced wage and price controls under President Richard M. Nixon, said today: "Health-care reform is necessary, but what do you do to keep prices from going up while you develop the reform institutions? In the absence of some kind of cost-control mechanism, no reform measures will have a significant bite, a significant effect in retarding health costs, for three to five years."
Even as Mr. Clinton complains about vaccine prices, he praises biotechnology as a model industry, and biotechnology helps produce vaccines.
Lisa J. Raines, a vice president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association, said: "Any discussion of the possibility that the Government will regulate drug prices chills investment. It could lead to Government regulating the rate of return. Once you turn our industry into a public utility, then investors will put money into companies that make wrinkle creams and other cosmetics rather than companies that make life-saving drugs."

HEADLINE: Police Search For Motive In 6 Slayings

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Detectives investigating the execution-style deaths of six people in a Bronx apartment said yesterday that the killers had used at least two types of guns and that 600 rounds of live ammunition had been found hidden in the apartment. But they said they still had no idea of the killers' identities and motive.
As relatives and friends mourned the three adults and three teen-agers who were each lined up face down on a living room floor and shot in the head Sunday at 645 Prospect Avenue in the South Bronx, the police scoured the drug-infested neighborhood for witnesses and examined the live ammunition, as well as shell casings left by the assailants, $4,400 in cash and other clues found in the apartment. 
 The shell casings came from two types of guns, suggesting that at least two killers had invaded the sixth-floor apartment where three members of one family and three residents of other apartments were slain. This appeared to confirm the impression of neighbors who said they heard shots about 12:30 A.M. on Sunday and the footsteps of more than one person running down a hallway. The police would not disclose what types of guns were used.
 
One Victim With a Record
 While the police publicly placed no interpretation on finding a large sum of cash in a household receiving public assistance or on the hundreds of rounds of ammunition for guns of three kinds, neighbors and relatives of some of the victims said these items confirmed their suspicions that drugs were behind the shootings.
Several residents said that one victim, Edwin Santiago, a 17-year-old high school student, was known in the neighborhood as a low-level drug dealer and might have been the killers' intended target, while the other victims appeared to have been bystanders, shot to eliminate any witnesses.
The other victims were Mr. Santiago's mother, Julia Santana, about 40, and his sister, Maria Santana, 26, a factory worker, who shared Apartment 612 with him, and three neighbors: Miguel Camacho Rivera, 23, a handyman who was dating Maria; Annette Medina, 17, a friend of Maria's, and Christopher Hernandez, 15, an eighth-grade pupil whose presence in the apartment remained a mystery.
The police said Mr. Rivera was the only victim with a criminal record. They said he was arrested once for possession of drugs in 1991, but did not know the disposition of the case. His family said he was placed on probation and had not been in trouble since his arrest.
While there were a number of clues and dozens of investigators continued to question relatives, friends, neighbors and even drug dealers in the area, there were no eyewitnesses and detectives said that there had been little progress in the case.
"We're not completely up against the wall, but we don't have much," Deputy Chief Edward Cappello, commander of detectives in the Bronx, said at a late afternoon news briefing yesterday at the 40th Precinct station house at 257 Alexander Avenue. Noting that the police had received few calls on the case, he added, "We need the public's help more than ever."
The police urged anyone with information on the case to call (212) 583-0144 or (212) 577-TIPS, and to reach residents of the largely Hispanic South Bronx community, officers made appeals over Spanish-language radio and television stations. Some investigators said the lack of public response reflected fear that cooperation with the police would bring retaliation by drug dealers.
 
Remembering Victims
 Chief Cappello said any suggestion that Mr. Santiago was the intended target was speculation. "I don't know too much other than he is a streetwise -- was a streetwise -- kid," he said. While the police tended to rule out robbery, he emphasized that no motive had been established. Pressed about a possible drug connection, he said, "It could be drugs; it might not be drugs."
As mourners came and went at the six-story red-brick apartment building on Prospect Avenue at East 152d Street, relatives and friends gave poignant accounts of the lives of the victims and told of a daily struggle for survival in a neighborhood where poverty, unemployment and other problems lay beneath the more visible dangers of drugs and gunfire.
Ms. Medina was the mother of a 10-month-old girl and had lived with her mother and sister for seven years in Apartment 616, across the hall from the apartment where she died, said her sister, Doreen Rivera. She had planned to earn a high school equivalency diploma and to take a test to become a police officer. "She really wanted to be a police officer badly," Ms. Rivera said.
 
Envisioning Last Moments
 The father of her child, Jose Montanez, 22, a telephone operator who lived elsewhere but sometimes spent nights with Ms. Medina and the baby, said he had planned to marry her when they could afford an apartment. He said she worked at odd jobs as a cashier or clothing saleswoman. "After the baby came, she was really motivated," he said. "She wanted to do things with her life."
He tried to envision her last moments. "All I could imagine is how scared she must have been, knowing they were going to kill her," he said. "I'm sure she must have pleaded with them not to kill her. I'm sure she told them she had a baby."
Mr. Rivera grew up in the Bronx but went to high school in Puerto Rico and returned a few years ago, his brother, Jose, recalled. He said Mr. Rivera dated Ms. Santana for a year, but rarely visited her apartment. He said they and Ms. Medina were all wearing coats when killed, perhaps to go out dancing.
Jose Rivera said his family suspected that the killers were drug dealers and that Mr. Santiago was the target. "Our family firmly believes that Edwin was the cause of everything that happened upstairs," he said.
Christopher Hernandez, who lived in a third-floor apartment with his mother, 6-year-old sister and 17-year-old brother, was an avid artist, on the eighth-grade honor roll at Intermediate School 52, had attended after-school art classes for three years and wanted to go to La Guardia High to study art, his brother, Juan, said.
He said Christopher helped his mother clean house, washed and ironed his own clothes and always asked for permission when he went out. On Saturday night, he went to a party and was driven home by the uncle of a friend about 10:30 P.M. -- but never arrived home. He had nothing to do with the Santana-Santiago family, and it was unclear why he was with the other victims, Juan said.
He said his family had long feared the streets and wanted to move away. "It was getting too dangerous and violent here, but now it's too late," he said. "My brother had a life in front of him. He was talented. He had a gift."

HEADLINE: Scheme to Split School District Is Revived

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Labor problems and financial distress in the Los Angeles Unified School District have given new life to an old idea: divide the sprawling school system into smaller parts so it is easier to manage and more responsive to local needs.
The idea, discussed here from time to time, is now emanating from the San Fernando Valley, where middle-class families want to separate themselves from the misery of the inner city and take control of their own schools. 
 A prime mover in the drive to break up the school system is David Roberti, a Van Nuys Democrat and President pro tem of the State Senate whose new district, after reapportionment, includes the valley. He plans to introduce legislation shortly that would start the process.
Mr. Roberti hopes to split the 641,000-student district into six or seven parts with 100,000 students each. An alternative proposal by the State Department of Education suggests 30 districts, each with 20,000 to 25,000 students. In the San Fernando Valley, some parents hope simply to secede, forming a second district separate from the city.
 
Minorities Alarmed
 The various plans for breakup have raised alarms here in the black and Hispanic communities, which are often at odds, with the first group declining in numbers and influence and the second ascending. Both black and Hispanic parents fear that the inner-city schools will be left with less money, less-experienced teachers, older buildings and fewer white students than now. They contend that the proposals constitute de facto segregation, although by economic class more than by race because even the San Fernando Valley schools are mostly nonwhite.
Labor and school board officials are also against the breakup plans. Among them are Helen Bernstein, president of the teachers union, and Leticia Quesada, head of the elected Board of Education, both of whom would lose power and patronage if the district was dismantled.
Instead, Ms. Bernstein, Ms. Quesada and many others here favor another recent proposal for decentralized, school-based management, modeled on changes elsewhere in the last decade. This plan was presented with great fanfare this week by a coalition of business, civic and educational leaders led by Mike Roos, a former State Assemblyman.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. to Offer New Minicomputers

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. will introduce today a series of more powerful minicomputers and software products in an effort to rejuvenate its midrange computer business.
The AS-400 family of minicomputers has been one of the International Business Machines Corporation's bright spots in the last couple of years, posting strong growth and profits. But its minicomputer sales slipped alarmingly late last year, especially in Europe, where I.B.M. gets about half its minicomputer revenues, analysts estimated. 
 Some analysts said the sales slippage was mainly a result of the weak economies in Europe and Japan and was not a shift away from I.B.M. machines. By December, the AS-400 sales began to pick up again, they said.
Nonetheless, I.B.M. faces increasing competition in the market for midrange computers, which, broadly defined, are machines priced from $15,000 to $1 million.
 
Microprocessor Rivals
 Traditional rivals like Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and NCR offer minicomputers with the Unix operating system, an industry standard software, or "open" system. And new companies like Sequent Computer Systems and Pyramid Technology have entered the minicomputer business with machines built around lower-cost microprocessor technology that also run on open software systems. The I.B.M. machine uses a proprietary operating system.
In the midrange computer market, I.B.M. still holds the largest share, at roughly 22 percent. The AS-400's big edge is the thousands of existing software applications, from data base programs to general accounting, that have been written specifically for the I.B.M. machine.
Still, the rival microprocessor-based machines are cheaper, and more software applications are being written to run on their open systems.
"The AS-400 has got to keep up with this new breed of minicomputers because that's where the industry is heading," said Gary Dvorchak, an analyst for Hambrecht & Quist Inc. in San Francisco.
 
New Software Products
 Today, I.B.M. will announce a series of AS-400 machines whose performance is 30 percent to 60 percent higher than previous models and will introduce new software products, according to consultants who were briefed by the company. I.B.M., they said, would also discuss its plans for moving to an open software environment.
There are sharply divided views on the outlook for the AS-400. Analysts' estimates of I.B.M.'s minicomputer revenues this year range from declines of more than 10 percent to growth in the double digits.
David Andrews, managing partner of ADM Consulting Inc. in Cheshire, Conn., said that the AS-400 family, if properly marketed, was still a growth business for I.B.M. This year, he expects the company's minicomputer revenues to increase by roughly 10 percent.
 
Still Popular Among Businesses
 The ease of use of the AS-400's operating software and its many applications, Mr. Andrews said, continue to make it the computer of choice in many corporate offices and factories.
Still, the biggest growth area for the AS-400 may not provide much comfort at I.B.M. headquarters in Armonk, N.Y..
"The hottest thing for the AS-400 is large companies shifting applications off mainframe computers onto groups of AS-400's," Mr. Andrews said, explaining that running the applications on minicomputers is often cheaper than on mainframes, I.B.M.'s traditional mainstay.
The minicomputer business remains extremely profitable for I.B.M., Mr. Andrews said. Last year, sales of AS-400 machines and its operating software amounted to $5 billion and generated pretax operating profits of more than $1 billion, he estimated. If all I.B.M.'s minicomputer-related peripherals, software and maintenance revenue were included, the revenues would reach $14 billion and pretax operating profits would be $2 billion to $3 billion, he said.
To date, the AS-400, first marketed in 1988, has been an extraordinary success. It resulted from a crash development effort, code-named the Silverlake project, at I.B.M.'s offices in Rochester, Minn. It was started after the company had faltered badly in midrange computers.

HEADLINE: Tax Proposal For Puerto Rico

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Senator David Pryor, a critic of prescription drug costs, said today that he would seek to repeal tax breaks for drug companies and other industries with manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico.
Mr. Pryor, a Democrat from Arkansas, said the tax breaks, embodied in Section 936 of the tax code, have become "nothing but a gigantic tax windfall for the pharmaceutical industry," costing the Treasury $3 billion a year. 
 He proposed a much less generous tax credit based on the actual wages the manufacturers pay workers on the island rather than their profits.
The drug industry defended the existing tax credit, contending that its incentives account for one-third of the 900,000 jobs in Puerto Rico.
Other industries, including electronics and apparel manufacturers, also make use of the credit.
Jeffrey L. Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said Section 936 has been "extremely important to the economy of Puerto Rico." Since 1950, employment in Puerto Rico has risen by half, he said, and the island's gross output has quintupled to $20 billion.

HEADLINE: An 'Unloved' Grass May Turn Hero In the Struggle Against Soil Erosion

 BODY:
VETIVER, a tall grass whose long, fragrant roots are commonly used in perfumes and soaps, could serve as an inexpensive and effective barrier against soil erosion, a panel of experts says.
Considered a leading threat to the environment, soil erosion results when nutrient-rich top soil is washed away by water or swept up by wind. Vetiver, when planted in rows across steep slopes, keeps soil and water from flowing past. 
 Experts on soil erosion and specialists on the vetiver plant, who collaborated on a recent study for the National Research Council, said that vetiver's roots, which are 6 to 10 feet deep, hold the grass barrier and soil in place from below while the plant's tall blades of grass form a barricade against runoff above ground.
 
Best Conditions for Plant
 Able to grow in acidic or alkaline, fertile or infertile, waterlogged or parched soils, vetiver does not deprive crops of nutrients or space. Its sharp grass blades do not seem to harm livestock but do discourage them from eating or disturbing the vetiver hedge, said Dr. Noel D. Vietmeyer of the research council, who directed the study.
Vetiver, believed to be native to India, grows best in tropical and subtropical areas where rainfall is heavy but frosts are rare. The researchers said the grass hedge is able to grow in drier climates, like those in areas of Africa, and in cooler but not freezing climates, like those in areas in the Southern United States.
The grass can take from a few months to a year to grow deep enough and tall enough to combat soil erosion produced by water. Generally, however, it is less effective against erosion caused by wind unless the grass is planted close together to form a dense wind barrier, the study said.
Some scientists say grasses were planted in various parts of the world to limit soil erosion as early as the 1920's. The new study, primarily financed by the Agency for International Development, was begun because vetiver has remained "unloved and unrecognized as a means of preventing soil erosion," said Dr. Vietmeyer. "It needed credibility."
Other plants that have been used to prevent soil erosion, like the vine kudzu, grow so rapidly and wildly that they become uncontrollable nuisances. He said vetiver was a self-leveling grass that grows tall enough to block erosion but does not grow out of control and, in that way, interfere with crops the way that kudzu, weeds and some other grasses do.
Vetiver is not effective in most of the United States, especially in parts of Iowa where the soil, among the richest in the world, is eroding at one of the fastest rates in the world, said Dr. David Pimentel, a professor of entomology at Cornell University who was an author of the new study.
He said the vetiver research findings should not detract from the importance of crop rotation and other erosion-control techniques that can be used alone in colder climates or in conjunction with vetiver in warmer areas. Dr. Pimentel said it takes 200 to 1,000 years to replace one inch of topsoil. "Once topsoil is lost, you cannot sit around and wait for it to correct itself," he said.
Dr. W. Doral Kemper, who directs the research unit on soil and water conservation for the Agriculture Department, is studying other methods to control soil erosion. He said rows of vetiver and other grasses should be planted more widely because the method was described about 50 years ago and works well. He said he was looking for other grasses that would withstand colder climates, like those in the Northern United States and Canada.
The researchers said that since a simple row of vetiver could keep large amounts of water on crops longer, they grow faster and denser. Dr. Vietmeyer said that in a poor economy when farmers tend to live hand to mouth, they see little incentive to protect the land from damage that might not become apparent for another decade.
"Increased moisture in the soil makes the crops and trees grow better," he said. "To the farmer struggling to feed his family this year, that may be the only important reason to plant vetiver."

HEADLINE: Social Castes Found to Be Not So Rare In Nature

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON

 BODY:
FOR years, an exclusive club made up of ants, bees, wasps and termites has ruled as the social elite of the animal world. The insects' well-run colonies of sterile workers devoted to serving their fat, fertile queens so impressed biologists as to acquire the scientific classification of social or "eusocial," a distinction even humans cannot claim.
But new studies indicate that many more species besides these well-known examples may be living eusocial lives, giving up their own chances of reproduction to help foster the offspring of others. 
 Scientists have now discovered eusociality in two species of thrips, a tiny insect. The eusocial thrips live as colonies in plant galls, defended by armed soldiers that never reproduce and will fight to the death against invaders. Eusociality has also been observed recently among a species of ambrosia beetles. The beetles live deep in tunnels inside eucalyptus trees, their sole purpose being to build and maintain their queen's labyrinthine world, never reproducing themselves.
Along with tree-dwelling aphids and the bizarre naked mole-rat, these species are helping to swell the ranks of those known to be eusocial.
Biologists say that the new additions may provide an important key to the puzzle of how such societies have come to exist. And researchers are happily predicting that many more such surprises are in store.
"A lot more animals are going to turn out to be eusocial," said Dr. Bernie Crespi, assistant professor of evolutionary biology at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia and the discoverer of the eusocial thrips. "People have thought that everything had been more or less discovered, but now that appears not to be the case at all."
Deborah S. Kent, a researcher with the Forestry Commission of New South Wales in Australia, discovered the ambrosia beetle's self-sacrificing habits by accident.
'We weren't even looking for the beetles being eusocial," Ms. Kent said. "We were looking at them because they're an economic problem in eucalyptus plantations and regrowth and have been for the last 40 years. People had already studied them but never recognized what was going on. The more people look the more they'll find."
Dr. William D. Hamilton, professor of evolutionary biology at Oxford University and a pioneer in understanding the evolution of eusociality, has a great respect for the phenomenon.
"It's the highest form of sociality," he said, "and it's what enables the ants to dominate the tropics. No organism but man so dominates everything that goes on in a tropical rain forest." Dr. Hamilton attributes the ants' success to their ability to organize their activities.
Dr. Hamilton was one of the first researchers to begin to solve the paradox of how the evolutionary struggle to survive and reproduce could give rise to creatures that never reproduce and spend their lives altruistically helping others to survive.
Ants, bees and wasps, known collectively as the hymenoptera, all share an unusual genetic system in which males carry only half the normal number of chromosomes, receiving a single set from their mothers. But a hymenopteran female, in the more conventional fashion, receives one set of chromosomes each from her mother and father.
Dr. Hamilton was the first to point out that the unusual genetics of the hymenoptera have the curious effect of making a female more closely related to her sisters than to even her own children, since she shares three-quarters of her genes in common with her siblings, but only half in common with her offspring. As a result, in order to propagate more of her genes into future generations, she can do better by staying in her mother's nest and helping to raise sisters rather than reproducing herself.
 
Looking at a Creature's Home
 The idea was a breakthrough in understanding eusociality, but not a complete answer. While all hymenoptera have the same genetic system of sex determination, not all are eusocial. In addition, termites, naked mole-rats and ambrosia beetles all carry the normal ratios of chromosomes from their mothers and fathers. So scientists have continued to search for a factor besides genetics that lies at the heart of the drive to become eusocial.
The new examples of eusociality hint that the nature of an animal's home may hold the answer.
As more eusocial species come to light, researchers note that a common thread is that of living inside a "valuable resource," like a hive or nest, that has taken much labor to build and maintain, and is valuable enough to die for.
In the near-deserts in eastern Australia, acacia trees dot the landscape, some daintily ornamented with small football-like shapes, inside of which hide the world's two known species of eusocial thrips.
Early in the growing season, female thrips, perhaps an eighth of an inch long, arrive at an acacia plant and begin eating one of its leaf-like stems. The stem will slowly develop into a gall in a football-like shape around the insect, creating a food-filled cavern in which she and all her offspring can live, safe from predators. Some of her offspring develop large front legs, armed with daggers pointing inward, which these soldiers use to kill those who threaten their home.
 
All-Important Home
 It turns out that there is only a short period during which a thrips can induce a plant to form a gall. Once that time is past, the thrips in the area must fight it out over those galls that have been created.
Dr. Crespi said the thrips were constantly fending off invaders, some of whom are other thrips that cannot make homes of their own and are specialized in stealing galls, as well as predators who come to eat the thrips themselves. Dr. Crespi's research on these creatures, financed by the National Geographic Society, was a decade in the making.
Researchers say the intense pressure to protect the all-important home base has driven the thrips, as well as others, to evolve a eusocial life style, complete with kamikaze soldiers that will defend it.
Similarly, eusocial aphids, like those discovered by Dr. Nancy Moran, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona at Tucson, patrol and defend the tiny galls they have formed on the cottonwood trees of Arizona; the galls are both a home and a source of food.
Dr. Moran said the galls had only a single exit hole, exactly the right size for a soldier aphid to exit for her patrolling duty. When someone or something disturbs a gall, which can contain thousands of aphids, the soldiers come out to attack and have been known to jam their plant-sucking mouth parts into human as well as insect intruders. Other aphids use horns on their heads to deter attackers.
"I was excited to find it," Dr. Moran said of the North American eusocial aphid. "It was sort of a mystery previously as to why there hadn't been any discoveries in North America, nothing besides hymenopterans and termites. There's more out there, for sure. It's mostly a matter of having someone there to look for it. I was on a hike when I found these."
While valuable, the homes defended by aphids and thrips pale in comparison to those fashioned by the ambrosia beetle. These beetles build extensive galleries of tunnels in the inner deadwood of eucalyptus trees.
When a female begins to build her empire, she works alone for more than six months drilling an entrance hole into the tree. It is often more than a year later when she finally lays the eggs that will produce the help she so desperately needs to continue her tunneling work.
 
Named for Food of Gods
 Ms. Kent said these enigmatic beetles were named after the food of the gods because biologists could not figure out what the insects were eating. Researchers now know that the beetles feed upon a fungus that they cultivate in their elaborate tunnel system. Ms. Kent describes the fungus as a moist, black sheen on the tunnel walls.
Researchers identify trees containing a beetle colony by tiny entrance ways, a tunnel of eucalyptus resin that sticks out of the tree like a spout. Unable to observe the beetles without killing the trees, researchers collect their samples by chain saw. After surveying more than 300 different colonies, Ms. Kent said she had found that the fungus galleries created by the beetles could be maintained for nearly 40 years. Scientists do not know how long the beetles or their queen live.
The importance of the galleries, not only for food production, but for safety, has also become clearer to scientists. Ms. Kent said that in all her surveys, only one predator was found inside a beetle home.
Naked mole-rats, whose lives were recently described in detail in "The Biology of the Naked Mole-Rat" (Princeton University Press, 1991), also build cavernous tunnels in which they live and love. Now a popular zoo animal, the once mysterious creature, nearly as ugly as it is intriguing, is the only eusocial mammal known.
These buck-toothed rodents dig tunnels in the East African savannah, inside of which reign a reproductive queen and several stud kings. While the number of these mole-rats can range up to 300 in a single colony, many of these inhabitants will never reproduce.
Many question remain for researchers about the origins of eusociality. In particular, the naked mole-rat has kept biologists asking why no other mammal, including humans, has evolved sterile, worker castes.

HEADLINE: SPORTS MARKETING;
Gifted Russian Youths, Sign Up Here

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
Pro Sports of Moscow, a fledgling talent agency loosely modeled after high-powered companies in the United States, recently began signing contracts with the parents of Russian children.
For providing coaches and training facilities to these potential stars, Pro Sports will receive 35 percent of what the athletes between the ages of 18 and 28 earn, plus an additional 5 percent for coaches assigned to the program. 
 In another place, in another time, this arrangement might have shocked some people and sparked an internal debate on sports and exploitation. But in Russia, now the Wild Wild West of the Eastern sports bloc, hardly a head was turned in disapproval as parents and guardians rushed to sign off on their talented 11-year-olds.
"If it helps children and coincides with the Olympic program, why not?" said Barazby Sabanchyev, head of marketing for the Olympic Committee of Russia.
 
Flow of Resources
 For decades, the Government of the Soviet Union poured its resources into three areas of technology: military hardware, aerospace research and Olympic sports. Now, the former Soviet Union is officially fractured into 15 independent national sports federations with no public financing and a great deal of capitalistic casting about for the sporting buck.
In Russia, apparently top-level sports will survive, contrary to dire predictions offered not so very long ago. After producing 111 medalists for the Unified Team at the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, the Russian republic remains the richest and most frenetic sports marketplace in the former Soviet Union.
National Olympic officials, along with a new breed of business opportunists, are forging new alliances each day with some of the most experienced, most impatient coaches in the world.
"If our coaches are the best in the world, they have to be rewarded what they're worth," said Aleksandr Koslovsky, secretary general of the Olympic Committee of Russia. "And they have to be patriotic enough to stay in a country where it is impossible to spend the money."
The money is arriving, some of it from surprising sources. The St. Petersburg Organizing Committee for the Goodwill Games in 1994, hoping to raise funds to support the international event and to maintain a strong national team, has begun a lottery at 50 rubles a ticket (about 9 cents) for a 2-million-ruble top prize ($3,571). This is the only lottery in Russia and figures to bring in enough revenue by itself to keep existing sports programs intact.
 
Financing Them All
 In January, Reebok International signed a breakthrough sponsorship agreement with the Russian Olympic Committee that will help finance all 20 of the Russian sports federations, from basketball to weight lifting, at least through the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and possibly beyond.
Other developments represent a new attitude toward fund-raising. The Olympic Committee of Russia, which won an internal battle of its own to represent the country in dealings with the International Olympic Committee, has sealed a marketing agreement with Harvey Schiller, executive director of the United States Olympic Committee. Both federations soon will sell the other's emblems in merchandizing plans that range from pins to sweatshirts.
An American-style sports dinner was held in Siberia in October, co-sponsored by the Olympic Siberian Academy and the Olympic Committee of Russia, honoring past Olympic greats. There was a business seminar in Moscow last month, as six sports businessmen from the West tried to explain to Russian administrators and unlicensed agents exactly how events and organizations can attract sponsorship money.
 
Costly Meals
 In June, there will be a fund-raising dinner at the Moscow Concert Hall, where the Russian Athlete of the Year will be announced to diners who have paid dearly for their meals.
"We must raise not only hard currency but rubles," said Sabanchyev, who must operate in an economy beset by inflation, and where the average Russian earns about $5 a month according to the latest exchange rate. "That is why we need Russian companies for sponsors, in addition to Western corporations. We've just started looking for sponsors, but already experienced three or four."
The Reebok deal was important for reasons other than the sheer dollar figure, which remains undisclosed. Other than a relatively minor agreement with the Elf oil company of France, the Russians had been unable to convince any major corporation that they were stable enough to support a major sponsor.
"My perception is that the sports organizations in general have survived three different regimes, that the middle bureaucracy is intact, and that they will continue to survive," said Roberto Muller, president of Reebok's Sports Division. "If Russia is no longer a true superpower, then sports becomes the only vehicle for the people's pride."
Just in case of unforeseen political in-fighting, Muller made 20 separate deals with the 20 separate sports federations in Russia.
"Billy Payne, the head of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, wants $40 million for every sponsorship," Muller said. "Compared to that, these federations are a bargain."
 
'Now's the Time'
 Not all potential investors are ready to bite. Don Dixon, head of the Lifestyle Marketing Group in New York, was approached about getting American corporations to buy "signage" on the jerseys of Russian soccer and ice hockey teams. He also received a fax in December from organizers seeking sponsors for the 1993 Baltic Games, where 350 athletes from the former Soviet Union will compete.
"I tell clients, now's the time to make contacts," said Dixon, who attended the marketing seminar in Moscow. "But I tell them, don't put dollar one in until you see what happens with the Yeltsin Government. By the second quarter of this year, you're looking at a solid opportunity on high-volume, low-cost products. You can make inroads."
Steve Woods, vice president of sales and marketing for the ProServ agency in Atlanta, also attended the seminar. In the future, he said, ProServ might represent the American endorsements of Russia's top athletes. But the agency is unlikely to compete with Pro Sports or any other Russian company on Russian turf. The rewards are too few.
"They're so much in the infancy of marketing," Woods said. "You have to tell them that putting up a logo in an arena is a good thing. They say, 'Why?' Everything is so loose. It's hard to make appointments, poor phone lines. They're between five and 10 years away from basic concepts."
 
Looking at Ethics
 Woods has pondered the ethical behavior of agencies such as Pro Sports, which takes the concept of the American-style agent several steps beyond its current definition.
"All it takes for these agencies is for one player to make it to the N.H.L., the N.B.A. or a pro soccer team and all the investments pay off," he said. "I thought about it for a while, signing away a kid for 10 years, and I'm not sure if that system is beneficial or harmful. It's hard for us to judge. We don't see the pain or despair."
Sergei Guzkov, press information director for the Olympic Committee of Russia, is the most optimistic Olympic official around, perhaps because it is his job to present the proper positive image.
"Not all recommendations we can use from outside," Guzkov said. "TV income and big ticket sales is impossible. But we now know about licencing emblems and sponsorship. They will help."
 
Role of Benefactors
 Guzkov remains hopeful that the newest sports entrepreneurs will turn into great benefactors of Russian sports.
"How they use the money is important," he said, of Pro Sports and similar new businesses. "If they put it back into sports, that is good. If they keep it for personal use, that will be very bad."
Like most sports officials from Russia and the 14 other republics now recognized as independent by the international sports community, Guzkov still longs for the old days, before all the hustling.
"It is very difficult to destroy the ties," Guzkov said. "In our minds, we still take the field together."

Through Ups and Downs, Harazin Stays Solid as a Rock

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 15

 BODY:
Al Harazin's favorite piece of personal apparel is a dinosaur lapel pin. The pin, given to him as a gift by the Mets, is meant to symbolize Harazin's status as one of a disappearing breed in baseball, namely that of monolithic executive.
Harazin, the club's general manager, is also its chief operating officer, responsible for everything from contract negotiations to trades to stadium operations to marketing to broadcasting. 
 The dinosaur, one season and 90 losses into his tenure, was asked if he ever worried about sudden extinction.
"Maybe I'm hopelessly naive," said Harazin, "but I don't worry about job security."
 
No Hot Seats Here
 The general manager's chair at Shea Stadium has historically not been a terribly hot one, irrespective of the club's fortunes on the field. Frank Cashen was hired to start the 1980's, was retained through several difficult and dreadful transition seasons, was lauded when the Mets evolved into challengers and then champions midway through the decade, and then he was allowed to effectively retire on his own timetable as the Mets staggered through the early 1990's.
But Harazin, while confident and secure, hardly feels entirely immunized from the abrupt, often arbitrary, consistently uncharacteristic hirings and firings that dot and frequently mar the landscape of sports, both professional and amateur.
"I think the job of general manager in baseball has become more and more like the field managers," he said. "There is too much credit given them and too much blame. Our ownership has to evaluate how comfortable it is with its key executives. I think the track record of our owners is that they have staying power. That said, if there were to be a failure over a sustained period of time, I'm sure they'd be prepared to make changes."
There certainly appears to be no change being actively considered. Harazin met with the club owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, here today for several hours and emerged smiling in the Florida sunshine. The Mets' 1992 season, with its 72-90 record, second straight fifth-place finish, myriad injuries and uproars, had at last removed itself from Harazin's horizons.
 
Finding No Fault
 "One of the owners said in the course of the meeting that for all that went wrong in 1992, he couldn't fault anything we did," Harazin said.
"Al's fine," Doubleday said in a brief interview after the meeting. "He may need to get more of his people in there over time, but the transition from Frank to Al has been smooth. He can do the job."
The job has had its share of upheaval in the 18 months Harazin has had it. To some, he was an aggressive and bold executive when he signed Manager Jeff Torborg while the man was under contract to the White Sox. To some, he was a baseball innocent and accountant gone mad when he signed off on huge checks to Bobby Bonilla, Eddie Murray and John Franco.
 
Trades and Turmoil
 To some, he was a genius for his acquisition of Bret Saberhagen. To some, he was less than brilliant in his quick decision to trade David Cone without creating as lucrative a market as possible for the star pitcher.
And through it all, there was the specter of what all the trades and turmoil and dollars meant in the corporate annual report. Attendance at Shea has shrunk from 3 million in 1988 to 1.8 million in 1992. Harazin, though, noted that the Mets still sold 2.5 million tickets in 1992.
"Have there been real financial implications? Yes," said Harazin. "You lose 90 games and finish fifth against the backdrop of a New York economy that has 13 percent unemployment, and that's a tough formula."
Asked what he considered his greatest accomplishment in his first season as general manager, Harazin said that was too tough a question.
"I'm not sure I'm entitled to say I've had a great accomplishment," he said. "It's been an accomplishment, I think, to have put Bobby Bonilla and Eddie Murray and Bret Saberhagen and Tony Fernandez on the roster. But it's not a genuine accomplishment until there are results. We haven't had those."
 
It All Adds Up
 As he entered his second spring training, Harazin said he has not found his lack of a pure baseball background to be a handicap, and that his training as a lawyer and negotiator has been a plus in an environment when so many considerations other than baseball talent enter into so many personnel decisions.
He said that with his assumption of Cashen's final title last month -- chief operating officer -- he has had to delegate more authority, and to that end he turned over all arbitration cases and all but multiyear contract negotiatons to Gerry Hunsicker, the club's assistant vice president.
"What has appealed to me throughout, and why I wanted the job cast as Frank had it, was the diversity," Harazin said. "I'm not like Joe McIlvaine. I didn't come up on the field. My interests have been broader."
The standard of evaluation, though, remains singular: win. Harazin understands it. And for the moment, he doesn't fear it.

HEADLINE: A Park in Peril

 BODY:
Just over 100 years ago, New York State's Legislature created one of America's outdoor treasures: a six-million-acre patchwork of state forests, timber tracts and private lands called the Adirondack State Park. Now in its centennial year plus one, the park faces threats from developers, from the changing economics of the timber business and from legislators who are not as prescient as their forerunners.
The Adirondacks are nowhere near as stressed as the national parks, which absorbed an astounding 250 million visitors last year. The Adirondacks, though larger than the Everglades, Glacier, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Parks combined, welcomed nine million. Albany does not therefore confront a salvage operation. Elected officials have only to muster the sense to preserve New York's jewel for future generations. 
 There's hope. Gov. Mario Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Sol Weprin propose to strike a balance between preservationists and the park's 130,000 proud and poor permanent residents. The Weprin bill, already approved by the Assembly, offers villages economic aid while increasing zoning protection for shorelines and wilderness.
Unfortunately, compromise is not in the blood of the Republican-controlled Senate, where the majority leader, Ralph Marino, has routinely deferred to his deputy, Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh, on matters involving the park. Mr. Marino's myopic view is that the fate of the Adirondacks is a regional issue best left to local residents and their champion, Mr. Stafford.
That argument ignores not only other New Yorkers whose taxes help the park but also the visitors, who do not come in search of subdivisions or dirty streams. That is what they may someday find unless Mr. Marino gets smarter. Housing construction jumped 50 percent in the last two decades, much of it in undisturbed back country.
Tougher zoning is a first step. Only money can solve another threat: the growing eagerness of timber companies to sell large holdings. Unlike timber interests in the national forests, Adirondack loggers have coexisted happily with backpackers, avoiding flagrant clearcutting while providing local tax revenue.
But New York's logging costs, mainly taxes, are higher than elsewhere. In a gesture reflecting both economic realities and a keen sense of public relations, the International Paper Company recently donated 22,000 acres of forest and white-water rivers to a conservation foundation. Unfortunately, miracles don't happen every day. Champion Paper may soon put 90,000 acres on the block.
Mr. Cuomo's budget thus proposes an environmental trust fund. The fund would offer owners tax incentives to keep their land intact, allow the state to compete with developers and compensate local governments for forgone tax revenues.
The fund earmarks only $10 million for the Adirondacks in the first year. But a little goes a long way up north; $10 million would have bought International Paper's tract with enough left over to bid for Follensby Pond, Ralph Waldo Emerson's picturesque 19th-century retreat and a talisman for preservationists.
Yet Mr. Cuomo's good intentions will mean nothing unless Senate Republicans can be brought to see what their predecessors saw a century ago: that the park is an issue of consequence to all New Yorkers, including generations yet unborn.

HEADLINE: Don't Worry, Be Happy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It amazes me that a panel of 11 experts from the National Research Council, part of a private organization, has announced that "AIDS was concentrated among homosexuals, drug users, the poor and the undereducated, and called them 'socially marginalized groups' with little economic, political, and social power" (news article, Feb. 5). 
 If this is the case, I am interested to hear their explanation of the increase of AIDS cases among women across America. Their belief that AIDS will disappear "because those who continue to be affected by it are socially invisible, beyond sight and attention of the majority population" shows only their ignorance to society as a whole. These unnamed experts go further by stating "the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic has affected many transient changes in the institutions we studied and relatively few changes that we expect to be permanent."
AIDS has affected everybody, and for it to be compared to influenza or the bubonic plague (such as the panel did) is simply asinine. The prevalent attitude that only society's undesirables will suffer from AIDS is precisely what has allowed this epidemic to flourish.

HEADLINE: On Making Good Manners Look Sinister

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read with no small amazement your Feb. 5 front-page article on the letter Robert E. Rubin, President Clinton's top economic adviser, wrote to his Goldman Sachs & Company clients before taking up his post as head of Mr. Clinton's new National Economic Council. My amazement was not that Mr. Rubin wrote such a letter, but that you found it news. 
 When a person leaves one position for another, it is generally considered good manners to write such a letter to clients of his old company with whom he has dealt. About five years ago, I left a large law firm for a multibillion-dollar, publicly held corporation. At that time I wrote a similar letter to all of my clients. I praised my old firm and assured those clients they would continue to be well served by it. I also told each client how much I valued our relationship and urged that we remain in touch. A number of the recipients of that letter were suppliers of my new employer.
Reading your article causes me to realize that someone could have painted that letter as a subtle message that continuing business with my old firm might lead to favorable consideration on multimillion-dollar contracts with my new employer.
For Mr. Rubin not to have written a letter such as this one would have been ungentlemanly and disloyal to a company he spent years helping to build. That he is entering Government service, even at such a high level, does not change the dictates of common courtesy to business associates or obligation to former partners to minimize the disruption of an unanticipated departure.
For men of Mr. Rubin's ability, accomplishments and position to enter Government is no small sacrifice to them, their families and their business partners, to whom they feel a responsibility. Your article shows that in return for a 90 percent pay cut and the interruption of a brilliant career, one can be rewarded on entering public service with a baseless assault on one's integrity.
Such disincentives to public service, particularly when the country needs the best financial and economic talent available, is not in the public interest.

HEADLINE: Politics Complicates Formulas for Aid to Schools

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 15

 BODY:
In 1986, budget talks in the New York State Assembly hit a glitch: according to computer-generated calculations from a school aid formula, New York City would receive more money than legislative leaders had agreed on.
But no new negotiations were needed to solve this problem, just a few strokes of a computer keyboard. By changing a number in the city's equation by .125, a legislative aide made the city appear wealthier. And with that, the city's aid dropped by more than $40 million, aligning itself neatly with the leaders' agreement. 
 The budget was passed, and few in the public, the city schools or even the Legislature itself knew what had happened.
Critics of the state's school aid system often use that recalculation as the perfect example of what is wrong with the way the state apportions aid. They say it illustrates a long-honored but rarely discussed Albany tradition: the use of complex aid formulas to mask political decisions.
This year, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed replacing 15 school aid formulas with one equation that would give significantly more money to poor districts and districts with high costs of living. The state Board of Regents is preparing to issue similar recommendations.
 
Opposition From Both Parties
 But Mr. Cuomo's efforts face a hard core of bipartisan opposition led by lawmakers who say the plan will help the urban and rural poor at the expense of the middle class.
The city is expected to try a different route to change. City officials said that they plan to sue the state, charging that they are not getting their fair share of the money.
The city's suit, which could be filed next month, mirrors a suit filed on behalf of 40 Long Island school districts which charged that the state's system discriminates against poor districts. In the last three years, similar suits in New Jersey, Kentucky, Texas and Kansas have brought major changes to those states' school financing systems.
To many experts, court action offers the best chance for revamping New York's system as well. Three times in the last two decades, state commissions have recommended making the system simpler and more equitable to the poor, and each time those efforts have fizzled in the Legislature.
"Attempting to change formulas is like a Russian novel: it's long, boring and in the end everybody gets killed," said John G. Augenblick, a consultant on school financing issues who is based in Denver.
A comparison of schools in North Shore School District in Nassau County and Community School District 6 in upper Manhattan illustrates the problems behind the school aid debate.
Nestled amid sand-swept streets near the Long Island Sound, North Shore High School offers its students a well-stocked computer lab that stays open after school, class sizes of 20 or fewer students and a 55-page catalogue with courses ranging from Japanese to Contemporary Film to Long Island Studies. Only about 3 percent of its students are poor enough to receive free lunches. Last year, 98 percent of its graduating seniors went to college.
 
Classes in a Locker Room
 The Eleanor Roosevelt Intermediate School in Manhattan's Washington Heights section packs 1,700 students, almost as many as in the entire North Shore district, into a building designed for 1,300. Classes average more than 30 students, a locker room doubles as classroom and the gym is used by five classes at one time. Lunch starts at 10:30 A.M. to insure that every student has time to eat.
More than 90 percent of its students speak no English at home, 86 percent are poor enough to receive free lunches and more than 60 percent are considered "at-risk" students based on low standardized test scores. About half will not graduate from high school or attend college.
Ranked by the state as above average in wealth, North Shore spends $14,000 a year on each student, raised primarily from local taxes. But the district also receives about $1,100 per student in state aid. New York City spends half as much as North Shore on each of its students, but receives just $2,000 more per student in state aid.
 
Closing the Gap
 To critics of the current financing system, the state should do more to close that $7,000 spending gap because New York City lacks the tax base to raise as much revenue as North Shore.
But superintendents from wealthier districts contend that spending differences are inevitable. And while many support giving more aid to poorer districts, they do not want their districts to pay for it.
"The goal of equality is unassailable," said Michael V. McGill, North Shore's superintendent. "What is assailable is that in the process of achieving that goal, you level everybody down."
Faced with that devil's choice, many legislators vehemently oppose changing the school aid system now. But even during the flush 1980's, school aid reform stalled in the Legislature. To understand why is to understand a process that has become known as "policy by printout."
To outsiders, it might seem a triumph of social science over politics: almost 30 formulas built from data about the wealth, size and needs of 718 school districts are run through computers that calculate aid for each.
 
'Working Backward'
 But the reality is quite different. Blending the smoke-filled back room with silicon-chip technology, legislative leaders decide how much money will go to each region, then have their aides tinker with the formulas until computers produce the desired results.
"It's a process of working backward," said Robert Berne, a professor of public administration at New York University and a consultant to the Board of Regents.
Though politics pervades decisions on school aid in most states, experts say that New York -- which spends more than any other state except New Jersey on education -- takes formula tampering to new heights. "In many other states, they have a formula which they may tinker with a little bit, but basically it holds for a few decades," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany. "But in New York, it is up for grabs every year."
Part of the reason is that every legislator has a stake in school aid, unlike many other budget items. Not only is the $8.5 billion school aid package the state's largest expenditure, accounting for about a fourth of the $31.5 billion general-funds budget this year, but every legislator represents at least one school district that receives aid.
And since state aid can determine whether a district raises taxes, buys new books or increases class sizes, its impact is readily noticed by voters, many of whom measure their legislator's effectiveness by the amount of aid their district gets.
 
Tinkering With the Formula
 Some critics contend that the very complexity of the system helps obscure the legislators' machinations, providing an aura of mathematical legitimacy to political decisions. "The trickiness comes in the details," said Jerry Miner, a professor of economics at Syracuse University. "For years, the state has been able to diddle around with this formula because no one else understood it."
And the machinations are legion. In 1974, the main school aid formula -- known as the general operating formula -- was designed to give more money to poor districts. But in the last two decades, more than a dozen new types of aid have been created, many of which insure that affluent districts receive a steady stream of aid outside the main formula.
For instance, the Legislature created aid to help districts, many of them suburban, keep property taxes down. In the mid-1980's, when many suburban districts no longer qualified for that assistance, a new category, Supplemental Support, began to channel them additional money.
 
'Save-Harmless'
 And the Legislature established a fail-safe mechanism that prevented districts from losing money even if the general operating formula said they should. Known as "save-harmless," that mechanism enabled districts on Long Island and in Westchester to receive stable or increasing amounts of aid in the 1980's even as their student populations were shrinking.
"New York State is known for having one of the highest proportions of save-harmless districts," Mr. Augenblick said -- about half. "Any time you have that, it means that the formula, which should be the fair way of dealing with aid, is not being allowed to do its work for political reasons."
Suburban legislators say New York City has also benefited from formula-fiddling. During the 1980's, programs were created for at-risk students, magnet schools and reading programs that have given millions in aid almost exclusively to urban districts.
Mr. Cuomo's aides say that his plan would help remove politics from school aid calculations by eliminating the save-harmless mechanism and 15 of the assistance formulas, ranging from transportation aid to gifted-and-talented programs. His formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of students poor enough to receive free lunches.
 
Aid Reductions
 Among experts, there is much agreement that numerous formula changes have reduced the system's ability to close the gap between rich and poor because they have spread the school aid pot thinner. And while that was less of a problem in the 1980's, when school aid increased every year, it has become a major issue in the 1990's, when aid has been cut by $429 million. This year, Mr. Cuomo has called for another $130 million reduction.
The brunt of those cuts has fallen on more-affluent districts. But poor districts, which depend more heavily on state aid, have been hit as well. After losing $3 million in aid in 1991, Syracuse cut 117 teaching positions and saw the average size of its elementary school classes grow from 23 to 28, said Dr. Henry Williams, the superintendent.
"Rich districts can reach into their pockets to make up the difference; poor districts can't," said Daniel P. Levitt, an attorney for the Long Island plaintiffs.

HEADLINE: 2 Dozen New Taxes Weighed To Pay for Health Care Plans

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The White House said today that it would cost $30 billion to $90 billion a year to carry out President Clinton's campaign promise of guaranteeing health care for all Americans, and Administration officials said they were considering two dozen new taxes as possible sources of revenue.
The taxes being considered are in addition to those the President will propose Wednesday to Congress to stimulate the economy and to help reduce the Federal budget deficit, Administration officials said.
 
Mrs. Clinton Visits Congress
 The White House made the disclosure as Hillary Rodham Clinton, chairwoman of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, visited the House of Representatives to lobby lawmakers of both parties on the issue. 
 Asked whether she and the President wanted to levy higher taxes to finance a national health-care plan, Mrs. Clinton did not answer directly. "There isn't a plan yet, so I'm not going to comment on that," she said. But she quickly added: "It's time this country faced reality and dealt with its problems. It's not going to be easy."
 
Engineering 'Massive Change'
 Confidential work papers from Mrs. Clinton's task force show that the Administration is considering taxes on insurance premiums, corporate health benefits, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and guns, among other sources of revenue for health care.
White House officials emphasized that no decisions had been made. But the work papers show that the new social program that Mrs. Clinton and her aides are contemplating would be bigger than any created in more than 50 years.
"Reforming the health-care system will involve Government-led changes on a scale not attempted since Social Security," one memorandum says. "People are calling for massive change, yet their support for individual plans is very weak."
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, welcomed Mrs. Clinton to Capitol Hill today. But in an interview, he said proposals being considered by her committee looked like "washed-over old-time bureaucratic liberalism, or centralized bureaucratic socialism."
The memorandum from the staff of Mrs. Clinton's task force says the Administration is determined to provide "universal access to affordable high-quality health care for all Americans."
"Depending on definitions and program structure," it says, "universal access could mean $30 billion or $90 billion of additional annual expenditure by the Government by 1997."
In contrast, Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, cost the Federal Government $129 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30; Medicaid, the program for low-income people, cost $68 billion.
 
Businesses to See Savings
 The memorandum says that businesses, not Government, will reap most of the savings generated by cost controls under President Clinton's plan. But it says the Government can "recapture" some of these savings, to pay for expanding access to health care and perhaps also to help reduce the Federal budget deficit.
In the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said Government savings from controlling health-care costs would be used exclusively to expand access to health care, not to reduce the deficit. And Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, repeated that commitment at her confirmation hearings in January.
Among possible sources of revenue for the President's plan, the memorandum lists these possibilities:
*Taxing health insurance premiums.
*Raising a corporate tax to capture part of the savings that corporations realize from slower premium growth.
*Taxing benefit plans that offer coverage above a certain level, to encourage employers and workers to choose health maintenance organizations and other forms of health insurance that offer the best value.
*Increasing taxes on alcohol and tobacco products, pollutants, guns and other things that contribute to health problems.
In addition, a memorandum written in part by Ira C. Magaziner, senior adviser to the President for policy development, and first reported in today's Wall Street Journal says "about 20 other alternatives" are available to raise revenue for the health plan.
In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said American businesses could be more productive and competitive in world markets if their employees' health costs were not rising so fast. Now it appears that businesses may not be allowed to keep all the savings but may have to pay a portion to the Government in new taxes.
Moreover, the memorandum confirms that the President and Mrs. Clinton see an immediate need to impose cost controls on the health-care industry without waiting for Congress to revamp the nation's health system.
The memorandum says the Administration wants to "elicit voluntary controls from the health-care industry." But just in case doctors do not volunteer, the Administration is seeking "ways to extend Medicare rate regulation to private insurance systems."
Medicare imposed a national fee schedule for doctors last year. Leaders of the American Medical Association met today with Mr. Magaziner at the White House to make clear that they did not want the Government to regulate their fees for private patients outside the Medicare program.
In an interview tonight, Dr. Raymond Scalettar, chairman of the association, said, "There are so many flaws in the Medicare fee schedule that it could not possibly be used in the private sector."
The memorandum from Mrs. Clinton's task force confirms that the President still wants to require all employers to arrange health insurance for their workers and "to pay a percentage (perhaps 75 to 80 percent) of the cost of a standard plan for their employees and dependents."
"Hence, most people would continue to have largely employer-financed coverage," the memo says. "The Federal Government would assist small companies in the early years so that this requirement would not cause undue hardship."
 
Drug Makers Respond
 The memorandum seems to assume that drug prices will be controlled. Listing questions to be addressed by the task force, the memorandum asks: "How will drug price increases be controlled? Will this be done nationally? How can we insure that innovation is not stifled?"
Drug company executives tried today to answer criticisms of their industry last week by the President and Mrs. Clinton.
On Friday, President Clinton called vaccine prices "shocking," and said some drug companies were making excessive profits. "In a public clinic," he said, "the cost of fully immunizing a child has leapt from $7 to more than $90" in the last decade.
Dr. R. Gordon Douglas Jr., president of the vaccine division of Merck & Company, said today that "the President's data were highly inaccurate and misleading." Of the $83 increase in vaccine prices, Dr. Douglas said, 80 percent is attributable to Federal excise taxes and the development of new vaccines for hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

HEADLINE: FEW TO PAY MORE IN INCOME TAXES, PRESIDENT INSISTS

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Wary of early negative reaction to his plan to cut the budget deficit and stimulate the economy, President Clinton sought today to assure the public that most middle-income Americans would not be hurt. The White House said income taxes would rise only for families earning more than $180,000 a year.
The White House also said that to protect households earning less than $30,000 a year it would suggest tax breaks to offset a proposed tax on energy and any other new levies in the program he will announce Wednesday night. 
 As new details emerged about the economic plan, and as the stock market tumbled nearly 83 points, Mr. Clinton's aides continued to maintain that families earning more than $100,000 year, about 4.4 percent of the population, would shoulder 70 percent of the burden of new taxes.
 
More Demanded From Many
 But the plan would demand more money from all households earning more than $30,000 a year, if not in income taxes then in other ways. Beyond that, officials said the Administration was also considering two dozen other taxes to be introduced later this year to cover the costs of Mr. Clinton's still unfinished health-insurance program.
White House officials also said tonight that Mr. Clinton would probably propose an additional surcharge on those earning more than $250,000 a year that would raise the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent. Administration officials said such a tax would probably affect only millionaires.
Many details of Mr. Clinton's plan, which he will unveil on Wednesday in a speech before a joint session of Congress, remained ill defined. But on the day after Mr. Clinton's televised appeal for middle-class sacrifice, which he said was unavoidable, the White House scrambled to convince people that Mr. Clinton was not abandoning his pledge to protect the middle class.
 
Explaining a Shift
 During the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would raise taxes only on those earning more than $200,000 a year, but aides said he felt forced to lower that threshold because the deficit was larger than expected.
Republicans, however, immediately accused Mr. Clinton of going back on his promise to protect middle-class Americans and blamed him for the drop in stock prices. "Watch your wallets," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, who denounced Mr. Clinton's program. "Boy, there are a lot of taxes in there."
As the President visited a construction site in Washington and addressed an economics conference in California by satellite, he and his aides dismissed the stock market decline as unrelated to the Monday night speech. They cited the relative stability of the bond markets as evidence that any judgment on the emerging plan is premature.
 
The Market in Perspective
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.94 points today. But since Mr. Clinton was elected, the market has been unusually strong. The closing figure today was still 57.01 points higher than it was the day after the election and 53.5 points higher than it was on Inauguration Day.
The final package of economic plans, said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, would include $100 billion in nonmilitary spending cuts over four years.
Administration officials are predicting that 70 percent of the taxes Mr. Clinton will propose would fall on the upper 4.4 percent income group. Households with incomes under $30,000 -- roughly 50 percent of all Americans -- would not have higher taxes at all, they say.
Mr. Clinton also said that his short-term plan would create 500,000 new jobs through private investment.
 
More Than 'Raw Pain'
 "I think when you see the whole program it, it won't be raw pain," Mr. Clinton said. "I think most middle-class Americans, when you look at the cost plus the benefits, are going to be much, much better off. It's a very progressive program, and a lot of the wealthiest American business leaders I've talked to believe that their businesses will be much better off, with stable, long-term lower interest rates, and the availability to invest and grow."
Administration officials said today that the plan would increase the income-tax rate on families earning more than $180,000 a year and individuals earning more than $140,000 a year to 36 percent.
Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington State, the Speaker of the House, said the important thing about Mr. Clinton's announcement is that he is going to use "tough, realistic, conservative figures.
"There isn't going to be any shading or coloring of the economic statistics," he said after meeting the President.
 
Hard Hat and Jeans
 The President spoke to California business executives today and visited a road-paving site in Northeast Washington as he portrayed the program he will announce to Congress as one to create jobs rather than bleed taxpayers.
"I believe that Congress will be determined to cut the deficit, too, and to restrain spending," said Mr. Clinton, who wore blue jeans, cowboy boots and a hard hat. "I'm going to go to them for the first time in 10 years and practice truth in budgeting."
But Republicans clearly plan to use the President's speech to sharpen their assertions, made since the campaign, that Mr. Clinton is just another tax-and-spend Democrat.
"I intend to fight his tax-and-spend policy every step of the way," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
 
Trudging Through Mud
 Negotiating the muddy site with Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly of Washington and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a nonvoting member of Congress for the District of Columbia, he sipped decaffeinated coffee and talked with a selected group of workers.
"They said that they would pay a little more if we were going to create jobs and reduce the debt," Mr. Clinton said afterward.
A senior White House official said today that the Clinton Administration had decided to use the most pessimistic available projections on how much the economy is likely to grow in the next four years, estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, which are gloomier than the figures of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. In fiscal year 1997, the Congressional Budget Office projects growth of 2.2 percent, as opposed to the 2.5 percent projection by the council and the average of 50 private forecasters.
The deficit in 1997 without any changes in the law would be $346 billion under the assumptions being used. It would be about $40 billion less if the more optimistic forecasts were used.
"We intend to usher in a new era of integrity in dealing with the budget," the official said. "We need to go the extra mile to regain the confidence of the American people."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said today that the President planned to travel outside of Washington at least once a week to promote his plan.

HEADLINE: National Recovery Fattening Tax Revenue in Many States

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Evidence is continuing to build that the nation's economic expansion that took hold in the second half of 1992 is having a positive effect on battered state finances.
Tax collections, not including legislated tax increases, rose nearly 6 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to a survey of state tax officials by the Center for the Study of States, a research concern in Albany. That is the biggest increase since the beginning of the recent recession and five times last year's rise. 
 Income and sales taxes -- each of which contribute about a third of state revenue -- are rising solidly. State income-tax collections are 6.4 percent higher than a year ago, sales tax collections 5.4 percent higher.
"We were seeing a much stronger recovery in the second half of 1992," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI/ McGraw Hill, "and with a large increase in consumer spending, that's showing up in state tax collections."
Tax revenue in the hard-hit Middle Atlantic region and in New England was surprisingly strong, rising about as much as the national average of 5.9 percent. Sales tax revenue, adjusted for changes in tax laws or in administrative procedures, rebounded in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
"It's good news for President Clinton," said Steven D. Gold, the center's director. "If state revenues are getting better, that's a sign that Federal revenues are going to get a little better too, and the improvement in state revenue will help avoid big tax increases."
 
Boon to Clinton?
 This improvement may make President Clinton's request to raise Federal taxes a shade easier politically. Many states that have been in awful budgetary straits may find their prospects improving, and some may be able to avoid further tax increases -- or even make good on promises of tax cuts.
What is more, preliminary results of a survey of legislative budget aides by the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures shows that more than 40 states are now meeting or surpassing the revenue objectives they set for the current fiscal year. A year ago, less than half were doing so.
"As far as revenues go," said Ronald Snell, the organization's budget analyst, "things are in good shape."
While some of the spurt in income tax collections reflects a rush by the rich to act before a Clinton tax increase, the rebound in tax collections confirms other signs of expansion.
Forecasters increasingly rely on state tax data for clues about the direction of the national economy. The group that sets monetary policy, the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board, for example, uses state sales tax receipts to corroborate retail sales reports from the Commerce Department, which are often subject to huge month-to-month revisions.
 
Sharp Turnabout Seen
 If the state-tax improvement continues, the fiscal picture in many state capitals would brighten considerably.
"The states have been in terrible fiscal condition, running record deficits," Mr. Wyss said. "The healthier tax revenue should permit them to avoid big tax hikes or big further spending cuts in the coming year. In Massachusetts, there's a possibility we could actually end up with tax cut this year if the Governor can keep the Legislature from spending it first."
David Bowers, a public finance expert at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, added, "Construction surveys last fall were already showing substantial increases in planned spending on highways, roads and bridges for 1993."
Nonetheless, the economists warned, the state governments are hardly out of the woods. The revenue recovery remains highly uneven across various regions of the country. According to the Center for the Study of States, revenue rose about 8 percent in the Southwest and the Southeast where, other economic indicators show, growth has been the most buoyant. The West, weighed down by the struggling California economy, had the smallest increase, 3.2 percent.
 
Jigsaw of Economies
 There are big differences within regions. New Hampshire's economy appears to have bottomed out in 1991, while Connecticut is still suffering from big military and insurance-company layoffs. New Jersey is in a double revenue bind: not only is its economy weak, but it cut its sales tax last year.
The second major reason that states' fiscal problems are not over is the level of spending. "Revenues are only half the picture," Mr. Snell said. "Despite faster than expected revenue growth, there are still very serious budget issues."
The three money gobblers in state budgets, economists say, are education, health and prisons. During the fiscal crisis of the last two or three years, many states have postponed spending on education that has become more and more urgent because of the arrival of a second baby boom. And promises for salary increases and construction are coming due.
Similarly, states have put off prison construction for the last two or three years, something they cannot do much longer before the courts force action on overcrowding.
 
No Straight Line to Prosperity
 Medicaid outlays are being driven up by rising caseloads and steep medical inflation.
Finally, the national recovery has stalled a couple of times before and could do so again. And the expansion may continue to be slower than usual.
"In a typical recovery," said Bill Hall, director of the Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission, "the year after the bottom you see growth of 5 percent. The comeback from this recession is much much more modest, and we have been projecting very modest growth.
"There just aren't a lot of new jobs being generated," Mr. Hall added. "Some Illinois companies are still laying off a few thousand workers. We figure those people won't be buying a lot of TV sets."

HEADLINE: Interior Secretary Is Pushing A New Way to Save Species

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
To head off conflict over endangered species, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is preparing a major policy shift in the Interior Department's focus on wildlife protection.
He hopes to avert what he calls "national train wrecks" in disputes like the one over the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest by avoiding having to impose emergency measures to protect suddenly endangered species. Instead, he seeks a policy based on preventive measures to insure long-term protection of whole ecosystems and all their inhabitants. 
 "We need to step back and look at the entire ecosystem and ask, 'Is it possible to intervene before the crisis?' " Mr. Babbitt testified yesterday before the House Natural Resources Committee in Washington.
 
Negotiated Settlements
 In an interview last week, he declared his intention to try to devise plans that would stop the decline of species before it became necessary to list them as threatened or endangered. This, he said, might avoid "the downward spiral of listing, and then the long, contentious legal process that is triggered when the Endangered Species Act takes hold."
The theory of such an approach, which has been backed by conservation groups, is that both conservation and business can be better served by negotiated settlements that plan the future of an entire ecosystem before any individual species are endangered.
There is more leeway for compromise under this view than when an area is severely degraded and options for protecting threatened species shrink.
Similar approaches have been tried with reasonable success. In one, the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group, has brokered a plan in the hill country outside Austin, Tex., to protect ecologically healthy areas while allowing development to proceed around them.
 
Ecology vs. Economy
 Some destruction of habitat by developers is to be allowed, with the most important areas reserved for wildlife. In some cases, developers' land is purchased in a swap agreement that lets them build elsewhere in the county. The larger strategy is to accommodate both the ecology and the economy of the entire region.
Mr. Babbitt told Congress, however, that it ought to be possible to devise conservation plans that mainly affect public lands rather than private ones.
If ecosystems are to be the focus of Federal conservation policy, Mr. Babbitt said, a national scientific assessment of ecosystem health -- a map, as it were, of the nation's biological diversity -- is required to spot problems before they get out of hand.
As things stand now, the Secretary added, ecosystem studies are split between several Interior Department agencies.
Mr. Babbitt said he was considering the establishment of a National Biological Survey to map species and ecosystems with the same scientific accuracy as the United States Geological Survey charts the country's geology.
In any case, he said in the interview, "everyone agrees we're going to need to revisit the concepts of the Endangered Species Act" and determine "if we can't find some way to look at ecosystems on a multispecies basis and ask how it is we can take reasonable steps" to "deal with the economic tradeoffs" before a crisis erupts.
 
'Anticipating the Problem'
 To avoid contention and lawsuits resulting from "repeated eleventh-hour listings" of species as endangered, Mr. Babbitt told the House panel yesterday, "we're going to have to manage the Endangered Species Act pro-actively, by anticipating the problem while we still have the flexibility to manage the problem."
He said in the interview that he believed this approach would uncover "a lot of unexplored possibilities" for conserving species while avoiding "economic collisions." If so, he added, it might be possible to avert what he called a series of "national train wrecks," like the conflict between loggers and environmentalists over preservation of the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest.
Many conservationists consider the Endangered Species Act, which is up for reauthorization this year, to be the nation's single most powerful tool for preserving species. But many also say that despite the act, ecosystems have continued to decline and species are still becoming endangered.
Opponents of the act charge that too often economic interests and property rights are threatened when protection measures are taken on behalf of an endangered species on a crash basis.
 
Nature Conservancy Plan
 Although the act is up for reauthorization, Congress can simply extend it, as it has done with numerous laws. Mr. Babbitt said there was "a division of opinion" as to whether legislation reauthorizing the act should be undertaken this year or next.
He said he saw a "lot of merit" in a proposal by the Nature Conservancy that a national commission, sponsored by private foundations, examine the question and recommend what to do about the law by the end of this year.
The Bush Administration, in its closing weeks, settled a lawsuit with environmentalists by agreeing to add 400 more species, mainly plants, to its protected list in the next four years. This, coupled with the example of the spotted owl controversy and the requirement to declare still other species endangered, has imparted urgency to the reassessment of conservation policy.
"My most urgent task in my first month around here has been to try to assess how we're going to handle the generic issue of biodiversity," Mr. Babbitt said in the interview, "because we're not equipped to do it."

HEADLINE: Voters Skeptical on Clinton Plan, Lawmakers Say

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
On the eve of President Clinton's economic address to Congress, lawmakers returning to the Capitol reported today that many of their constituents were voicing skepticism and fear about what the President had in mind for them.
While polls indicate that the public is open to Mr. Clinton's economic ideas, many lawmakers who toured their states during a weeklong recess concluded that his support might be thin and tentative. 
 Reactions varied from region to region when it came to the details of the Administration's expected proposals for new energy taxes or cuts in entitlements. But lawmakers said voters almost universally worried that the White House and Congress were asking for sacrifice but were not really serious about deficit reduction.
"People are ready to sacrifice," said Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who strongly supports Mr. Clinton. "But the leading concern is that the money saved from spending cuts won't be used for new spending."
 
'They Don't Believe Anybody'
 Senator Dennis DeConcini, a conservative-leaning Democrat from Arizona who is a swing vote on economic policy, said he came away from a tour of his state concluding: "A big majority is prepared to accept sacrifice if they are really satisfied it's going to deficit reduction. But they don't believe anybody -- not me, not the President -- that it will go to deficit reduction."
The lawmakers noted that the constituents who called them or attended their town meetings were not necessarily representative of public opinion. But as the avalanche of calls that buried Zoe Baird's nomination as Attorney General demonstrated, the most highly motivated voters can make an impact on Capitol Hill.
Mr. DeConcini, for example, said he took directly to Mr. Clinton an idea that had strong support in his town meetings: setting up a national trust for tax payments that would be earmarked for deficit reduction. Mr. DeConcini said that Mr. Clinton did not immediately respond to his suggestion but that the President would have to eventually "if you want this Senator to vote for tax increases."
Congressional Democrats say it is too soon to assess how strong opposition will be against a program whose details are still not fully known. But Republicans say they are already working to limit tax increases and expand budget cuts, and they complain that Mr. Clinton did not consult with them as he had promised.
 
Republicans Find Skepticism
 The intensity of the reaction to Mr. Clinton's economic plans varied widely around the country. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, said her office was flooded today with telephone calls from retirees fearful that their Social Security payments would be cut or taxed more heavily.
Representative Michael N. Castle, Republican of Delaware, said that he appeared on three radio talk shows last week and that the overwhelming reaction was "scornful about the President's reversal" on the middle-income tax cut he proposed during the campaign. And today, Mr. Castle said, his office had received 65 telephone calls responding to President Clinton's televised address on Monday night, with 62 of them expressing criticism.
"The general conclusion," Mr. Castle said, "is that you will get the Clinton tax increases and Congress will brush a lot of the spending cuts under the rug."
Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, described the mood in his state as "bitter" because "the taxes, environmental restraints and attacks on oil and mining and lumber all affect us."
 
Democrats Find Support
 In contrast, Representative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, said he observed a reservoir of support for Mr. Clinton in his district in south Chicago. "Most of the people in the district are poised to accept a fair tax increase if it is geared toward stimulating the economy," he said.
Other Democratic lawmakers, like Senators J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, reported that their constituents were generally withholding opinion about Mr. Clinton's plans until the address on Wednesday.
"I got a wait and see," Mr. Lieberman said. "But what I did find was that a lot of the media skepticism was not reflected in the public."
Senator Jim Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, suggested that Mr. Clinton had hurt himself in his Monday night speech by focusing on raising taxes rather than on cutting spending. Noting that telephone calls to his office today were running 80 to 20 in criticism of the speech, Mr. Exon added: "I hope he'll do a better job tomorrow night. He's got a tough sell."

HEADLINE: Charting a Course at the Pentagon, Aspin Uses His Congressional Map

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
You can take Les Aspin out of the Congress, but you apparently cannot take the Congress out of Les Aspin.
In his first three weeks as Defense Secretary, the former 11-term Representative from Wisconsin has drawn on his Congressional past. He has imported a dozen House staff members as top aides, ordered an overhaul of the department's foreign and domestic policy arms to focus on specific issues the way Congressional subcommittees do, and increased Pentagon planners' sensitivity to budget cuts that Congress might oppose. 
 Mr. Aspin wielded tight control over the House Armed Services Committee by using his command of military issues and rewarding loyal colleagues with projects in their districts. But he is now struggling to exert the same kind of influence over the sprawling Defense Department and its many competing fiefs.
In his handling of the Clinton Administration's pledge to allow homosexuals in the military, Mr. Aspin made confusing and contradictory comments on a national news program three weeks ago. Since then, he seems to have found his sea legs, impressing European ministers in meetings in Munich about the crisis in the Balkans and rushing to meet a tight deadline to produce a smaller Pentagon budget for next year.
 
Changes Big and Subtle
 "He's had a lot of things hit him all at once that'll take time to sort out," said Marvin Leath, a former Texas Congressman who is now a Washington lobbyist for several military contractors.
Transitions are always rocky for incoming administrations, even for one as familiar with the Pentagon as the Aspin team. Dozens of senior Defense Department posts remain vacant pending White House approval.
Associates say Mr. Aspin, a workaholic even by Washington standards, is dealing well with these inconveniences, just as he is with the change from Congress's rhythm of legislative marathons followed by recess to the Pentagon's calendar of perpetual crisis. Friends say a subtler switch for Mr. Aspin, a 54-year-old former economics professor, is adjusting from being a big man in Congress courted for his ideas and opinions to being a Cabinet team member, though a very influential one, carrying out President Clinton's orders.
"It's a striking difference," said Representative Norman Sisisky, a Virginia Democrat who was a longtime colleague of Mr. Aspin on the Armed Services Committee. "Suddenly he has to follow the President's policy. He's not running his own committee anymore, where he could follow the President's policy or not."
Nothing illustrates this better than Mr. Aspin's handling of the issue of homosexuals in the military. Associates said Mr. Aspin was eager to begin reorganizing the Pentagon bureaucracy and start moving on other issues he had given a lot of thought to while in Congress.
In his first week, though, Mr. Aspin found himself sparring with Gen. Colin L. Powell and the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff over Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to allow homosexuals in the armed forces. Until a confirmation hearing on Jan. 7, Mr. Aspin had spoken barely a word on the issue, and confidants say he has little interest in the matter.
"Aspin really has never been known to dwell on personnel issues and was probably aggravated he had to spend so much time on the gays issue," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who also served on the Armed Services Committee. "He'd much rather focus on global strategy."
Appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" on Jan. 24, Mr. Aspin was put in the embarrassing position of explaining an internal strategy memorandum by his staff that advised Mr. Clinton to consult with the Joint Chiefs and Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia. That was sound advice, Pentagon and Congressional officials said, but a written tactics paper smacked too much of a wily committee chairman plotting a legislative coup.
The memorandum hit a particular nerve with Mr. Nunn, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee and supports the ban. Apparently offended that the Administration had not paid him proper deference, Senator Nunn threatened to challenge Mr. Clinton on the issue, putting a much sharper edge on his normally friendly rivalry with Mr. Aspin.
The Defense Secretary only seemed to make matters worse with his statements on the CBS program. Asked if the Administration could succeed in lifting the ban, Mr. Aspin said, "We're going to try and make this thing happen." A few minutes later, though, he said, "If we can't work it out, we will disagree and the thing won't happen."
Asked if Mr. Clinton would ask Congress to change the military code's ban on sodomy, Mr. Aspin said, "The answer is yes." Pressed further on that point, Mr. Aspin said, "No, not in this context necessarily."
Military officials said they took the confusion as a cue to intensify their public opposition to allowing homosexuals to serve in the armed services. Many senior officers said they had interpreted Mr. Aspin's comments to reflect the uncertainty they also felt.
"I'm impressed with Aspin," said one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He's trying his darn edest to work the President's problem under impossible conditions."
 
'Thinking Out Loud'
 Mr. Aspin declined to be interviewed for this article, but he told reporters traveling with him to Munich earlier this month that any reports of strains between the Administration and the Joint Chiefs were exaggerated.
Associates of Mr. Aspin say the kind of unfiltered dialogue weighing possible courses of action on the CBS program was vintage Aspin.
"Aspin's hallmark is to arrive at decisions by thinking out loud," said Sean C. O'Keefe, the Bush Administration's Navy Secretary and the Pentagon's former comptroller. "If you stay with him to the end, he's usually got something important to say."
Those who know Mr. Aspin well say that disciplining his flood of ideas would hamper his creative style. Affable and outgoing, Mr. Aspin relishes a spirited debate, even with reporters.
"You've got to let Aspin be Aspin," said Senator John W. Warner, a Virginia Republican on the Armed Services Committee who has known Mr. Aspin for years. "You're not going to change him."
 
No Uniformed Sentries
 Senator Nunn plans to hold hearings on homosexual issue in March or April, and Mr. Aspin has moved to more pressing matters until then. He has ordered that the Pentagon's policy branches be realigned to address human rights, arms proliferation and the conversion of military industries.
In a symbolic gesture reflecting his rumpled, casual manner, Mr. Aspin ended the practice of uniformed sentries' standing guard outside the Defense Secretary's Pentagon office, saying the decade-old tradition was unnecessary.
In Munich, for an international security conference, Mr. Aspin met privately with ministers from Britain, France, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands in what one aide described as a "big-time NATO schmooze session."
"He'll be a man of big reforms," Leo Delcroix, Belgium's Defense Minister, said in an interview.
The big change he is working on now is the Pentagon's budget. Mr. Aspin directed the armed services last week to submit nearly $11 billion more in cuts on top of the $3 billion Mr. Bush had already proposed for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. Those reductions will be offset somewhat by programs that Mr. Aspin wants to add.
 
Approach Is Criticized
 Critics, including Congressional aides and former Bush Administration officials, say that Mr. Aspin has reneged on a promise to conduct a comprehensive review of Pentagon spending for the 1994 fiscal year and that he is using the same top-down approach that he criticized the Bush Administration for last year.
"If we reduce our forces from the top down, by simple subtraction, we will get a smaller defense budget and smaller forces, but the chances are good that neither the budget nor the forces will be the right ones," Mr. Aspin said on Jan. 24, 1992.
Defense Department aides say they had no other choice given the Feb. 25 deadline to submit a Pentagon budget to the White House. They promise a thorough review this summer for the 1995-99 period.
What is left in and what is dropped from next year's budget will probably reflect Mr. Aspin's Congressional experience. The Navy, for example, will probably receive more money for ballistic-missile defenses because it is a sure winner with lawmakers.
"They're very sensitive to how things will play on Capitol Hill," said one veteran Pentagon planner. "They know what's sellable and what's not."

HEADLINE: President's New Pitch: Redefining Patriotism as a Banner for Peace, Not War

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In telling Americans that it is their patriotic duty to support his economic program, President Clinton is trying to redefine "patriotism" from pulling together to face a mortal threat abroad to paying higher taxes to face an economic threat at home.
This is both a high-risk political strategy and an experiment in the politics of mobilizing mass opinion in the wake of the cold war. The biggest risk is that Mr. Clinton will discover what Jimmy Carter did when he declared that his energy conservation plan was "the moral equivalent of war" -- that most Americans found the notion so overstated that they scoffed at it, undermining his whole initiative. 
 While many Americans can understand an appeal to bipartisan support for an economic plan, they may balk at the notion that it is their patriotic duty to pay higher taxes.
"Patriotism and economics form strange bedfellows," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, "One can make a national interest case for sacrifice, one can make a common sense case for sacrifice, but patriotism is when you risk your life, not when you risk your wallet."
 
New Political Vocabulary
 Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton's use of patriotism in his Monday night address to the nation is an experiment. It is based on the assumption that with the end of the cold war, and with the absence of any overriding external threat, the nation's patriotic fervor can be stoked up to confront an enemy that is depicted by bar charts and line graphs, not as the Red menace or Nazi youth. The deficit, health-care reform or low-wage jobs are concerns of every American, but how many people would kill for them?
In a way, Mr. Clinton is introducing a whole new post-cold-war political vocabulary, Mr. Leach said. The President is saying that the Government gets involved abroad, in places like Somalia or the Balkans, out of "compassion" and raises taxes at home out of "patriotism."
Another danger in appealing to patriotism in support of his budget is that Mr. Clinton could be courting more division than solidarity. Those who will not support his program on economic or philosophical grounds will not take kindly to being labeled as being against God, country and apple pie.
"I, like others, was uncomfortable with the use of the word patriotism," said Thomas Mann, a Congressional expert at the Brookings Institution, a research organization. "Patriotism is a word that can be used and misused too easily. It carries more baggage than Clinton would like. If you disagree with him, are you unpatriotic? I don't think he wants to be in a position where those who oppose his program might be accused of being unpatriotic, but that is a risk he is running."
 
A Vietnam Comparison
 If the debate really sharpens, it might be particularly ticklish for Mr. Clinton, who in the Presidential campaign defended his opposition to the Vietnam War as the product of his own interpretation of patriotism.
When Mr. Carter used the language of war to get Americans to accept a program of stringent conservation, higher energy prices and penalties for waste, his plan died three steps out of the starting gate.
"The big difference between now and 1977," said Jody Powell, who was President Carter's spokesman, "is that when we used the moral equivalent of war only about three people in the country believed that energy was such a big problem. A lot of smart-mouthed Washington pundits dismissed it, until oil prices started quadrupling.
"Hopefully, Clinton won't have to wait so long for vindication. I think what he has going for him is that most Americans believe that we have a big problem with the economy, that we need to pull together."
As Mr. Clinton put it in his address on Monday: "If you will join with me, we can create an economy in which all Americans work hard and prosper. This is nothing less than a call to arms to restore the vitality of the American dream. When I was a boy, we had a name for the belief that we should all pull together to build a better, stronger nation. We called it patriotism. And we still do."
Even though Mr. Clinton did not run a campaign based on the notion of sacrifice by the middle class, Mr. Powell argued, his message of sacrifice is "not a big surprise to people."
That is certainly the bet that Mr. Clinton is making, his aides say. He is betting that Americans are worried enough about their children being worse off than they are and Social Security not being there when they need it that they will be ready to contribute the same sweat and tears, if not blood, they would for a military crusade.
Mr. Clinton's personal poll taker, Stan Greenberg, said that also underlying Mr. Clinton's use of patriotism is the President's conviction that most Americans look back on the 1980's as a period of frustration over the lack of priority given to American domestic affairs and interests.
"The notion that we are all in this together was lost as people sought their separate fortunes," Mr. Greenberg said.
"What the President was trying to do last night was an attempt to recreate an ethic where people begin to feel responsible again for their own country," he added. "I think the public thinks the country is in crisis and that people have failed to pitch in and they are waiting to be called to duty."
But this is a very different conscription notice from the one to which people are most accustomed, or even from the one that Mr. Clinton prepared them for in the campaign. It is asking an indulgent consumer society to do what is the hardest thing possible: sacrifice now for deferred gratification. The question is how many will answer Mr. Clinton's patriotic call, and how many will dodge his draft?

A.T.& T. to Take a Charge Of $7 Billion for New Rules

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
A.T.& T. said yesterday that its charge against earnings for new accounting rules for retiree health benefits would total about $7 billion in the current quarter. In December 1991, A.T.& T. had said the after-tax charge could range from $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion.
While virtually insuring a large paper loss for the full 1993 year, the charge does not hurt cash flow or dividends for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, whose stock is owned by more people than that of any other American company. 
 As previously reported, A.T.& T. had said its 1993 earnings would rise by $500 million because of another new rule that covers deferred tax liabilities. A.T.& T. had overestimated its likely tax bill. A.T.& T.'s net income last year was $3.8 billion, or $2.86 a share.
 
 
New Rules Require Charge
 As with other large corporations, A.T.& T. is required to conform to new rules covering its liability for current and future health care and other benefits for retired employees. Under the new rules, known as Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 106, A.T.& T. does not have to set aside new money, but must report the sum as a charge against earnings.
The charge is like requiring a family to estimate all of its children's future college costs and then report them on a financial statement.
The change in accounting rules, adopted in 1990, requires companies to report the likely financial effect of retiree health benefits, which have grown rapidly in the last decade. The companies must move away from a pay-as-you-go approach for figuring out health costs to one that more accurately reflects costs for employees now and in the future.
Under the new rules, for example, if a 25-year-old A.T.& T. employee earned $100 in retirement benefits today, that amount, allowing for inflation and other factors, must be reported in current financial statements even though the employee is decades away from retirement or may even leave the company. Under the old rules, the $100 of benefits would be accounted for only when the money was actually paid.
A.T.& T. had 141,000 retirees and 312,700 employees in December 1992.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Plan Leaves Gloom at Goldman

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
At age 54, Robert E. Rubin, who in December resigned as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company to become President Clinton's economic czar, may be too young to remember Kate Smith's late 1940's hit song "Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone."
But yesterday he might have appreciated the sentiment. 
 The details of President Clinton's economic program will not be disclosed until tonight, but the package of tax increases and spending cuts that Mr. Rubin helped to formulate not only got a dismal initial reception from the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted by 82.94 points, but also drew a chorus of boos from at least two of his erstwhile colleagues.
In a gloomy two-page memo to Goldman's clients, Steven G. Einhorn, one of Mr. Rubin's former partners, and Abby Joseph Cohen said that the economic package would have a distinctly negative impact on the stock market, and that Goldman was accordingly reducing its exposure to equities by 15 percentage points in its "model" portfolios.
 
Recommends Buying Bonds
 Goldman recommended that money coming out of the stock market be redirected into bonds.
The strategists listed five reasons for the asset shift. First among them is the Administration's fiscal package, one that Mr. Einhorn and Ms. Cohen describe as having "a less favorable tax increase/spending reduction mix than originally proposed."
"This change in mix is disappointing for two reasons," the memo said. "First, it suggests that Mr. Clinton has not fully confronted the politically more difficult issue of spending cuts. Second, there is the risk that Congress further dilutes the mix by postponing spending cuts but not the tax increases."
The authors also bemoan an attitude toward the health-care industry that is not only "bothersome," but reflects an "us versus them" mentality.
"If public vilification of the corporate sector is to be part and parcel of this Administration's policy," the memo said, "the implication for shares is not good."
Mr. Einhorn did not return phone calls, and Ms. Cohen was on vacation yesterday.
A telephone call to Mr. Rubin's office at the White House seeking comment about his old firm's analysis was also not returned.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Promises Aid for Small Businesses

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Easing fines on grocery stores, publishing reference guides that decipher city regulations and introducing courses to teach city employees to be courteous were among the newest initiatives to ease the plight of small businesses that the Dinkins administration unveiled yesterday.
They received mixed reviews from business owners who noted that the city has a long history of mayoral promises to small businesses that never amounted to much. Still, several owners said this was the most comprehensive effort they could remember and hoped the outcome would be different this time. 
 The measures were the latest to come from an 18-agency task force headed by Wallace L. Ford 2d, Commissioner of the Department of Business Services.
Mayor David N. Dinkins created the task force in October 1991, a move some small business owners saw as a reaction to their intense criticism of the Mayor for what they perceived to be his indifference to their woes in the recession. The owners also gained an important ally when Barry F. Sullivan, a former banker, was appointed Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development last May.
Yesterday's report included some initiatives revealed in the Mayor's State of the City speech in early January and even earlier. These included proposed legislation to exempt some 28,000 small businesses from the city's commercial rent tax; plans for $2.5 million in grants to establish children's day-care centers; a 46,000 reduction in the number of summonses for minor sanitation violations, and some city loan programs.
 
Further Steps Indicated
 At a meeting at City Hall yesterday between city officials and business owners and organizations, Mayor Dinkins noted that his administration was also taking steps, including the appointment of ombudsmen at several agencies, to make it easier for small businesses to navigate the city's labyrinthine bureaucracy and regulations and to land city contracts.
"We need to do more to get Government off the backs of small businesses," he said, indicating that more measures were sure to come. Mr. Dinkins, like the other likely contenders in this fall's mayoral election, is wooing the small-business vote.
Some business owners and groups called the actions a welcome step.
"Over all it is good," said Abraham Mammen, owner of two Indian restaurants in Jackson Heights, Queens. "We had thought the Dinkins administration was anti-business."
 
The Height of Pickle Buckets
 He said he was particularly cheered by the establishment of a board of owners of ethnic food businesses to work with the Department of Health on changing the regulations and procedures so that owners have more flexibility in the way they prepare food.
Citing an example of a restriction he thought absurd, Mr. Mammen said the health department recently issued him a summons for the height of the bucket in which he aged lemon pickles. Department inspectors wanted them aged in a pan, he said.
Other members of the small business community said the initiatives did not go nearly far enough. Some called for big cuts in taxes and permit fees and for the creation of an arbitration system that would limit the ability of landlords to raise rents.
"What the task force produced is a good beginning, but much more needs to be done," said Stanley Schair, a partner of a small Manhattan law firm who chairs the Small Business Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
He was skeptical that individual agencies would ease up in fining small businesses. "It's against the laws of nature for an agency to reduce its importance and its budget by collecting less fines," he said.
 
Warning Instead of Fines
 Small-business owners and groups were disappointed that the Dinkins administration has not yet formulated a program for cracking down on unlicensed street vendors. Mr. Ford promised "a more complete announcement" on the issue within 30 to 60 days.
One new program announced yesterday was low-interest loans of up to $50,000 to enable small businesses to become more energy-efficient. Another was a pledge by the Department of Consumer Affairs to issue warnings rather than fines to grocery stores that commit minor infractions, like failing to post conspicuously their licenses or selling items that lack unit pricing and fresh dating labels.
Barbara G. Berger, co-owner of Food City Supermarkets, thought the change was long overdue. She told of an inspection at a recently renovated store at 94th Street and Columbus Avenue in Manhattan in which, after three hours, Consumer Affairs inspectors found six items without unit price tags. Her store was fined $750.
"I'm optimistic," she said of the initiatives, "because it's the first time I've ever seen the city trying."

HEADLINE: Clinton Makes Lobbyists a Target In Opening Battle Over Tax Rise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton has landed a street-fighter's punch in his opening battle to push tax increases and budget cuts through Congress: He charged that his opponents "have already lined the corridors of power with high-priced lobbyists."
"Special interests," he called his foes in his televised speech on Monday night. "Defenders of decline," he labeled their hired lobbying guns. 
 "Ludicrous," responded Tom C. Korologos, a high-priced lobbyist. Mr. Korologos, who is as much a legislative fixture as the spittoons on the Senate floor, was the only defender of decline visible outside the Senate today, even as scores of big-name Democrats huddled nearby to hash over Mr. Clinton's televised remarks on the economy.
Officials of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, where the President's tax proposals will first be scrutinized, reported that the corridors of power outside their offices were similarly vacant.
 
First-Degree Hyperbole
 To Mr. Korologos, this proves that Mr. Clinton is guilty of first-degree hyperbole, raising straw men with abandon in an effort to convince the people that tax increases are in their interest. "If you've got a tax increase to sell, blame it on the special interests," Mr. Korologos said.
Many Democrats said they agreed with Mr. Korologos. They also said the President was wise to do just that.
"It's a brilliant tactic," said Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, "because the public perception is that the corridors of Washington are lined with special interests and high-powered lobbyists. And the public believes that's one of the reasons nothing gets done around here."
A Senate aide who is in the thick of the tax debate said: "Nobody is lobbying now, but there will be opposition. And if Clinton can characterize it as illegitimate before it appears -- even if a great deal of it may turn out to be legitimate -- then it's worth trying."
 
Calm Before the Storm
 In fact, lawmakers and their aides liken the present lack of favor-seeking and logrolling to the gentle rustle of leaves that precedes a summer thunderstorm. Some lobbyists have called their nominal allies in Congress.
"A few of the interests are calling, wanting to know what I know," said Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, a coal-state Democrat who is the Senate's majority whip. "They're worried about a carbon tax on coal."
Mr. Ford grinned the crinkly grin of a man in the know. "I've been able to tell them there won't be a carbon tax," he said.
Lacking any legislation to lobby for or against, one lobbyist said, many in the business are focusing for now on the White House, working an unfamiliar corps of Democratic policy makers in an effort to shape Mr. Clinton's program even before it becomes public.
"A lot of it right now is letter-writing," said another lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Letters are being written against an energy tax, some of which I've signed. Letters are being written arguing that you can't raise $40 billion more by taxing foreign corporations."
 
Recalling a Lobbying Frenzy Recalled
 On Capitol Hill, interest groups are so far engaging in what one Ways and Means Committee aide called "plotting," although, he added, "I'm not sure how I'd plot this time around."
"If you're too aggressive in trying to protect yourself, you could wind up isolated and even looking like a heel," said the aide, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Indeed, that is what happened in the last big lobbying frenzy, in 1986, when the Reagan Administration steered a major overhaul of the tax laws through Congress. At that time, after the House Ways and Means Committee approved an amendment that helped the banking industry, banking lobbyists celebrated so effusively in the Capitol's hallways that the embarrassed and angry lawmakers reversed themselves.
The House Ways and Means aide argued today that Mr. Clinton had placed lobbyists on the defensive and that he had "given the members tremendous cover by telling the public what these guys are doing."
Mr. Korologos rejected that as he stood outside the Democrats' meeting this afternoon. "White Houses always try to do this," he said.
Then, spotting a Senator, he pardoned himself, saying, "I've got some work to do, guys."

HEADLINE: Pretzels, Soda, and No Hint of a 'Meat Market'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
In the 13 years that Ronald S. Pavluvcik has been a member of the Westport Unitarian Singles Group, he figures he has dated more than 100 women.
The last time Helen Burns was out on a date was 25 years ago with her former husband, when she was 19. 
 Mr. Pavluvcik and Ms. Burns were among almost 200 people at a recent gathering of the singles group that, with more than 2,000 members and hundreds more who attend regularly, claims to be the largest of its kind in the nation.
 
Seeking Someone Special
 Both Mr. Pavluvcik and Ms. Burns began the evening with hopes of meeting someone special.
"When I meet a woman now and she asks me how long I've been coming, I joke that I'm not exactly a success story," said Mr. Pavluvcik, 45, a computer consultant from Stratford. "But that depends on how you define success. After all, I have had two long-term, serious relationships with women I met here, and I've made a lot of great friends. I'm a very contented single person and I don't have to be married to be happy."
Nearby, Ms. Burns, of Milford, talked to two other women and scanned the church lobby for desirable men.
"We haven't met the man of our dreams yet," Ms. Burns said. "But we're working on it."
 
'Frightening to be Single'
 Ms. Burns, 44, a secretary, said that after raising two sons and a daughter, she never expected to be dating again. A divorce last summer changed everything.
"It's very, very frightening to be single after 25 years of marriage, and especially these days," she said. "This is all so new to me. But I would rather come here than go to a bar. At least here, people aren't getting drunk, and it's not as much of a meat market."
That is important for many members who say that, in the age of AIDS, they're not interested in the casual sex of bar encounters.
 
Since AIDS, More Restraint
 "There is definitely a more restrained and less outgoing attitude now among members because of AIDS and the demands on people's time," said Gordon B. Thomas, 66, a former president of the group. "Because of the economy, many members are working more than one job and a lot more hours, and they just don't have time to devote as much energy to singles activities."
However, Mr. Thomas said, between 10 and 15 newcomers, ranging in age from 25 to 85, arrive at each function. More than 100 couples have married after meeting through the group, he said.
Not that everything always goes smoothly. Stephanie Simpson, 40, a registered nurse from New Zealand, recalled that after attending one of the group's functions for the first time five years ago, she left in tears.
"I made the same mistake that a lot of people make when they first come," she said. "I had unrealistic expectations and thought I was going to meet Mr. Right the very first night. The best advice I can give to people is to keep going and just try to make friends but not give up, because while we have a core group that are there every week, there are also many different people every time."
 
From Sex to Coping
 On this particular Wednesday, members and guests were mingling and waiting for the start of a special "healing hearts" lecture and workshop intended to help them cope with being alone, or for one of the regular weekly discussion groups.
Debera Johnson, an artist from Wilton now single after 12 years of marriage, opted for a discussion where the topics ranged from sex to coping with the realities of relationships.
"This is only my second time here, but I like it," she said. "I really don't know what the dating rules are now and it's awkward. And I still haven't figured out how to meet someone I notice across the room who I want to talk to. But it's comfortable being here with a lot of people who are in the exact same situation."
 
Dozens of Activities
 The search for an alternative to the bar scene prompted 29 members of the Unitarian church to establish the singles group 18 years ago. Initially, it was open only to members of the church and activities consisted of discussions and occasional parties. But a few years later, the group opened to the public and began growing rapidly, boasting more than 4,000 members by 1983.
The original one-page monthly calendar has developed into a 20-page publication that lists dozens of clubs and activities, from regular weekly discussion groups to dances, camp-outs, ski trips, hikes and lectures.
The organization now draws participants from as far away as New York City, Westchester and Rockland Counties, and West Hartford. Members pay an annual fee of $30 which provides them with weekly discounts for most events, including the regular Tuesday- and Wednesday-night mixers.
 
Outdraws the Church
 "The child just outgrew the parent," said Donald R. Delano, 45, an engineer from Fairfield who has been part of the group since his divorce a decade ago. "Even though we have had a decline in membership the past couple of years, there are still more people in the singles group than in the church."
Longtime members attribute the group's success to a combination of factors including its location in an upscale suburb, where it is particularly difficult for singles to meet, and to a large corps of volunteers dedicated to its survival.
"This group just couldn't exist in Idaho or many other places," said Mr. Pavluvcik, who despite not meeting the woman of his dreams on this night, said he had a good time. "There is such a high rate of divorce in this area and being right in the middle of Fairfield County, the corporate center of the United States, it's not surprising to me that this group has managed to survive."
Ms. Burns, who also didn't find a new love on this night, said she was just hoping to find a nice man to date. "He doesn't even have to be rich, or even normal," she said. "Just nice. And caring."

HEADLINE: New Venture Stirs Mexico Trade Issue

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In a development that has inflamed opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, entrepreneurs in New York and Mexico have established an investment fund whose announced purpose is to buy small American manufacturing companies and move them to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages there.
The Mexican Government's largest industrial development bank is a "significant investor" in the venture, according to a prospectus distributed today by Richard A. Gephardt, the House Majority leader, a leading opponent of the trade pact. 
 "Funds such as this should not be allowed to operate," Mr. Gephardt said in a letter to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico. "But even more objectionable is the official participation of entities controlled by your Government in stealing American jobs."
 
Powerful Obstacle
 Likely job losses to Mexico are already the most potent political obstacle to Congressional approval of the the trade agreement, which would eliminate most barriers to trade and investment among Canada, Mexico and the United States. President Clinton has endorsed the agreement, pending negotiation of side agreements on labor, the environment and surges in imports as tariffs are reduced.
A senior American trade official said this evening that Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, would discuss the fund on Wednesday morning at his first meeting with Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister. "Any Government-subsidized program to steal American jobs would not be tolerated by this Administration," the official said.
The Mexican Embassy had no comment on the prospectus last night.
Even without the Nafta, Mexicans may already buy American companies in many industries and legally move them to Mexico, while Americans can buy Mexican companies in some industries and move them here.
The Mexican Government's involvement in the fund, known as the AmeriMex Maquiladora Fund L.P., is particularly awkward for the Clinton Administration. In his election campaign, President Clinton strongly criticized a foreign aid program that provided financial incentives for American companies to move to Central America.
The prospectus said the fund's organizers are trying to raise $50 million they would use to buy 9 to 13 companies. But critics of the free trade pact cited the prospectus as evidence for their contention that many American companies would move south if the trade pact is approved.
Pat Choate, the director of the Manufacturing Policy Project, a Washington group that is seeking more protection from imports for ailing manufacturing industries, said that the fund could be the first in a wave of cross-border financial transactions to rival the leveraged-buyout boom during the 1980's, and that "hundreds of thousands" of American jobs would be lost.
The Mexican Government's involvement in the fund, "couldn't possibly be a worse move," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat.
The fund "is wonderfully revealing of the attitudes behind the enthusiasm for the Nafta," said Tom Donohue, the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, which opposes the pact.
But most academic studies have predicted that the pact would create more American jobs than it would destroy or send to Mexico because jobs added in Mexico would ultimately mean more demand for American goods. More than two thirds of Mexico's imports come from the United States.
The prospectus estimated that manufacturing companies now paying $7 to $10 an hour to their workers in the United States can pay Mexican workers just $1.15 to $1.50 an hour. By moving to Mexico, the companies would save $10,000 to $17,000 per employee each year, excluding relocation costs, the prospectus said.
The fund would buy companies with annual sales of $10 million to $100 million, move them to Mexico within a year and a half, and then resell the company after three to eight years.
"The fund anticipates that moving the manufacturing operations to Mexico will significantly reduce the labor costs of production and enhance the profitability of these companies," the prospectus said.
The prospectus identifies two men as the fund's organizers: R. Paul Sprague, a New York consultant and financial deal maker, and Adolfo Peniche Perez, who is the Secretary of the Treasury for the state of Yucatan in southeastern Mexico. Mr. Sprague declined to discuss the fund, saying that it was in the process of raising money and that he was legally bound not to make any comments.
Mr. Peniche did not return two telephone calls to his office in Merida, the capital of the state of Yucatan.

HEADLINE: Two Diesel Giants Set Alliance

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The Cummins Engine Company, the world's leading independent maker of heavy-duty diesel engines, and Komatsu Ltd., Japan's top construction equipment manufacturer, today joined the list of huge multinationals pooling their resources to manufacture existing products and develop new ones.
"Capital-goods companies all over the world are caught up in intense competition for what is essentially a mature market," said Henry B. Schacht, chairman and chief executive of Cummins, which is based in Columbus, Ind. "Everyone is looking for an edge."
 
'We All Learned'
 The partnership was formed less than a decade after Komatsu led a charge of Japanese engine makers at the United States market. That effort ultimately failed at great cost. Cummins had slashed prices to keep Komatsu, Mitsubishi, Nissan and other Japanese companies from gaining a foothold, but the American company had to make painful cuts in its operations to control costs. "We all learned something from that," Mr. Schacht said. 
 Trucks are the biggest end users of the types of engines Cummins makes, but the company's engines are also used in construction equipment, boats, industrial machinery and as power generators.
Before attacking the American market, Komatsu had been a longtime customer of Cummins and a licensee for its engines. Analysts said that the resurrection of the ties between Cummins, with revenues last year of $3.8 billion, and Komatsu, which is more diversified and nearly twice as large, highlights the pressures on companies to think globally. They said it also shows how the investments by American engine makers in technology to comply with stricter air-quality controls have created a useful bargaining chip in forming alliances.
 
 
Technological Advantage
 "Komatsu had to link up with Cummins to stay competitive with Caterpillar," said John E. McGinty, a heavy-equipment analyst in Boston for First Boston. Caterpillar Inc., which is based in Peoria, Ill., is a leader in the construction equipment industry as well as a leading maker of diesel engines. Analysts say that Cummins, Caterpillar and the Detroit Diesel Corporation, the third major American maker of diesel engines, all hold a substantial technological advantage over most foreign engine manufacturers in environmental controls.
Cummins and Komatsu said the first step in their partnership would be to make the popular 3.9-liter and 5.9-liter Cummins engines, which range in horsepower from about 70 to 200, in one of Komatsu's Japanese factories. Komatsu will use much of the output in its construction equipment, and Cummins will use the plant to expand its sales throughout Asia.
The second step, the companies said, would be a joint venture to build a huge 30-liter Komatsu-designed engine with horsepower ratings up to 1,100 in one of Cummins's domestic plants and sell it through Cummins's large American dealer network. That could allow Cummins to chip away at Caterpillar's dominance in engines for huge off-road construction equipment. The companies said that other forms of cooperation could follow.
Mr. Schacht said that the companies hoped to finish negotiating the terms of their joint agreements by this summer and to begin production of the Cummins engines in Japan within two years. Analysts said any benefits would not be felt for several years.
Cummins's stock ended trading today on the New York Stock Exchange at $82.75 a share, down $2.125, in a sharply plunging market.
 
 
Increasing Pace of Cooperation
 The announcement comes at a time when the pace of industrial cooperation is accelerating both domestically and across borders. Within the United States, for instance, auto makers are working together on electric cars.
The growing pressures for global sharing of costs have recently been highlighted by the aerospace industry, in which the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, its bitter European rival, are discussing cooperative development of a huge new aircraft.
Global relationships in the heavy- equipment industry go back several decades. Caterpillar, for example, has a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries dating back to 1963 that supplies a wide range of equipment to Japan and exports certain types of Caterpillar excavators, loaders and tractors around the world.
"I don't see any end to it," said Robert Z. Aliber, professor of international economics and finance at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.

HEADLINE: Flower District Fights Move to South Bronx

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Faced with the loss of four major flower wholesalers who plan to move to the South Bronx, the rest of New York City's flower industry is fighting to remain in Manhattan, where it has been rooted for more than 100 years.
Despite traffic congestion, lack of space and prospects of rezoning, many flower wholesalers and retailers have banded together in an effort to find a way to stay in the present Flower District or relocate to some other site in Manhattan. 
 In recent weeks, the flower community has formed the first industry-wide group, the New York Florists Association; gained the support of elected officials; held talks with the Department of Transportation to ease traffic congestion and parking problems, and called on city officials for support in considering the rezoning of the Avenue of the Americas.
"The vast majority of the industry not only prefers, but needs to stay in Manhattan to survive," said Annie Zamoiski, president of the new association, grouping more than 50 wholesalers, retailers and suppliers. "Because we are a service industry, it is critical for us to stay near our clients: hotels, restaurants, designers, the gift market, caterers and retailers. Our customers are here and we need to be here to serve them."
 
Problems of Growth
 In a direct appeal to city officials, Ms. Zamoiski asked for help to remain on 28th Street or if relocation was necessary, to find another site in Manhattan, "perhaps to Pier 40." She said the flower industry was at "a critical juncture," citing the problems associated with growth, like congestion, and "even greater pressures" with the relocation of the four largest wholesalers and the proposed rezoning of the Avenue of the Americas from manufacturing to commercial and residential use. The Flower District is an oasis of greenery, bright-colored blossoms and exotic plants, situated in the form of a cross on 28th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway and along the Avenue of the Americas between 26th and 29th Streets. On most mornings, the market bustles with buyers and sellers, double-parked cars, trucks, express mail vans and tourists.
Contesting the Mayor's recent announcement that the flower market was relocating to the Bronx, Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and City Councilman Tom Duane said that only a small portion of the industry was willing to relocate to the Bronx and "most of the firms remain committed to Manhattan."
In a joint letter to Barry F. Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Ms. Messinger and Mr. Duane called on the City to resolve the problems of the Manhattan site: traffic, parking, threat of displacement. They noted that the flower market was an important part of the neighborhood's economy, accounting for hundreds of jobs and giving the area "a unique character."
 
Concern About Future
 Officials from the flower industry have been meeting with city transportation officials to resolve immediate problems of traffic and parking. At the same time, the group has been seeking a solution to long-term space and rezoning problems and is looking into the possibility of relocating to Pier 40, which is part of the West Side Waterfront project.
"Most of us have walk-in trade and operate best together in this full-service market, which has everything from dried and silk flowers to potted plants and earthen pots," said Jim Weisse, treasurer of the Florists Association and a co-owner of Caribbean Cuts, a wholesale firm at 137 West 28th Street.
Although the flower industry is "in good health and expanding," Mr. Weisse said, the market faces problems: traffic congestion, lack of warehouse space and deteriorating buildings. He said talks with the city Department of Transportation have brought some relief from parking tickets and efforts are under way to extend commercial parking hours.
But wholesalers and retailers alike expressed concern about the future of their district, located in a manufacturing zone, which the City Planning Department has said should be opened to residential development. And as they discuss possible solutions, many of the flower people suggest Pier 40 as their favorite option because of the space and location on Manhattan's West Side, opposite Houston Street.
 
'A Lot of Restrictions'
 Last week, the leaders of the Florists Association took up the issue with Tom Fox, president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the state Urban Development Corporation, charged with the development of the waterfront from Battery Park City to 59th Street. "There are a lot of restrictions but it could be a reasonable compromise," Mr. Weisse said after the meeting.
But with public review and approval procedures, Mr. Fox said, it will be two to three years before the long-term use of the pier will be decided.
Councilman Duane, who represents the area that includes the Flower District, said this week that the city had been "extremely shortsighted" in encouraging developers' plans that would allow the construction of large apartment blocks in the area. A rezoning measure, currently under review, could mean the end of the Flower District by raising rents and land values beyond the reach of most flower companies, he said.
"I wouldn't dream of moving to the Bronx; all my customers are here," said Ms. Zamoiski. A freelance retailer better known as Annie Z., she works out of an office at 245 West 29th Street, providing floral arrangements for corporate clients, weddings, dinner parties and other special events.
 
Caught Off Guard
 Ms. Zamoiski said other wholesalers and retailers were surprised by last month's announcement that four wholesalers would move to the abandoned Penn Central Rail Yards in the Bronx in the next two years.
The four, who have signed leases in the new Bronx development project, do most of their business by telephone and are not dependent on the central location, their colleagues said. When they announced the move, they said it would be easier to truck tulips deeper into New Jersey and Connecticut from the Bronx.
Mitchell Vlachos, whose family business, Harry Vlachos Inc., is one of the wholesalers planning to move to the South Bronx, said he would prefer a facility on Manhattan's West Side, like Pier 40. "That would be great for all of us and for the people we serve," said Mr. Vlachos.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Clinton Borrows Freely From Capra to Tap Middle-Class Ideals

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
You may catch a whiff of Ronald Reagan in President Clinton's direct approach to the television audience or a touch of Ross Perot in the President's display of colorfully doleful charts, but his public introduction of the Administration's economic prescriptions owes even more to the spirit of Frank Capra.
In the radio talks, the video "town hall" meeting and the brief television address that have led up to tonight's message to Congress, he took the role, familiar from so many Capra movies, of the young, idealistic outsider calling for the support of solid middle-class Americans in his challenge to high-priced lobbyists (who ever heard of a low-priced one?), special interests (or an unspecial one?), status-quo pols and other "defenders of decline." 
 On Monday night you could practically hear the big us-against-them speeches of James Stewart and Gary Cooper as the youthful-looking President pleaded, "We're all in this together" and perorated with an evocation of patriotism and the Almighty. All that was missing was a small boy looking on, aglow with admiration.
 
Teacher and Politician
 That is not to take away from the performance. Mr. Clinton is proving himself a more sophisticated politician than the Capra heroes and a more adept teacher than recent Presidents and aspirants. In the "town hall" appearance especially, it was impossible to imagine Mr. Reagan or Mr. Perot, not to mention George Bush, answering questions so lucidly, showing due sensitivity to the concerns of the unemployed defense worker, the family in need of medical coverage, the working mother worried about child care, without quite promising all things to all of them. In such a forum complexities are inevitably glossed over, but Mr. Clinton at least alluded to them and offered considerable context.
The style was classroom homely. "Let me tell you why I did what I did," he began one answer and then actually offered an explanation for his restrictions on Haitian refugees. He called health care "the most complicated problem I ever messed with." By comparison, the rote response of Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican and minority leader, came over like Edward Arnold, the Capra-era actor who specialized in rich, greedy, powerful characters.
The "town hall" hour was a smartly conceived and smoothly directed show. The studio was small enough to give the scene the feeling of a gathering of individuals instead of an audience. Mr. Clinton rose almost at once from his chair, stepped off the stage and spoke mostly from the edge of a low platform, almost within touching distance of people in the front row.
Questioners had evidently been screened: no loonies allowed and not too many white men. And there were useful if mild follow-ups from the local television personalities in four cities. A decision had plainly been made to stay away from network stars and high-power journalists.
The one-on-one feeling was sustained even after the last question, when the camera showed the President stepping down onto the studio floor and chatting with a woman. When Mr. Clinton said, "I'm going to try to stay in touch with you this whole four years," everyone knew he was not addressing Dan Rather.
 
Different View of World
 It is by now evident that Mr. Clinton finds no rewards in going out of his way to encounter the national news media. "We don't see the world the same way," he said last week. What he may have meant was that more professional, less respectful interviewers might harp on the campaign promises that have gone by the way or the awkward start to his Presidency, and might press harder for details of his plans. Other politicians, too, have learned that going direct to the people via radio and television call-in shows is a means of avoiding scrutiny by reporters who can bring experience to their questions and don't mind being a little pushy.
As for the voters themselves, it is useful to remember that Frank Capra's movies carry an ambiguous message. Although happy endings were invariably imposed, with the ordinary Joes and Janes doing the right thing by the honest young hero, the more interesting and unsettling parts of the better scripts showed how quickly the citizenry can turn into a mob, how fickle, frightened and prone to manipulation people can be.
Well, Mr. Clinton is showing himself to be no mean persuader. If the polls indicate that the nation is readier for more reality than has been asked of it by its leaders in recent years, that is in part a tribute to the talent and theatrical know-how the President is bringing to his case.

HEADLINE: Secretary Sees a Vital Role For Labor in U.S. Growth

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich told the leaders of organized labor today that unions were vital to the new Administration's hopes for economic growth and that he intended to help them regain the power they have been losing for decades.
In a discussion covering nearly three hours at the annual winter meeting of the executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Reich, who has emerged as the Government's most influential Labor Secretary in economic policy in at least a generation, told unions that management has gained an unfair advantage in resolving conflicts with unions. 
 "Undoubtedly, we need to restore a level playing field in this country," Mr. Reich told reporters after his discussions with the unions. "In the last 10 years, working men and women have been penalized for even trying to create unions." He called the labor movement "the most articulate, indeed the only voice of the front-line worker in America."
 
Liked What They Heard
 Mr. Reich came here to seek support for President Clinton's economic plan from organizations that gave Mr. Clinton around 10 million votes in November, and he appears to have left them enraptured.
Despite a refusal to assure the unions of unequivocal support for several issues they consider vital, like lifting President Ronald Reagan's ban on hiring the air-traffic controllers he dismissed for striking illegally in 1981 and on raising the minimum wage, the leaders liked just about everything they heard.
Vincent R. Sombretto, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, called the session with Mr. Reich "the most extraordinary executive council meeting I've attended in the last 12 years."
"He's seeing an important role for the labor movement," Mr. Sombretto said. "He sees collective bargaining as a key element to raising the standard of living in this country."
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, said, "He's saying all the right things."
Despite the tax increases that the unions' many middle-class members face under Mr. Clinton's plan, the president of the labor federation, Lane Kirkland, said, "The President is going in exactly the right direction."
 
Speaking From Notes
 Mr. Reich addressed the presidents of 32 unions and staff in a cavernous, windowless hotel conference room from which the press was excluded. He did not prepare a speech, using notes written on the front of a manila folder instead. But at a news conference later he reported on the meeting, and union leaders confirmed much of what he said.
He told the federation nothing of the President's economic plan beyond what has been already disclosed. But Mr. Kirkland said the federation "will do its level best to be strongly supportive of this plan, including all of its components."
Unions pine for their power of four and five decades ago, when their political agendas were the same as those of the Democratic Party.
But in the 1980's, especially, unions lost such ground that in industries like retailing and many services their membership is so small they are close to irrelevant. By last year, their representation in the work force had shrunk to 15.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from above 20 percent in the 1970's.
 
Voice of the Workers
 Mr. Reich said that unions, in collaborating with management, help define the more efficient factories with multiskilled workers that Mr. Reich sees as the industries of the future. "All the evidence suggests that when workers have voice, the yield is higher productivity," he said.
He assured the unions that Mr. Clinton would fulfill his campaign promise to support legislation, opposed by the Bush Administration, that would prohibit companies from dismissing workers who go out on strike and permanently replacing them with nonunion workers.
And he said that within two weeks he would appoint a commission to examine the laws and regulations that organized labor says business exploits to undermine unions and thwart their efforts to recruit new workers. "It may be time to revisit some of the assumptions" embodied in the laws, Mr. Reich said.
Labor leaders said the Secretary assured them that the commission would make its recommendations within a few months.
 
Choosing Words Carefully
 Mr. Reich said he told the unions that the commission "would be looking at employee participation in the future and recommend back to the Administration changes in labor law that would facilitate labor-management relations in the future."
In an interview, Mr. Reich said he was considering a thorough reorganization of the plethora of Government services that help unemployed workers seek training, re-employment services, financial aid and counseling. He suggested a "comprehensive program for one-stop shopping."
The shops, he said, would be managed by "local labor market boards" that would pull the services together. "We need to have one single job retraining, job-search service," Mr. Reich said, that would be similar to Commerce Department and Agriculture Department extension services. "It's an option we're seriously considering," he said.
At the news conference, Mr. Reich said the President had not reneged on his campaign promise to require employers to spend 1.5 percent of the wages they pay on employee training, although Mr. Clinton evidently has done so, at least for now.
"The Administration will not be mandating the 1.5 percent training tax right away," Mr. Reich said. "I want to use it as a last resort."

HEADLINE: Report Warns of Scheme Directed at Low-Income Minority Homeowners

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Eutha M. King, a 68-year-old woman living on Social Security payments, has never stopped regretting the day a door-to-door home-improvement contractor appeared at her threshold. He talked her into getting a loan for $25,000 worth of repairs for new electrical wiring and kitchen remodeling for her home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
Since that day three years ago, Ms. King said, her life has become a roller-coaster ride, shifting from coping with poor and incomplete construction work to teetering on the brink of foreclosure on the house she has owned for more than 25 years. 
 She said the contractor tricked her and did not reveal the fine print of the contract. Facing monthly payments of $1,600 -- instead of $900 -- she asked relatives to help and took in a granddaughter, who offered to assist with the payments.
"The company never finished the kitchen work, and my family and friends had to patch things up as best as they could," Ms. King said. "The payments were much higher than what the contractor told me they would be and the bank kept threatening to foreclose. This has been a nightmare."
A report issued yesterday by New York City's Consumer Affairs Department suggests that Ms. King's troubles represent a scenario facing thousands of low-income black and Hispanic homeowners who have been systematically deceived by some home-improvement contractors into obtaining high-interest second mortgages for work that is usually shoddy and seldom completed.
The department said more than 32,000 minority homeowners in neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx have been victimized in the last seven years by home-improvement sales representatives who are essentially agents for finance companies and banks, who then charge interest rates as high as 21 percent. The home-improvement contractors target low-income minority areas, the department said, because homeowners in those neighborhoods often cannot obtain financing directly from banks.
"A dual home-improvement lending system has been created in New York City," said Mark Green, the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs. "One with lower interest rates for white and middle-class neighborhoods, the other with high interest rates for lower-income and minority neighborhoods."
 
Inflated Payments
 Often the homeowners have been duped into believing that the amount of the loan is less than the number written on the contract. Under the terms of those contracts, the finance company pays the contractor, who typically does little or poor construction work. The homeowner is then responsible for the inflated monthly payments. A homeowner unable to make the payments then faces eviction action from the bank, which has bought the mortgage from the finance company.
Mr. Green said the working poor and older homeowners living on Social Security have been the most common victims.
 
Changes in Laws Urged
 He said he has urged banks that buy home-improvement mortgage obligations from finance companies to stop all dunning or eviction actions until they investigate whether there was fraud in the circumstances connected with the loan and whether the contractor was paid before the work was satisfactorily completed.
"Major banks have to stop looking the other way when they know they're foreclosing on people who were deceived into 20 percent mortgages for work never done," Mr. Green said.
The report also recommends that state law be changed to make it illegal for home-improvement contract sales staffs to act as agents for finance companies. The report also urges that laws be changed to make it illegal for finance companies to pay contractors directly unless one of their own inspectors has personally visited and signed off on completed work.
Ms. King has found some consolation in the fact that since reporting her situation to the consumer affairs officials, the bank has been willing to negotiate refinancing the mortgage. Nonetheless, she remains bitter.
"The way this contractor did me was so dirty and underhanded," she said. "We still have no light in the kitchen and we never got the washer and dryer he said we would get. I hope no one else will have to go through this."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Are Mostly Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of government securities remained firm yesterday despite the turmoil in the equity market, as bond traders reacted favorably to President Clinton's economic talk of Monday night.
The benchmark 30-year bond made gains in early trading, and at one point the yield fell as low as 7.07 percent -- its lowest level since the Treasury began selling the long bond in 1977. But the bond gave back its gains later on some profit taking, and late in the day, the long bond was offered at a price of 99 25/32 , down 9/32 , to yield 7.14 percent. 
 Issues with shorter maturities, however, continued to post gains throughout the day.
 
Corporates Up Slightly
 With government bond prices firm, the corporate issues followed and prices edged up slightly. Bond traders said the key to the future direction of bond prices depended on whether the Federal budget deficit could be controlled by tax increases and spending reductions.
Some investors and economist say inflation is so contained and the economic recovery so weak that if bond yields move higher it will slow the economic recovery further and force another round of interest-rate cuts.
On Monday, President Clinton proposed increased taxation for the wealthy and the middle class along with reduced Government spending. The market reacted positively yesterday morning, especially among issues with long maturities, before slipping in the afternoon.
Some analysts cautioned that bond investors should not ignore the steep selloff in the stock market, as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 82.94 points, to 3,309.49, in reaction to the President's proposals.
Many investors are beginning to realize that the fiscal medicine of tax increases and spending cuts is likely to slow economic activity.
Unlike bond prices that advanced on expectations of a reduced Federal deficit, weak economic growth and low inflation, stock prices generally fell on worries regarding the effect of strong deficit-reduction measures on economic activity.
Charles E. Rhoden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josepthal, Lyon & Ross, said there were no unusual movements yesterday in government or corporate trading. He said his people concentrated yesterday on 5- to 10-year maturities for their portfolios.
 
'Experiencing Rate Shock'
 "There are two things in this market that are coming to a head," he said. "One is that the market has had a huge rally and other is that investors in the market are now experiencing rate shock. The comfort factor is being disturbed, and investors are uneasy about taking an overbalance in the market."
While the outline of President Clinton's plan was well received by the Treasury bond traders, it has also cast a great deal of uncertainty in the corporate and junk bond markets.
 
Corporates
 The yield spreads between corporate bonds and Treasury securities remained relatively tight. Narrow yield spreads indicate that this year's early deluge of corporate bond issuance primarily represents the refunding of outstanding higher-coupon corporate bonds, with a sizable part of this year's bond issuance also financing the paying down of short-term debt.
The first corporate issue to take advantage of lower borrowing costs yesterday was Michigan Bell Telephone, with a $200 million debt offering of 30-year debentures through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The issue, rated Aa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AAA by the Standard & Poor's Company, was priced to yield 7.545 percent, or about 44 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than Treasury securities with a comparable maturity.
 
Auction
 The Treasury yesterday sold $23.2 billion of new three- and six-month bills at auction, with the average discount rate slightly lower than those offered last week.
For the three-month bill, the average was 2.93 percent at auction, making it the seventh consecutive week that the rate has dropped. So far this year, the average rate has fallen 12 basis points. The average discount rate for the six-month bill was 3.08 percent, down for the second consecutive week and down 20 basis points since the beginning of the year.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Dow Off 82.94 As Most Stocks Take a Beating

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Traders and investors sold stocks with greater fury yesterday than on any day since November 1991, apparently registering apprehension about President Clinton's economic plans.
Selling was concentrated on the technology stocks that have led the market higher since investors began drawing confidence last October from the likelihood of Mr. Clinton's election. Just two weeks ago, most market averages stood at record levels. 
 But yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks, suffered a 3.6 percent decline.
 
Trading Is Heavy
 The Dow Jones industrial average of larger stocks fell 82.94 points, or 2.4 percent, to 3,309.49. Trading was heavy, with 332.9 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bond investors reacted with less alarm, keeping prices steady yesterday, as many continued to believe that Mr. Clinton would succeed in narrowing the deficit. [Page D14.]
In explaining yesterday's stock market plunge, analysts cited the President's confrontation with drug companies over pricing and the threat that his plans for cutting spending and raising taxes would retard the recovery.
"If Clinton's program goes through, it will dampen the expansion for the rest of the year," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. The growth of corporate profits, which has propelled the market higher since last fall, would then slow or cease, analysts said.
Other analysts added, however, that with stock indexes near record highs, a retreat was in order among investors anxious to preserve their profits.
"This market was already rolling down the hill," said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley. "A few things came along to push it."
The success of Mr. Clinton's economic plans depends in part on the response from investors, since their actions help determine how readily companies can raise capital. The smaller high-technology companies that the new President most wants to aid have had great success in marketing their shares lately, but suffered the largest losses yesterday.
President Clinton shrugged off the market's drop, saying, "The people in the stock market have known in general all along what was going to be in the program, and the stock market's gone up markedly since the election."
Analysts mocked the White House comment. "I was not aware that they had hired any market analysts there," said Laszlo Birinyi, whose financial consulting firm bears his name.
Mr. Clinton's attacks on drug companies and his threat of cost controls contributed to a recommendation yesterday by Goldman, Sachs & Company for clients to reduce the stock portion of their investment portfolios by 15 percentage points.
"If public vilification of the corporate sector is to be part and parcel of this Administration's policy, the implication for shares is not good," Goldman analysts said in their message to clients.
 
Parallels With Steel
 Some strategists, including Mr. Metz, saw parallels between yesterday's selloff, after Mr. Clinton's assault on the drug companies, and the market retreat that followed President John F. Kennedy's attack on steel companies and their price increases three decades ago.
On Monday night, President Clinton spoke of broad themes in a brief televised speech, preparing the nation for the sacrifices he will seek in an address to Congress tonight. Traders said yesterday that the details they have learned so far caused them to fear that Mr. Clinton was more eager to tax away corporate and personal income than to curb Federal spending.
"The market's just sending a big old message," said Bill Allyn, who manages the listed equity desk at Jefferies & Company. "People don't mind taxes so much as long as the Government does its part."
Yesterday's stock selling was determined but not panicked. Steven E. Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price mutual funds, saw no surge of redemption orders. Some callers, he said, saw the pullback as a buying opportunity.
 
Nasdaq Off 25.15
 And Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley saw the possibility of renewed advances once investors realized that Mr. Clinton's proposals might not pass Congress intact.
On the Nasdaq market yesterday, where the composite index dropped 25.15 points, many of the most popular computer and biotechnology issues fell several points. Intel lost 5 1/8, to 105 7/8; Microsoft 3 1/2, to 80 1/8; Amgen 4, to 49 7/8; Biogen 4 1/2, to 30 3/4, and Legent 6 1/4 to 43. Smaller issues suffered proportional losses.
The Dow's 83-point plunge was the largest in one day since a 120-point loss in November 1991, also after many averages had reached records and biotechnology stocks had soared. Big Board losers outnumbered gainers yesterday by more than four to one.
Among the Standard & Poor's 500, drug and diversified health-care companies were the two worst performing groups. Merck fell 2 1/2, to 37 7/8; Pfizer 4 1/8, to 60 1/8, and Johnson & Johnson 2 3/8, to 42 5/8.
Retailers, auto makers and other cyclical issues that have ridden the strengthening economy also toppled yesterday, with Chrysler down 3 3/8, to 36 1/2; G.M. down 2, to 38 5/8; Goodyear down 4 3/8, to 66 5/8; International Paper off 3 5/8, to 64 3/4, and Dayton Hudson off 3, to 79 1/4.
Nike fell 9 1/8 to 73 after the company said late Friday that it was unlikely to meet analysts' earnings estimates.
The Dow Jones transportation average fell 63.46 points, more than 4 percent, to 1,515.48, as fears of an energy tax and OPEC cutbacks intensified the selling of airlines, truckers and rails. UAL fell 6 1/2, to 119 1/2; Xtra Corporation 4 1/2, to 82 1/2; Conrail 3 3/8, to 53 3/8, and Delta 2 3/8, to 49.

BellSouth to Spend More on Service

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The BellSouth Corporation, the largest of the regional Bell companies, said yesterday that it planned to spend nearly $9 billion to modernize its local telephone service by 1995.
The amount is an increase from the $8.5 billion allotted in its previous three-year budget. 
 BellSouth, which covers nine states in the fast-growing South, has experienced stronger growth than telephone companies in other regions, like California, where the persistent recession and high unemployment have hurt the Pacific Telesis Group. BellSouth, based in Atlanta, is assuming an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent in the number of telephone lines, compared with growth rates of 1 percent and 2 percent elsewhere in the country.
 
 
More Digital Switching Systems
 Besides replacing old or damaged telephone lines, the BellSouth money will go toward the further deployment of digital switching systems, which increase the number and speed of telephone calls on the network. They also allow the use of sophisticated computer programs that can provide new services like caller-identification or videoconferencing.
While the overall spending rise is modest, less than 6 percent over three years, what is more important is that BellSouth is not only maintaining a robust level of spending, but increasing it, said William M. Ferguson, BellSouth's group president for network and technology.
 
 
New Telephone Lines
 The largest portion of the budget, about $5.7 billion, has been set aside to add telephone lines to the 18.5 million lines in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee. Some of the budget will also be used to replace damaged or worn equipment, including $45 million for damage related to Hurricane Andrew in Florida last year.
Most of the remaining money will be used to modernize the network. About 61 percent of telephone lines are digital, where voice and data are carried in the code understood by computers, instead of the older analog language. By 1995, about 81 percent of the lines will be digital.
These digital lines make possible the use of what is known as Signaling System No. 7. This computer hardware and software system provides more efficient routing of calls.

HEADLINE: 90's May Be a Decade of Growth

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The nation may be poised for faster economic growth during the 1990's than people have previously believed, according to economic heavyweights like the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.
Just as the Clinton Administration is starting to concentrate on the economy's long-term troubles, some economists are focusing on tantalizing signs that America's economic engine packs more horsepower than it used to: last year's productivity growth was the fastest in 20 years, profits are rebounding despite weak sales growth and business has gone on a high-tech spending spree. Job growth may finally be picking up, too. 
 "By the second half of the 1990's, the United States may post consistently faster noninflationary growth than was possible during the past two decades," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
 
Hardly a Panacea
 Faster growth would not put most Americans on Easy Street anytime soon. The turmoil of bankruptcies, corporate restructurings and white-collar layoffs will almost surely continue as once-prosperous economic leaders like I.B.M., General Motors and Sears struggle to remake themselves and a wave of new technology wipes out entire occupations.
"Like other rich countries, the United States was caught in a slow-growth trap since the early 1970's," Mr. Steinberg said. "But now, the great productivity slowdown of the past 20 years may finally be over." Productivity refers to the amount the average American worker can produce in an hour or, more generally, to the economy's efficiency.
This would not be the first time that a long stretch of stagnation gave way to buoyant growth, economic historians say.
 
New Age of Innovation
 Like the 1970's and 1980's, when business entered the computer age, the late 1860's through the 1880's was a period of technological innovation. The typewriter, telephone and light bulb were all invented or developed in usable form, but without measurably increasing the nation's output. It was not until the 1890's and early 1900's that these inventions propelled industrial or commercial productivity.
"We should realize just how long the gestation of technology is," said Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard.
Increases in productivity may be reviving now, economists say, in part because corporations are learning to take advantage of the $1 trillion they invested in the last decade in computers and other high-tech equipment.
Charles Ferguson, a technology consultant based in Cambridge, Mass., remarked, "There's no doubt that in the remainder of this decade, U.S. corporations are going to use computers much more effectively than they have been."
Among those who believe that this is a possibility is the customarily cautious Mr. Greenspan. "A new synergy of hardware and software applications may finally be showing through in a significant increase in labor productivity," he told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Jan. 29. "These far-reaching changes in the production processes and manufacturing, and in the means by which services are produced and distributed, have apparently yet to run their course."
If the increase in productivity continues, Mr. Greenspan said, "we have underestimated the potential long-term economic growth of the economy; that is, that in fact, it can grow faster than most economists have recently been forecasting."
President Clinton was considerably less optimistic during his Oval Office address Monday night on his forthcoming economic proposals, dismissing signs of faster productivity growth as statistics cited by "defenders" of the "status quo."
What makes Mr. Greenspan's speculation powerful is that in his role at the central bank, he functions as a sort of state trooper for the economy -- the man who cruises into traffic to remind drivers not to exceed the speed limit. In effect, Mr. Greenspan was telling worried Democrats that he might soon be standing on the side of highway, arms folded, smiling.
"The higher potential growth, the more likely that the economy will actually grow faster," Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said, "and the longer it takes before the bottlenecks develop or the economy runs into growth barriers like more restrictive monetary policy."
 
A Meaningful Percentage Point
 Until recently, most forecasters agreed that the economy could not safely grow much faster than an average of 2 percent a year: the labor force is expanding by about 1 percent a year and productivity growth has been stuck at about 1 percent a year since the early 1970's. But lately some economists have started wondering whether last year's higher productivity might be pushing potential growth closer to 3 percent.
The difference between 2 percent and 3 percent growth, year in and year out, can be the difference between living standards doubling in one generation, versus taking two or three generations to achieve the same progress.
But, Mr. Greenspan and others warn, higher growth is a possibility, not a certainty. Hard evidence that the United States has broken out of its two-decade-long slump in growth will not be available for several years, when long-term trends can be viewed apart from the ups and downs of the business cycle.
Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, is one of those who is skeptical that there has been an authentic turnaround. "Productivity grew in the last year and a half," he said, "but it was extremely bad from 1988 to 1991. Much of the turnaround is just getting back to where we were."
Nonetheless, Mr. Greenspan and some others cite concrete evidence that prospects of faster growth are not pie in the sky.
They refer to three measures: First, the increase in productivity, while similar to those in past recoveries, is extremely rapid, considering the slow growth of output. It is not unusual for productivity to bounce up when sales are booming, but sales have been tepid this time around.
Second, this is the first time that all of the production increases during a recovery were a result of greater productivity, rather than from an expansion of the work force.
And most of the action has been outside manufacturing. While factory productivity, which recovered from its 70's slump a decade ago, is behaving quite normally, service productivity, which has not budged for a decade, has been rising almost as fast.
"When business was booming in the 1980's, service companies used technology to woo customers," said Bill Lewis, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, an arm of the worldwide consulting company. "Now that sales are slow, they are refocusing the efforts on cost reduction."
A third sign is that profits have made a strong comeback despite a relatively weak rebound in sales. "This is a business-led, profits-driven recovery," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns, who served as chief economist with the Office of Management and Budget during President Ronald Reagan's first term. "It's out of some old industry economics textbook written long before we heard of John Maynard Keynes and demand-side economics," he said.
Profit margins have increased in the last year. During periods of high inflation, companies could repair poor profit margins by raising prices. Nowadays, potential customers may simply refuse to buy and, as a result, companies have to dig into costs and raise efficiency. The operating earnings of the companies on the S. & P. 500 list, stripped of special charges, jumped 13 percent in 1992 -- as much as in 1983 even though revenue rose half as much.
One reason for this is the heavy spending by companies on new equipment. Such spending, especially for high-tech equipment, did not fall as much during this recession as it usually does and has been rising in the last year at nearly four times the rate of consumer spending -- 11.9 percent versus 3.2 percent.
"This is the first recovery I have seen in many cycles," Mr. Kudlow said, "when the expansion of business profits and recovery of business balance sheets is leading to business investment, which in turn is pushing up hours worked and providing incomes even while long-term downsizing is taking place."
Today, high-tech equipment accounts for a bigger share of economic output than cars and trucks.
"That gives at least a reasonable reason to think that we'll see fast productivity growth sustain itself," said Bradford De Long, a Harvard economist whose studies suggest that more spending on equipment explains why some countries grow faster than others.
As George Belonogoff, vice president and manager of engineering systems for Bechtel Software Inc, says: "We've reached the point where you can design a facility on a computer. Before we used to build plastic models that cost millions of dollars and thousands of man hours."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Cattle and Grains Decline; Oil Off in Reaction to OPEC

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market's plunge sent shock waves through the cattle and grain markets yesterday, and crude oil prices fell amid skepticism about an OPEC agreement to trim production.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell nearly 83 points, as investors worried about President Clinton's plan to raise taxes. 
 The stock market's tumble "kind of cast a shadow over everything," said Martyn Foreman, a grain analyst with Agrivisor Services Inc., a subsidiary of the Illinois Farm Bureau in Bloomington, Ill.
An early rally took live cattle futures to a record high of 83.75 cents a pound in the opening minutes, eclipsing Friday's peak of 82.75.
 
 
'Traders Started Worrying'
 "When the stock market tumbled, the cattle traders started worrying about the economy and what a tax increase on the middle class might mean as far as consumer purchasing power," said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago.
February live cattle futures managed to finish with a slight gain, reflecting deterioration of cattle feedlot conditions because of weekend snow in the Southern Plains.
Mr. Foreman of Agrivisor said losses in grain futures on the Chicago Board of Trade mainly reflected beneficial weekend snow in the winter wheat belt. The stock market's plunge was a contributing factor.
"It's hard to tell how much it hurt," he said. "It certainly didn't help."
Oil prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange after bickering ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output by 1.5 million barrels a day.
 
 
'Severe Question'
 William O'Neill, senior strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, said the meeting's acrimonious tone "brings into severe question whether there will be full compliance with the new quotas."
Light crude for March delivery fell 45 cents, to $19.53 a barrel; March heating oil fell 0.49 cent, to 55.14 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline plummeted 1.3 cents, to 52.28 cents a gallon, and March natural gas climbed 5.5 cents to $1.765 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Tight supplies and strong demand drove lumber futures to a record high for the 16th consecutive session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The March contract rose $5, to $400.70 per thousand board feet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Dragged Lower By Selloff in U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday in hectic trading on world currency markets, following the plunge in stock prices in New York.
Gold prices rose worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $333.00 an ounce, up $3.40 from Friday. Republic National Bank said gold added $3.20, to a late bid price of $332.00. Markets in the United States were closed on Monday for Washington's Birthday. 
 The dollar-selling began overnight in Europe, where traders began assessing President Clinton's plans to increase taxes.
The plan unnerved the stock market in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 82.94 points amid fear that higher taxes could derail the economic recovery.
 
 
'Dollar Just Followed the Dow'
 "The dollar just followed the Dow," said Frank Pusateri, a vice president at the Bank of Boston. "Clinton's package is 100 percent" of what is driving the market, he said.
Analysts, however, were quick to emphasize that the market still saw strength in the dollar. The United States currency had gained ground in recent weeks after interest rates began to decline in Europe. With many European economies still depressed, interest-rate differentials are expected to remain in the dollar's favor.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 120.62 yen, down 0.53 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 119.65 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 119.93 yen, from 120.65 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4475, from $1.4180 late Monday. In in New York, one pound cost $1.4495, up from Friday's $1.4205.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates included: 1.6285 German marks, down from 1.6586; 1.5040 Swiss francs, down from 1.5385; 5.5165 French francs, down from 5.6080; 1,541.00 Italian lire, down from 1,542.00, and 1.2583 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2546.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $331.65 an ounce, from $328.55 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a late bid of $329.95, from $328.30. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold was up 12 cents to $329.48.

HEADLINE: Banks Show Drop in Yields

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
Yields of bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the seven-day period that ended yesterday continued to edge downward.
In the New York market, average six-month certificate yields were lower than at 20 major banks across the country, while money market yields were about the same. 
 In the New York area, yields on money market accounts were down an average of 2 basis points, to 2.64 percent, according to the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Money market account yields have now fallen for eight straight weeks.
The average New York rate for three-month certificates of deposit dropped a basis point, to 2.75 percent, as did the average yield on six-month accounts, which fell to 2.95 percent.
 
 
Sharp Changes in New York
 The institutions in the New York market that posted the sharpest changes this week included Carteret Federal Savings in New Jersey, which reduced its money market accounts by 36 basis points, to 2.94 percent. First Fidelity Bank in New Jersey lowered its yield on six-month certificates by 10 basis points, to 2.90 percent, while National Westminster Bank dropped 5 basis points off its three-month account, to 2.53 percent.
Outside New York, yields at 20 large banks were largely unchanged, at 2.63 percent. Six-month C.D.'s fell by 1 basis point, to 2.98 percent.
 
 
'A Critical Juncture'
 "This is a critical juncture for savers and borrowers," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor. "Everything hangs on the markets' reaction to President Clinton's tough economic proposals."
At the Treasury's weekly auction yesterday, the average discount rate for three- and six-month bills was again slightly lower. The three-month bill fell to 2.93 percent, the seventh consecutive week it has dropped. The average rate for a six-month bill was 3.08 percent, down a basis point. The weekly Treasury auction is one measure of how banks may set deposit rates in the weeks ahead.

HEADLINE: Hospitality to Acquire Super 8 Motels

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Hospitality Franchise Systems Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $125 million for Super 8 Motels Inc., which operates 949 budget-priced motels in North America.
The move rounds out Hospitality Franchise's lineup of hotels and motels, which includes the higher-priced chains Ramada in the United States and Howard Johnson and Days Inn worldwide. 
 "It makes a whole lot of strategic sense," said William Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, a research and money management firm in Greenwich, Conn.
 
'Critical Mass' in Budget Market
 Henry R. Silverman, chairman and chief executive of Hospitality Franchise, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., said the acquisition would afford Super 8 franchisees greater economies of scale, saving them between 5 and 10 percent on their expenses. In addition, he said, "it gives us instant penetration with critical mass in the budget segment, which is the fastest-growing part of the market."
The transaction would also intensify Hospitality Franchise's spirited rivalry with Choice Hotels International, whose chains include Comfort, Quality and Econo Lodge. In 1990, Hospitality Franchise outbid Choice for Ramada and Howard Johnson, paying Prime Motor Inns Inc. $175 million. The company itself does not own any hotels outright.
Investors in the company, which went public at $16 a share in December, applauded the move by bidding the stock to a new intraday high of $27.375 yesterday. But the stock came under pressure from the overall market's plunge, and it ended the day up only 12.5 cents, to $26.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Higher Earnings Estimate
 Michael G. Mueller, an industry analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said yesterday's announcement prompted him to raise his earnings estimate for Hospitality Franchise to $1.30 a share this year from $1.15, and to $1.65 a share next year from $1.45.
Hospitality Franchise said it expected the transaction to be completed by mid-April. The company also said yesterday that it was trying to refinance its debt with Chemical Bank, a move that should lower its expenses further if it is successful.
Mr. Mueller considered the purchase price, which is roughly seven times cash flow, a good deal for Hospitality Franchise. In 1992, franchise revenues for Super 8 were $34 million, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were roughly $15.4 million. Mr. Mueller said that figure should rise to $18 million this year.
Mr. Silverman said that Hospitality Franchise did not plan any noteworthy shifts in strategy for Super 8, which owns 48 motels that will not be acquired in the deal. The retained properties will be reorganized into a new company that will remain based in Aberdeen, S.C., where the first Super 8 motel was built in 1976.
The controlling interest in Hospitality Franchise is owned by Blackstone Capital Partners, which in turn is owned by the Blackstone Group, a leveraged-buyout firm formed in 1985 by Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman.

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Up

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus jumped almost 40 percent in January from a year earlier, another stark reminder of the heavy pressure Tokyo faces to stimulate its stagnant economy and increase imports.
The customs-cleared trade surplus for January, unadjusted for seasonal factors, widened to $5.29 billion from a revised $3.79 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said today. The figure was higher than most economists' predictions. 
 Its surplus with the United States rose to $2.95 billion from $2.45 billion in January 1992, while the surplus with the European Community widened to $2.74 billion from $2.16 billion.
Adjusted for seasonal factors, the total January surplus widened to $9.82 billion from a revised $9.48 billion in December, the ministry said.
Exports tend to be above normal in the last four months of the year and markedly below normal in January.

Trying to Be Seen
Along with the exploding popularity of country music has come a deluge of new artists eager to join country's constellation of stars. With so much competition, record labels increasingly must find ways to make their fledgling acts stand out from the pack. Mercury Nashville has come up with its own solution. 
 The label is promoting three new solo artists -- John Brannen, Toby Keith and Shania Twain -- by packaging them together and taking them directly to the record-buying public. Accompanied by a band, the three are going on a 15-city "Triple Play" tour of country-music clubs, beginning on Feb. 26 in Louisville, Ky. Their new singles are being released separately, and all three debut albums are to hit record stores on April 20.
Luke Lewis, the president of Mercury Nashville, said that presenting the artists together rather than separately would create greater interest among radio stations, record stores, the press and consumers and would also be more economical. And because live performances are so compelling, he said, a club tour seemed to be a good marketing strategy.
"This arena has gotten really competitive, and you have to make a particularly strong impact from the get-go with new acts these days," Mr. Lewis said. "The tried-and-true method would be to go to the big major markets, do showcases and invite key industry people. But that wouldn't be as consumer-oriented. We're hitting markets where radio stations are more receptive to playing new acts and where there's a particularly efficient retail environment so we can see an instantaneous reaction."
This is not the first time Mercury Nashville has tried something new. About a year ago, it was looking for a way to fuel the career of a young Kentuckian. Rather than take the well-traveled route of having his music video appear on country television networks and getting his debut single played on radio, the label released the video to dance clubs and created a dance and dance contest to go with the song. Fill in the blanks with Billy Ray Cyrus, "Achy Breaky Heart" and the Achy Breaky.
 
On South Africa
 If you ask Jon Secada about his "overnight success," the singer and songwriter might tell you it involved earning a bachelor's degree in music and a master's degree in jazz vocal performance, working for over five years with the musician and producer Emilio Estefan and his wife, Gloria, as well as a lot of perseverance.
"It was a slow process but a good one," Mr. Secada said in an interview. "Emilio had told me that it would take a while to get established and have a career that would be respected and last. I've always been in it for the work and love of my craft; that's why I studied music. From the beginning I believed I was lucky because I could work in the industry."
Mr. Secada, who was born in Cuba, is up for a Grammy Award as best new artist, and his debut album (SBK Records) has been nominated as best Latin pop album. He'll find out if he won one week from today. For now he can still savor the global success of his album and first single, "Just Another Day." He currently has two songs on Billboard's chart of the top 100 singles, with "Do You Believe in Us" at No. 31 and, at No. 50, "Angel," one of the singles with the greatest sales gains.
The singer recently visited South Africa and said he was touched by the way he was greeted.
"Black media and radio people in South Africa accepted me a lot better than black radio stations here," said Mr. Secada, who with his family settled in Miami when he was 8. "My music's not played here on black radio stations, but over there it was like 'welcome home,' " he said. "I'm black, I'm Hispanic; my music might not be rhythm-and-blues completely, but it's got flavors of it. The feeling there was, you are here in our country and we accept you with open arms."

Mets Casting Their Eyes On Dominican Sandlot

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Morning had broken noisily in the Dominican Republic and traffic had snarled in Santo Domingo one day last December. Spread out smack in the center of the entrepreneurial madness and automoble exhaust is a humble baseball diamond, one full of holes and hopes, and on this day, a dozen or so of the country's unemployed leaned on a fence and watched as a makeshift instructional league game went on.
"It's a public park," Eddie Toledo, the top Dominican scout for the Mets and the man in charge of the organization's developmental program in the country, said. "It's tough to keep up. You fix something, and who knows who is going to break it." 
 But Toledo's greatest concern, the project he goes to bed worrying about protecting from any kind of damage, was standing out in right field, breathing in the smog and the scene's air of ordinariness.
 
Quick Bat, Nice Arm
 "Good quick bat," Milciades Oliva, one of Toledo's coaches, said of Rafael Guerrero. "Nice arm. Perfect body. Desire."
The high praise for the right-handed outfielder, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds, runs clear to the top of the Mets' organization.
"Rafael Guerrero has more physical talent than any Dominican player who has ever come into our system," Gerry Hunsicker, the Mets' vice president for baseball operations, said recently. "He has a chance to be a dominant major league player."
And so, as the Mets prepare to open spring training here this week, before speculation turns in earnest to Eddie Murray and Bobby Bonilla in 1993, it is tempting to look further into the future and transport Rafael Guerrero, 18, from right field in that Santo Domingo public park to right field at Shea Stadium. It's a huge projection, to be sure, but it's what springtime imagination is all about in baseball.
 
'This Kid Seems Special'
 "You look up the word scout in the dictionary, and it says 'explorer,' " said Toledo. "So there is always a chance you are wrong, that the path your instincts lead you on will be wrong. This kid seems special. He was ready to be signed at 15, but you had to wait until he was 17. He's different. He's got charisma. He's going to be big. He's going to be, maybe, a cornerstone of the outfield for the Mets."
Hunsicker said: "He's a very young kid with many miles to go. But he's got great raw power. He can be an exciting player."
Guerrero, with all his lack of polish and hype, did nothing to blunt the excitement the Mets feel for him with his first season of professional baseball last year. He hit .278 in 56 games in the Gulf Coast League, driving in 36 runs and leading the club in slugging percentage.
"He held his own," said Hunsicker. "I see him being able to move quicker."
 
A Challenge for Youngster
 Guerrero will arrive here for the organization's minor league spring training in March. And a strong showing could earn him a spot on a full season minor league club, perhaps with the organization's Class A team in Columbia, S.C.
"It would be a tremendous leap," said Hunsicker. "But he could do it."
The Mets believe that as an organization they have put in place more than the normal set of resources to help a player like Guerrero in his accelerated climb through the North American baseball system. Their annual budget for developing Latin American players has grown from $25,000 three years ago to $150,000 today. English classes are offered and Felix Millan, a former member of the Mets, has overseen the entire Latin American program as its salaried coordinator.
"But it remains not as easy as it should be for, say, a young Dominican player to get integrated and advance," said Hunsicker. "There is still prejudice. There remain additional challenges."
 
A Diamond in the Rough
 The hurdles were manifestly obvious at the diamond in Santo Domingo in December. The baseballs looked like broken pieces of coal and bounced about as well. Grass grew amid the infield dirt. There was no such thing as a routine grounder or flyout.
"God is the only one who waters our field," said Oliva.
Dust and dirt swirled across the field. Guerrero's face was covered with it as he comes off between innings. A smile, though, could clearly be detected.
"It was very hard for me at the beginning," said Guerrero. "But I still feel like a kid. There are no questions for me. There are no doubts. Shea Stadium -- that's going to be the place for me."
"I hope so," said Toledo. "My bonus is at stake."
Baseball in the Dominican Republic is all about great leaps -- of faith as well as effort. Guerrero has taken both and so far landed with an impact felt throughout the Mets' organization.

HEADLINE: Royal Indiscretions

 BODY:
In Britain, the odds offered by bookmakers seven weeks ago against doing away with the monarchy by the year 2000 were 100 to 1. Incredibly, they have since fallen to 8 to 1. According to a recent Gallup Poll, only one person in three believes Britain gets good value from the cost of the royal family, and four in five say too many of the royals lead an idle, jet-set life.
This dramatic collapse in public esteem owes much to telephonic garrulity. It would seem half of Britain has read or listened to apparently authentic recordings of Princess Diana tittering her secrets to a male pal who calls her "Squidgy" while her husband, Prince Charles, swaps off-color snickers with Camilla Parker-Bowles, wife of a courtier. And who eavesdropped? Most likely, some royal-watchers say, Government snoopers at the supersecret signals interception facility at Cheltenham, who may have leaked the tapes, with or without approval of superiors. 
 In just months, these disclosures have done more damage to the royals than a century of anti-monarchical agitation. The opposition Labor Party is now discussing a proposal to make the Queen liable to inheritance taxes and to take away her power to dissolve Parliament and choose a prime minister. Not since the English Civil War has the royal family become a subject of such furious party debate.
All of this confirms the acute prophecy of Walter Bagehot, the Victorian-era editor of The Economist: "When there is a select committee on the Queen, the charm of royalty will be gone. Its mystery is its life. We must not let daylight in on magic." What Bagehot could not have foreseen is that an agency associated with the James Bond mystique of unquestioning fealty to Queen and country should be the prime suspect in bringing the Crown into disrepute.
Americans can now better understand the unwritten prohibition against quoting the table talk of members of the royal family. It prevents disclosure of the awful secret that, in private, royals can be even more banal than their humble subjects.

HONDA, SUBARU, MITSUBISHI SALES FALL IN EARLY FEBRUARY

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Sales of cars built in the United States by three Japanese automakers fell in the Feb. 1-10 period, the companies reported yesterday. The Honda Motor Company, suffering a sales decline in recent months, extended that weakness with a 17.8 percent drop in the period. For the year, Honda sales are off 23.4 percent. Subaru of America, a small competitor in domestic car sales, reported a 43.9 percent decline compared with last year. For the year, Subaru sales are up 3 percent. Mitsubishi Motors, another small contender in sales of cars built in the United States, said its sales slid 18.1 percent in early February. For the year, sales of Mitsubishis built in the United States are up 23.1 percent. 
 Separately, Honda said that it was raising the price of cars sold in the United States by nearly 1 percent. A company spokesman said an average of $149, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, will be added to the price of economy models sold under the Honda name, while the average price of its luxury Acura models will rise $187, or eight-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: A Tax on Gasoline? Better Get Used to It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Timid Stimulus Package" (editorial, Jan. 30) argues that President Clinton's plan of $15 billion to $20 billion in additional Federal spending is not sufficient to stimulate the economy and reverse "huge layoffs at I.B.M., Boeing, Sears and other corporate giants." 
 But a gradual increase in gasoline and other consumption or value added taxes for investment financing would stimulate the economy without igniting inflation and discouraging technological improvement. This measure, which can be considered as a hybrid of the Keynesian demand side (increase in investment spending) and the supply-side (increase in production) economics, would also reduce foreign trade deficits and make the dollar stronger.
Among the symbols of American life, "mom, apple pie and cheap gasoline," the third will have to be reconsidered by consumers.
In almost all other countries the price of gasoline is higher, up to $4.50 a gallon. Although such a tax would at first hurt the average family, it would in the long run help to reduce budget deficits, pollution, accidents and the dependence of the United States on foreign oil.

HEADLINE: Hopes for a New Boston Garden Dim With Political Quarreling

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
For years the Boston Garden has been a special symbol to Bostonians. Part shrine, as the home of their beloved basketball Celtics and hockey Bruins, it has also been a frustrating reminder of the petty politics and lack of civic leadership that have blocked repeated efforts to replace the grimy old Garden with a more modern arena that would have air-conditioning and seats with good views.
Last spring, when Boston's three largest banks agreed to lend $120 million to build a new Garden, salvation finally seemed at hand. The steel had been ordered and 700 construction workers, out of jobs for several years with New England's recession, were set to start work on March 1. 
 But late last week, on the very day the Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a bill giving state approval to the deal, the developer backed out, accusing the politicians of making unfair changes in the contract. The action by the developer, Jeremy M. Jacobs, the owner of the Delaware North Corporation of Buffalo, has thrown Boston into turmoil.
"This is a town where there are three pastimes: politics, sports and revenge," said Lawrence C. Moulter, the president of the New Boston Garden Corporation, which is owned by Delaware North.
"I think this a community that is dysfunctional," said Mr. Moulter, who has been working for years to put together a complex package that would allow a new arena to replace the outdated one, built in 1928. "We are saddled by the baggage of 300 years of decaying politics. It started with the Puritans, who made us feel that we have to beat ourselves to prove we are having a good time."
What caused the deal to collapse is a matter of bitter dispute. Mr. Moulter said the Legislature had demanded too many petty financial concessions. Legislators say Mr. Jacobs, his boss, tried to enrich himself by sneaking through changes in the construction plans for the new Garden, which will be in air rights over state-owned land. Businessmen familiar with the deal say strong egos and abrasive personalities on both sides played a role.
In the eyes of Mr. Moulter, and many others here, the collapse of the deal has raised a question about whether Boston really is a world-class city and whether a growing effort to make the city a site for the summer Olympics is just a foolish dream.
"There's a subculture of meanness, intolerance and pettiness, of putting down people instead of putting up people," said Paul G. Garrity, a former state judge.
"It's really an intolerance of people who are not only different from you in race, ethnicity and religion, but it's people who don't come from your neighborhood," said Mr. Garrity. "Jeremy Jacobs isn't from around here. He isn't a member of the Boston tribe."
The unraveling of the plan to build the new $190 million arena has also called into question the leadership of the state's two most powerful politicians, Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican, and the president of the Senate, William Bulger, a Democrat. Governor Weld has been frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996. A strong advocate of Delaware North's plan for the new Garden, he has nonetheless appeared powerless to get the Democratic-controlled Legislature to pass a bill that Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Moulter will accept.
Mr. Bulger, from the heavily Irish-American working-class section of South Boston, held up an earlier bill last December, before the previous session of the Legislature expired, arguing that it gave away too much state land and money to Delaware North. There may also be elements of a personal quarrel in the dispute between Mr. Bulger and Mr. Jacobs. In 1988, a former aide to Mr. Bulger who is one of his closest friends, Francis X. Joyce, suggested that Delaware North was connected to organized crime. Mr. Jacobs filed a libel suit and the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, a state agency headed by Mr. Joyce, paid $100,000 to Mr. Jacobs as a settlement.
In addition to the Boston Garden, Delaware North owns the Boston Bruins, food concessions in many sports arenas around the country, a greyhound parimutuel betting organization and was recently awarded the right to operate the concessions at Yosemite National Park.
Mr. Bulger could not be reached for comment. His office said he was in Hawaii attending a conference on health care.
But Joseph Brady, counsel to the State Senate, said Mr. Bulger had opposed the initial deal with Delaware North because the concern was violating a 1988 state law under which, in effect, the state permitted Delaware North to build the new Garden above a state-owned railroad station, South Station. Specifically, Mr. Brady said the developers' plans showed they would have built a ticket office and sports shop on property intended for the train station.
Mr. Brady also asserted that Delaware North's plan would have lowered the air space above the train tracks to 30 feet from 35 feet, making it impossible to use double-decker commuter trains. Mr. Brady said the developer also planned to build an office tower on the ground, instead of in the air above the station, further encroaching on state property.
Mr. Moulter, in turn, charged that it was the Legislature that was making changes in the original agreement. After Mr. Bulger killed the first bill in December, Mr. Moulter said, Mr. Jacobs made a number of financial concessions.
Then last week, Mr. Moulter said, after a final meeting with legislative leaders at which agreement was reached, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Thomas M. Finneran, a Democrat, called Mr. Moulter back in.
"They told me, 'There is one more thing you have to do,' " Mr. Moulter said. Mr. Finneran, he said, wanted the developer to kick in $3.5 million in so-called linkage payments, in which Delaware North would provide that amount to Boston area parks for ice skating.
That was when Mr. Jacobs decided to cancel the deal, Mr. Moulter said.
 
Effort to Rescue Deal
 Governor Weld has been trying this week to put a deal back together, and today he met with bankers and Mr. Moulter. One banker said the plan might still be saved. If it is not, the 700 construction jobs will be lost, the Celtics and Bruins may carry out threats of leaving Boston, and the state will be out $25 million worth of construction that Delaware North agreed to do as part of the new station.
Howie Carr, a columnist for The Boston Herald and a talk show host on WRKO radio, said the incident showed that "nothing's really changed" since the days of Mayor James Michael Curley, who presided with pomp over a Boston in economic decline during the first half of the century and eventually went to prison for corruption.

In San Antonio, Hyatt Defies U.S. Trend

BYLINE: By LETTICE STUART SAN ANTONIO

 BODY:
A Japanese-American group will open a 500-room Hyatt hotel here despite a depressed and overbuilt national hotel market in which new construction is at a near standstill.
The $100 million 200-acre Hyatt Regency Hill Country Resort is one of only a handful of major new hotels completed in the United States in the last 12 months and is the first to be built in Texas in five years. The opening is scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 24. 
 The project was developed by the Woodbine Development Corporation of Dallas and is owned by the Hyatt Corporation of Chicago, the Hunt Realty Corporation of Dallas, the Shimizu Land Corporation of New York, and the Kawasaki Steel Corporation of Tokyo. Financing was provided by the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
"In an industry where 'no new hotels' is a rule of thumb right now, this project certainly is an exception," said Robert J. Crawford Jr., president of Lodging Solutions Inc., a hotel consulting firm in Natick, Mass.
Mr. Crawford said the industry is suffering from the nationwide frenzy of hotel construction between 1984 and 1989 that left the country with 2.5 million hotel rooms and an average vacancy rate of 40 percent.
He estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the hotels in the country currently were unable to service their debt. More than 3,000 hotels have been taken back by lenders in the last three years, and another 2,000 are likely to follow in the next 24 months, he said.
Lenders, who are reselling these properties at 30 percent to 40 percent of replacement cost, may be forced to finance acquisitions, but capital for new construction is virtually nonexistent, Mr. Crawford said. He predicted it would be five or more years before the industry begins to recover.
But John Field Scovell, president of Woodbine Development, the developer for the Hyatt resort in San Antonio, is unfazed. "We think San Antonio is the best hotel market in the country right now," Mr. Scovell said.
Bruce H. Walker, president of Source Strategies Inc., a hotel consulting and market research company in San Antonio, said that the city's hotel revenues increased 13 percent in 1992, and that occupancy rates at the city's hotels, which have a total of 20,000 rooms, averaged nearly 75 percent. Mr. Walker believes the market will support an additional 5,000 rooms over the next three or four years.
The reason for his optimism is San Antonio's $2 billion annual tourism industry. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, San Antonio draws 11 million visitors a year and is the state's No. 1 tourist destination. The Alamo landmark in the heart of downtown is the leading attraction.
The growth of San Antonio's tourism business has been no accident. For years city officials and civic leaders have sought out and supported developments that bolstered tourism. In 1986, a $32 million expansion of the Henry E. Gonzalez Convention Center was completed, increasing total exhibit space to 240,000 square feet. In 1988, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation opened the $220 million Rivercenter Mall downtown on the San Antonio River. Sea World of Texas, a 250-acre aquatic theme park, opened the same year.
San Antonio's newest attraction is Fiesta Texas, a $100 million 200-acre musical theme park set in a limestone quarry and surrounded by 100-foot cliffs. The park, which opened in May, was developed by Opryland U.S.A. Inc. of Nashville and the United Services Automobile Association, better known as USAA, an insurance and financial services company in San Antonio. Fiesta Texas is expected to bring an additional $4 billion to the local economy during the next 15 years.
In addition, the 65,000-seat Alamodome Stadium is nearing completion and is scheduled to open in the spring.
The site for the Hyatt resort was carved out of a 2,700-acre cattle and agricultural ranch that lies within the city limits in the northwest section off State Highway 151. The resort consists of a 500-room hotel; an 18-hole golf course; tennis courts; a jogging path; a health club; and a four-acre water park with two swimming pools, a waterfall, an outdoor spa, sand beaches, gardens and a 1,000-foot river for navigating by inner tube.
The hotel's 27,000 square feet of meeting space includes a 5,700-square-foot ballroom aimed at attracting convention and group business. Designed by Hill Architects Inc. of San Francisco to reflect the region's typical architecture, the hotel's limestone facade is accented by wood-trimmed porches.
Room rates will range from $165 to $220 a night, according to Kenneth A. Pilgrim, the hotel's general manager.

HEADLINE: Bosnia Neighbors Nervously Seek Pacts

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SKOPJE, Macedonia, Feb. 17

 BODY:
A flurry of diplomatic activity has swept the Balkans in the last week as political leaders from this volatile area have taken steps to strengthen regional ties to prevent sparks from the Bosnian war from igniting nationalist conflicts that could engulf their countries.
In the first visit to independent Macedonia by an important head of state, President Turgut Ozal of Turkey today discussed military assistance to this former Yugoslav republic, which was left without a military when the Yugoslav Army withdrew last spring, taking with it even faucets from barracks sinks. 
 In the last week, the Balkan countries bordering the former Yugoslav republics have strung a web of friendship pacts and economic-cooperation agreements.
Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis clearly signaled over the weekend in Athens that Greece is angling for a compromise solution to its blockage of European Community recognition of Macedonia as an independent state.
 
'A Panic Setting In'
 "You're seeing a panic setting in in the Balkans that there may be a coming conflagration, and no one wants to be isolated and on the losing side," a Western diplomat said. "Neighbors are taking another hard look at each other. Everybody is trying to sign as many agreements as possible."
On Sunday, Romania and Greece signed an agreement on political and economic cooperation, including a pledge to refrain from using force to settle regional conflicts.
After a two-day visit to Albania by the Bulgarian President, Zhelyu Zhelev, the two countries signed a friendship accord on Sunday that calls for construction of a highway running from Black Sea coast of Bulgaria through Macedonia and on to the Albanian port of Durres.
Bulgaria and Greece agreed on Friday to strengthen relations and take steps to help prevent the Bosnian war from spreading to Macedonia, whose territory has been contested over the last century by all four of its neighbors.
 
Turkish-Romanian Accord
 Again last week, the Turkish Foreign Minister signed a political and economic agreement in Bucharest after two days of discussion of the Yugoslav war and other issues with the Romanians.
It is no surprise that much of the diplomacy is centered on Macedonia, the economically weakest component of the former Yugoslavia and the only one of its breakaway republics to be denied diplomatic recognition by the European Community and the United States.
In addition to concern that animosities between this country's majority Slavs and minority ethnic Albanians might explode, Macedonians fear that if major clashes break out between Serbs and the Albanian majority in Kosovo province in Serbia, the Albanians here will drag Macedonia into a war with Serbia that could ensnare Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey.
In a preventive measure last month, the United Nations deployed a multinational peacekeeping force here. And the United Nations Security Council is reportedly preparing a resolution recognizing Macedonia.
At the end of December, the United States warned Serbia not to take military action against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
 
Ozal's Balkan Tour
 Mr. Ozal's visit to Skopje is the second stop on a Balkan tour that began in Sofia, Bulgaria, and continues on Thursday in Tirana, Albania. Though it is billed as an effort to end the war in Bosnia, the trip is clearly intended to put Europe on notice that Ankara has a strong interest in Macedonia and other Balkan countries that emerged from the Ottoman Empire after the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913.
Turkey has been the most outspoken advocate of United Nations military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was an Ottoman province until 1908.
Slobodan Casule, a longtime Macedonian journalist who heads the national radio station, said: "The point of Ozal's visit is to establish a Turkish stronghold here and especially in Albania. This is Turkey's link with Europe, and the Turks are telling both Serbia and Greece 'hands off.' "
 
Athens Blocks Recognition
 Athens has blocked European Community recognition of this mountainous, land-locked country for more than a year, asserting that the very name Macedonia represents territorial pretensions on the Greek province of Macedonia.
Over the last year, Turkey has become Macedonia's most important trade partner. Turkish footwear, detergent and other goods are replacing merchandise from the former Yugoslav republics on Skopje's store shelves. Scores of Turkish-Macedonian companies have formed.
At a news conference today, Mr. Ozal repeated his assertion that Turkey is responsible for looking after the well-being of the Muslims in the Balkans.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: Impact on Individuals;
Middle Class and Wealthy To Bear Brunt of New Taxes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton's new tax plan reaches into the pockets of a broad swath of Americans, increasing income taxes on the rich, hitting the middle class with a new energy tax and raising taxes on Social Security benefits of the affluent.
For average Americans, the most visible change brought by the new plan will be higher prices for gasoline, electricity and heating fuel. Administration officials say the annual energy bill for a family with a taxable income of $60,000, currently around $3,000, will rise by $133. 
 With news of the energy tax angering many middle-income Americans, Administration officials strained today to assert that Mr. Clinton's tax plan would strike the rich far harder than the middle class.
They said that for households earning $250,000 a year, the new package would raise taxes from all sources by about $10,000. For households earning $80,000, taxes would go up by about $560 and for a family earning $45,000 taxes would rise about $225. For a family earning $25,000, taxes would remain essentially unchanged, inching up about $25.
 
Shift on Lower Incomes
 Administration officials said Americans with incomes of under $20,000 would be no worse off and would sometimes be better off despite the new energy tax. These low-income families, they said, would be helped by more generous food stamp benefits, larger subsidies to heat their homes, and increasing the earned-income tax credit.
On Tuesday, Administration officials had said the President's tax package would not increase taxes on Americans earning less than $30,000. But Treasury officials acknowledged today that under the plan, taxes for families with incomes of $20,000 to $30,000 would rise by one-tenth of 1 percent -- a figure they said was so low that it did not represent an increase.
Mr. Clinton proposed many other tax changes, including an increase in the top rate for estate taxes and prohibiting taxpayers from deducting the price of meals and real estate expenses when they move. Among the proposed tax measures are these:
 
Income Taxes
 Mr. Clinton would hit the rich hardest by increasing the top personal income tax rate to 36 percent from 31 percent for couples with adjusted gross incomes of $180,000 or more and single people with adjusted gross incomes of $140,000 or more. Income taxes for families earning less than $180,000 are to remain unchanged.
According to the Administration, this increase would hurt 1.2 percent of American households. Under the proposal, according to an example given by the Treasury Department, a family of four with an income of $275,000 would see its overall taxes jump by 11 percent or $8,969 to $90,537.
The plan also creates a 10 percent surtax on households with taxable incomes of $250,000 or more, which translates into adjusted gross incomes of $305,000 or more. This would raising their top tax rate to 39.6 percent.
For a family earning $500,000, taxes would jump by 22.4 percent, or $32,845, to $179,573. That would increase the effective tax rate to 35.9 percent from 29.3 percent.
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton said this tax would be a millionaires' surtax. In unveiling the surtax today, Administration officials responded to criticisms that the threshold for the tax had been lowered by asserting that 85 percent of households with taxable incomes of $250,000 or more had more than $1 million in assets.
These income tax increases are expected to raise $26.3 billion in the fiscal year 1997, according to Treasury estimates.
In another measure hitting the rich, the President proposed to eliminate limits on earnings subject to the 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax. Currently, the tax is applied only to the first $135,000 in earnings.
If Congress approves the increase in the top income-tax rate on the rich, there will be a wide differential between the top tax rate on income and the tax rate for capital gains. Mr. Clinton's plan would raise the highest income tax rate to 36 percent -- and 39.6 percent if the surtax is included -- while the capital gains tax rate remains at 28 percent.
That is a sharp change from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which set the top income tax rate and the capital gains rate at 28 percent with the goal of ending any preference between earned income and investment income. The 1990 budget deal raised the top income tax rate to 31 percent.
President Bush tried unsuccessfully to cut the capital gains rate to 15 percent, saying it would unleash a flood of investment. But now, with the top income tax rate expected to rise well above the capital gains rate, wealthy Americans may do precisely what the Democrats who opposed Mr. Bush's capital gains cut feared they would do: they might rush to find loopholes and shuffle assets to convert earned income into capital gains income to be taxed at the lower rate.
 
Social Security
 The Administration proposed taxing 85 percent of Social Security benefits for relatively well-off recipients; currently, 50 percent of benefits for people in this group are subject to taxes. The higher taxes will apply to couples with incomes of more than $32,000 and single individuals with incomes of more than $25,000.
According to Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, subjecting 85 percent of benefits to taxation would mean that for elderly households with incomes of more than $100,000, annual Social Security benefits would in effect drop $1,359 to $7,644. For households with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000, benefits would fall $843 to $7,904. A family with an income of $40,000 to $50,000 would see its benefits fall $378 to $8,113, and for households with incomes between $35,000 and $40,000, benefits would fall $82 to $8,305.
 
Earned Income Tax Credit
 In discussing the nation's economic troubles during the campaign, Mr. Clinton often noted that many families where one or both parents worked still lived under the poverty line. To remedy this, the Administration proposed today to increase the earned income tax credit, a Government subsidy that goes to low-income workers.
Under the proposal, a two-parent family earning $10,000 could receive a $2,400 credit, up from the current maximum of $1,998. Partly to offset the effects of the new energy tax, the ceiling for receiving some benefits under the credit would increase to $30,000, up from the current ceiling of $23,760.
The proposal called for creating such a credit for households without children. Under the plan, workers who earn less than $9,000 a year would get a 7.65 percent credit, giving them a maximum credit of $306. For workers whose incomes are so low that they owe no income taxes, the credit is refundable, and for low-income workers who pay taxes, their taxes are reduced by the amount of the credit.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Energy Plan;
Fuels Tax: Spreading The Burden

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton wants to add some new letters to the Government's tax-code alphabet soup: B.T.U.
His proposed broad-based energy tax would apply to the energy content of nearly all fuels, as measured by the British thermal unit, or B.T.U. -- the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. 
 When the tax is fully in force, the Treasury estimated, it would increase the $2,242 energy bill for a family of four earning $25,000 by $105.
 
Increase for Gasoline
 The new tax would raise the price of gasoline by 2.5 cents a gallon next year; in 1996 the tax would be 7.5 cents a gallon higher than it is now. With the average household using about 1,000 gallons of gasoline a year, that means an increase cost of about $25 the first year and $75 the third year .
Treasury officials said the energy tax would result in a 75-cent increase in the average home's monthly electricity bill, now $67, in the first year, and in a $2.25 increase in the third year.
Administration officials said they chose the new energy tax because it would encourage conservation, reduce pollution and not hurt any one region much more than others. Mr. Clinton selected it after criticizing a gasoline tax during the Presidential campaign on the ground that it would hit the middle class disproportionately. But many experts say that a broader energy tax would still hit the middle class harder than it hits the wealthy.
 
Sparing Renewable Energy
 The tax would not be imposed directly on consumers but on producers, refiners and transporters. It would then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
Administration officials propose to phase in the tax over three years, with the first third taking effect on July 1, 1994. The new tax would increase energy costs for the typical household by about 4.5 percent once it is fully phased in after July 1, 1996.
The new tax would increase the cost of gasoline, natural gas, home heating oil and electricity coming from coal, hydropower and nuclear power. But the tax would not apply to renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar power and geothermal power.
A specific amount of fuel would generally be taxed according to the B.T.U.'s it produces: for example, a tax of 25.7 cents for each million B.T.U.'s of coal and natural gas, 59.9 cents for each million B.T.U.'s of oil. The price of a million B.T.U's of natural gas varies by season, but is about $2. The same unit of heavy oil, the kind used in competition with gas and coal, is around $2.50. That unit of coal is around $1.50.
 
A Higher Tax on Oil
 Administration officials said they proposed to tax oil more because it pollutes more than natural gas and imposing a similar levy on both fuels would have raised the price of cleaner-burning natural gas far more proportionally than it would have raised the price of oil. The Administration proposed the same B.T.U. tax for coal and natural gas even though coal pollutes more; coal is far cheaper, so proportionally the tax would be higher.
The Administration also proposed to extend a 2.5-cent-a-gallon Federal gasoline tax that was scheduled to expire in 1995.
Industry officials today welcomed the news that the energy tax would not be placed on raw materials that are components of other products, like oil derivatives used to make plastics. But they said they were disappointed that the Administration did not plan to refund the energy taxes paid on exported goods, adding that the tax would make such goods less competitive abroad.
The Administration plans to collect $1.5 billion from this tax in the fiscal year 1994, $8.9 billion in 1995, $16.4 billion in 1996 and $22.3 billion in 1997.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: Impact on Business;
Some Businesses Face Tax Rise, but Most May Get Incentives

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
For American business, the Clinton Administration's economic plan holds a large array of new taxes and other proposals, including an increase in the corporate income-tax rate that would have the 2,700 largest corporations pay a maximum of 36 percent instead of the current 34 percent.
At the same time, businesses would be offered substantial incentives to invest in new equipment. Reflecting a general inclination by the Clinton team, small businesses, the main provider of new jobs, would be particularly favored. 
 Among other things, the plan would discourage corporate lobbying, further reduce the deduction for business meals and entertainment and deny corporations deductions for pay of more than $1 million a year to an individual unless tied to a still-to-be-defined standard of productivity.
The initiatives, some little discussed, are part of an overall strategy to insure continued economic recovery in the short term and to put both the economy and the Federal budget on sounder footing for the long term.
 
Corporate Income Tax
 Raising the corporate income tax will generate $30.6 billion from 1993 through 1998, according to Treasury estimates, while tax credits for businesses will cost the Government $28.9 billion.
The tax rate would be 36 percent for companies with taxable incomes of more than $10 million. Businesses in that group account for about one-tenth of 1 percent of American companies but the overwhelming majority of corporate tax payments. While companies could pay as much as 39 percent on some earnings, none would pay more than an average of 36 percent. Once a corporation earns $15 million, however, all of its profits would be taxed at the 36 percent rate.
 
Investment Tax Credits
 The plan provides two kinds of investment tax credits, depending on a company's size. Medium-sized and large companies would get a 7 percent credit for two years for buying new equipment, but not buildings, if that is a significant proportion of what they spent in an earlier base period.
They could choose either the three-year period of 1989 through 1991 or the five-year period of 1987 through 1991. In either case the new investment in the first year must be more than 70 percent of the base level, while investment in the second year must exceed 80 percent of the base level.
Companies with receipts of less than $5 million will receive a 7 percent credit for all investment for two years and then a permanent credit of 5 percent.
For any company, the credit could be applied to reducing liability under the alternative minimum tax, a tax paid by corporations or people whose deductions or tax-exempt income would otherwise leave them owing little or no tax. The credit could be used to offset up to 25 percent of the amount due, the Treasury said.
 
Capital Gains Tax Cut
 Small business would also have the benefit of a special cut in the capital gains tax, an idea pressed by Senator Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat who is a friend of President Clinton. In the Administration version, people investing in companies with capital of up to $25 million and holding the investments for at least five years, would be taxed on only half of their capital gains.
 
Securities Tax
 The Administration also seeks to require securities dealers to "mark to market" their inventories, reviving a Bush Administration proposal from last year to tax unsold securities. Under current law, dealers may choose between valuations based on the lower of their cost or the current market value in computing their taxable income and pay the tax only after the security is sold. The effect is to give the Government tax revenue from unsold securities if their value rises.
 
Energy Tax
 Corporate America would be subject to the Administration's proposed tax on energy, a levy based on the heat content of fuels as measured in British thermal units or B.T.U.'s. But to minimize damage in international competition, companies would not have to pay the tax on feedstocks, such as the oil that actually becomes part of a tire or plastic product.
There would be no rebate for energy used in goods that are exported.
 
Foreign Corporations
 Following up on another campaign theme, the Administration's package also has measures to obtain more taxes from foreign corporations by narrowing benefits and tightening enforcement.
One measure would require foreign companies to provide documents at the time goods are sold to subsidiaries in the United States to show whether the prices are reasonable, not artificial. Another measure would limit deductions for bank loans guaranteed by a parent corporation abroad, making it harder for foreign companies to reduce their profits by swelling the debt of their American operations.
The international operations of American companies would also come under closer scrutiny. One provision would increase the effective tax rate for oil companies. Another would end the indefinite deferral of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of American companies, taxing them at current rates once the earnings exceed 25 percent of the subsidiary's assets.
 
Miscellaneous
 The proposed $1 million limit on full deductions for corporate pay, a highly contentious issue, could be linked to profits or the corporate balance sheet but the Treasury said no decision on the benchmark seemed imminent. This was projected to raise $646 million over the six-year period, including a $19 million loss this fiscal year because executives accelerated income into late 1992.
Breaking new ground, the Administration also proposes, with some unspecified exceptions, to deny companies deductions for lobbying Congress or the executive branch. But this would not affect payments to trade associations, which are tax-exempt.
Deductions would no longer be allowed for meals and real estate expenses when workers move or club dues for employees. The deductibility of business meals and entertainment, cut in 1986 to 80 percent from 100 percent, would be further cut to 50 percent.
Picking up another idea that has received previous legislative scrutiny, the Administration proposed barring the buyers of failed thrift institutions from taking tax deductions for bad loans for which they were reimbursed by Federal insurance.
The credit for wages paid Puerto Rican workers, now 100 percent, would be reduced to 65 percent. This would produce a $7 billion gain to the Treasury over six years.
Still other measures in the Clinton plan would permanently extend a credit for research and experimentation that expired in 1992 and lift the ceiling on the amount of bonds that could be sold to finance high-speed rail lines.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Campaign;
Gambling That a Tax-Cut Promise Was Not Taken Seriously

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
In selling his economic plan, President Clinton is gambling that voters never took seriously his campaign promise to lower the tax burden of the middle class and will respond favorably to an aggressive pitch based on equal measures of hope, fear and class revenge.
After months of polling and research, Mr. Clinton's top political advisers say they are convinced that middle-class voters will support higher taxes. The advisers say the voters will see the new taxes as the price of great improvements in Government service and as inflicting a just punishment on the rich who profited during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. 
 There is a lot of evidence in recent polls to support these hopes, but they rest on a risky political premise: the assumption that middle-class voters will forgive Mr. Clinton his broken promise of tax relief or will accept the contention that he did not unconditionally promise such relief.
"Voters never believed in the middle-class tax cut, because they have never seen anyone get a tax cut," said Mr. Clinton's chief poll taker, Stanley Greenberg. "They always believed their taxes would go up whether Bill Clinton became President or George Bush was President.
"They voted for Bill Clinton because they believed he was going to submit a program to change the direction of the country, to improve the economy and to create jobs. They will be mad as hell if their taxes go up and there's no genuine commitment to change. But if there is, they will be willing to contribute."
"It is critical," Mr. Greenberg said, that the rich be seen as punished most by Mr. Clinton's tax increases.
 
'A Very Big Signal'
 "This says to voters that this is a President who is not a captive of the wealthiest people but who is instead responsive to the middle class," Mr. Greenberg said. "That is a critical issue. Since they are not going to see the results of economic growth for a long time, it is critical that you send them a very big signal about whose interests are being advanced."
The first challenge in selling Mr. Clinton's plan to raise taxes on the middle class would seem to be overcoming the voluble history of his many specific promises to the contrary.
As candidate, Mr. Clinton promised to offer tax relief to families with incomes of less than $80,000 a year. He said he would raise taxes on only "the wealthiest 2 percent," those with incomes above $200,000 a year, and impose a surtax of 10 percent on those with annual incomes of more than $1 million.
He said that over four years he would squeeze an additional $45 billion out of foreign corporations doing business in the United States. He dismissed as an outrageous falsehood the Republican assertions that his spending programs would mean additional taxes on families making as little as $30,000 a year.
Now, Mr. Clinton proposes to increase income taxes to 36 percent from 31 percent on couples who have taxable income of more than $140,00 a year and on unmarried individuals with taxable income of more than $115,000.
And the "millionaire's surtax" would be imposed on households with taxable income of more than $250,000 a year. As tax experts predicted, the amount expected to be gained from foreign corporations will be only a few billion dollars. And virtually every family making less than $30,000 a year would not bear the costs of the higher taxes.
 
'He Never Said It'
 In interviews on Tuesday, James Carville and Paul Begala, Mr. Clinton's chief political advisers, outlined what would be the central arguments against accusations of political betrayal.
"The first defense is that he never said it," Mr. Carville said. "Clinton never made a George Bush-style read-my-lips pledge. He said that that would be irresponsible to do."
Further, Mr. Begala and Mr. Greenberg said their polls and focus group sessions showed that voters accepted the argument that Mr. Clinton had promised only that he would not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the new Government programs he would propose. They said the research also showed that voters believed Mr. Clinton when he said he had been forced to reluctantly accept middle-class tax increases when he found out, after the election, that the budget deficit was worse than he had thought.
But Republicans, and others, can be expected to point out just how many examples of disparity there are between Mr. Clinton the campaigner and Mr. Clinton the President.
It is true that, beginning about a month before Election Day, Mr. Clinton took care to say he was not making a read-my-lips pledge on middle-class taxes. He was making the more narrow pledge that he would not raise taxes to pay for his new spending programs. But the overall thrust of what he promised ran in the opposite direction.
Mr. Clinton introduced the promise of a tax cut for the middle class in a speech in November 1991 at Georgetown University. "I will offer middle-income tax cuts," he said. "The average working family's tax bill will go down about 10 percent, a savings of about $300 a year, and I won't finance it with increasing the deficit."
As late as 10 days before the election, Mr. Clinton was still promising a tax cut for families making less than $80,000. On Oct. 24, a reporter asked him if it was true, as advisers were saying, that he might postpone the middle-class tax cut for a year if elected, in the light of gloomy economic projections. "Absolutely not," Mr. Clinton said. "I make the economic decisions in this Administration."
 
The Critical Question
 The question of whether the difference between Mr. Clinton's campaign proposals and what he is now proposing is regarded by voters as "a threshold issue," as Mr. Begala put it, that Mr. Clinton must successfully answer to gain acceptance of his plan.
He is doing so successfully right now, Mr. Begala said, adding: "The research is clear on that. Now, to keep things going in the right direction, we have to have the debate focus on two points of view: One, 'I don't want to pay more in taxes because I don't want Bill Clinton's changes.' Or two, 'I am willing to pay more, but he better come through with real changes.' "
To this end, the campaign will play off voters' fears that the nation has reached a crisis point, which, unaddressed, could lead to disaster.
"What I'm trying to get people to focus on is the thought: If you don't do this now, think of what the country will look like in five years," Mr. Carville said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Spending Cuts;
A Wide Swath, on Earth and in the Sky

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton's economic plan proposes making $253 billion in spending cuts over four years by eliminating some programs and cutting back others, including a plan to scale back the $30 billion space station to eliminate cost overruns.
The plan he presented to Congress would also cut benefits for retirees, veterans and the poor by $91 billion over four years and impose or raise fees on many Government services. 
 As part of an effort to convince Americans who would pay higher taxes that his plan to reduce the deficit would be fair, $8.3 billion of the savings would be accomplished by freezing Federal workers' pay for one year and reducing future scheduled raises.
 
Earlier Presidents
 "I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know," Mr. Clinton said tonight. "And that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been."
Mr. Clinton is not the first President to demonstrate his commitment to fiscal austerity by proposing pain for Federal workers. Two months before Election Day last year, President George Bush suggested cutting the pay of Federal officials earning more than $75,000 a year by 5 percent.
Mr. Clinton's plan would reduce military spending by $76 billion and non-military expenditures by $54 billion over four years, cutting a swath through a bewildering array of specified programs. They range from the elimination of special extension grants at the Department of Agriculture to freezing financing for the Appalachian Regional Commission.
 
Wool and Mohair
 One spending cut that would save $212 million in the Department of Agriculture would limit payments to farmers who provide wool and mohair. That subsidy, Administration officials said, was designed to protect the supply of materials for soldiers' uniforms and was carried out in World War I.
A review of the proposed cutbacks follows:
 
Agriculture
 The Administration proposes to save $374 million by reducing loan subsidies under the Rural Electrification Administration, which Mr. Clinton championed as Governor of Arkansas.
 
Commerce
 By eliminating trade adjustment assistance and terminating demonstration programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the department would save $250 million over four years.
 
Corps of Engineers
 Some $235 million would be saved by reducing construction financing for low-priority water projects.
 
Defense
 The Pentagon would cut $60 billion beyond what President George Bush had proposed through 1997, mainly by paring an additional 200,000 troops and greatly reducing spending on the Star Wars anti-missile defenses. An additional $18 billion in savings would be made through a pay freeze next year and smaller-than-expected salary increases through 1997.
 
Energy
 Money for the superconducting supercollider project would be stretched out over four years instead of being allocated immediately.
 
Environment
 The Administration proposes to save $4.1 billion by phasing out waste-water treatment grants that were to expire.
Health Care
 New limits would be placed on eligibility for benefits under Medicaid at a projected savings of $4.5 billion. User fees for the Federal Drug Administration would be increased, at a savings of about $1 billion over four years.
 
Housing
 The budget would cut $565 million in special-purpose grants by 1998. These pet projects have been derided as Congressional "pork barrel" spending and were also singled out during the Bush Administration. But Congress restored the cuts. Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros outlined cuts that would produce an annual savings of $1.5 billion over four years.
 
Justice
 Spending on prison construction would be reduced by $331 million.
 
Interior
 Low-priority water projects would be eliminated, saving $163 million.
Space Agency
 The space station would be restructured and stripped of much of the money that had been set aside for its development over the next four years. An Administration official said that the station was being redesigned to avoid cost overruns and that the savings had been redirected to other projects.
Transportation
 Low-priority projects would be eliminated at a savings of $1.3 billion, Coast Guard pay would be reduced, and fees would be increased on general-aviation aircraft and tonnage.
Veterans' Benefits
 Fees for housing loans, now free, would be set at 2 percent, and veterans would pay part of their G.I. Bill benefits, a policy change that would raise about $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Australia Campaign Takes an American Tone

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Feb. 17

 BODY:
When Prime Minister Paul Keating and John R. Hewson, his opponent in the national election on March 13, met for their first television debate last Sunday, Channel 9 viewers here were startled to see a squiggly white line inching across the screen as each candidate spoke.
Called "the electronic worm" by the press, the line was a graphic rendering of the audience's reaction to the debate. Each of the 128 audience members controlled a dial registering everything from total disapproval to complete agreement. 
 When Mr. Keating praised his and the Labor Party's record, for example, the worm crept downward on the screen. When he attacked Mr. Hewson and the Liberal Party, the line started up again. After a Kennedyesque peroration by Mr. Hewson about how "our limit should be the extent of our dreams," the worm soared. A dull bit about the 2000 Olympics sent it plunging again.
The instant-response gadget is used regularly by market researchers to test new products. It is not often used in politics in Australia, but then neither the Prime Minister nor Mr. Hewson are new products.
Mr. Keating has been Prime Minister since the end of 1991 when he ousted former Prime Minister Bob Hawke in a Labor Party coup.
In the 1980's Mr. Keating was Mr. Hawke's Treasury Minister. Under Mr. Keating, the economy has declined precipitously and unemployment climbed to a post-World War II high of 11.4 percent last November. Currently it is about 11.3 percent.
Mr. Hewson, a former economics professor, heads a right-of-center coalition that wants more decentralization and an unpopular goods and services tax. Mr. Keating, who now campaigns strenuously against the tax, proposed a similar levy when he headed the Treasury in the mid-1980's -- as Mr. Hewson delights in pointing out.
The electronic worm gave Mr. Keating a slight edge in the debate but opinion polls in the next few days gave Mr. Hewson the win. Mr. Keating appears to have learned that attacking his opponent garnered more points than advancing his own agenda. In recent appearances he's concentrated on slashing attacks on Mr. Hewson.
Recent Liberal victories in two states have done little to enhance Labor's image. Victoria ousted its Labor government last year; Western Australia did the same this month. Exit polls indicated that many voters in Western Australia had been influenced by the United States elections and had also decided it was time for a change after 10 years of Labor rule.
While the first debate gave neither candidate a significant advantage, it did manage to divert attention from several issues both sides could do without.
In the months before an election date was declared, prominent issues were Mr. Keating's shares in a pig farm and Mr. Hewson's exceptionally low taxes. Both turned out to be completely legal.

 Then there was the Speaker's bike accident. In 1990, Leo McLeay, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, fell off a bike he had borrowed from the Parliament gymnasium in the capital, Canberra. He suffered a broken arm and filed a claim for damages from the Government. In a brief time he received about $45,000 in compensation funds.
When the story broke recently, Mr. McLeay, a political crony of the Prime Minister, tried to face down his critics. But when he became the butt of cartoons and jokes, party leaders pressed him to resign, which he did last week.
Within what seemed like hours after the election date of March 13 was announced, the opposition coalition began broadcasting a television commercial showing unsuspecting citizens caught in the cross-hairs of a rifle telescope. The voice-over said many Australians were "looking down the barrel of unemployment," adding: "No one is safe. Labor must go."
Mr. Keating said the commercial recalled American campaign techniques. Mr. Hewson said: "People are scared stiff. We make absolutely no apologies."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Speech;
Text of the President's Address to a Joint Session of Congress

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's economic address to a joint session of Congress last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the House and the Senate, distinguished Americans here as visitors in this chamber -- as am I -- it is nice to have a fresh excuse for giving a long speech. 
 When Presidents speak to the Congress and the nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range and challenges and opportunities that face the United States. But this is not an ordinary time, and for all the many tasks that require our attention, I believe tonight one calls on us to focus, to unite and to act, and that is our economy. For more than anything else, our task tonight as Americans is to make our economy thrive again. Let me begin by saying that it has been too long -- at least three decades -- since a President has come and challenged Americans to join him on a great national journey, not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow.
Like individuals, nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves -- how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live, and, later, how they wish to be judged by history. Like every individual man and woman, nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them.
We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. And at this historic moment, as Communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have called for change -- and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them.
Our nation needs a new direction. Tonight, I present to you a comprehensive plan to set our nation on that new course.
I believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work, to family and to faith. We must now break the old habits of both political parties and say that there can be no more something for nothing, and admit frankly that we are all in this together.
The conditions which brought us as a nation to this point are well known. Two decades of low productivity growth and stagnant wages; persistent unemployment and underemployment; years of huge Government deficits and declining investment in our future; exploding health care costs and lack of coverage for millions of Americans; legions of poor children; education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough global economy. For too long we drifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community, and our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups, by partisan bickering and by the sheer complexity of our problems.
I believe we can do better, because we remain the greatest nation on earth, the world's strongest economy, the world's only military superpower. If we have the vision, the will and the heart to make the changes we must, we can still enter the 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined, and enter it having secured the American dream for ourselves and for future generations.
I well remember -- I well remember twelve years ago President Reagan stood at this very podium and told you and the American people that if our national debt were stacked in thousand dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. Well, today, that stack would reach 267 miles.
I tell you this not to assign blame for this problem. There is plenty of blame to go around -- in both branches of the Government and both parties. The time has come for the blame to end. I did not seek this office to place blame. I come here tonight to accept responsibility and I want you to accept responsibility with me and if we do right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it.
 
Elements of Plan
 The plan I offer you has four fundamental components:
First, it shifts our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment initially by jump-starting the economy in the short term and investing in our people, their jobs and their incomes over the long run.
Second, it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present, by honoring work and families in every part of our public decision-making.
Third, it substantially reduces the Federal deficit, honestly and credibly, by using in the beginning the most conservative estimates of Government revenues, not as the Executive Branch has done so often in the past, using the most optimistic ones.
And finally, it seeks to earn the trust of the American people by paying for these plans first with cuts in Government waste and efficiency, second with cuts, not gimmicks, in Government spending, and by fairness, for a change, in the way additional burdens are borne.
Tonight, I want to talk with you about what government can do, because I believe government must do more. But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector. And second that each of us must be an engine of growth and change. The truth is that as government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in turn.
Our immediate priority must be to create jobs -- create jobs now. Some people say well we're in a recovery and we don't have to do that. Well, we all hope we're in a recovery. But we're sure not creating new jobs. And there's no recovery worth its salt that doesn't put the American people back to work.
To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments over $30 billion to put people to work now to create a half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities and spread hope and opportunity among our nation's youth. Especially I want to emphasize after the events of last year in Los Angeles and the countless stories of despair in our cities and in our poor rural communities, this proposal will create almost 700,000 new summer jobs for displaced unemployed young people alone this summer. And tonight I invite America's business leaders to join us in this effort so that together we can provide over one million summer jobs in cities and poor rural areas for our young people.
Second, our plan looks beyond today's business cycle, because our aspirations extend into the next century. The heart of this plan deals with the long term. It is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future. And it has a deficit reduction program that will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest, will lower interest rates, will decrease the percentage of the Federal budget claimed by interest payments, and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that could adversely affect our economy.
Over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs and an improved economic competitive position in the world.
 
What Must Be Done
 In order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction -- something no American Government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before, spending must be cut and taxes must be raised. Spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes, and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment. The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most.
Our plan is designed, furthermore, and perhaps in some ways most important, to improve the health of American business through lower interest rates, more incentives to invest and better-trained workers.
Because small business has created such a high percentage of all the jobs in our nation over the last 10 or 15 years, our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history. We propose -- we propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country with revenues of under $5 million. That's about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40 percent of the work force but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade. And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks. We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time, and we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper.
With a new network of community development banks, and one billion dollars to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from South Boston to South Texas to South-Central Los Angeles.
This plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems; in high-speed railways and high-tech information systems; and it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future.
Standing as we are on the edge of the new century, we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade. And so we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade, including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment.
At the same time -- and I say this to you in both parties and across America tonight, all the people who are listening, it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement. The world is changing so fast that we must have aggressive targeted attempts to create the high-wage jobs of the future; that's what all our competitors are doing. We must give special attention to those critical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century but that are in trouble in America today like aerospace. We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations.
And I say we must do this together. I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and labor and government work together for a change.
 
Focus on Health Care
 But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail -- let me say this again -- I feel so strongly about this. All of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take, this year, not next year, not five years from now, but this year, bold steps to reform our health care system.
In 1992 we spent 14 percent of our income on health care, more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world, and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health-care benefits to all of its citizens. Unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health-care costs. By the year 2000, almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care. Our families will never be secure; our businesses will never be strong and our Government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health-care crisis. We must do it this year.
The combination of the rising costs of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the the very lives of millions of our people, and they are weakening our economy every day. Reducing health-care costs can liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment in growth and jobs. Bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give and any spending program we could promote. Reforming health care over the long run is critically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding investment in America.
Later this spring, after the First Lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health-care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families, so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either.
We'll have to -- we'll have to root out fraud and overcharges, and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor. We'll have to maintain the highest American standards and the right to choose in a system that is the world's finest for all those who can access it. But first we must make choices. We must choose to give the American people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more Americans into agony.
Let me further say that I want to work with all of you on this. I realize this is a complicated issue. But we must address it. And I believe if there is any chance that Republicans and Democrats will disagree on taxes and spending or anything else, they'd agree on one thing -- surely we can all look at these numbers and go home and tell our people the truth: We cannot continue these spending patterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less every year. We can do better.
 
Children and Education
 Perhaps the most fundamental change in the new direction I propose offers as its focus on the future and its investment which I seek in our children. Each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost. Half of the 2-year-olds in this country today don't receive the immunizations they need against deadly diseases. Our plan will provide them for every eligible child and we know now that we will save $10 later for every $1 we spend by eliminating preventable childhood diseases -- that's a good investment no matter how you measure it.
I recommend that the Women, Infants and Children's nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it. We all know that Head Start, a program that prepares children for school, is a success story. We all know that it saves money, but today it just reaches barely over a third of all the eligible children. Under this plan, every eligible child will be able to get a head start.
This is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. For every dollar we invest today we'll save three tomorrow. We have to start thinking about tomorrow. I've heard that somewhere.
We have to ask more in our schools of our students, our teachers, our principals, our parents. Yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in learning. Money alone is not enough. We have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools.
We have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy. So we have to establish a partnership between businesses and education, the Government, for apprenticeship programs in every state in this country to give our people the skills they need.
 Lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers, too, throughout their career. The average 18-year-old today will change jobs seven times in a lifetime.
We have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too fractured. We must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined worker-training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them. We have got to do better than that.
Finally, I propose a program that got a great response from the American people all across this country last year, a program of national service to make college loans available to all Americans; and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country -- as teachers or police officers or community service workers. To give them the option to pay the loans back, but at tax time, so they can't beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their talents.
A generation ago, when President Kennedy proposed and the United States Congress embraced the Peace Corps, it defined the character of a whole generation of Americans committed to serving people around the world. In this national service program we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever served in the Peace Corps.
This program could do for this generation of members of Congress what the Land Grant College Act did and what the G.I. Bill did for former congressmen. In the future, historians who got their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for giving America a new lease on life, if you meet the challenge.
If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work. If we believe in restoring the values that make America special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work and there must be dignity for all workers.
For those who care for our sick and tend our children who do our most difficult and tiring jobs, the new direction I propose will make this solemn simple commitment. By expanding the refundable earned income tax credit we will make history, we will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.
 
Welfare and Families
 Later this year we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it. I have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade and I know from personal conversations with many people, that no one ---- no one wants to change the welfare system as badly as those who are trapped in it. I want to offer the people on welfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need to get back on their feet, but say after two years they must get back to work, too, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary. We have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity.
Our next great goal should be to strengthen our families. I compliment the Congress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step, but it is time to do more. This plan will give this country the toughest child-support enforcement system it has ever had. It is time to demand that people take responsibility for the children they bring in this world.
And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which tears our communities apart. We must pass a tough crime bill.
I support not only the bill which didn't quite make it to the President's desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, to provide boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders for more space for the hardened criminals in jail. And I support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
Let me say this, if ---- I will make you this bargain: If you will pass the Brady Bill, I'll sure sign it.
Let me say now, we should move to the harder parts. I think it is clear to every American, including every member of Congress and both parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in Washington is not high. We must restore it. We must begin again to make Government work for ordinary taxpayers, not simply for organized interest groups and that beginning must start with real political reform.
I am ---- I am asking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year. I ask you to increase the participation of the American people by passing the motor-voter bill promptly. I ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deduction for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill.
Believe me, they were cheering that last section at home. I believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for Republicans and Democrats alike, because it says to the voters back home: "This is your House, this is your Senate; we're your hired hands, and every penny we draw is your money."
Next, to revolutionize Government we have to insure that we live within our means, and that should start at the top and with the White House. In the last few days I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million. I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments; I have cut the Federal bureaucracy -- or will over the next four years -- by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion.
It's ---- it is time for Government to demonstrate in the condition we're in that we can be as frugal as any household in America, and that's why I also want to congratulate the Congress. I noticed the announcement of the leadership today that Congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs. I think that is important; I think it will send a very clear signal to the American people.
But if we really want to cut spending we're going to have to do more and some of it will be difficult. Tonight I call for an across-the-board freeze in Federal Government salaries for one year. And ---- and thereafter during this four-year period I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost-of-living allowance normally involved in Federal pay increases.
Next, I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know, and that all those who say we should cut more, be as specific as I have been.
Finally let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut Government -- we have to rethink the whole way it works. When I became President, I was amazed at just the way the White House worked in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay: outmoded ways that didn't take maximum advantage of technology and didn't do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers money.
So I want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every Government department. I want to push education reform, as I said, not just to spend more money but to really improve learning. Some things work and some things don't. We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don't.
I'd like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyers.
In the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans, we must use Federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions -- but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch, to stop people from making sensible loans.
I'd like for us to not only have welfare reform, but to re-examine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs. In the end, we want people not to need us anymore. I think that's important.
 
On the Deficit
 But in the end, we have to get back to the deficit. For years there's been a lot of talk about it, but very few credible efforts to deal with it. And now I understand why, having dealt with the real numbers for four weeks. But I believe this plan does -- it tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term. It puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest changes in Federal priorities from consumption to investment in the history of this country, at the same time, over the next four years.
Let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as I go around the country, and who've asked it in the past. We're not cutting the deficit just because experts say it's the thing to do, or because it has some intrinsic merit. We have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and education and the future of this country.
And the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business. That's why we've got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to be engaged in.
We cut the deficit so that our children will be able to buy a home, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers, so that our Government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation.
If we don't act now, you and I might not even recognize this Government 10 years from now. If we just stay with the same trends of the last four years, at the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product, and paying interest on that debt will be the costliest Government program of all.
We'll still be the world's largest debtor and when members of Congress come here, they'll be devoting over 20 cents on the dollar to interest payments, more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlements. And you will come here and deliberate and argue over six or seven cents on the dollar, no matter what America's problems are. We will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must and we'll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment.
This budget plan by contrast will, by 1997, cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction using the independent numbers of the Congressional budget office.
Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous Presidencies.
I did this -- I did this -- I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers. I did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this difficulty. I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we're likely to get, if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it'll turn out better for the American people than we say in the last 12 years, because there were difference over the revenue estimates.
You and I know that both parties were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility. This is tightening the rein on the Democrats as well as the Republicans. Let's at least argue about the same set of numbers, so the American people will think we're shooting straight with them.
 
Cutting the Budget
 As I said earlier, my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions to cut the Federal spending by a total of $246 billion. We are eliminating programs that are no longer needed such as nuclear power research and development, we're slashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects, but many of these programs were justified in their time and a lot of them are difficult for me to recommend reductions in. Some really tough ones for me personally.
I recommend that we reduce interest subsidies to the Rural Electric Administration -- that's a difficult thing for me to recommend. But I think that I cannot exempt the things that are ---- exist in my state or in my experience if I ask you to deal with things that are difficult for you to deal with. We're going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental abiding interest of the American people.
I have to say that we all know our Government has been just great at building programs; the time has come to show the American people that we can limit them, too, that we can not only start things but we can actually stop things.
About the defense budget, I raise a hope and a caution. As we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post-cold war world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. And we may all doubt what that range of reduction is, but let me say that as long as I am President, I will do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the American flag will remain the best-trained, the best-prepared, the best-equipped fighting force in the world. And every one of you should make that solemn pledge.
We still have responsibilities around the world, we are the world's only superpower and this is still a dangerous and uncertain time and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interests and needs.
Backed by an effective national defense and a stronger economy, our nation will be prepared to lead a world challenged, as it is everywhere, by ethnic conflict, by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, by the global democratic revolution and by challenges to the health of our global environment.
 
Raising Taxes
 I know this economic plan is ambitious but I honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the United States. And I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting Government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past and by asking more Americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow. For the wealthiest, those earning more than $180,000 per year, I ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for Federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent.
We recommend a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year and we recommend closing some loopholes that let some people get away without paying any tax at all.
For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a rate raise in the corporate tax rate, also in the 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses.
Our plan seeks to attack tax subsidies that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas, than for staying here and reinvesting in America.
I say that as someone who believes an American company should be free to invest around the world and as a former Governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my state, but the tax code should not express a preference to American companies for moving somewhere else and it does in particular cases today.
 We will seek to insure that through effective tax enforcement, foreign corporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that American companies make on the same income.
To middle-class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution tonight, I will say again as I did on Monday night: You're not going alone anymore. You're certainly not going first and you're not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past.
I want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of America's families will have no increase in their income tax rates. Only 1.2 percent at the top.
 
Limiting Medicare
 Let me be clear: There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare. As we move toward the fourth year with the explosion in health-care costs, as I said, projected to account for 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000, there must be planned cuts in payments to providers -- the doctors, the hospitals, the labs -- as a way of controlling health-care costs. But I see these only as a stop-gap until we can reform the entire health-care system. If you'll help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care.
Let me repeat this, because I know it matters to a lot of you on both sides of the aisle: This plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in Medicare benefits for any beneficiary.
Secondly, the only change we are making in Social Security is one that has already been publicized: the plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes, who do not rely solely on Social Security to get by, to contribute more. This plan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay taxes on Social Security now. Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now will not be affected by this plan.
Our plan does include a broad-base tax on energy. And I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it's a good idea.
I recommend that we adopt a B.T.U. tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit, because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence economically of this country, as well as helping to reduce the debt.
And because it does not discriminate against any area. Unlike a carbon tax, it's not too hard on the coal states. Unlike a gas tax, it's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work. Unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up.
And it is environmentally responsible. It will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit.
Taken together, these measures will cost an American family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. It will cost American families with incomes under $30,000 nothing, because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned income tax credit.
Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things we will see the continuation of what's happened just since the election. Just since the election, since the Secretary of the Treasury, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and others who begin to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan interest rates have continued to fall long-term.
That means that for the middle class who will pay something more each month, if they have any credit needs or demands, their increased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards. This can be a wise investment for them and their country now.
I would also point out what the American people already know and that is because we're a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. We will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country and these will be spread fairly with real attempts to make sure that no cost is imposed on families with incomes under $30,000 and that the costs are very modest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes trigger in.
 
Dangers of Inaction
 Now I ask all of you to consider this: whatever you think of the tax program, whatever you think of the spending cuts -- consider the cost of not changing. Remember the numbers that you all know.
If we just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade we'll have a $650 billion a year deficit. We just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year -- twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe. We just keep on doing what we're doing, over 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt.
Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years of stagnation interrupted by occasional recession, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in income, to more debt, to more disappointment. Worse less, unless we change, unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both jobs and incomes, we will be condemning our children and our children's children to a lesser life than we enjoy.
Once Americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years. At present productivity rates it will take a hundred years to double living standards, until our grandchildren's grandchildren are born. I say that is too long to wait.
Tonight the American people know we have to change. They're also likely to ask me tomorrow, and all of you in the weeks and months ahead, whether we have the fortitude to make changes happen in the right way. They know that as soon as I leave this chamber and you go home, various interest groups will be out in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan and that the forces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to do this but we just can't do it.
Our people will be watching and wondering, not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue, but just to see whether this is going to be business as usual or a real new day, whether we're all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we're working for them. We must scale the walls of the people's skepticism, not with our words but with our deeds.
After so many years of gridlock and indecisions, after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising results, the American people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of us if we fail to seize this moment. This economic plan can't please everybody. If the package is picked apart, there'll be something that will anger each of us, won't please anybody. But if it is taken as a whole, it will help all of us.
So I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't made and nobody likes the tax increases. But let's just face facts: for 20 years, through Administrations of both parties, incomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it should. We cannot deny the reality of our condition. We have got to play the hand we were dealt and play it as best we can.
My fellow Americans, the test of this plan cannot be what is in it for me. It has got to be what is in it for us.
If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinventing our Government, we can lift our country's fortunes again.
Tonight I ask everyone in this chamber and every American to look simply into your own heart, to spark your own hopes, to fire your own imagination.
There's so much good, so much possibility, so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress.
This must be America's new direction. Let us summon the courage to seize it.
Thank you. God bless America.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: Health Care;
Putting Limits on Growth of Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton proposed tight new restraints on Federal payments to doctors and hospitals tonight in order to save $60 billion in Medicare and Medicaid over the next five years. And to raise money for the Medicare program, he asked Congress to increase the payroll tax on people earning more than $135,000 a year.
In proposing to slow the growth of the two big health programs, Administration officials said they had made every effort to protect elderly people and the poor. But groups representing the elderly expressed concern that the proposed cuts in payments would make doctors less willing to take Medicare patients. Doctors are not required to take Medicare patients. 
 Proposals to trim Medicare invariably generate fierce debate. Dr. Raymond Scalettar, chairman of the American Medical Association, said the Government was breaking an agreement made with doctors in 1989, when Congress established a Medicare fee schedule for doctors. "Physicians have lived up to their end of the bargain," he said, but the Clinton Administration is proposing to cut doctors' reimbursement anyway.
Martha A. McSteen, who lobbies for the elderly as president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said: "Arbitrary cuts in Medicare do not get at the root causes of soaring health-care costs. Continued cuts will only undermine the quality of and access to health care."
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Leon E. Panetta, the President's budget director, said today that the proposals were the first of many intended to bring soaring health costs under control. Administration officials say future proposals will try to limit the cost of health care for private patients outside the Medicare programs.
Nothing in the proposals would prohibit doctors and hospitals from increasing charges to patients with private insurance to offset the loss of income from Medicare. But Federal officials said they hoped that would not happen.
To shore up the Medicare trust fund and reduce the Federal budget deficit, Mr. Clinton wants to extend the Medicare payroll tax. Under current law, the employer and employee each pay a Medicare tax of 1.45 percent on income up to $135,000. Mr. Clinton wants to remove that limit.
For a person earning $200,000 a year, for example, this change would mean a tax increase of $942. There would be an equal tax increase for the employer. Many economists maintain that, in practice, the employee ultimately pays the employer's share, as well as the employee's share of the payroll tax.
The Treasury estimates that the Medicare tax increase would raise $2.8 billion next year and $29 billion from 1994 through 1998.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposals, Medicare and Medicaid spending, for the elderly and the poor, would still grow. But the increases would be slower than under current law.
Tables issued by the Office of Management and Budget, as part of the President's budget request today, show that the Administration expects to save $60 billion in Medicare and Medicaid over the next five years.
The Department of Health and Human Services estimated that the savings would be even higher: $62.6 billion over five years. It said 16 percent of that amount, or $10 billion, would come from beneficiaries, mainly through higher premiums. About 38 percent of the savings, or $24 billion, would come from hospitals, especially teaching hospitals, which would lose some of the special payments they now get for the costs of medical education.
Medicare expects to save $8 billion by limiting or reducing payments to doctors, especially surgeons and other medical specialists. The remainder would come from limiting payments to laboratories and other health-care providers.
In his address to Congress tonight, Mr. Clinton said, "This plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in Medicare benefits for any beneficiary."
Instead, he said: "There must be planned cuts in payments to providers -- to doctors, to hospitals, to labs -- as a way of controlling health-care costs. But I see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health-care system. If you will help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care."
After protests from the elderly, Mr. Clinton decided not to propose a sharp increase in Medicare premiums for recipients with high incomes.
In his budget request, Mr. Clinton did propose increasing Medicare premiums for all beneficiaries to levels slightly higher than envisioned under current law. The premium, now $36.60 a month, is scheduled under the law to rise to $41.10 in 1994 and $46.10 in 1995. Federal officials were unable to specify the proposed new levels.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, family doctors and others who provide "primary care" would get the full increase in Medicare fees to which they are entitled under current law. But surgeons and other specialists would get smaller increases, and in some cases their Medicare payments would be reduced.
In addition, the President would reduce Medicare payments for laboratory services and would not allow any increases for inflation over the next four years.

HEADLINE: Labor Seeks a Tougher U.S. Stand On Trade With Mexico and Japan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 17

 BODY:
The leaders of American labor challenged the Clinton Administration today to toughen policies on trade with Japan and Mexico, and the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said the United States should try to join the European Community.
Meeting here in its annual winter session, the executive council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations called on President Clinton to reject the North American Free Trade Agreement, negotiated by the Bush Administration with Mexico and Canada. The council said the treaty should be renegotiated to "stop the flight of jobs" to Mexico. 
 The council, made up of the heads of 33 unions, also urged the Administration to limit imports of Japanese automobiles to 800,000 to one million a year. This would be "an interim measure until long-term solutions" to the imbalance of trade with Japan are put into effect, the council said.
The council said the current limit on Japanese cars, 1.65 million a year, was too high to cut the American trade deficit with Japan, which last year topped $30 billion in auto products alone.
 
Loss of Jobs Feared
 American labor unions have repeatedly expressed fear that the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, would result in the loss of many thousands of American jobs. The unions believe that the accord would induce manufacturers to move their factories to Mexico, where wages and other costs are much lower.
Mr. Clinton has pledged to meet some of labor's objections by negotiating side agreements with Mexico on workplace conditions and the environment, but he has opposed renegotiating the treaty outright before submitting it to Congress.
At a news conference today, Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., questioned the wisdom of pressing for a trade deal with Mexico without first trying to establish closer trade relations with the 12 countries of the European Community.
Washington has never sought a bilateral trade pact with the European Community, but Mr. Kirkland said, "If broader access to markets is to be a priority, then it would make sense to me that instead of putting Mexico first in our order of priorities, that we should seek to enter the European Community and make the Atlantic alliance economically meaningful."
Asked by a reporter whether the European Community, whose founding charter limits members to European countries, would be willing to admit the United States, Mr. Kirkland said, "I would suggest to you that we have certain bargaining leverage, including the presence of a substantial number of American troops over there and a strong commitment to European defense."
Mr. Kirkland called Nafta "a disaster for millions of working people" and "an agreement based solely on exploitation."

HEADLINE: Regan Says Revenue Picture Has Improved

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 17

 BODY:
In a review of the state's monthly cash report, Comptroller Edward V. Regan said today that the state has received $1.26 billion more in revenues over the last 10 months than had been projected last April, when the current budget was passed.
Expecting that the economy will grow slowly this year, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed a tight-fisted $31.5 billion spending plan that projects a $3.7 billion deficit and calls for deep cuts to school aid and Medicaid. But Republicans have said that the Governor's economic projections are far too gloomy. 
 The Republicans now argue that the higher-than-projected revenues -- most of them from personal-income taxes -- demonstrate that the Governor's economic projections last year were too conservative.
"We suspect that the Governor's revenue projections for next year are not reflecting what's going on with the economy," said John McArdle, a spokesman for Senator Ralph J. Marino, a Nassau County Republican and the Senate majority leader.
 
Wall Street Bonuses
 But Mr. Cuomo's aides say that the $1.2 billion in additional tax revenue is an aberration. They said Wall Street executives received bonuses in December instead of January or February to avoid paying the higher taxes recommended by President Bill Clinton. As a result, the state is getting the revenue it had projected last April, just earlier.
"Pardon us for not realizing that Americans would reject a popular sitting President and elect a guy who said he would raise taxes," said Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state's Division of Budget.
By leaning toward the conservative side, Mr. Cuomo's economic projections will enable the state to end this year with a $183 million surplus, its first in five years, Ms. Hutton said.
The haggling over economic projections is just a warm-up to the larger fight over the state's budget for the year beginning April 1.
The Governor, the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate have said they will agree on an economic forecast by early March. But until then, there is likely to be little consensus over how to interpret reams of economic data.
For instance, Republicans noted that sales tax receipts were $40 million higher than anticipated for the past 10 months But Mr. Cuomo's aides characterized the number as insignificantly low. And they found further bad news: in the first 15 days of 1993, income tax receipts were actually $270 million lower than for the first 15 days of 1992.
"It is important that people not be lulled into thinking New York's economy is stronger than it is," Ms. Hutton said.
But Mr. McArdle suggested that the Governor had a personal motive for his budget: "You could argue he is doing it to intentionally build a surplus for an election year," he said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: In New York;
For Wealthy, Equanimity And Anxiety

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
From the lobbyists' suites of Washington to the paneled corridors of Wall Street law firms, stewards and counsels of the privileged classes yesterday accepted with a mix of equanimity and trepidation the word that it would cost more to enjoy those privileges under President Clinton's tax proposals.
In Manhattan, Broadway theater owners wailed that curtailing the deductibility of business meals and entertainment expenses to 50 percent from 80 percent would be "devastating," and some restaurateurs worried that it could further hurt their fragile industry amid a tentative comeback. 
 "The rich people could not care less," said Sirio Maccione, silken owner of Le Cirque, as he oversaw the evening buzz in his restaurant on East 65th Street. "But it's really hurting the people who are going out for business. Without the deduction, they'll be in big trouble. Maybe I should open a pizzeria. I'm not advising anyone, because if I were intelligent, I would not be a restaurateur, but Mr. Clinton should be more in the reality of things."
But others expressed relief that Mr. Clinton had not proposed to raise the price of earning and dining and drinking and dying even more.
 
'Something We Expected'
 "It's something we expected, I'd have to say in candor," Sanford J. Schlesinger, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Shea & Gould, said of Mr. Clinton's call to reinstate the top Federal tax rate of 55 percent for estates over $3 million. The rate was cut to 50 percent as of Jan. 1 only because President Bush vetoed a grab-bag spending bill last fall that would have continued the higher rate.
Elizabeth Hart, director of government relations for the 1,000 private clubs of the National Club Association in Washington, said the President's plan to end deductibility of club dues was no surprise. "Quite frankly, it surfaces a lot -- three times last year in three different bills," she said, sighing.
But she said that the change would cost more in lost jobs and payroll taxes -- 81,000 jobs and $170 million a year -- than the Administration projects it would raise in the first year and that it would hurt thousands of entry-level workers, many of them minorities.
 
'People Need Help'
 Tax bills come and go, and only the green-eyeshade set has little to lose. Their phones were ringing off the hook.
"Any time you have change, people need help," acknowledged Andre Fogarasi, managing director of Arthur Andersen's office of Federal tax service in Washington. He said the prospect that the top individual tax rate could rise to 42 percent, after accounting for the proposed 10 percent surtax on incomes above $250,000, meant people "are now willing to make some effort to get around the tax rules and plan."
New York City's Finance Commissioner, Carol O'Cleireacain, was philosophical. "The income effect is clearly negative for high-income people, and New York City has a lot of them, so it's going to drain purchasing power," she said. "But raising the tax rates also means that in places that have high taxes, the worth of each deduction is greater, so that becomes a benefit."
Others were less sanguine.
"We think it would have a devastating effect," Harvey Sabinson, executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade group for the Broadway theater owners, said of the proposal to trim deductibility of entertainment expenses.

HEADLINE: Teaching in a Closet, or a Shower;
Crowded Classes and More Students a Portent of the Future

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
It is so crowded in some New York City public schools that some students get lunch at 10:30 A.M. Some attend classes in churches, empty warehouses, factories, even defunct department stores. Classes are taught in closets, and computer labs are converted shower stalls.
And the problem is only getting worse: The largest surge in enrollment in a quarter of a century has increased the number of students to just shy of one million, school officials say. They add that by the end of the century, enrollment could approach the record set when the Baby Boom generation went through the system. 
 In the official student tally for the current school year, which was released yesterday, enrollment increased by 22,202 students, to 995,465. If the additional students were given their own school district, it would be the fourth largest in the state, after New York City, Buffalo and Rochester. Syracuse and Yonkers would come next.
The 2.3 percent increase in the student population represents the third consecutive year that enrollment has increased significantly. Over the three-year period, enrollment increased by a total of 55,827 students, with as many as 200,000 or more new students projected by the end of the century.
To put that number in perspective, the $24 billion capital construction proposed by Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez would build just enough schools, 63, by 1997 to handle the increase in the number of students so far -- and Mr. Fernandez's proposed list is considered likely to be pared down.
City public-school enrollment peaked in 1971, with a record 1,140,349 students, as the city entered a period of stark decline and retrenchment. School officials used the opportunity to close and dispose of outdated school buildings that they thought they would never need again.
 
More Pressure on School System
 Much of the recent increase has been attributed to new immigrants, who have been filling up public schools in some neighborhoods while seats in other neighborhoods go begging. Some of the growth is also because of the economic pressures on parents during a recession that has resulted in sagging enrollments in private and parochial schools.
Now school officials say they are concerned that the increasing enrollment will put pressure on already strapped school budgets, at a time of fiscal combat in Albany.
"While enrollment in our schools continues to grow dramatically, our share of the state's allocation for education continues to shrink," Mr. Fernandez said in a statement that accompanied the enrollment report. "The Legislature's funding formula is not only illogical, but cruel."
The school enrollment figures, based upon a census taken Oct. 31, were released earlier this year than they have been in recent years, apparently as part of an effort to bolster a proposal by Mr. Fernandez to establish up to 50 small high schools, where students are less likely to be lost in the crowd.
While the plan was conceived as a way of reaching students who are failing in large, impersonal schools, it is being sold as a response to the overcrowding in city high schools, where enrollment is rising faster than in any other area.
Plans for seven of the new high schools were approved by the Board of Education last night, and school officials are worrying that since the board voted to oust Mr. Fernandez at the end of his contract, support for the new schools is eroding. Money set aside to deal with overcrowded classrooms will be used to lease space to establish many of the new schools, school officials said.
Much of the enrollment increase comes not from a jump in the birth rate, the traditional predictor of school enrollment, but in a surge in immigration. In the last three years, more than 125,000 immigrant children enrolled in city schools. A study by school researchers shows that the largest group came from the Dominican Republic, followed by Jamaica, the former Soviet Union, Guyana, China and Haiti.
 
Growing Queens District
 The largest increase in enrollment reported last year was in Corona and Elmhurst in Queens, part of School District 24, where enrollment jumped by 12 percent, or 3,200 students. Even before the latest enrollment increases were counted, the district was listed as being at 128 percent of capacity.
District 24, which is at the center of a dispute with the Chancellor over his Children of the Rainbow multicultural curriculum, is also home to immigrants from 112 nations, including concentrations of Chinese, Dominicans, Koreans, Asian Indians, Filipinos and Guyanese.
District 6, in Washington Heights, the second most crowded district, now at 122 percent of capacity, saw an increase of 1,610 students, many from the Dominican community.
Parents and school officials say they believe that another factor in the increasing enrollment in public schools has been the shift from parochial and private schools. Parents who can no longer afford the tuition or have been lured back by quality schools and special programs are opting for public schools. Between 1971 and 1991, enrollment in private or parochial schools fell by more than a third, to 267,838, from 415,939.
"More and more parochial and independent schools are closing because parents can no longer afford them in this economy," said Ayo Harrington, president of the United Parents Association, which represents parent associations at 260 schools.
In a statement that accompanied the new school figures, Mr. Fernandez said that while the city school system includes 37 percent of all public school students in the state, four out of five students with limited English abilities and a third of all poor students, the city received only 33 percent of state aid to school districts.
But it is not clear that the trend cited by Mr. Fernandez will continue. State education officials, citing increasing birth rates, are forecasting an increase of about a half a million students in public schools across the state by the year 2000, only about a third of them in New York City.

HEADLINE: For Business, Ample Pain to Share

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The economic plan offered by President Clinton last night gives corporate America and Wall Street, like the nation's households, plenty to think about.
The President sought specific sacrifices from business, like higher corporate taxes and fewer deductions. But there were subtle symbols that he was trying to establish new relationships between the Government and corporate America. 
 His audience, for example, included at least one prominent corporate figure among the assembled legislative, judicial and regulatory leaders. Hillary Rodham Clinton sat between Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc.
The President's plan raises taxes for large companies and well-paid executives, while denying the tax deductibility of a series of corporate perks. In dollar terms, eliminating these add up to little in a plan intended to increase Government revenue by more than $328 billion over five years. But they are important emblematic targets for the Clinton Administration.
Under the plan, corporations would no longer be able to claim tax deductions for paying executives more than $1 million a year. Club dues would no longer be deductible. The tax-deductible share of business meals and entertainment would be trimmed from 80 percent at present to 50 percent. And paying lobbyists would no longer be deductible.
Yet the largest cost to big business would be increasing the maximum corporate tax rate to 36 percent from 34 percent. The Administration hopes to raise $30.5 billion over five years with the higher corporate taxes. Another big ticket will be an across-the-board energy tax based on the output of energy produced, with revenue of $71 billion projected over five years.
Mr. Clinton is also planning tax incentives, estimated to cost a total of $83 billion over five years, aimed at encouraging worker training, research and development spending, investment in small businesses, and a handful of high-tech projects like high-speed railroads and a so-called data highway for computers.
If the plan is enacted by Congress, there will be plenty of pain to go around among executives, some of whom expressed concern after hearing the President's address last night.
"When they talk about training programs, how the Government and corporations would be expected to fund that was not clear at all," said John V. Roach, chief executive of the Tandy Corporation in Fort Worth. "It is clear that larger businesses were singled out for higher taxes and fewer benefits. That seems to say that the Government is headed toward almost a more socialized program like in Europe without the support and focus on larger business."
Each item in the Clinton plan will stir resistance in some quarters. But the early reaction from a sampling of executives seems to be mostly one of qualified support.
 
Cutting the Deficit
 A number of executives in banking and finance said they considered cutting the deficit to be the most important element in the President's plans and that last night's speech was merely the first step in a long, risky process.
"This is the first time the deficit has been raised to this level of public conciousness," Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive of the Paine Webber Group, said after the speech. "But the specifics of the planned spending cuts have to come soon. If that doesn't happen, the public will view this as politics as usual."
Robert E. Denham, chairman of Salomon Inc., said that "while I don't necessarily agree with every piece of the program, the President has focused on the right objective, which is meaningful deficit reduction."
Richard M. Kovacevich, president and chief executive of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said many business executives "want to support the President, and believe that some of the things he is working on are correct."
"But it seems to me," he added, "that one has to continuously relate the pain to the gain, and that is what is getting confused here. If I were President and I was trying to sell income tax increases, I would say all of the increase in income taxes I am asking people to pay will be used to reduce the deficit. The pain is the tax increases. The gain is cutting the deficit."
Mr. Kovacevich also expressed some disappointment with Mr. Clinton's decision not to press for some relaxation in banking regulations, an idea that received a good bit of attention at the economic meetings in Little Rock in December.
"In our industry we believe that with some regulatory reform we could generate an extra $80 billion in new loans," he said. "That is far greater than the $30 billion in stimulus" Mr. Clinton asked for last night.
 
The Energy Tax
 Under the President's proposal, $71.4 billion will be raised over five years through an energy tax. The so-called B.T.U. tax, for British thermal units, which is based on the energy content of fuels, was opposed by many companies in energy-related industries. Still, it is being seen as something of a compromise because it is not intended to penalize the use of specific fuels nor is it aimed at parts of the country that are heavily tilted toward production of either oil, natural gas or coal.
"We would have preferred a value-added tax on products rather than a B.T.U. tax," said Roger Hemming haus, chairman and chief executive of Diamond Shamrock in San Antonio. "But if energy has to be taxed broadly, then a B.T.U. tax is probably the best way to go."
The energy tax would be modified to reflect the fact that fuels sell at different prices and have different energy contents. But the exact mathematics of it may come under attack by various sectors of the industry who feel they are being affected unfairly.
"Natural gas is selling at a huge discount on a B.T.U. basis so it could be hit by a higher tax," said Craig Goodman, the vice president of governmental affairs for the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation, a natural gas producer in The Woodlands, Tex. Mr. Goodman was the director of energy tax policy in the Energy Department during the Bush and Reagan Administrations.
John Kean, president and chief executive of the NUI Corporation in Bedminster, N.J., said he expected any energy taxes to be passed through to consumers. But some executives worried that the bureaucracy needed to collect these taxes, either from energy producers or utilities, and that this could prove daunting or wasteful.
"I can't imagine anything more difficult to collect," said John Lollar, chairman and chief executive of the Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation in Houston.
John R. Hall, chairman and chief executive of Ashland Oil Inc., in Ashland, Ky., said he strongly opposed any energy tax and that it would have a negative ripple effect through all sectors of industry.
'I think it will be inflationary, it will cost jobs and it will be impractical," he said. "Also, if refiners in Europe don't have to pay it, they will ship products in here and ruin our business."
Still, some exploration companies were heartened by the prospect that an energy tax might lead to a reduction in oil imports. "Depending on the specifics, it could have a very positive effect on oil imports," said John McFarland, chairman and chief executive of McFarland Energy Inc. in Santa Fe Springs, Calif.
And early reaction from the auto industry was supportive.
"No one likes tax increase for individuals or business, since they could have a serious effect on any economic recover," Harold A. Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said in a statement issued after the speech. "But Americans may be willing to make the sacrifice for a period of time, if the tax increases are accompanied by sizable spending cuts."
 
Corporate Taxes
 One immediate effect of an increase in the corporate tax rate to 36 percent might be to pull down earnings this year. Because corporations must put aside future taxes as a liability, such set-asides will probably have to be increased immediately.
"A lot of corporations will show a negative hit on their balance sheets," said Mr. Hemminghaus of Diamond Shamrock.
For example, Keith Booke, director of investor relations for the Valero Energy Corporation in San Antonio, said that the company anticipated taking a one-time charge this year of $16 million to reflect the increase in future tax liabilities under the Clinton plan. Last year, the company had income of about $84 million, he said.
"This is the cost of doing business in a democracy and we are prepared to pay our fair share," said Mr. Kean of NUI. "Some of it will be passed through to our customers and some of it will come out of the hide of our stockholders."
Mr. Hall of Ashland said: "It is going to have a marginally negative effect that is going to cost jobs and make less capital available for new investments. I think it is a poor time to raise taxes, particularly on our industry, which is going to have to spend $40 billion over the next few years to meet requirements of the Clean Air Act."
Some chief executives were also concerned that paying more in taxes could increase the price of products and hurt them competitively, particularly against foreign producers.
"I can understand why they have had to increase it to keep it at the individual maximum," said Mr. Roach of Tandy. "The other side of the coin is that it is business that is going to generate jobs and investment, but when those funds are taken away, it doesn't give business the option of using it for that purpose."
Donald M. Himelfarb, president and chief executive of Thrifty Rent-a-Car System Inc., based in Tulsa, Okla., found the increase in the corporate tax rate acceptable, provided the Government showed similar discipline with spending cuts. "If there is going to be a balance, then that is acceptable," he said. "It only makes sense in light of greater spending cuts."
In the Silicon Valley of California, James G. Treybig, president and chief executive of Tandem Computer, said the President's proposals were "consistent with what he talked about."
"The taxes are a little higher, but the goals are the same," he said. "We are willing to pay higher corporate taxes if we can also cut spending. The next group of people we have to hear from are in Congress."
 
Investment Tax Credit
 Some corporate leaders expressed puzzlement as to why the Clinton plan called for a temporary tax credit for big business while offering a permanent one for smaller companies.
"I think it ought to be offered across the board to large and small companies alike and it ought to be permanent so that companies can plan," said Mr. Hemminghaus of Diamond Shamrock.
Mr. Himelfarb of Thrifty agreed. "You are stealing momentum from one period to the next," he said. "Sound business decisions cannot be made on a temporary investment tax credit."
Still other business leaders said that the impact of even a temporary credit for large business could be positive.
"It encourages us to develop infrastructure and makes its easier for us to build pipelines," said Mr. Kean of NUI.

HEADLINE: Teaching the Hard Sell of Soap to Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Since Unilever N.V. purchased a laundry detergent factory in Poland for $20 million a year and a half ago, the plant's Pollena 2000 detergent has become a surprisingly strong seller for the British-Dutch consumer products company.
Riding the popularity of an advertising campaign developed months earlier by the plant's Polish managers, Pollena 2000 quickly made Unilever the market share leader in detergents here. Built around a bit of clever wordplay among characters from Polish popular literature, the campaign has become more ubiquitous in the popular culture than "Where's the beef?" ever was in the United States.
 
Easy Victories the Exception
 The brand's success shows the potential for rapidly increasing sales of consumer goods in the formerly Communist nations of Central and Eastern Europe. But such quick and easy victories are the exception for Unilever and the other Western companies that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the last two years in Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic and Slovakia, and that are edging into the poorer nations of the region including the former Soviet republics. 
 In setting up operations in countries that are undergoing the wrenching transformation to market economies, such companies have faced an array of problems, from outdated plants to a lack of trucks and warehouses for distribution to a local dearth of advertising expertise.
More fundamentally, they often find themselves faced with the daunting task of teaching local managers and workers not just more efficient production and marketing techniques, but the very basics of a free-market economy.
"We had to help develop the awareness that the marketplace decides what's good, not the state," said Hans Overgoor, who heads Unilever's operations in Poland.
Like its competitors from Western Europe and the United States, Unilever has spent heavily in Eastern Europe, more than $150 million so far, to buy and revamp state-owned factories and distribution systems and to begin introducing its own brands. In Hungary it has purchased an ice cream producer and taken an 80 percent stake in a large maker of soap, margarine and detergents. Last year in Czechoslovakia it bought the leading soap and margarine business. In Poland, in addition to the detergent company, it has acquired the largest margarine producer.
Although their executives say they are dedicated to making their operations respond to the needs of the market, Unilever and its competitors have sometimes found it difficult to determine just what consumers do want.
Market research is scarce, even on such basic questions as average income or the number of homes with washing machines. And consumers themselves sometimes seem overwhelmed by the new choices available and by the flood of advertising messages.
The Procter & Gamble Company saw sales of its Wash 'n' Go shampoo plummet for several months last year when it was unable to quash rumors in Poland that the product would cause hair to fall out. Gossip, long the antidote to official propaganda, is still sometimes given more credence than advertising.
In 1991, the Colgate-Palmolive Company came close to purchasing Caola, Hungary's state-owned producer of toothpaste, shampoo and other personal-care products, but pulled out at the last minute when it discovered that Caola's sales were falling precipitously under an onslaught of Western competition. The French food company BSN said some of the production equipment in plants it bought last year in Czechoslovakia was about as advanced as the machinery in France immediately after World War II.
"I wouldn't say it's third world," said Hajo Valk, the regional director for Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in Eastern and Central Europe. "It just takes a lot of ingenuity and a very flexible attitude from the people you have there, because a lot of things we take for granted in the West you can't take for granted there."
 
400 Million Consumers
 Unilever, as one of the first companies to make acquisitions in Eastern Europe and as one of the more aggressive marketers of Western brands in the region, has had its setbacks. But its executives say they are there to stay.
The region's population of 400 million, barely smaller than the 430 million in Western Europe, cannot be ignored, said Hans Eggerstedt, the director of the company's European operations. Average incomes in the region are approaching the levels of Portugal or Greece, he said, meaning that consumers increasingly have money to spend.
Finally, he said, residents of Eastern Europe, unlike those in Africa or Asia, share the same basic culture and attitudes of Western consumers, suggesting that the process of marketing products to them should proceed more smoothly.
"We must be able to succeed in doing business in Eastern Europe, which is so similar to Western Europe and in the end is in the heartland of our business," Mr. Eggerstedt said. "It is not only an opportunity for us. It is a must for us."
 
Keeping the Ice Cream Frozen
 Mr. Eggerstedt said Unilever's sales in Eastern Europe, now more than $375 million a year, should triple within five years, primarily through increased sales rather than from additional acquisitions.
But the company has already recognized the hurdles it will face along the way. When Unilever bought an ice cream company in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1991, it encountered one of the most common problems facing consumer products companies in Eastern Europe: the lack of a reliable distribution system to get its products into stores. Forced to rely on the old state-run system of trucking and storage, Unilever's ice cream often reached stores half-melted.
Unilever executives said they have subsequently had to spend much of their time and money setting up a system of wholesalers and transportation in all of the Eastern European countries.
Unilever got a similarly bad surprise when it examined the financial management of the detergents business in Poland. Although inflation in Poland was running at about 70 percent at the time, the factory's local managers, who had never worried much about the bottom line, were resetting prices only once or twice a year. Quickly, Unilever put in place a policy of reviewing prices at least four times a year.
 
Introducing Western Brands
 Over all, though, Unilever executives said they had been able to move steadily ahead with their primary strategy of squeezing the greatest possible sales from the stronger of the local brands they acquire, while modernizing and expanding local factories and regularly introducing their own brands.
In Poland, for example, the company reformulated Pollena 2000, using technology brought in from the West, to make it more powerful in removing stains. It invested in new equipment to eliminate production problems that often made the quality of the detergent vary from box to box.
Unilever is spending more than $24 million over five years to double the production capacity of the detergent factory and to add the capability to make liquid detergents. Mr. Overgoor said it had no plans to phase out Pollena 2000, but the company has been busy marketing one of its Western European detergent brands, Omo, as a more effective -- and more expensive -- alternative.
"Our main aim has been from the very beginning to establish a strong position for our international products and brands," Mr. Eggerstedt said.
 
Tailoring the Message
 Yet marketing consultants in Warsaw said Unilever might learn a lesson from the advertising for Pollena 2000 and Omo. The popularity and effectiveness of Pollena 2000's advertising, they said, shows the value of a campaign designed solely for the nation in which it appears. That is especially important when dealing with consumers whose brand loyalties are completely in flux and who have little experience sorting through a barrage of advertising messages.
The campaign centers on an imposing 17th-century Polish nobleman and his sons, known to almost all Poles from a series of popular books. In the first commercial, one of the sons spills wine on his clothes during a banquet. In the ensuing silence, the other son turns to the father and asks whether his brother should be beaten -- but he uses a word that can also mean cleaned. The father replies menacingly with the same word, and is then seen happily washing the stained clothes with Pollena 2000.
Omo, on the other hand, is advertised with a campaign adapted from Western Europe, and ends with women saying, "Thank you, Omo." While Mr. Overgoor said the commercials had been effective, Polish consumers widely mocked them, apparently unable to swallow the Western conceit that a grateful housewife would thank a laundry detergent.

HEADLINE: Mexico Pulls Out of Fund That Has Roiled Trade Issue

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Under sharp pressure from the United States, Mexican officials said today that the Government's main development bank would withdraw from a private investment fund set up to buy American companies and move them to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages.
The announcement came almost immediately after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, told his Mexican counterpart that he would not begin new negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement until Mexico resolved the issue of its role in the fund. 
 "I indicated that it would not be productive to begin these talks until we addressed an issue that was potentially explosive," Mr. Kantor told reporters in Washington after his first meeting with Mexico's Foreign Trade Secretary, Jaime Serra Puche.
 Mr. Kantor said he had asked merely for "a clarification" of Mexico's participation in the fund. But he made it clear that when Mr. Serra telephoned him less than an hour after their meeting ended to tell him of the withdrawal, he got what he wanted. "He acted quickly and effectively," Mr. Kantor said, "and I was very impressed and pleased with the results."
Opponents of the trade agreement had seized on the little-known investment fund as hard evidence that Mexico intends to use its relatively cheap labor to steal American manufacturing jobs.
A prospectus for the fund, a limited partnership based in Delaware and called the AmeriMex Maquiladora Fund L.P., said it would try to raise as much as $50 million to buy between 9 and 13 small and medium-sized American companies to be moved to Mexico.
The Governments of Mexico, Canada and the United States concede that the trade accord will not only remove tariff barriers but encourage manufacturers to move their operations where they can produce more efficiently. Yet all three have sought to play down the prospects for such movement because the opposition of American and Canadian labor groups concerned about job losses could threaten the agreement's ratification.
 Mr. Serra and Mr. Kantor met today precisely to begin discussing what measures their countries could take to ameliorate any job losses the accord might cause, or environmental damage that might result from the movement of American companies seeking looser pollution laws in Mexico. President Clinton supports the pact, but has said he would not endorse it until further agreements are negotiated to safeguard the American environment and work force.
Just what Mexico, Canada and the United States may agree to along those lines remains unclear, particularly to the Mexican Government.
For instance, although it is expected that at least the United States and Mexico would commit to greater public spending and stricter standards for labor and environmental protection, it is doubtful that any of the countries would accept an independent, supranational body to enforce those standards. Mexico and the United States are also expected to discuss some sort of accord on sugar imports that would complement the broader agreement.
The question of enforcement aside, Mr. Serra's hurried response to Mr. Kantor this morning suggested that Mexico might make significant concessions to insure the trade agreement's approval by the United States Congress. Its ratification in by the Mexican Senate is assured, because the legislature is dominated by the ruling party.
 
Seeking to Avoid Delays
 As negotiated, the agreement is to take effect on Jan. 1, 1994. Mexican officials are eager to see it through the Congress before the August recess, fearing that any further delays could make its ultimate ratification more difficult and jeopardize the flow of needed investments into Mexico.
After hearing from Mr. Serra, Mr. Kantor announced today that Mexican, Canadian and American officials would meet March 15 in Washington to begin discussing the parallel agreements.
The Mexican trade secretary, meanwhile, disputed that the AmeriMex fund was established to move companies from the United States to Mexico. But the fund's prospectus states that it will buy established United States companies "wherein a portion or all of the manufacturing will be relocated to Mexico to take advantage of savings in the cost of labor."
Mr. Serra also described the fund as "very, very small" and the role in it of Mexico's largest development bank, Nacional Financiera , as "very limited." However, other Mexican officials acknowledged that the $3.75 million invested by the bank represented 25 percent of the fund's capital and probably was the largest single stake of its 14 partners.
 
 
Mexican Official Is Partner
 And while the bank, known as Nafin, technically cannot control the fund's investments, it appeared likely that it would be able to influence them through a Mexican official who is one of the fund's two general partners. The official, Adolfo Peniche Perez, is Finance Secretary for the ruling-party Government in Mexico's southeastern state of Yucatan.
In an interview this afternoon, the president of Nafin, Oscar Espinosa Villareal, said the bank had always intended its role in the fund to be temporary and was already in the process of divesting. He noted that the bank, which has assets of about $22 billion, was involved in many operations that aimed to capitalize on the two countries' growing economic integration.
"Basically we thought about the return," he said of Nafin's decision to invest in the fund, which was made before he assumed control. "There was never a political criteria involved in deciding whether or not to invest."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Cummins Engine is tuned up for a boom in the truck market.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
ANALYSTS say the Cummins Engine Company is humming on all cylinders. After several years of heavy spending on new products, the diesel engine maker, based in Columbus, Ind., has halted the erosion of its market share in the heavy-duty truck business and sharply increased its share of the pickup truck sector.
Last Friday's encouraging fourth-quarter earnings report signaled a long-awaited return to healthy profitability. And Monday's announcement of a long-range partnership with Komatsu Ltd. of Japan underscored the global leverage Cummins has acquired through its investment in emission-control technology for its new engines. 
 "You have to give management credit for resurrecting this company," said Eli Lustgarten, who follows Cummins and other capital equipment companies for Paine Webber.
In fact, investors have given Cummins a lot of credit during the last two years. Cummins stock, which dipped under $32 in late 1990, rose as high as $86 early this month. The shares have since slipped, on fears of higher fuel taxes. Yesterday, they closed at $80.75, down $2 each, on the New York Stock Exchange. The record high of $94.75 was set in 1987.
The consensus is that earnings will jump sharply this year and next. The highly cyclical North American heavy-duty truck market, Cummins's largest source of business, is enjoying its biggest boom in years with new production rising 35 percent last year and another double-digit increase expected in 1993. In addition, Ford last year joined Chrysler as a major customer for Cummins's diesel pickup truck engines. The company also sells engines for the marine, construction and utility markets, all of which are expected to grow.
At the same time, Cummins's severe cost-cutting measures of the late 1980's and early 1990's have raised profit margins. Last year also saw a sharp drop in warranty payments, which had swollen during the late 1980's when the company rushed a poorly designed product to market.
The only thing that kept Cummins from reporting a profit for full-year 1992 last week, after five losses in six years, was a one-time charge of more than $251 million to cover changes in the way it accounts for retiree health-care costs.
The debate now concerns how high Cummins's earnings will leap and how much of the jump will reflect operations, as opposed to tax benefits built up during money-losing years. Skeptics like Mr. Lustgarten see earnings of between $9 and $10 a share in 1994, including up to $2 in tax benefits. Optimists like Larry D. Hollis, who follows the company for Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, say earnings could near $12 in 1994.
Cummins's current stock price fully anticipates the pace of the earnings growth that Mr. Lustgarten is forecasting. Mr. Lustgarten is thus among those who are neutral on the stock, expecting it to do no better than match the market. But a performance like that projected by Mr. Baird could well push Cummins shares past the $100 level. Mr. Baird last week joined those recommending that investors with a moderate to long-term perspective buy Cummins shares.
Most analysts are concerned about what impact, if any, President Clinton's economic proposals will have on the length and strength of the recovery. The trucking industry has traditionally been one of the first sectors to grow during a recovery. The longer and stronger the early stages of the recovery, the more appealing the stocks of truck makers and their suppliers remain to investors who usually switch funds to other, later-blooming sectors as the recovery matures.

Struggling Town Pins Hopes on Theater Revival

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Conn.

 BODY:
WHEN the Apple House grocery here closed last spring, a once distinctive stretch of Route 44 suddenly looked seedy. And in a town that could give lessons on how to be the quintessential New England village, seedy just doesn't fit.
People here now say they should have seen it coming as more and more buildings in the town's small commercial center were abandoned. 
 But for years the unused structures were easily overlooked in favor of their historic neighbors, particularly the 1904 Royal Arcanum Building, up the street, and at the green, the Battell-Stoeckel estate that the Yale Summer School of Music calls home.
It wasn't until the Apple House closed that the sights sank in. And now, a group of residents is hoping to turn things around by reviving a long-abandoned theater, known as the Opera House, on the second floor of the building where the Apple House operated.
"I think we've had trouble envisioning the impact the closing of the Apple House would have on the town," said Hank Tremblay, a selectman and owner of Manor House Bed and Breakfast Inn. "Things just weren't the same anymore."
His wife, Diane, vice president of the Merchants Association, agrees. "When times were good, people just didn't have time to care if the center was functioning. Once people realized that the town couldn't even support a grocery store, they started thinking."
Many merchants want to see Norfolk become a retail center, siphoning traffic off Route 44 to a shopping complex complete with stores, restaurants and connecting walkways. Not only would their own businesses benefit, but jobs would be created and the empty buildings put to good use.
There are those, however, who would prefer that Norfolk remain the sleepy community it has always been, where weekenders come to relax and day trippers to hear classical concerts on warm summer nights.
"There's something about living nowhere," said Rosemary Gill, a local artist. "I feel like this is Brigadoon. I'd just as soon see it have a tiny drugstore and nothing else."
Ms. Gill's father, the New Yorker writer Brendan Gill, is passionate about retaining the town's architectural integrity and small-town feel, but is sensitive to its economic realities, too.
In the 1860's, he said, Norfolk was already known as a summer resort.
"Today, 135 years later, it is still successful as a place for people who want a picturesque village," he added, but small towns like Norfolk "are finding it increasingly difficult to find a successful economic basis of their own."
"Most have to depend on a tourist economy," he said.
Mr. Tremblay says no one wants to turn Norfolk into the Northwest Corner's equivalent of Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard, but a retail center would improve the town's economy and appearance.
"We're not looking to create a tourist attraction," he said. "Hopefully, it will just mean people being able to come here and spend time downtown."
The difference between hoping and doing, however, is vast. Starling Childs, an owner of the Brick Block, a housing complex destroyed by fire in 1986, says that six years ago he proposed virtually the same retail plan that merchants are contemplating now. The problem, he said, is that no one seems to be able to agree on what the town needs.
"Basically, we have a dysfunctional town," said Mr. Childs. "Do you detect a note of bitterness? There are people going around saying the Brick Block is a diamond in the rough, but no one's willing to put any money into it. The trick is, someone has to come in and buy the whole town."
At least one solution may come from the Connecticut Theater Arts Consortium, a year-old group that is raising money to buy the Village Hall, where the Apple House and the Opera House reside. Its plan is to turn the Opera House into a cultural center and open the first floor to retailers.
The 1883 theater looks almost as it did the day it closed in 1940. Handpainted canvas backdrops still hang above the stage, weighted by old ropes and sandbags. The red and green trim, the ornate wooden molding and overhead beams are pristine.
In the dressing rooms, visiting acts chronicled their appearances in pen on the walls: "H. Mack, the Singing Comedian," "Baum Bros., Comedians-Vaudeville," "Jerry Leroy and Adams George, Comedy-Acrobats." Dates are scrawled throughout: 1907, 1922, 1931, 1915.
"This is for the town," Mr. Tremblay said. "The thrust of those interested is not in turning us into a Lenox or a Stockbridge. I think we're gearing toward a resident center instead of a tourist center. I think it just means having things to do."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Does raising the minimum wage in fact mean fewer jobs?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
ROBERT B. REICH, the new Secretary of Labor, says he will use his considerable muscle to lever an increase in the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage. And to organized labor's friends celebrating the Democratic victory at the polls, the declaration was a welcome call to arms: "The idea of anything less than $5 makes no sense," declared Representative William D. Ford, chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. "I don't know of any part of this country where anybody could subsist on less."
But to many economists, including many liberal ones, the minimum wage is one can of worms they would just as soon not crack. For while all agree that $4.25 an hour does not buy a piece of the American dream, there is no longer a consensus on the likely impact of a higher minimum on either jobs or poverty. 
 The reassuring "new view" that the employment effects are, in fact, trivial is being challenged by the "new, new view," which is much like the old: The price of higher-paying jobs may well be fewer jobs or stingier fringe benefits.
According to the textbooks, the minimum wage cuts both ways. A higher minimum does indeed mean higher incomes for low-wage workers who are employed. But over the decades, myriad studies have confirmed that employers respond to wage regulation by cutting their payrolls; most put the damage at roughly a 1 percent loss in jobs for a 10 percent increase in the minimum.
The difficulty of this choice was underlined by Ed Gramlich of the University of Michigan. Many minimum-wage workers, he discovered, were the dependent children of the middle class. Thus, much of the gain from a higher minimum would go into surfboards and stereos -- not into rent and baby formula. It is far better, then, mainstream economists concluded, to increase the living standards of the working poor with tax breaks or to improve their earning power with training.
But this near-consensus has broken down. For one thing, today's opponents of the minimum wage do not have much to offer the food stamp generation. There is little public support in the deficit-ridden 1990's for an expensive attack on poverty. And while President Clinton will no doubt shoehorn some cash for education and apprenticeship programs into the budget, Mr. Reich is the first to acknowledge that it will take a decade to see much sign of progress.
For another, there have been a handful of intriguing studies -- two by David Card of Princeton University and one by Lawrence Katz of Harvard and Alan Kreuger of Princeton -- suggesting that the 27 percent increase in the Federal minimum wage in 1990-91 had virtually no effect on jobs. And these studies will probably weigh heavily on Administration thinking: Mr. Katz is now the chief economist for the Labor Department.
If the Card-Katz-Kreuger analyses were as widely accepted outside the Clinton Administration as in, everyone could relax. At very worst, patrons of Taco Bell would end up paying an extra dime for their chicken fajitas so that the nice college kids behind the counter could spend spring break in Fort Lauderdale.
No such luck. The Employment Policies Institute, a Washington organization financed by big retailers who oppose the minimum wage, is publicizing a critique by David Neumark of the University of Pennsylvania and William Wascher of the Federal Reserve Board. Their findings support the once-universal academic view that the minimum has modest but noticeable effects on employment.
So, too, does a freshly minted study of California labor by Lowell Taylor and Taeil Kim of Carnegie Mellon University that used more detailed -- and arguably more accurate -- data than the New View analyses.
"The evidence just doesn't give me confidence in Card's results," concludes James Heckman of the University of Chicago.
Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at Michigan State University and a veteran of the minimum wage wars, thinks, in the end, the issue is a diversion from the nuts-and-bolts problems of creating a more productive work force. Hardly any professional economist, he suggests, would willingly take the risk of a very large increase in the minimum -- say to $6 or $7 -- that might cut a wide swath of unemployment through the unskilled labor force. But by the same token, he argues, the sort of modest increase that could be pushed through Congress would not make a big difference in employment or poverty.
Mr. Hamermesh's compromise of choice: Throw organized labor a bone in the form of a token increase, and then index the minimum to average wages so the issue will not soon again absorb the energies of policy makers.
That, in fact, may be what Secretary Reich has in mind. He has hinted at a $4.70 minimum -- a dollar less than the unions want and a small enough sum to have a minimal impact on average labor costs.

HEADLINE: Building of New Homes Dropped 7.2% in January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Construction of new homes fell 7.2 percent in January, the Government said today. Analysts attributed the drop to bad weather and an unsustainable increase in December.
If bad weather is not a factor this month, the analysts added, housing starts should turn up, helped by favorable mortgage rates and a gradually improving economy. 
 "The economy is growing more strongly, interest rates remain low and consumer confidence continues to be high," said David Berson, an economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association. "All that will translate into more starts."
 
Biggest Drop Since April
 The Commerce Department reported that housing starts in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million, the lowest level since last July, when new construction dipped to a rate of 1.11 million. Last month's decline was the largest since starts fell 16.9 percent in April.
Starts were down sharply in the Northeast and West and also fell in the Midwest. They rose in the South.
"Hopefully, this starts number was an aberration," said David Lereah, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Our projection is well over 1.3 million for 1993. But it's not a good way to start the new year."
Analysts noted that starts had jumped 4.8 percent in December, to a annual rate of 1.29 million, and ended the year 18.4 percent above 1991. But they said growth this year would only be about 9 percent, and that the 4.8 percent advance in December overstated the industry's strength.
Sales of both new and previously owned homes rose in December, reducing inventories and providing incentives for further building.
At the same time, mortgage rates were at a 20-year low, and the Mortgage Bankers Association said loan applications, a leading indicator of sales, had remained strong.
 
Permit Applications Slip
 Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future activity, edged down 1.7 percent, to a rate of 1.18 million rate.
"This decline in permits would not suggest as drastic a decline in starts as 7.2 percent," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York. "We expect a bounce-back in starts in upcoming data."
New construction of single-family homes was off 5.6 percent, to a 1.07 million rate, the first decline in six months. Starts of single-family homes rose 4 percent a month earlier.
But starts of multifamily homes, which are overbuilt in many regions, fell even more, to a 122,000 rate, or 19.7 percent. Construction of larger apartment buildings -- five units or more -- dropped 21.7 percent, to a 94,000 rate, the lowest on record. The previous low was 98,000 in December 1991.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Word to Tokyo: Don't Leave New York

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
In an effort to maintain Japanese investment while steering more business to New York City, Mayor David N. Dinkins leaves tomorrow for an eight-day visit to Japan in a trip that will test the Mayor's salesmanship in meetings with business executives and public officials.
In the last year, the Mayor has been increasingly urged by business leaders and his deputies, particularly Barry F. Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, to appeal directly to foreign business leaders. Last June, the Mayor took a weeklong trip to Britain, France and Germany. 
 Some officials contend that the Mayor's trip is intended to smooth relations with Japanese leaders, who reportedly felt slighted by Mr. Dinkins's abrupt decision to cancel a trip to Japan during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. He was scheduled to go there for the dedication of a municipal government building in Tokyo and instead sent Sally Hernandez-Pinero, who was then the deputy mayor for finance and economic development.
Mr. Sullivan, who had been a senior executive at the First Chicago Corporation before going to City Hall last year, will accompany the Mayor, along with about a dozen New York business executives.
 
Most Pay Their Own Way
 The delegation will be headed by Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership/New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a group of business leaders. The Partnership will cover the travel expenses of Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Sullivan and two members of the Mayor's staff. Other executives will pay their own expenses, Mr. Shelp said.
Among the executives going on the trip will be Robert B. Catell, president and chief executive of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company; James S. Gordon, chairman of Burson-Marsteller; James A. Harmon, president and chief executive of Wertheim Schroder & Company; Caroline Jones, president and chief executive of Caroline Jones Advertising, and Clarence O. Smith, president of Essence Communications Inc.
In a difference from the European trip, the Mayor will be less involved in pursuing new investment than in urging Japanese companies to retain their existing operations in New York, Mr. Shelp said. The current recession in Japan has caused concern among New York executives and City Hall that some Japanese companies will pare down or close their New York operations.
Japanese companies in New York have become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. Of the nearly 5,000 foreign-based companies with operations in New York, Japanese operations account for nearly a quarter, according to the New York City Partnership/Chamber.
 
Seminars on New York
 Mr. Dinkins, who will stay mostly in Tokyo, will hold seminars for financial service and communications concerns and real-estate firms on the merits of operating in New York City.
On Tuesday, the Mayor will give a keynote address at the Keidanren's Council for Better Corporate Citizenship in Tokyo, the premier business forum in Japan. The next day, he will address the American Chamber of Commerce, the major group of American business leaders in Tokyo.
"The trip to Europe had a quicker payoff when you consider the fact that we are now having meetings with 26 European operations considering operating in New York," Mr. Shelp said. "We hope this will lead to investment and expansion, but we think it will be over a longer period."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS - ADVERTISING;
Michael Jackson's revival may not win him any new endorsements.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
HE'S famous, but infamous, too. He's dangerous, but perhaps not as much as before. He's bad, but he's not evil. And while he's not the thriller he used to be, his ratings have been a killer.
The celebrity in question is Michael Jackson, who has recently embarked on a series of public performances and appearances after years of reclusive behavior. Entertainment industry executives have attributed the singer's about-face to a desire to bolster his image in the wake of what are considered disappointing American sales for his latest album, "Dangerous" -- the first fruits of his much-heralded $65 million contract with Sony -- as well as to draw attention to Heal the World, his charitable foundation. 
 For some time, advertisers have shied from associations with Mr. Jackson, believing that consumers had lost interest in him since the peak of his popularity in the mid-1980's, when his "Thriller" became the world's all-time best-selling album. They also feared that his unusual behavior, from wearing surgical masks to befriending a chimpanzee named Bubbles, would diminish the value of his endorsements.
"The feeling was that the weirdness turned off Middle America," said Marty Blackman, president at Blackman & Raber, an entertainment and sports consulting and talent company in New York. "They thought he was O.K. along the West Coast and the East Coast, but in between, he was just a little too extreme."
But Mr. Jackson's recent forays into the spotlight have attracted enormous audiences nationwide. His live 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey on Feb. 10, for instance, was the fourth-most-watched entertainment program in television history. A report this week in Inside Media estimated that advertisers paid $160,000 to $270,000 per 30-second spot, which meant they enjoyed ratings approaching Super Bowl levels at prices a fifth to a third of what it cost to buy commercial time during Super Bowl XXVII.
Not that Super Bowl advertisers had much to complain about, thanks to Mr. Jackson. Dick Ebersol, president at NBC Sports, said the singer's performance at the halftime show on Jan. 31 was "a significant factor" in retaining viewers through the second half of the lopsided contest, which became the most-watched television program ever.
Experts like Mr. Blackman say that the attractiveness of Mr. Jackson to advertisers has been enhanced by his burst of activity, because it is serving to rehabilitate his reputation. In particular, they pointed to his statement that a skin disorder called vitiligo caused his changing skin color, which, they said, could effectively counter criticism that he had intentionally lightened his skin.
"Positive press is always good," said Noreen S. Jenney, president at Celebrity Endorsement Network in Woodland Hills, Calif., which represents advertisers in securing celebrity endorsements.
"And so is the lack of negative press," she added.
Still, even though during the Winfrey interview, Elizabeth Taylor popped in to praise Mr. Jackson as "the least weird man I've ever known," the endorsement experts doubt whether Mr. Jackson could suddenly become another Michael Jordan, who has amassed a list of endorsements as long as he is tall.
A primary reason, according to Ms. Jenney, is Mr. Jackson's timing: his publicity blitz coincides with a weak economy.
"I'm finding that in this climate, advertisers are looking for ways to accomplish their goals without blowing their whole budgets on celebrity talent," she said. That puts stars like Mr. Jackson, whose past fees have ranged as high as $7.5 million to $10 million, at a serious disadvantage.
And he is also handicapped, she added, by a perception that "those advertisers who went with him for major dollars haven't gotten out of it what they hoped." She cited a $10 million breach-of-contract suit filed against him last September by L.A. Gear Inc., which suffered an embarrassing failure with a line of buckle-bedecked Michael Jackson shoes. (Mr. Jackson filed a $44 million countersuit.)
Mr. Jackson's one current significant marketer relationship is with the Pepsi-Cola International division of the Pepsi-Cola Company, which signed him last February to an 18-month sponsorship agreement -- not including the American market -- pegged to his worldwide concert tour in support of "Dangerous."
The company "looked into the possibility" of buying time during Super Bowl XXVII to expose Mr. Jackson's latest Pepsi International commercial to American viewers, said Andrew Giangola, a company spokesman. When that did not prove feasible, he added, the spot was run during telecasts of the game in more than a dozen foreign countries.
"As hot as Michael Jackson is," Mr. Giangola continued, "and as much attention as is focused on" the so-called King of Pop, Pepsi-Cola, which ran commercials featuring him in this country during the 1980's, is not considering a permanent return engagement. The reason, the spokesman explained, was that the company believes "he is synonymous with the 'Choice of a New Generation' campaign, which continues to be our tagline overseas. He has never been part of 'Gotta Have It,' " Pepsi-Cola's current American campaign.

Hewlett Net Surpasses Forecasts

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company surprised Wall Street today by reporting profits, revenues and orders all in excess of analysts' estimates.
The news lifted Hewlett-Packard shares, which closed at $72.25, up $4.675, today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Earnings were $261 million, or $1.03 a share, 10 to 15 cents a share higher than analysts expected. In last year's first quarter, Hewlett-Packard would have earned $302 million, but reported a loss of $30 million because of an after-tax charge to cover a change in accounting for employees' post-retirement health benefits.
Profit margins have come under pressure from the company's shift to lower-margin items, like printers, personal computers and work stations. But Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said Hewlett-Packard's orders were surprisingly strong, particularly internationally, where weak economies had caused some concern.
"They've built up a lot of international backlog unintentionally," he said, which will translate into sales in the second quarter, ending in April. In addition, a work force reduction of 1,200 employees during the first quarter will result in lower costs and higher profit margins in the second quarter, he said.
 
Revenue Up 18%
 For the three months that ended Jan. 31, Hewlett-Packard had revenue of $4.57 billion, up 18.4 percent from $3.86 billion a year earlier.
Hewlett-Packard's results were strong compared with the performance of the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation, the only larger computer manufacturers in the nation. Both those companies are mired in losses and only partway through painful restructurings.
Analysts said one part of Hewlett-Packard's successful strategy was early adoption of open systems, a computer approach based on published software standards and the availability of hardware from multiple sources.
 
Record Orders
 "We're extremely pleased with our growth in orders, which was well balanced by business and geography," Lewis E. Platt, Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
Hewlett-Packard said orders for the quarter were a record $5.2 billion, compared with $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 1992. Orders in the United States totaled $2.1 billion, up 18 percent from a year earlier, while orders from outside the country grew by 28 percent, to $3.1 billion.
"The year is off to a good start," Mr. Platt said. "Our challenge is to turn strong order growth into higher profitability. We're cautious, however, because continuing order growth depends in part on worldwide economic conditions, which still show signs of weakness in key geographies."
Noting that sales from Hewlett-Packard's computer business alone were up 27 percent from a year earlier, Mr. Herwick of Hambrecht & Quist added, "Not only is this a big and profitable computer company, but it is growing."

Prices for Wheat Advance On New Hope for Exports

BYLINE: By ReutersReuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Wheat prices jumped today on signs of a revival in exports, but trading in many other commodities was cautious ahead of President Clinton's speech tonight on the details of his plan for the economy.
Meanwhile, oil prices sank for the second consecutive day amid skepticism over OPEC's ability to maintain the discipline to hold to its new quotas. 
 In the wheat pit at the Chicago Board of Trade, traders said the market was ready for a rebound. "We were heavily oversold, and finally we've seen some business, which has been nonexistent for a long time," one analyst said.
Corn and soybean prices edged up slightly, as conflicting forces kept futures on those commodities from establishing a trend in either direction.
March corn rose 1/2 cent, to $2.12 1/2 a bushel, and March soybeans added 2 1/4 cents, to $5.73 1/4 a bushel.
President Clinton's proposals to increase corporate and individual taxes have hit the equity and commodity markets, including the sensitive soybean market.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber prices soared to yet another new high, while livestock futures were mixed.
 
Energy Prices
 Oil prices declined in light of the shaky agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production by a million barrels a day starting on March 1.
"As far as the fundamentals are concerned, the agreement is good," said Cyrus Tahmassebi, chief economist at Ashland Oil, referring to OPEC's new ceiling of 23.6 million barrels a day. "But certainly a credibility gap is there."
But trading was cautious ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's data on domestic inventories, along with President Clinton's speech, which was expected to include some form of energy tax.
"Don't expect President Clinton's speech to have any market impact, barring big surprises," said one trader in Houston. "A general energy consumption tax should have no short-term market effect."
Crude oil for delivery in March fell 20 cents, to $19.33 a barrel; March heating oil lost 0.51 cent, to 54.63 cents a gallon, and March unleaded gasoline dropped 0.21 cent, to 52.07 cents a gallon.

Dollar Off Again on Worry Over Clinton Economy Plan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower on world markets yesterday, hurt for the second consecutive day by concerns over President Clinton's economic package.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $331.00 a troy ounce, off $2 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold lost $1.90 an ounce to a late bid price of $330.10. 
 Dealers sold the dollar overnight in Europe, and the selling continued in spurts when trading shifted to domestic markets. "It's been the worst two days of the year," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
In the last two sessions, the dollar has fallen nearly 4 pfennigs against the German mark and neared post-war lows against the Japanese yen.
"The market is responding to the prospects of a slower economy and a heavier tax burden," Mr. Chandler said, referring to Mr. Clinton's plan.
Higher taxes will siphon off money from consumers and businesses alike, stemming economic growth, dealers fear.

Average Money Fund Yield Was Flat in Latest Week

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The average yields on money market funds were little changed in the latest reporting week, reflecting the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, analysts said yesterday.
"What we're seeing is the stability of the Federal Reserve policy of holding interest rates where they are now," said Walter S. Frank, the chief economist at The Money Fund Report, a research publication that tracks money market funds. 
 With rates stabilized, Mr. Frank said he doubted that the Fed would change course and raise interest rates, which would put a drag on the economy.
President Clinton's program to cut the deficit by raising taxes, he said, will create some slowdown in the economy. "You can't imagine the Fed coming over and creating additional drag by raising interest rates," he added.
According to The Money Fund Report, the average seven-day simple yield on taxable money market funds fell 2 basis points, or hundredths of percentage points, to 2.71 percent in the latest reporting week. The average compounded seven-day yield was down a basis point, to 2.75 percent.
The publication said the average 30-day simple yield fell a basis point, to 2.74 percent, while the average 30-day compounded yield was also down a basis point, to 2.78 percent.
The average days to maturity for securities held by taxable funds was unchanged at 61 days. Total assets in taxable money market funds dropped by $9.8 billion, to $477.8 billion.
 
Top Funds
 The top-yielding taxable general-purpose fund was the Olde Premium Money Market, with a seven-day yield of 3.57 percent. The fund is distributed by the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
Another top-yielding fund was United Services Government Securities Savings, which invests only in Government securities and had a seven-day compounded yield of 3.62 percent. It is distributed by United Services Advisors Inc. of San Antonio.
For tax-exempt funds, the average simple seven-day yield was down 6 basis points, to 1.92 percent, and the compounded yield was also down 6 basis points, to 1.94 percent. The average 30-day simple yield was up 4 basis points, to 1.94 percent, and the 30-day compounded yield was also up 4 basis points, to 1.96 percent.
The average days to maturity in tax-exempt funds was 53 days, unchanged. Assets of tax-exempt money market funds increased by $365 million, to $102.5 billion.
The top-yielding tax-exempt fund was the Evergreen Tax Exempt Money Market Fund, with a rate of 2.66 percent, down 5 basis points from the pervious week. The fund is distributed by Evergreen Asset Management of Purchase, N.Y.

Owners Link Salaries To Revenue Sharing

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Major league club owners took what they viewed as a major step today toward forging a new economic relationship with the players. The owners' action, though, didn't prompt the players' union chief to run outside his Manhattan office and do cartwheels down Third Avenue.
The owners, meeting for the sixth time in less than six months, established in a unanimous vote a "linkage" between revenue sharing on their part and a salary cap on the players' part. 
 "We're saying today there is linkage between these two things," Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers, chairman of the major league executive council, said at a news briefing. "It's often been said by the Players Association, let them solve their own problems first. Let them go to revenue sharing. The clubs took a step today to acknowledge there is a direct linkage."
 
Fehr Is Unconvinced
 Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, reacted skeptically to the owners' action.
"Just because they said so doesn't make it so," Fehr said by telephone from his office in New York. "Maybe one day they'll explain to us what the linkage is. I'm glad they did it; I'm sure they got an enhanced feeling of solidarity. I hope they feel better. But the real linkage is the big-market owners won't share with small-market owners unless the players give them back the money. That's the only linkage we've heard about."
The vote came during a presentation to the owners by Richard Ravitch, their chief labor executive, who has been lobbying among them in recent months for a plan under which the 28 clubs would share more of their revenue than they do now.
Ravitch has emphasized that the players will not accept a salary cap without increased revenue sharing among the clubs. The owners want the players to accept a percentage of their revenue for their salaries; they call it revenue participation, but in reality it creates a salary cap.
Clubs currently share national television revenue equally, and they receive minor shares of local cable revenue and home gate receipts. But small-market clubs say it has become increasingly difficult for them to compete fairly with large-market clubs because of the great disparity in local television and radio revenue, as well as gate receipts.
Large-market clubs, in the past, have opposed such sharing, but the views of some apparently are changing. For example, Peter O'Malley of the Los Angeles Dodgers long had vigorously opposed other clubs dipping into the Dodgers' lucrative local revenues, but he recently has indicated a willingness to share at least some portion of that money.
A major league official said that even George Steinbrenner of the Yankees, an ardent opponent of greater revenue sharing, has said he would be willing to explore the idea. The Mets, however, are said to remain adamantly opposed to a new sharing plan.
Ravitch has not proposed a specific revenue-sharing plan. When he does, the unanimous vote that occurred today may not be so unanimous. Clubs might be willing to accept the philosophy of the idea but balk at the reality when they see the percentages Ravitch has in mind. Moreover, if the players reject a salary cap, the owners' revenue-sharing intentions most likely would evaporate.
Ravitch left immediately after the meeting and was not present at Selig's news briefing.
"We don't have a specific plan," said Selig, a major proponent of the idea. "But I'd say it's more than philosophical. While you don't come to a specific result, you come to a practical conclusion of establishing the linkage that 28 clubs acknowledge exists. There is a definite relationship between the two. One can't exist without the other. The clubs now start with an economic premise. You can't get one without the other."
The players, however, have always balked at the implementation of a salary cap. They say they have to be shown the current system isn't working before they would consider a new system.
 
Reports Is Finished
 Among other matters, Selig said the long-awaited report from the restructuring committee, which will define the commissioner's role and authority, has been completed. He said it will be sent to him in a day or two.
Selig said the committee studying possible realignment of the leagues should have its report completed either by the next meetings March 3-4 or the meetings, as yet unscheduled, after that.
The committee designated to search for a new commissioner met for the first time today. Some owners want the committee to wait until baseball's other major matters -- a new labor agreement, new television contracts and realignment of the leagues and playoffs -- are resolved before selecting a commissioner.

HEADLINE: Welfare Compromise for Auto Makers

 BODY:
Trucks carry cargo. Cars carry passengers. The distinction is obvious to everyone -- except Detroit auto makers. They're pressuring the Clinton Administration to reclassify Japanese minivans and sports utility vehicles as trucks.
The Big Three aren't confused, just greedy. Once minivans are mislabeled as trucks, tariffs would automatically rise from 2.5 percent to a whopping 25 percent. 
 The tariff hike would drive Japanese minivans out of the U.S. market and provide cover for the Big Three to jack up minivan prices by $1,500 or more -- a blow to the middle-class families President Clinton swore to protect.
If that's not bad enough, there are two other reasons to oppose the tariff hike. It would not create many jobs for auto workers. Detroit already controls over 90 percent of the minivan market and thus wouldn't reap many additional sales as the Japanese drop out, especially if minivan prices soar. And reclassification would likely be ruled in violation of international trade rules, leading to Japanese retaliation against U.S. exports.
Three strikes, but Mr. Clinton will probably grant Detroit's wish anyway. He promised as much during the Presidential election campaign. To woo Michigan voters he attacked the Bush Administration's decision to keep minivans classified as cars. Coming off his economic speech, in which he proposed tax hikes on the middle class, the President is unlikely to renege on another campaign pledge.
But there's a middle ground, proposed by Representative Charles Schumer of New York. He calls on Mr. Clinton to tie reclassification to a pledge by the Big Three that they will not increase minivan prices faster than inflation. Should they try, the tariff would come tumbling back down.
The pledge would provide a measure of protection for consumers. But it isn't a perfect solution. Who will check that Detroit doesn't try to get around the pledge by imposing hidden price hikes -- for example, by removing expensive accessories from its minivans?
Yet Mr. Schumer's two-sided bargain fits well with Mr. Clinton's campaign theme of a "new covenant" between citizens and government. If reciprocal obligations make sense for welfare-seeking families, why shouldn't the President demand no less from welfare-seeking corporations?

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton's Moment

 BODY:
New Presidents are given very few opportunities to define themselves to the country and define what they expect from the country. Some seize the chance, some don't, but the truth is that these moments of definition rarely return.
Bill Clinton's address to Congress and the nation last night on economic policy was just such a moment. He knew that and tried to seize it. Battles are sure to be fought over the details of his program, but Mr. Clinton cannot be faulted for squandering his chance to stake his turf. 
 It was also a moment rich with irony: the last President to use this setting so ambitiously was Ronald Reagan. Twelve years ago, Mr. Reagan appeared before Congress with his own economic package wrapped in a beautiful dream. There can be gain without pain, he said; cut taxes and watch the economy soar.
Last night, from the same podium, Mr. Clinton pronounced that dream dead, and offered in its place the wholly contrary notion that, after a decade of fiscal excess, there can be no gain without pain, and plenty of it.
The success of Mr. Clinton's proposals will depend on two things: whether, taken together, they are perceived as fair; and whether they are seen to be the correct response, immediately and in the long term, to two decades of sluggish productivity and wages. The program he announced last night is a credible attempt to meet both challenges.
First, he stressed fairness. The rich would pay the most, largely in increased income taxes. The middle class would shoulder its share of the burden largely through increased energy taxes. Corporate America would pay more, and Government programs would be trimmed.
As to economic strategy, Mr. Clinton squarely faced a conundrum: The U.S. suffers two problems that cannot be solved with the same medicine. In the short run, factories are idle and millions of Americans remain unemployed or underemployed despite the fact that recovery is more than a year old. For this problem, Mr. Clinton proposes a $30 billion stimulus package that temporarily increases the deficit.
In the long term, the economy suffers from too little saving and therefore too little investment and growth. That's the reason middle-income households are suffering. People cannot earn more until productivity rises faster. To solve this problem, Mr. Clinton proposes substantial increases in public investment in infrastructure, training and education and tax subsidies for private investors.
The centerpiece of his strategy is a deficit reduction package consisting of $500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases spread over four years. That will free needed funds for the private capital markets. By 1997 the deficit would fall to about $200 billion -- a fiscally prudent target.
Indeed, if Mr. Clinton has erred he has done so on the side of making his stimulus too brief and his deficit reduction too hasty. The economy could stand serious stimulus in 1993 and 1994; but under the Clinton plan, deficit reduction kicks in during 1994, offsetting the effect of the stimulus package. The plan would be less risky if he upped the stimulus package and postponed the long-term deficit reduction until 1995.
But this timetable reflects Mr. Clinton's political judgment, and it is a gamble he may win.
The Clinton plan is 180 degrees away from the Reagan economic plan delivered 12 years ago. Mr. Reagan stimulated the economy by increasing consumption and defense spending; Mr. Clinton would do so with investment -- the only way to spur long-term economic security. Mr. Reagan based his plan on phony budget estimates; Mr. CLinton's estimates -- subject to careful screening over the next couple of weeks -- seem honest in their economics and canny in their politics.
After several weeks of floundering, Bill Clinton has given focus to his Presidency by seizing on exactly the same issue that eventually gave definition to his campaign: the economy.
The difference is that he presents the issue more honestly. Gone is the pretense that he could resurrect the economy merely by soaking the rich and taxing foreign companies. Gone is the promise that he could grant tax relief to the middle class. In their place is a summons to Congress "to break the old habits of both political parties" and to help him deliver on his commitment to restore the economy.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Great Leap Backward

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
That squishy sound you heard throughout President Clinton's economic address -- the weakness at the core of his proposals -- is a refusal to deal with the explosion of Federal spending.
A decade ago, Speaker Tip O'Neill snookered President Reagan in a deficit reduction deal: For one dollar in tax increase, promised the Democrat, Congress would cut three dollars in spending. Never happened; Democrats claim there never was a deal. 
 Three years ago, George Bush made the "deficit reduction deal" with Democrats that helped torpedo his Presidency: For every dollar in new taxes, two dollars were to be cut in spending. But taxes were front-loaded and spending cuts back-loaded; the deficit soared.
Now we have similar snake oil from Mr. Clinton. Only weeks ago, we heard from his budget chief that for every dollar in new taxes, two dollars would be cut out of the spending stream. Now even that ephemeral goal has been abandoned: it's to be "in rough balance" -- a dollar cut for a dollar taxed.
Even if that were true, contrary to all recent experience, such "balance" would mean that the debt would continue to grow because each year's deficit compounds itself.
In the storm of projections, keep in mind a few bedrock principles:
Economic stimulus -- jargon for "government spending" -- adds to the deficit, the interest on which is killing us. Accept no Clintonite protestations that this is just for now, and next year, boyoboy will they become deficit-cutters. Never happens.
Higher taxes do not help, and could abort, a recovery. We're on the way back up to brisk growth, with productivity increasing; now is not the time to snatch money out the pockets of people able to spend it.
A true fair sharing of the pain would be to reduce our debt by slowing the growth of government services, not to take more tax money for more services. No wonder we have seen so little of Lloyd Bentsen in the pre-speech hype: Clinton's plan, rather than "growing the economy," grows the Government.
Cutting the deficit is not an excuse for raising taxes when you are not really cutting the deficit.
Now we are at the heart of the matter. Mr. Clinton, sold as "a different kind of Democrat," is the same kind of Democrat on economics: he is answering the Reagan revolution with a plan for a Clinton counter-revolution. His promised "new direction" is a reversion to 1979.
How to sell this Great Leap Backward? In 1971 Richard Nixon told his aides, "We've got to have a villain." We tried to make inflation the villain, which led to the misbegotten wage-price freeze, but not until anti-war demonstrations engulfed the Democrats did a villain emerge that guaranteed Nixon's re-election.
In his post-election campaign, Clinton has selected no fewer than four villains to be the anvil on which he hammers counter-revolution.
The first is "the rich," the definition of which has widened to all those not poor. He takes this sanctimonious appeal to class warfare from F.D.R.'s blast at "economic royalists."
Second is the "special interests," Truman's villain, now defined as those lobbyists and lawyers outside the Clinton Cabinet who oppose proposals to raise taxes, slash defense or treat Social Security as welfare.
Villain number three is the pharmaceutical industry, for the sin of conspicuous success. Price controls on children's vaccines have populist appeal, but if advertising is penalized and price controls on new drugs result in shortages, black markets and cutbacks in medical research, this villain will be quickly de-demonized.
The fourth villain is the one most despised: that ol' debbil deficit. Its puissance was exploited by Ross Perot, who could rightly claim that the debt begun by Democrats was tripled under Republican Presidents.
"Revenue to lower the deficit" is cited by Clinton as the reason for his flip-flop on a middle-class tax cut. His excuse is that deficit projections leaped after his election, but that stretches a wild guess about 1997 from the Democratic Congressional Budget Office (Clinton's favorite projector). The high projection justifies tax-hike plans he concealed from the electorate in 1992, and makes it easier to come under in the 1996 campaign.
In Monday's infelicitous "call to arms," and in last night's "new directions" ramble, Bill Clinton raised taxes, raised spending, raised deficits and raised doubts.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Fearing Voters . . .

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Candidate Clinton tried to teach Americans a critical lesson -- that domestic policy is foreign policy is domestic policy. But President Clinton seems to be running away from world affairs, fearful of displeasing voters who might think him overly engaged abroad and insufficiently attentive to America. And through his tentativeness, he could be inadvertently encouraging the very isolationist impulses he warned against during the campaign -- and jeopardizing his mantle of leadership.
So far, Mr. Clinton has kept international issues at arm's length, at least publicly. And last night, in the space usually reserved for the State of the Union address, he offered an economic speech, serving to shield his deliberate scanting of the outside world. 
 Voters, particularly the volatile middle class, do want Mr. Clinton to focus on fixing up America, and he must heed them. But he may be overreading their signals and treading far more cautiously in foreign affairs than politically necessary or internationally wise.
Most Americans in opinion surveys consistently tell the President two things: Put America's problems first. But also play a leadership role in the world -- and especially tend to humanitarian crises such as Somalia and Bosnia.
The "America first" message is so stark as to brace even the most internationally minded President. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll asked people to rank government priorities. Reducing the deficit came first with 31 percent, then stimulating economic growth with 24 percent, followed by reforming the health care system with 18 percent. Only 4 percent of the respondents gave top priority to foreign policy issues.
Americans answering a New York Times/CBS News Poll last week underlined those anti-internationalist priorities. Asked about the current level of military spending, 39 percent said it was about right, 6 percent said it was too low -- and 50 percent said it was too high. Fifty percent support for cutting Pentagon spending is incredibly high, perhaps a record high.
Hearing these hoofbeats, Mr. Clinton disappeared from the Bosnia crisis. Quite deliberately, Secretary of State Christopher, not Mr. Clinton, presented the Administration's approach last week.
In search of the middle-class mind, CBS's "Sunday Morning" news program recently visited Sioux Falls, S.D., and asked a resident what he would like to hear from Mr. Clinton in his upcoming address. "Let's get out -- get out of the other countries and let's pay attention to what the people need in this country," came the clarion call. "He's our President, not their President."
It is hard not to be overwhelmed by such forthright demands, and Mr. Clinton's address last night demonstrated he was listening -- too well. Which means he is not fully hearing the public's second message, namely that most Americans do not want to scamper away from tough situations abroad.
In a Times/CBS Poll last month, 69 percent favored the U.S. military intervention in Somalia. Eighty-four percent said they would approve of military action against Iraq if Saddam Hussein violated U.N. restrictions. While the responses on Bosnia were somewhat contradictory, particularly on the issue of European versus U.S. responsibility, 67 percent favored sending U.S. troops to get food and medicine through to needy civilians.
These remarkably high percentages strongly suggest most Americans will back using U.S. military power where humanitarian or strategic stakes are high and where policy is clearly explained. Put another way, whatever Americans are saying today about domestic priorities, they will hold Mr. Clinton accountable if he abdicates world leadership, if foreign leaders complain of a weak Washington, or if world crises are not contained.
Mr. Clinton may well misunderstand the public's unhappiness with George Bush's priorities. Many middle-class swing voters rejected Mr. Bush not because he paid so much attention to foreign affairs, but because he paid so little attention to America.
Mr. Clinton justified his speech's near-total inward focus by arguing these are not ordinary times. He's right. In extraordinary times like these, there is no alternative to America's world leadership. His campaign litany -- domestic policy is foreign policy is domestic policy -- still rings true, and still needs preaching.

HEADLINE: There They Go Again

BYLINE: By Ronald Reagan; Ronald Reagan, President from 1981 to 1989, heads the Reagan Center for Public Affairs.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Less than one month ago, our nation showed the world the strength of our democratic system with the peaceful transfer of Presidential power from one elected citizen to another and, incidentally, from one political party to another. While it is no secret that I would have preferred a different scenario that day, I have great respect for our constitutional system and would like to support our new President.
I had every intention of holding back any comments on the new Administration until it was well in place and its policies became clear. Unfortunately, the policies are already becoming alarmingly clear. With campaign promises dropping like autumn leaves, I can't refrain any longer. 
 "First, we're going to raise the taxes on the people that did well in the 1980's," the Clinton Administration says. Did I hear that right? I'm afraid so! Do they really believe that those who have worked hard and been successful should somehow be punished for it? Is success in the 1980's, or any time for that matter, supposed to be something we as Americans are to be embarrassed about?
I hate to confuse their economic thinking with a few facts, but if they were to look at the 1980's, they would find that America experienced its longest period of peacetime economic expansion in our history. They would find that America led the world out of a global economic recession and that our economy was the envy of virtually every other nation. They would see that we created nearly 19 million new jobs for Americans of all income levels. And it may shock the Clinton Administration to discover that most of the economic gains of the 1980's were made by low- and middle-income citizens, not the wealthiest Americans.
Earlier this week, President Clinton said, "I know we have learned the hard lessons of the 1980's." I didn't realize they were so hard to learn. The fundamental lesson of the 1980's was that when you cut taxes for everyone, people have the incentive to work harder and invest, to make a better life for themselves and their families.
If the new Administration doesn't want to look back as far as the 1980's, maybe it will at least look back at the summer of 1992. Candidate Bill Clinton was promising that, if elected, he would provide a tax cut for the middle class. Now, in less than one month of his Presidency, that promise of a tax cut has not only been broken but it has been reversed into a tax increase for middle-income workers.
During the campaign, Bill Clinton said he would tax only the very rich. Last week, he defined this category as those making $200,000 a year. On Monday, the definition came down to $100,000 and now the "very rich" seems to be anyone making $30,000 a year.
Somehow, as the Administration raises everyone's taxes, it wants us to take comfort in knowing that others are getting theirs raised even more. Unfortunately, that kind of "comfort" doesn't put food on the table of the hard-working middle class, buy new shoes for the kids or make it easier to pay the mortgage, let alone put some money aside for savings. The fact is, every dollar the politicians take back to Washington means less spending power for average Americans and more opportunity for the Federal bureaucracy to waste money.
We must also listen for the sound of the other shoe to drop: the Clintons' health program. This will almost certainly involve proposals for another round of taxes later this year, and you can bet those won't be levied on a handful of millionaires.
In the Middle Ages, it was believed that alchemists could turn base metals into gold. Now it appears that alchemists in President Clinton's Administration hope to turn a huge tax increase into economic growth. Alchemy didn't work then and it won't work now. Taxes have never succeeded in promoting economic growth. More often than not, they have led to greater economic downturns.
In his campaign, candidate Clinton described himself as a "new Democrat," implying that there would be no more tax-and-spend dogma, no social engineering, no class warfare pitting one group against another. This week, however, he has begun to sound like an "old Democrat." That's the kind who does not understand one simple fact: the problem is not that the people are taxed too little, the problem is that the Government spends too much.
Until President Clinton and the liberals in Congress accept that principle and act accordingly, I'm afraid we are headed for a repeat of the late 1970's. And that is something we can all live without.
No one can dispute that the enormous budget deficit is a major threat to the economic security of our country. But let us remember that deficits are caused by spending. By the very terms of our Constitution, only Congress has the power to spend.
For more than four decades, one party, the Democratic Party, has controlled the House of Representatives. The solution to the deficit problem is not to ask heavily taxed working Americans to "sacrifice" even more.
It's the big-spending liberals controlling the Congress who need to show some restraint and "sacrifice" a few of the pork-barrel measures they've been slipping past the taxpayers for far too long. Only when the Clinton Administration and Congress summon the will to put the brakes on Federal spending will they get the deficit under control.
While I'm flattered that President Clinton admits to taking a page out of my communications plan, I wish he'd use it to sell an economic program of growth and expansion, not the failed liberal policies of the past.
Just as positive signs of economic recovery are appearing, Mr. President, please don't blow it. Although it goes back well before the 1980's, may I offer you the advice of the 14th century Arab historian Ibn Khaldun, who said: "At the beginning of the empire, the tax rates were low and the revenues were high. At the end of the empire, the tax rates were high and the revenues were low."
And, no, I did not personally know Ibn Khaldun, although we may have had some friends in common!

HEADLINE: America's Better Self Got Lost in Aliens Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We share A. M. Rosenthal's sense of solidarity with immigrants in "Aliens: Let Them Work" (column, Feb. 9). A nation of immigrants, the United States has at various stages of history turned its back on its best self and let its fearful face show. Xenophobia and racism -- both strong currents in American life -- often combine in the making of immigration policy. 
 The American Friends Service Committee and many others who work closely with today's immigrant communities opposed employer sanctions when the 1986 immigration law was under consideration. Our fundamental objection to the proposed law was that we saw the sanctions provision as a denial of a strong religious tradition in this country that calls on us to welcome the stranger.
We saw the employer-sanctions provision as leading to discrimination in hiring by employers, who would reject a foreign-looking applicant, rather than risk hiring undocumented people. Such has proved to be the case. We saw the provision as leading to a market in forged documents. Such a market thrives.
We saw the employer-sanctions provision creating a highly vulnerable group of employees, unable to protect themselves from economic exploitation and other abuse. This has come to pass: witness the new sweatshops across the country.
We saw the law as asking employers to be part of a governmental effort designed to starve immigrants out, to drive them home again and to deter others from coming -- to become, as Mr. Rosenthal says, "an unpaid work-police."
The issues immigration policy seeks to address would be better dealt with by investment in enforcement of labor laws concerning fair wages and working conditions for all workers, documented or undocumented, meaningful foreign debt relief and international economic cooperation directed to achieve sustainable development. Let us welcome the stranger. Let us repeal employer sanctions.

HEADLINE: America's Better Self Got Lost in Aliens Law;
'Victims' Who Exploit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I cannot fathom why Anthony Lewis and others have painted Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, President Clinton's first two nominees for Attorney General, as victims of a male-dominated society simply because they employed illegal aliens as child care workers (column, Feb. 8). 
 Admittedly I am not a mother or a highly paid professional woman. However, I have worked with immigrant rights groups, and I can tell you the main reason people employ illegal aliens is that they will work for much less, and because of their tenuous status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service they are more compliant and more easily exploited.
With regard to the consequences of the actions of Ms. Baird, Judge Wood and any men whose wives have employed illegal aliens, this is not about keeping women in their place. I wish somebody would keep me in my place as a Federal district judge or a $500,000-a-year general counsel for a Fortune 500 company.
If these women were low- or middle-income workers who would be put into a serious financial bind by paying the prevailing rate for legal nannies, I might feel different. However, this issue has nothing to do with feminism and everything to do with the wanton, callous, capitalistic exploitation of the reserve army of the unemployed.
We've come a long way, baby. Is this the direction we want to continue going in?

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Will Emerge Stronger

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Behind Japan's Economic Crisis" (Op-Ed, Feb. 1): Isn't Akio Mikuni's description of Japan's economic difficulties, as reflected in a sharp stock market decline over the last two and a half years and by declining growth, rather exaggerated? 
 It is true the Ministry of Finance has exercised extraordinary powers over Japan's financial community for the better part of four decades. With the Bank of Japan, the ministry did indeed ration credit as it guided the country's reconstruction after World War II.
But over the last two decades the Ministry of Finance has changed course and turned toward a policy Mr. Mikuni seems to ignore: it has both liberalized and internationalized Japan's financial markets.
During the 1970's and 80's, when I was assigned to the United States Embassy in Tokyo, my colleagues and I observed a series of important changes that have transformed the entire Japanese financial system.
Gone are the days when American brokerage houses couldn't be members of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, when Japanese corporations preferred to raise funds in London and New York, instead of Tokyo, and when the ministry decreed the interest rates banks paid their depositors.
As Mr. Mikuni notes, Japan's banks and brokerage houses overextended themselves with cheap credit for speculation on stocks and real estate during the late 80's, and many will soon be paying the piper.
But this is not necessarily the complete disaster Mr. Mikuni says it is. From the wreckage there will surely emerge a healthier, stronger and more competitive Japanese financial industry, one in which American companies will be active participants.

HEADLINE: Keep Electric Boat Busy in Post-Cold War Era

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You have been reporting that the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Conn., will have large layoffs in connection with the end of the cold war and a reduced need for new submarines (front page, Feb. 9). The facility evidently must be subsidized to preserve it to make submarines, should the need arise. 
 In connection with the need to keep this facility intact, someone should point out that Electric Boat could not be better situated and equipped to build modular tunnel sections for sinking into an underwater trench to construct a new underwater highway and rail connection between Orient Point on Long Island and New London in Connecticut. Such a tunnel might well pay for itself from toll revenue without any net cost to the government at all. The improved transportation access between Long Island and New England would aid the economies of both regions. The Electric Boat facility could remain fully em ployed on the project for a decade, while remaining intact for the manufacture of submarines as national security needs might dictate.
Defense industries are national resources that should be preserved by putting them to work on civil infrastructure improvements that will pay for themselves. Electric Boat could build a marvelous tunnel and remain ready to build new submarines. There can be no better time to begin a tunnel across Long Island Sound and no better facility than Electric Boat to build it.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Overview;
CLINTON PLAN TO REMAKE THE ECONOMY SEEKS TO TAX ENERGY AND BIG INCOMES

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton tonight proposed a comprehensive program of tax increases and spending cuts designed to trim the Federal deficit over the next four years by $500 billion, or 38 percent, and to revitalize the nation's economy.
In a speech to a joint session of Congress that is expected to shape at least the early stages of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton outlined a series of new taxes that would fall most heavily on business and on relatively wealthy individuals, both active and retired. But families earning as little as $20,000 a year -- members of the "forgotten middle class" whose taxes he promised during his campaign to cut -- will also be asked to send more dollars to Washington under the President's plan. 
 Largely because of a new energy tax, the average middle class family of four would pay about $17 a month more under Mr. Clinton's program.
 
Spending to Create Jobs
 Mr. Clinton was exuberantly greeted by Congressional Democrats who had waited a dozen years to see a President of their party among them. He said pointedly, "Americans have called for change, and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them," and spoke as a believer in the efficacy of government to a nation that views Washington with deep skepticism. [Transcript, pages A20-21.]
Hoping to convince voters that he is different from the free-spending liberal Democrats of the past, Mr. Clinton said he intended to cut military spending by $76 billion more than previously announced and to slash spending on more than 150 civil projects ranging from the space station to agricultural subsidies. He called as well for a freeze on all Government salaries and limits on payments doctors and hospitals receive under Medicare.
But the President also offered $30 billion in additional spending on such projects as highways and summer jobs, designed to rev up the economy over the next six months. The goal is to create 500,000 jobs by the end of next year, he said -- a start on the 8 million he hopes to create by 1997.
 
Stressing Fairness of Plan
 "This economic plan is ambitious, but I honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the United States, and I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting Government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past," said the President, who tinkered with his text all day, then used it only as a guide.
He is "asking more Americans to contribute today," Mr. Clinton added, stating his political theme, "so that all of us can prosper tomorrow."
"The test of this plan cannot be: What is in it for me?" the President said. "It has got to be: What is in it for us?"
The prospects of the plan, on which the President has worked for weeks and on which he is staking much of his political well-being, are uncertain. It is a substantial gamble, taken in the first month of his first term, when his political leverage should be at its strongest. It will work only if he can persuade the public that the proposed taxes are fair, that new revenues will really be used to cut the deficit and that the proposed cuts are genuine.
 
Plea to Accept Whole Package
 Only at the end of his address, which was televised nationally, did the President turn to taxes, and when he did he begged his listeners not to focus on one or two items.
"This economic plan can't please everybody," he conceded. "If the package is picked apart, there'll be something that will anger each of us, won't please anybody. But if it is taken as a whole, it will help all of us. So I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't made."
Led by Ronald Reagan, whose policies Mr. Clinton seeks to reverse, Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives accused Mr. Clinton of reverting to the Democrats' old "tax and spend" traditions. Democrats on Capitol Hill quickly made loyal noises but also reported heavily anti-Clinton telephone calls and said that modifications could be expected.
In a televised rebuttal, the leader of the Republican minority in the House, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, warned the country: "When you hear a Democrat call for taxes, do not ask for whom the tax rises; it will rise for you."
 
Importance of Perot
 Although the same party now controls Congress and the White House for the first time since 1980, the task facing Mr. Clinton remains onerous. Members of Congress are more susceptible in the era of mass communications to constituent pressures than to Presidential entreaties and White House favors.
The attitude of Ross Perot, whose Presidential candidacy last year drew almost 19 percent of the total vote, could have a major impact on public attitudes. In his campaign, he called for deficit reduction and budgetary honesty, and Mr. Clinton telephoned him today to seek his backing.
After working so long on his speech that the text was not available until moments before he walked into the House chamber, Mr. Clinton used what he and his staff had drafted only as an outline, looping in and out of the printed document the way a stump speaker does during a campaign.
He insisted that his was not a State of the Union message and said at the start that he would confine himself to the economy. But he talked as well about campaign reform and health care and gun control in his 58-minute speech.
The Cabinet, the Supreme Court, the members of Congress and the Diplomatic Corps were arrayed beneath the lectern as the President spoke. Many of his staunchest supporters were in the balcony, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an outfit of brilliant red, flanked by two important economic players: Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and John Sculley, the chairman of Apple Computer, who has been one of Mr. Clinton's main business backers.
In his speech, the President asked the nation to take some bitter medicine, not unlike that proposed last year by a rival in the primaries, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. Such an approach helped doom Jimmy Carter's Presidency and wrecked the 1984 Presidential campaign of Walter F. Mondale.
 
Putting Promises Aside
 Mr. Clinton and his advisers believe that Americans now consider the deficit more repugnant than higher taxes. But it has been difficult for Presidents in the last quarter-century to generate public commitments to large-scale projects like the broad attack on the nation's economic ills that the President's plan constitutes.
As George Bush discovered when voters turned on him after he broke his vow not to raise taxes, broken promises have proven to be electoral poison, and Mr. Clinton ignored some of his campaign pledges, retreated from others and contradicted still others in his economic presentation tonight. His political strategists can only hope the commentators and the public focus on deficit-busting rather than on promise-busting in the coming months.
The skittishness of public opinion and business sentiment was exemplified by an 83-point drop in the stock market on Tuesday after a speech in which Mr. Clinton dwelt on taxes.
Perhaps the most sweeping of the taxes proposed by the President is a new levy on energy that would raise prices on gasoline, natural gas, coal and heating oil -- and on manufactured goods whose production consumes energy. He also proposed raising the top tax rate to 36 from 31 percent on individuals with taxable incomes of more than $115,000 and couples with taxable incomes of more than $140,000.
 
Revoking Gains of 80's
 Mr. Clinton urged Congress to enact higher corporate taxes, impose a surtax on families earning $250,000 a year or more, raise the taxes employers and employees pay to support Medicare and increase the taxes on Social Security benefits for more well-off recipients. He suggested an increase in various government fees, like those for grazing livestock on Federal lands.
To further boost his job-creation program, however, the President offered a tax break to businesses. Big companies would be rewarded for increased spending on new equipment in 1993 and 1994, and firms with gross receipts under $5 million would permanently enjoy such investment tax credits.
Mr. Clinton said he wanted a four-year, $160-billion package of increased spending -- which would, of course, partly offset his spending cuts. It would be concentrated on transportation facilities, including highway construction, mass transit, high-speed rail links and improvements at aging airports.
According to government tax analysts, about 57 percent of Mr. Clinton's total tax increase of about $60 billion a year would be paid by those with annual incomes of $200,000 and over. The President argues that they profited most from the tax cuts of the 1980's and must therefore bear the heaviest burden in the future.
 
Striking Perk for the Rich
 Hoping to give his program as strong a populist cast as possible, Mr. Clinton went after the wealthy in a number of ways, starting with the new 36 percent top rate on high earners. The maximum rate on capital gains, however, would stay at 28 percent. A 10 percent surtax would be imposed on people with taxable incomes, excluding capital gains, over $250,000 -- mostly millionaires, according to the Treasury.
Furthermore, all wages, not just the first $135,000 a year, would be subject to the 1.45 percent tax that pays for Medicare, the vast program of health care for the elderly and disabled. In a flourish of disdain for the perks of the rich, the President proposed to eliminate the deductibility of club dues and cut the percentage of expense-account spending qualifying for business deductions to 50 from 80 percent.
 A front-page article about the economic plan referred imprecisely to the amount by which it would reduce the Federal budget deficit. The miscalculation is discussed today in an article on page A15.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 19, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page summary of the Clinton economic proposals yesterday described a proposed income tax change incorrectly in some copies. The proposed surtax would raise the tax rate on taxable income above $250,000 by 10 percent, from a rate of 36 percent to one of 39.6 percent.
A table of case studies showing the impact of the proposal calculated the surtax incorrectly in one case. A family with a taxable income of $283,746 would owe a surtax of $1,215; the family's total tax would be $94,692, an increase of $12,545 over the tax bill under current rules.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The President's Day;
Clinton Is a Revisionist Even With His Writers

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Dozens of aides spent hundreds of hours of endless toil drafting the speech that President Clinton took to Capitol Hill with him tonight. But that was not the speech that Mr. Clinton actually delivered.
In the end, much of the President's address -- whole paragraphs even -- were completely ad libbed by a politician who loves nothing more than to tinker with, and rewrite, his own words. 
 As Mr. Clinton rambled on, one passage seemed to come out of nowhere, and provoked the extraordinary spectacle of loud, even disrespectful laughter from the Republican side of the House chamber. That was when Mr. Clinton talked about the "independent figures" from the Congressional Budget Office.
Undaunted by his opponents' derision of the budget office, which was virtually always at odds with Administration estimates of the Federal deficit and other important numbers in the Reagan and Bush years, Mr. Clinton forged on. "Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans," he joked. "But I'll point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative on what was going to happen and closer to right than previous Presidents."
 
An Unaccustomed Fact
 Besides the spontaneity in the speech, the scene was one that has not taken place in a Presidential address to Congress for more than 12 years. Throughout the terms of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, it was the Republican side of the aisle that always jumped first to standing ovations or wild acclaim for their party's President.
Tonight, the Democrats -- some of whom will no doubt pick apart Mr. Clinton's economic program in the days ahead -- reveled in the unaccustomed fact that their President belongs to their party.
But the mood in the hall seemed noticeably subdued at other times, as the camera panned to the deadpan, and sometimes grim-looking, faces of Mr. Clinton's aides. Robert Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, and Alice Rivlin, the White House deputy budget director, seemed exhausted from the ordeal of putting together the economic package.
Except for the occasional laughter, the Republicans paid their respects to the President. Even Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the outspoken House Republican whip, joined in several standing ovations at the beginning, including the prolonged greeting of the President as he entered the chamber. But by midway through the speech, Mr. Gingrich stayed stuck in his seat, offering no more than occasional tepid applause.
 
Writing and Rewriting
 Mr. Clinton's ad libbing seemed surprising since he had spent the day displaying the trait that sets him apart from his more disciplined predecessors: He likes to write, and rewrite and rewrite speeches until moments before he delivers them.
The fact that tonight's speech was the most important on the economy of any President since Ronald Reagan's in 1981 did not hasten the drafting process. Mr. Clinton was surprised to learn of the noon deadline to get the speech to the printers so it could be published and bound. (Needless to say, he missed the deadline; the speech was duplicated on copying machines.)
Congressional officials said it was the first time in at least 20 years that the White House did not distribute copies of the President's speech on Capitol Hill before Mr. Clinton's appearance.
When he was not seeking support for his economic program, Mr. Clinton shuttled between the Oval Office and the Roosevelt Room with a handful of aides, still trying to settle on the precise language he wanted to use to enlist support for the brew of tax increases and spending cuts that some feared would be unpopular.
As his speech writers stood by in frustration, Mr. Clinton reviewed the draft line by line, scrawling last-minute fixes in the margins in his illegible handwriting. He also thought out loud the passages he wanted in the speech as his aides scribbled every word. All day long, an ever-growing cadre of aides wandered in and out of the room to offer counsel.
 
More Cooks, More Soup
 Elsewhere in the West Wing, aides said Hillary Rodham Clinton was working with Robert E. Rubin, the economic policy adviser, to try to insert more human language in a section of the speech he had helped draft.
As if they were still in college cramming for that big final, three energetic speech writers, David Kusnet, David Dreyer and Michael Waldman, were said to have pulled an all-nighter at the White House Tuesday night, toiling over the speech that their boss reworked the next day.
It is harder, they say, to trim a speech than to make it longer. And the involvement of so many hands served only to elongate the speech. By the end of the day, White House aides said it had nearly doubled its original length, to more than an hour.
 
Pitch to Anchors and Perot
 Although Mr. Clinton fussed and toiled over the language, he never wavered in his aggressive salesmanship. He went so far as to invite the network anchors to the White House (no cameras allowed) for a private sales pitch over a lunch of mixed grill and broccoli. As the anchors took notes, Mr. Clinton put his own spin on major portions of the plan.
"This was a regular feature of the Reagan Administration, but it never occurred in the Bush Administration," said Peter Jennings of ABC News. "The purpose was obvious: to see to it that the people who are going to speak to the largest audiences tonight at least have the President's view of what he's trying to accomplish."
After lunch, Mr. Clinton called Ross Perot to seek his support, well aware that Mr. Perot, who made the deficit his central issue as a Presidential candidate last year, was scheduled to appear on the ABC News program "Nightline" after the address.
"He wanted to tell Mr. Perot what was in the package," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary. "He believes the package does many of the things that Perot called for in the campaign."
Mr. Clinton was known during last year's campaign for his down-to-the-wire massaging of speeches. So his aides said people should not be surprised that even a team of White House speech writers could not break him of the habit.
"He's not making changes for change's sake," said Bruce Reed, a domestic policy aide. "He poured his heart and soul into it."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Overview;
CLINTON PLAN TO REMAKE THE ECONOMY SEEKS TO TAX ENERGY AND BIG INCOMES

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton tonight proposed a comprehensive program of tax increases and spending cuts designed to trim the Federal deficit over the next four years by $500 billion, or 38 percent, and to revitalize the nation's economy.
In a speech to a joint session of Congress that is expected to shape at least the early stages of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton outlined a series of new taxes that would fall most heavily on business and on relatively wealthy individuals, both active and retired. But families earning as little as $20,000 a year -- members of the "forgotten middle class" whose taxes he promised during his campaign to cut -- will also be asked to send more dollars to Washington under the President's plan. 
 Largely because of a new energy tax, the average middle class family of four would pay about $17 a month more under Mr. Clinton's program.
 
Spending to Create Jobs
 Mr. Clinton was exuberantly greeted by Congressional Democrats who had waited a dozen years to see a President of their party among them. He said pointedly, "Americans have called for change, and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them," and spoke as a believer in the efficacy of government to a nation that views Washington with deep skepticism. [Transcript, pages A20-21.]
Hoping to convince voters that he is different from the free-spending liberal Democrats of the past, Mr. Clinton said he intended to cut military spending by $76 billion more than previously announced and to slash spending on more than 150 civil projects ranging from the space station to agricultural subsidies. He called as well for a freeze on all Government salaries and limits on payments doctors and hospitals receive under Medicare.
But the President also offered $30 billion in additional spending on such projects as highways and summer jobs, designed to rev up the economy over the next six months. The goal is to create 500,000 jobs by the end of next year, he said -- a start on the 8 million he hopes to create by 1997.
 
Stressing Fairness of Plan
 "This economic plan is ambitious, but I honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the United States, and I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting Government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past," said the President, who tinkered with his text all day, then used it only as a guide.
He is "asking more Americans to contribute today," Mr. Clinton added, stating his political theme, "so that all of us can prosper tomorrow."
"The test of this plan cannot be: What is in it for me?" the President said. "It has got to be: What is in it for us?"
The prospects of the plan, on which the President has worked for weeks and on which he is staking much of his political well-being, are uncertain. It is a substantial gamble, taken in the first month of his first term, when his political leverage should be at its strongest. It will work only if he can persuade the public that the proposed taxes are fair, that new revenues will really be used to cut the deficit and that the proposed cuts are genuine.
 
Plea to Accept Whole Package
 Only at the end of his address, which was televised nationally, did the President turn to taxes, and when he did he begged his listeners not to focus on one or two items.
"This economic plan can't please everybody," he conceded. "If the package is picked apart, there'll be something that will anger each of us, won't please anybody. But if it is taken as a whole, it will help all of us. So I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't made."
Led by Ronald Reagan, whose policies Mr. Clinton seeks to reverse, Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives accused Mr. Clinton of reverting to the Democrats' old "tax and spend" traditions. Democrats on Capitol Hill quickly made loyal noises but also reported heavily anti-Clinton telephone calls and said that modifications could be expected.
In a televised rebuttal, the leader of the Republican minority in the House, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, warned the country: "When you hear a Democrat call for taxes, do not ask for whom the tax rises; it will rise for you."
 
Importance of Perot
 Although the same party now controls Congress and the White House for the first time since 1980, the task facing Mr. Clinton remains onerous. Members of Congress are more susceptible in the era of mass communications to constituent pressures than to Presidential entreaties and White House favors.
The attitude of Ross Perot, whose Presidential candidacy last year drew almost 19 percent of the total vote, could have a major impact on public attitudes. In his campaign, he called for deficit reduction and budgetary honesty, and Mr. Clinton telephoned him today to seek his backing.
After working so long on his speech that the text was not available until moments before he walked into the House chamber, Mr. Clinton used what he and his staff had drafted only as an outline, looping in and out of the printed document the way a stump speaker does during a campaign.
He insisted that his was not a State of the Union message and said at the start that he would confine himself to the economy. But he talked as well about campaign reform and health care and gun control in his 58-minute speech.
The Cabinet, the Supreme Court, the members of Congress and the Diplomatic Corps were arrayed beneath the lectern as the President spoke. Many of his staunchest supporters were in the balcony, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an outfit of brilliant red, flanked by two important economic players: Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and John Sculley, the chairman of Apple Computer, who has been one of Mr. Clinton's main business backers.
In his speech, the President asked the nation to take some bitter medicine, not unlike that proposed last year by a rival in the primaries, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. Such an approach helped doom Jimmy Carter's Presidency and wrecked the 1984 Presidential campaign of Walter F. Mondale.
 
Putting Promises Aside
 Mr. Clinton and his advisers believe that Americans now consider the deficit more repugnant than higher taxes. But it has been difficult for Presidents in the last quarter-century to generate public commitments to large-scale projects like the broad attack on the nation's economic ills that the President's plan constitutes.
As George Bush discovered when voters turned on him after he broke his vow not to raise taxes, broken promises have proven to be electoral poison, and Mr. Clinton ignored some of his campaign pledges, retreated from others and contradicted still others in his economic presentation tonight. His political strategists can only hope the commentators and the public focus on deficit-busting rather than on promise-busting in the coming months.
The skittishness of public opinion and business sentiment was exemplified by an 83-point drop in the stock market on Tuesday after a speech in which Mr. Clinton dwelt on taxes.
Perhaps the most sweeping of the taxes proposed by the President is a new levy on energy that would raise prices on gasoline, natural gas, coal and heating oil -- and on manufactured goods whose production consumes energy. He also proposed raising the top tax rate to 36 from 31 percent on individuals with taxable incomes of more than $115,000 and couples with taxable incomes of more than $140,000.
 
Revoking Gains of 80's
 Mr. Clinton urged Congress to enact higher corporate taxes, impose a surtax on families earning $250,000 a year or more, raise the taxes employers and employees pay to support Medicare and increase the taxes on Social Security benefits for more well-off recipients. He suggested an increase in various government fees, like those for grazing livestock on Federal lands.
To further boost his job-creation program, however, the President offered a tax break to businesses. Big companies would be rewarded for increased spending on new equipment in 1993 and 1994, and firms with gross receipts under $5 million would permanently enjoy such investment tax credits.
Mr. Clinton said he wanted a four-year, $160-billion package of increased spending -- which would, of course, partly offset his spending cuts. It would be concentrated on transportation facilities, including highway construction, mass transit, high-speed rail links and improvements at aging airports.
According to government tax analysts, about 57 percent of Mr. Clinton's total tax increase of about $60 billion a year would be paid by those with annual incomes of $200,000 and over. The President argues that they profited most from the tax cuts of the 1980's and must therefore bear the heaviest burden in the future.
 
Striking Perk for the Rich
 Hoping to give his program as strong a populist cast as possible, Mr. Clinton went after the wealthy in a number of ways, starting with the new 36 percent top rate on high earners. The maximum rate on capital gains, however, would stay at 28 percent. A 10 percent surtax would be imposed on people with taxable incomes, excluding capital gains, over $250,000 -- mostly millionaires, according to the Treasury.
Furthermore, all wages, not just the first $135,000 a year, would be subject to the 1.45 percent tax that pays for Medicare, the vast program of health care for the elderly and disabled. In a flourish of disdain for the perks of the rich, the President proposed to eliminate the deductibility of club dues and cut the percentage of expense-account spending qualifying for business deductions to 50 from 80 percent.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: In the Nation;
A Split Congress Sits Back and Listens, and Waits

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Democratic lawmakers broadly supported President Clinton's economic proposals tonight but said the plans would have to be modified to win majority support in Congress. Republicans heaped scorn on the whole package, saying it would unfairly sock the middle class with new taxes.
But Ross Perot, who still seems to informally represent a bloc of swing votes Mr. Clinton will need to get his programs passed, said he thought it was "a good speech." The President was so eager for the support of Mr. Perot, who got 19 million votes as an independent candidate for President in the last election, that he briefed him on his economic proposals by telephone before delivering them to Congress. 
 "I thought it was a very positive speech," Mr. Perot said in an appearance on the ABC news program "Nightline." "I would expect the American people to react favorably to it."
 
Reserving Judgment
 But Mr. Perot made clear that he was reserving final judgment on the Clinton program until after "we get into the details, and I can hardly wait to see the details." He said he and his supporters were still "skeptical" about giving Congress more money to spend through higher taxes, and that he still favored a balanced budget amendment that would tightly control spending.
While senators and representatives were also quick to voice their opinions, which predictably split along party lines, Clinton aides said they were eager to see how the package was being received by the voters.
Before Mr. Clinton spoke, lawmakers of both parties said their telephones had been ringing nonstop all day, with calls running heavily against the President's proposals, based on his own presentation of the economic package in a preview speech that had been broadcast from the Oval Office on Monday night.
Even Democrats said telephone calls to their offices were largely negative -- as much as 50 to 1 against new taxes, which Mr. Clinton, significantly, did not mention until toward the end of his address.
 
Little Bipartisan Support
 Whether that initial opposition will reflect the public mood now that Mr. Clinton has laid out his full program and embarks on a national campaign to sell it is impossible to predict.
What is already clear is that Mr. Clinton is not going to get the immediate bipartisan support he hoped for from Capitol Hill. Republicans lost no time in signaling that they would not accept Mr. Clinton's program with the ease with which many Democrats accepted President Ronald Reagan's economic program 12 years ago.
Indeed, Mr. Reagan himself, in an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on Thursday, is leading the charge against Mr. Clinton's plan, dismissing it as another version of "the failed liberal policies of the past."
 
Blows From Republicans
 In the official Republican rebuttal to Mr. Clinton, the House minority leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, clearly tried to avoid appearing obstructionist, saying Republicans "want our new President to succeed."
Some of the new programs Mr. Clinton is proposing, Mr. Michel added, may even be "laudable," but paying for them will require too many new taxes from too many Americans.
"When you hear a Democrat call for taxes, do not ask for whom the tax rises; it will rise for you," he said.
Given the Republican opposition, Clinton aides said the success of the plan would depend on how much weight the Democratic leadership in Congress would put behind it, in the face of the expected public outcries about higher taxes. Democrats control both houses by substantial margins.
"I am convinced the Congress will enact the program in its overall dimensions," said Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington state. "It is not going to be every line of the President's recommendations, but I think in great substance it will be enacted."
Just as crucial will be whether Mr. Perot throws his support behind the plan. As the President's staff courted Mr. Perot and his supporters, the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said Mr. Clinton called Mr. Perot to brief him on the plan. "A lot of the things that the President is addressing in this economic plan are things that Mr. Perot agrees with," she said.
In the view of many lawmakers, Mr. Perot, and the swing voters who have followed him, may be more influential than the Republicans.
 
View From Wall Street
 On Wall Street, Morris W. Offit, the chairman of Offitbank, an investment bank, predicted that business would, after some initial grumbling, support the program. But Mr. Offit warned of trouble if the White House asked for additional taxes to pay for other social welfare programs of the sort advocated by the President's wife, Hillary. After a substantial decline on Tuesday, stocks were mixed today as investors awaited details of the Clinton plan.
Republicans did not even wait for Mr. Clinton's speech to begin disparaging his proposals. They spent day passing out buttons around Capitol Hill that said, "It's Spending, Stupid!" and "Tax and Spend. Again," while taking turns lambasting Mr. Clinton's proposals from the House and Senate floor.
The Republicans based their attacks on two themes. One is that Mr. Clinton's proposals would soak the middle class, not the rich, and that this is exactly the opposite of what he promised in the Presidential campaign. The other is that new taxes now will smother the economic recovery and that what Mr. Clinton should instead cut more spending.
Republicans also criticized Mr. Clinton for emphasizing the new programs he plans to introduce, while minimizing exactly how he will pay for them with new taxes.
"Christmas came early," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader. "We haven't seen the spending cuts. He talked about what he's giving away, and that's about it."
Democrats, in the meantime, rallied behind Mr. Clinton, accusing the Republicans of trying to drum up hysteria. But behind their display of unity, many lawmakers expressed private concern about the public mood. Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said the President was going to have to "spend every day of the next 30" explaining his plan.
"Nobody likes taxes," said Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. "I assume Clinton wants to be fair, and from what I interpret, he is fair."
 
Deluge of Calls
 Nevertheless, lawmakers from both parties said their phones had been jammed for the past two days. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said he received "an overwhelming volume of calls" -- 50 to 1 -- opposed to tax increases. Elderly voters, in particular, were urging cuts in welfare rather than in Social Security payments or Medicare.
The initial negative reaction could be reversed by Mr. Clinton's public relations efforts, starting tonight. And early reactions to economic programs always change over time, especially when there are taxes involved.
But what the calls before the speech did suggest, lawmakers said, is that the President's speech on Monday night may have backfired. He had intended it to lay the political groundwork for his proposals tonight by letting Americans know how serious the economic problems were and how everyone would have to sacrifice to solve them. But his talk of new taxes and his playing down of Federal spending seemed to have triggered a wave of anxiety.
Mr. Dole said on the Senate floor this morning that his office had received 900 calls, which were running 17 to 1 against the Clinton plan.
But Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, predicted that the Clinton plan would ultimately be well received by the people, and he promised to cooperate with the President to secure speedy enactment of the proposals.
 
Some Changes Are Likely

 But Mr. Mitchell said it would be unrealistic to assume that even the Democratic-controlled House and Senate would not seek at least some changes in the President's proposals.
Some lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike, have expressed a fear that Mr. Clinton, in his zeal to persuade middle-class voters that the heaviest burdens of his program will be borne by the wealthy and corporations, may be treading dangerously close to encouraging class conflict.
"What is striking is that there is this class-warfare rhetoric, but what is creepy is how cynical it is," said William Kristol, who was chief of staff to former Vice President Dan Quayle. "He doesn't really believe in this rhetoric. He has a Cabinet full of lawyer millionaires."
Clinton aides say that the President needs a few enemies to cement a broad-based coalition behind his program, but that he is not out to attack the rich per se -- only those who came by their wealth by supposedly taking advantage of the relaxation of tax laws in the Reagan-Bush years.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: News Analysis;
Taste of Harsh Medicine

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Bill Clinton campaigned last year on the promise of economic change. Tonight he described in detail how difficult and painful that change would be.
Not since World War II has a President proposed such strong medicine. And not since Ronald Reagan 12 years ago called for a popular program of deep tax cuts and much more money for the Pentagon has a President recommended such a fundamental shift in how the Government operates. 
 After 12 years of Republican emphasis on low taxes and less Government involvement in domestic affairs, Mr. Clinton wants to raise taxes and expand Government investment in such areas as education and public works projects. He also wants to cut the budget deficit, which ballooned in the Republican years.
"Tonight," the President said at the outset of his address to Congress, "I want to talk about what Government can do, because I believe our Government must do more."
Mr. Clinton seemed to go out of his way to develop a plan that Americans would perceive as fair -- one that would require the wealthiest Americans to pay the most, that would put no particular industry or region of the country at a disadvantage while letting none off the hook completely, and that would wring some wasteful expenditures out of the Government.
 
Hitting Close to Home
 But fair or not, it would sting. Every household would pay more for gasoline and utilities, a reversal of the campaign promise to cut taxes for the middle class. Those families with incomes below $30,000 would have the new taxes all but offset by increased benefits. And Government programs that affect the pocketbooks of ordinary Americans -- Social Security, Medicare, student loans -- would be trimmed.
In his speech to Congress, Mr. Clinton played down the austerity at first, emphasizing instead his still unformed plans to change the health and welfare systems and establish a national service corps for young people. An hour into the speech, when he finally got around to tax increases and asked his audience for courage and contribution, he may have lost many of his television viewers. But the documents his staff distributed throughout the day left little doubt of the pain in what he was proposing.
The belt-tightening would not begin in earnest until next year. As a prelude, Mr. Clinton would try to create 500,000 new jobs nationwide this year by expanding Government spending on construction projects and giving tax breaks to businesses.
But the President's top economic planners said the main purpose of the program -- and the basis on which it should be judged -- was not what it would do to the economy this year but what it would do about turning the economy around over the long term.
The goal, said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, was to "reverse a number of disturbing economic trends."
 
Too Much, Too Little
 Over the last two decades, Americans have consumed too much and saved and invested too little.
Family incomes have stagnated, even though many more families have two earners. The gap between the rich and the poor has widened.
And most important for budget purposes, the Federal deficit -- the difference between what the Government spends and what it gets in revenue from taxes -- is rising inexorably. Unless changes, big changes, are enacted, Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, said today, the deficit will exceed half a trillion dollars by the end of the decade.
 
What Kind of Solution?
 No economist disputes that those unhealthy trends exist. The only question is whether Mr. Clinton is attacking them the right way.
Republicans on Capitol Hill accused the President of insufficient zeal in reducing spending. Mr. Panetta said he welcomed suggestions for further reductions. He challenged them to come up with the programs they wanted to take the ax to.
"They'll give you a hell of a speech on the deficit," Mr. Panetta said of the Administration's critics. "Obviously, our confrontation is going to be on the specifics. If you're just going to give me the regular speech you give at the Rotary Club, forget it."
Mr. Panetta said during his confirmation hearings last month that he was shooting for $2 of spending cuts for every $1 of tax increases. The deficit-reduction package announced tonight was split almost evenly between lower spending and higher taxes.
 
A More Palatable Term
 And one of the most controversial items on the spending side of the ledger was actually a tax increase -- the higher-income taxes that would be imposed on Social Security benefits received by individuals with pretax incomes over $25,000 and couples with incomes over $32,000.
"We call it a spending cut because it actually reduces benefits," said Jack R. DeVore Jr., the chief Treasury spokesman. Ronald Reagan also called it a spending cut in 1983, when he signed the law first placing taxes on the Social Security benefits of more affluent retirees.
But this one shift allowed Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to maintain today that Mr. Clinton's program, expected to raise taxes by $253 billion over five years, would not amount to the largest tax increase ever enacted.
The tax law Mr. Reagan proposed and signed in 1982, which mostly took away tax breaks enacted in 1981 and never put into effect, resulted in a tax increase on paper of $268 billion in 1993 dollars, Mr. Bentsen observed.
 
'A Sigh of Relief'
 "There was a sigh of relief when I saw that," Mr. Bentsen said. But if the $21 billion in higher taxes on Social Security benefits are counted, the Clinton program would be the largest tax increase ever.
The higher taxes on Social Security would affect fewer than one-quarter of retirees. Those taxes aside, the Administration's figures show that the wealthy would bear the brunt of the tax increases. Thirty percent of the higher taxes would be paid by taxpayers with incomes below $100,000, the Administration calculates; 70 percent would be paid by those with higher incomes.
Taxpayers earning more than $200,000 would see their taxes rise by about 3 percent. For those with incomes of $20,000 to $30,000, taxes would go up one-tenth of 1 percent, but that would be virtually offset by increased benefits.
Taxpayers with incomes of $30,000 to $50,000 would get a tax increase of about one-half of 1 percent, and those with incomes of $50,000 to $200,000 would have an increase of about three-quarters of 1 percent.
 
Embracing Pessimism
 For all but the most affluent, the higher taxes would be in the form of an energy tax passed on to customers by public utilities and gasoline stations. The typical cost to a family with an income of $40,000 would be about $120 a year, according to Treasury calculations that were confirmed by private authorities.
"There are no gimmicks," Mr. Panetta said. "There are no smoke and mirrors."
The Administration adopted the most pessimistic forecasts, worse than what Mr. Clinton's own Council of Economic Advisers recommended.
By forecasting the deficit to be much higher in the 1997 fiscal year than would have been the case with more optimistic projections, Mr. Clinton has an added excuse for breaking his campaign promise to cut the deficit in half. And if the size of the actual deficit has come down four years from now, his accomplishment will appear to be larger.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Then Again, It Could All Backfire

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
President Clinton's economic plan might not produce the burst of growth and new jobs he hoped for because of a phenomenon that economists love to dissect: unintended consequences.
On one hand, consumers could, as the President no doubt hopes, be cheered by his package of stimulus and deficit reduction measures and nudge the economy forward with increased spending. 
 But the opposite effect is also possible: If the specter of higher taxes drags down consumer confidence and frightens corporations and investors -- a mood in evidence in the stock market's jittery behavior this week -- it could be a recipe for slower growth.
And another unexpected factor emerged: Mr. Clinton's proposal got ashot in the arm today as investors pushed long-term interest rates to their lowest level since the mid-1980's in reaction to his plan to cut the deficit. This shows that many investors, who vote with their dollars, are convinced that he is serious about cutting the deficit and that his plan is credible.
 
Heavy on Deficit Reduction
 "The way I see this package is it's an ounce of stimulus and a ton of deficit reduction," said Laurence H. Meyer, an economist who heads a consulting firm in St. Louis. "He plans to cut the deficit by $140 billion in fiscal 1997 -- that's a lot."
Still, Mr. Clinton and his economic advisers are facing other problems. One is that the $31 billion stimulus package that the President proposed for the economy may take longer than anticipated to get off the ground because of possible delays in Congress.
For example, his popular proposal to create a new tax credit to encourage business investment could get bogged down in Congress along with the less welcome tax increases. This kind of delay means that much of his stimulus program might not have an effect until next year.
"It might really take a while for some of these projects to gear up, so you might need a microscope to see the stimulus this year," said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior economic consultant for DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
Put another way, this means that President Clinton's plan to create 500,000 jobs this year through his stimulus program might be exaggerated. Many economists put the number of news jobs closer to 300,000.
Shortly after the November election, when Mr. Clinton's advisers were talking about a stimulus program without much pain attached and a larger investment tax credit than the one proposed, several economics consulting firms predicted that the stimulus plan would increase growth by one-half of 1 percent above the 3.1 percent forecast for this year. But now, as a result of the worries about tax increases and delays in enacting Mr. Clinton's package, many economists suggest that the stimulus package might increase growth by less than that.
Many companies are not rushing to do what Mr. Clinton hopes they will -- make new investments in plants and equipment -- because of concerns about a higher corporate income tax and because of possible delays in Congressional enactment of the proposed investment tax credit. These factors could also delay new hiring.
 
Welcoming Lower Interest
 All this negative news makes the recent decline in interest rates all the more welcome for Mr. Clinton. Lower rates should encourage a new wave of home-building and mortgage refinancings as well as give a new boost to business investment while his plan for an investment tax credit makes its way through Congress.
"The instrument of their growth stimulus package is increasingly one of low long-term interest rates rather than of lower taxes," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist with Morgan Stanley. "Lower interest rates might be a powerful enough stimulus to overcome some of the fears about jobs and taxes."
Interest rates fell in reaction to the President's speech Wednesday night because many investors were persuaded that he plans to chop forcefully at the deficit, a development investors believe will reduce risks of future inflation.
To be sure, investors recognize that Mr. Clinton's proposed deficit cuts are not yet set in concrete and that Congress may scale them back, or reject them altogether. But they seem so impressed by Mr. Clinton's commitment to deficit reduction that many economists expect long-term interest rates to fall under 7 percent. This would bring them to their lowest level since the 1970's.
In Congressional testimony today, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sought to comfort middle-class Americans by noting that the benefits of low interest rates might offset the pain of a new energy tax. He said that while a typical middle-class family would lose $17 a month to the new energy tax, refinancing its mortgage at a lower interest rate would save it several times that much.
 
Clinton's Salesmanship Helps
 Despite some unintended pitfalls, there is still a chance that Mr. Clinton's economic plan could end up giving the economy as large a shot in the arm as he hoped. For example, consumer spending could continue to grow if he proves such an expert salesman in selling his economic plan that he keeps consumer confidence rising, notwithstanding the dismay about a new energy tax.
Besides, Mr. Clinton could receive some surprise help from the Federal Reserve. If economic growth falls far short of Mr. Clinton's expectations, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, could help bail out the President by lowering short-term interest rates.
"It's gong to take some time to pass a lot of this, said Henry Kaufman, who heads his own economics consulting firm in New York. "'In the front line of sustaining the economy, we'll continue to have the Federal Reserve. It was more than symbolic to have the chairman of the Federal Reserve sitting next to Hillary Clinton." He was referring to when the President spoke.
Mr. Kaufman said that giving Mr. Greenspan the seat of honor showed that the President was seeking no conflict with the central bank. He added that he thought the decline in long-term interest rates and the downward trend in inflation, despite the surprising jump in the January consumer price index, indicated that the Federal Reserve should be willing to cut interest rates further if the fragile economy stuttered again.
 
Hoping for a Thumbs Up
 Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to testify on Friday before the Senate Banking Committee, where he will no doubt be asked to give his opinion of the President's economic package. If he gives a thumbs up, it will be a boon for Mr. Clinton because it will reassure investors.
The fall in long-term interest rates may also bring some good news for the President's longer-term plans to rebuild the economy. For one, if the spending cuts and tax increases start to take effect next year, these factors would be a substantial drag on growth. Low long-term interest rates could go far to offset that.
Not only that, the Administration has touted its plan to invest more in education and in rebuilding highways and other public works as keys to increasing the nation's long-term prosperity. But it might turn out that lower long-term interest rates prove just as important in fueling long-term increases in investment and productivity.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Overview;
Battle Lines Begin to Form on Clinton Economic Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The political debate over the budget began in earnest today as Republicans said President Clinton wanted to raise taxes without reducing Government spending enough and the President defended his program for improving the economy.
The debate over the President's program, on Capitol Hill and around the country, was fueled by new figures published by the White House showing that almost all the deficit reduction proposed for the next two years in the package Mr. Clinton outlined Wednesday would come from tax increases, with almost none from spending cuts. 
 The new, more complete budget tables made public today also showed clearly just how much the deficit would be cut under the Clinton plan. Instead of the $500 billion reduction over four years that was emphasized in some documents Wednesday and reported by The New York Times and some other news organizations, the cumulative reduction would be $325 billion, figuring in new spending the President proposes.
 
Cabinet on the Road
 Mr. Clinton promoted his plan at a rally in St. Louis, his first stop in a two-day trip to Missouri, Ohio and upstate New York. Almost all the members of his Cabinet and many other top officials were also on the road today to pitch the proposals. By the end of the day, Administration officials had appeared in more than 25 states.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the budget director, Leon E. Panetta, went before the Congressional budget committees, the first step in what will probably be a tortuous journey as Congress deals with the proposals. Congressional Democrats were largely supportive of the President today, but Republicans took aim at what they called insufficient spending cuts.
The bond market showed strong support for the President. The 30-year Treasury bond, the best gauge of the long-term interest rates that must drop if Mr. Clinton's economic program is to succeed, fell to 7.02 percent, the lowest since the Government began selling such securities in 1977. [Page D1.]
Mr. Clinton acknowledged the Republican criticism in his speech at Union Station in St. Louis, but he and his Cabinet secretaries maintained that the new Government spending they sought was a new kind of spending: a down payment on jobs and economic growth, not money to finance wasteful consumption today.
"I do propose to spend some more money," Mr. Clinton said, "but not in the old way. Look at what we spend it for. We have reduced Government consumption. We have reduced inessential programs.
"But we increased spending on jobs, a jobs program to create a half a million jobs starting right now -- in building roads, repairing streets, fixing airports, cleaning up the environment with water systems and sewer systems, a million summer jobs for young people, if I can get the private sector to contribute to the 700,000 we're going to create in the Government."
Overnight polls showed strong support for the President. A CNN/USA Today telephone poll of 514 adults who said they watched the address Wednesday night found that 79 percent supported Mr. Clinton's plan, while 16 percent opposed it.
Mr. Clinton's package, the toughest budget-cutting program proposed by a President since World War II, would raise taxes and lower Government spending so that the annual deficit, now more than $300 billion, would be reduced by $140 billion by the 1997 fiscal year, the last of Mr. Clinton's term.
Over five years, the deficit reduction would come almost equally from spending cuts and tax increases.
The main elements would be higher income taxes on families with incomes above about $180,000, new taxes on energy that would cost most families $100 to $150 a year, reduced military spending, a freeze in the pay of Government workers, limits in Medicare and Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals and relatively small spending cuts in many other Government programs.
The budget documents published today show that while the deficit would be cut by $39 billion next year and $54 billion in 1995, Government spending, now more than $1 trillion a year, would be reduced by only $5 billion next year and $6 billion in 1995. All the rest of the deficit reduction in those years would be accomplished by tax increases. Only in the last two years of Mr. Clinton's term would spending cuts begin to bite.
 
The Politics of Economics
 Questions about taxes and spending have been the main battleground of partisan conflict in American politics over the last two decades. When Republicans have been able to persuade the public that taxes were being wasted, they have generally been elected. When Democrats have been able to show that the Government was paying insufficient attention to the public's needs, they have normally won.
In their appearances before the Congressional committees, Mr. Panetta and Mr. Bentsen were assailed by Republicans as being big taxers and spenders.
In a typical exchange, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, declared: "What I'd like to know is what the heck went wrong in Year 1? Why not have the cuts now and the taxes later rather than what we always see, which are the taxes now?"
In response, Mr. Panetta argued that deep cuts in spending now would "cause even greater consternation with regards to the economy."
Mr. Panetta was chairman of the Budget Committee until he left Congress this year to join the Clinton Administration. Normally mild and affable, he is popular among Democrats and Republicans. But in exasperation today, he finally told the Republicans, "You are the perfect example of the gridlock the American people are tired of."
In the Senate hearing, Mr. Bentsen challenged the Republicans to name the precise places they wanted to cut spending.
The Treasury Secretary, a Senator from Texas before he joined the Cabinet, was questioned sharply about his assertion that an increase in the taxes on Social Security payments received by affluent retirees was a spending cut and not a tax increase. Mr. Bentsen said it was properly characterized as a spending cut because Social Security benefits would, in effect, be taken back by the Government.
At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Vice President Al Gore said that the Administration was prepared to work with Congress on modifications in the economic plan but that "the main components all have to be there in order for the plan to be successful."
While it is far too early to gauge how the Clinton plan will fare in Congress, the Administration could take heart that the criticism came almost entirely from Republicans.
The Democratic leaders in the Senate and House went out of their way to praise the program and to emphasize the importance of demonstrating that the President and Congress could work together for the good of the country.
Some Democratic backbenchers objected to particular proposals that would harm their constituents. For example, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota said he was worried about proposed cuts in farm subsidies. But the public support for the overall program among Democrats was solid, at least for today.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: News Analysis;
Fragile Plan for Change

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
It was a staggeringly long agenda that President Clinton laid before Congress and the nation Wednesday night, and his aides say he plans to press for much of it in his first year in office.
Not only does he intend to undo the Reagan revolution by increasing taxes, slashing the military budget, trimming spending here on some old projects, increasing it there on some new ones; he also proposes to create an entirely new system of health care, to reform campaign laws, to launch a service corps, to "end welfare as we know it," to impose gun controls, and on and on. 
 The last President to try anything on that scale was Lyndon B. Johnson, and he had a lot of things going for him that Bill Clinton does not have.
But Mr. Clinton believes that after months of talking about change, the moment for action is at hand, a genuinely pivotal moment for the nation, and that only a bold challenge from the White House stands a chance of success.
As a senior White House strategist said today, "The voters gave us a mandate for change, if they did anything, and we have to make everyone and everything that stands in our way look like a roadblock on the highway to the progress the country demands."
 
A Winning Combination
 So Mr. Clinton expresses exasperation with "all the naysayers" and earnestly seeks the cooperation of Ross Perot. Together, with both opposing the status quo, they won 62 percent of the popular vote last year; together, they might move Congress in their direction. In an interview today, Mr. Perot outlined an agenda that goes well beyond the President's, which could help Mr. Clinton by making his list of programs seem a more temperate alternative.
But Mr. Perot is not ready to put his stamp of approval on the Clinton plan, and even if he did it is not clear that he can transform votes for him into effective pressure on Republican and Democratic members of Congress.
Much will depend on how deeply the nation believes that the mushrooming deficit represents a true national crisis, and how persuasively it communicates its feelings to Capitol Hill. In the two years that Johnson pushed through the main elements of his Great Society legislation, he benefited from a sense of crisis brought on by the civil rights movement and from the shock delivered to the national psyche by the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
 
The Battle of Perceptions
 Beyond that, much will depend on the battle of perceptions that was joined today. Republicans, led by the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, argue that the proposed attack on the deficit relies too much on new taxes and too little on spending cuts.
The White House's own figures, ambiguous on Wednesday night, showed clearly today that all of the deficit reduction in the next two years will come out of new taxes rather than a combination of taxes and spending cuts. The cuts will begin to contribute only in 1995 and 1996.
In one of the more damaging thrusts in a long diatribe against the President's proposals, Senator Dole noted that both Lloyd M. Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, and Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, had pledged to seek $2 in spending cuts for every $1 in new taxes, and that the nation's governors had suggested a 2.75-to-1 ratio. The new White House figures suggest that over the next four years the Administration is now aiming at gaining only 43 percent of deficit reduction from spending cuts, and 57 percent from tax increases -- a ratio of slightly more than $2 in cuts for every $3 in taxes.
Mr. Clinton responded by challenging the Republicans to suggest further targets for cuts, hoping to portray them as barons of gridlock.
 
Johnson's Big Advantage
 
 
But all of this is preliminary skirmishing. Johnson was able to push through his programs not only because of a mood of national peril, but also because of huge majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives that Mr. Clinton simply does not have. The Democrats began 1965 with a 36-seat majority in the Senate and a 118-seat majority in the House, making success all but automatic. This year the Democratic majorities are 14 and 84, which means the President will have to work much harder to keep his party in line.
That is no longer as easy as it was 30 years ago, to say the least. The evolution of the mass media has made direct communication between voter and representative more important, in many cases, than the influence of the White House. Party leaders on Capitol Hill no longer control very many votes.
If the radio and television talk shows begin over the next week or so to produce a consensus unfavorable to the President -- if, for instance, the idea takes hold that, as in the past, the new taxes are sure to materialize and the spending cuts may not -- the fairly solid Democratic front that was on display today may start to crumble.
"We want to vote with our President," said a leading moderate Democrat in the Senate. "We have waited a long, long time to have one of ours at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. But some of us will find it hard to support this package in the end, if the public sees it as all tax and no cut."
A special target for Mr. Clinton is the lower-middle-class suburban voter. In the thousands, these so-called Reagan Democrats deserted George Bush last fall, voting either for Mr. Clinton or for Mr. Perot. William Kristol, who was chief of staff to former Vice President Dan Quayle, commented today that the President tried Wednesday night to convince them that government could again be their friend by distributing the tax burden as he did and by emphasizing government programs of direct help to them, like education and jobs, and not divisive social initiatives.
But such voters, whose decisions to give Mr. Clinton a try made it possible for him to carry such swing states as Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri, remain highly skeptical about government and its propensity to tax.
 
Picking the Package Apart
 Equally dangerous to Mr. Clinton, as he himself said candidly on Wednesday night, is the possibility that the lawmakers might start to pick the package apart under pressure from constituents or lobbyists or both, choosing to accommodate one industry but not another, to penalize one interest group but not another -- and undo a very subtle, careful political balancing act.
The President had to get something from the middle class, for example, even though he had promised them a tax cut. There were not enough rich people to generate the revenue he needed. But he sought to retain his populist political cover by socking the rich hard and limiting the increased demand on most middle-class families to $100 or $200 a year. That, in turn, required reassurance to business, which took the form of interpolated pledges in his speech and a number of investment incentives and other concessions.
But pull this string or that, and the whole thing might unravel quickly, no matter how skillful the knitting that put it together in the first place.
And if Mr. Clinton's economic program cannot be pushed through more or less intact, some of the wind will go out of the Administration's sails, and the prospects for reforming health care, an even more divisive subject, will dim, however brave the resolve at the White House. Finding an Attorney General and dealing with homosexuals in the military may have been one-week wonders; the results of the struggle that began in earnest today will play and play.

HEADLINE: Germans Feel Pain of Unity, Squabbling Over Who Pays

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 18

 BODY:
When Germany was reunited in October 1990 and the way ahead looked clear and rosy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl told his people that no one would feel any pain.
More than two years later, the industrial powerhouse in the western half is sinking fast into recession, with unemployment now at 7.4 percent and rising. Instead of blooming, the formerly Communist economy in the eastern half collapsed under the pressure of competition, dragging the rest of the country with it and stirring widespread anger and frustration. 
 As in the United States, talk of "sacrifice" is now the order of the day, and there is also little agreement here on the need for it.
Mr. Kohl has begun telling the 62 million western Germans that helping their 16 million poorer cousins in the east to rebuild their part of the country is going to cost so much that they will have to pay higher taxes and suffer deep cuts in the welfare state that made Germans the envy of most of the rest of Europe for 40 years.
Investors and employers have also begun to tell eastern Germans that they cannot expect to have, overnight, the same high standard of living as the west. The business executives are also saying they want to go back on rash promises they made while the economy was booming last year to raise salaries quickly.
 
Crackdown on Extremists
 Hostility between German haves and have-nots is rising by the day, part of the frustration that led to more than 2,000 attacks against foreigners, mostly asylum-seekers, by right-wing radicals and neo-Nazi skinheads last year.
The Government authorities say the pace of those attacks has diminished since a crackdown on extremist groups that began in November.
Thomas Petereit, a fitter in the Thyssen steel works in the western German industrial city of Duisburg, hard hit by a crisis in the steel industry caused largely by cheap competition from eastern Europe, put his finger on the mood in the Ruhr industrial district.
"I'm sorry to say it, but some people on the factory floor are saying we shouldn't have let the Berlin wall be torn down," he said.
Many people in eastern Germany, having been led to expect nearly instant economic gratification from unification, felt cheated when they lost their jobs, and they do not understand the argument that raising wages to western levels now will guarantee that they lose still more.
Last week, 16,000 east German metalworkers took to the streets of Magdeburg to demand that employers honor an agreement to raise their average wages by 26 percent this year, to bring them to 82 percent of western levels.
"After the biggest demonstration in Magdeburg since the collapse of Communism, I see no way we should let the employers go back on their word," said Claus Martecki, a union leader there. "If we do without wage increases, that isn't going to bring a single additional order to any factory here."
 
'Solidarity Pact' Proves Elusive

Last fall, in an appeal similar to the one President Clinton voiced this week, Mr. Kohl called for a "solidarity pact" among the major political parties, labor unions and industry to agree on the tax increases, spending cuts and wage restraints to make unification work. But the public debate about such an accord has been raging for weeks, and is not sounding much like "solidarity" at all.
The squabbling over the costs of reunification has given all German politics a bad name, with many people wondering whether the country is capable of tackling its most pressing problems. Mr. Kohl's popularity ratings have sunk almost continuously since he won the election in 1990, but nobody else is doing much better.
Mr. Kohl's many critics charge that the Chancellor has asked for less sacrifice from business and the independently wealthy than from western German workers who have long since begun feeling the economic pinch. But the debate also reflects a broader European undercurrent of unease about just what the well-off welfare states of western Europe are in for now that the Iron Curtain is gone and those who lived under Communism are beginning to demand a piece of the good life.
Only a year ago, in the midst of the now-vanished boom, it had not really dawned on western Germans that life might no longer be one annual salary raise after another and ever-shorter working hours. Last April, public-sector labor unions in western Germany threw the country into chaos, with bus, rail and garbage strikes demanding double-digit wage increases on top of even larger raises that the easterners were demanding, from a much lower base.
The unions ended up last year with 5.4 percent raises, but this year, sobered by the realization that the state is short of money and already mortgaged to the hilt by record debts incurred to pay for unification, they have just settled for 3 percent -- a percentage point below inflation.
 
Official Plans Touch Off Protests
 The Government's plans for a package of spending cuts and extra taxes as part of the solidarity pact began leaking out last year, touching off the first ripples of resentment in the west against those in the east. Newspapers warned direly, for instance, that people using municipal swimming pools in the west would shiver because the water temperature would have to be lowered a couple of degrees to pay for similar luxuries in the east.
When the Government's proposals for cuts in social programs were formally announced last month, they were roundly rejected by the Social Democratic opposition and the labor unions for placing what the critics said was too great a burden on the western Germans least able to pay.
With total unemployment rising to 3.5 million, the governing coalition led by Mr. Kohl proposed reducing unemployment insurance payments from 68 percent of net pay to 67 percent for jobless people with dependents and 65 percent for single people.
The governing coalition also proposed a surcharge on income taxes for all taxpayers, but not until 1995. It allowed a one-year, 7.5 percent unification surcharge on western Germans' income tax to lapse in June.
The new tax would apply to corporations as well as individuals, but the Government did not say how big it would be. Nor did the Government ask well-off taxpayers to give up state child payments that now go to rich and poor alike, or suggest that highly paid civil servants and self-employed people should contribute to unemployment insurance, from which they are now exempt. These steps had reportedly been under consideration.
"The plan is a huge disappointment from the eastern German point of view," said Wolfgang Thierse, an opposition Social Democratic leader from the east. "It picks on the weak and forces them to bear most of the burdens. It will create a growing mood of hostility among the little people to the 'Ossis.' " That is the derogatory term western Germans use for people from the east.
The Social Democrats suggested this week that the wealthy should start paying more taxes this summer, a proposal immediately rejected by the Government. But even the opposition concedes that the high-spending welfare state has to cut back on spending to finance the $65 billion a year that reconstruction of the east is expected to cost, for the next ten years.
 
West Sees East As Just Greedy
 In the east, officially, there are 1.2 million jobless, 14.7 percent of the labor force, but many more than that are in retraining programs and short-hours programs that keep them off the jobless rolls. A majority of the unemployed in the east are women.
In the eastern German state of Saxony, after the metalworking industry asked for a revision of a contract that called for wages in eastern Germany to rise this year to 82 percent of western levels -- and 100 percent by next year -- the unions insisted on sticking to the original contract.
Today the industry responded by unilaterally canceling the contracts, and the union threatened to strike. As part of worker unrest, 20,000 East German steelworkers took to the streets in Chemnitz to demand their raises.
Many people in the west see the eastern attitude as short-sighted and greedy. But if wages do not rise quickly to western levels, politicians and economists say, eastern Germans will just move west to get them, as more than a million have done since 1989.
"In a population that has accepted the fact that up to 70 or 80 percent of the employees in some factories in our part of the country have been let go, the idea that people in the west are undergoing real hardship is simply incomprehensible," Dr. Kurt Biedenkopf, the Governor of Saxony, said last month.
"Any agreement on a solidarity package has to make it clear and understandable to people that it would be no catastrophe for the 80 percent of Germans who live in the west if their disposable income were not to grow for a considerable time," he said.
 
Steelworkers Worried by Layoffs
 In Duisburg, in the heart of the gritty Ruhr, a visitor to the giant Thyssen works found steelworkers uneasy.
"We've already made our sacrifice," said Manfred Siebierski, chairman of the factory's works council. Steelworkers settled in December for an 18-month contract that gives them a wage increase of only 3.1 percent. "What we hear on the factory floor is: 'It's somebody else's turn,' " Mr. Siebierski said.
One reason why German labor relations have been viewed as a model by most other Europeans for 40 years is that many disputes are resolved by institutions like works councils, where labor and management work out problems before they become major disputes.
With no substantial labor unrest, Thyssen has retired thousands of steelworkers in the last few years, and other have accepted short shifts to save their jobs.
But Thyssen also plans to eliminate 8,000 more of its 37,000 steelmaking jobs here and at other plants in western Germany over the next couple of years.
Steelworkers demonstrated in the Ruhr today and have called for a protest march on Bonn on March 26 to force the Government to come up with a plan to protect their jobs.
How Germans handle the problems of unification has effects far beyond their borders. Heavy Government borrowing to finance unification caused the independent central bank, the Bundesbank, to push up short-term interest rates to record levels to forestall inflation, now running above 4 percent, but the increase pushed Germany into recession.
Central banks all over Western Europe have tried to avoid devaluing their currencies by also raising interest rates, making the recession bite deeper and creating political tensions through most of the European Community.
 
Will the Burdens Be Shared Fairly?
 Mr. Kohl, who had originally intended to have the solidarity pact in place by the end of last year, now wants to thrash out agreement with political leaders and state governors a month from now.
"The key question is whether the package is seen to be a fair distribution of the burdens on all taxpayers," said Ernst Kock, an official of the national public employees' union in Berlin.
With the post-unification boom now clearly over and joblessness rising, there are signs of moderation in wage demands by western German unions, but this could bring tensions of its own.
"At the same time as we are experiencing an economic crisis, we are beginning to see that even hard work will not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living," Edzard Reuter, managing board chairman of Daimler Benz A.G., the Stuttgart automotive giant, warned in an article in the weekly Die Zeit recently.
Many experts believe that the German standard of living, like the American one, is probably in for a long period of stagnation, and perhaps even some decline, for the first time in the history of the Federal Republic.
A recent manifesto by former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Mr. Reuter and five others poses the key question: "Will democracy continue to be accepted if it can't justify itself by constantly improving the well-being of its citizens?"

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The President's Day;
CLINTON CAMPAIGNS FOR TIGHTER BELTS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Feb. 18

 BODY:
President Clinton and his top aides today began a cross-country public relations blitz to sell his economic proposals, with the President urging receptive spectators in St. Louis to let their Congressmen know they will not be punished for making "tough, hard decisions."
Addressing several thousand people packed into the old passenger hall and stairways of Union Station here, the President said that giving elected lawmakers political breathing room on budget cuts and tax increases was the only way his program would get through Congress. 
 Mr. Clinton also opened his counterattack against Republicans, who assert that his plan calls for too many new taxes and too few spending cuts.
 
Energized by Campaigning
 "I have already heard some people on the other side of the aisle say, 'He should have cut more,' " said Mr. Clinton, who seemed to be energized by being back on the campaign trail. "I say: 'Show me where, and be specific -- not hot air. Show me where.' "
While Mr. Clinton's trip here was the most visible, most of his Cabinet fanned out around the country today to join in the drive. Some members returned to their home states as favorite sons or daughters.
Like a candidate taking his basic stump speech on the road, Mr. Clinton repeated the main themes of his address to Congress on Wednesday night, again using most of his time to talk about his proposed spending cuts and new programs and soft-pedaling how much in new taxes it would all cost.
But there was no doubt about his main argument to the St. Louis crowd and the rest of the country -- that people should reject the notion that nothing in Washington can ever change and let senators and representatives know they will not be thrown out of office if they agree to raise taxes or cut spending programs.
"There are already people saying that we really can't make fundamental change -- you can't bring the deficit down, or nobody will hang in there and make these tough budget cuts the President's proposing, or you can't really reform the health-care system," Mr. Clinton said. "I am tired of all the naysayers. I think we can make some changes, but we need your help."
 
Wearing Their Buttons
 A random sampling of the crowd gathered in Union Station -- many clearly Clinton supporters, some wearing leftover campaign buttons, but many just passing by on their way to the shopping center in the old depot -- showed support for the main themes in the President's speech to Congress.
Virtually every one of 30 or more people interviewed said they endorsed the view that it was time to sacrifice to turn the country around, and that they felt that Mr. Clinton's proposals would evenly spread the tax burden.
"I don't have a problem with it," said Carla Green, a 30-year-old waitress. "I am not in a big-income bracket. He is going to help me. That itty-bitty energy tax is like the difference between whether my son and I order a pizza in the house one night, or not. My dad, who is in the income bracket that is going to be affected, said to me: 'You're going to give up a pizza. I am going to give up a $200 dinner with wine, but we've all got to do something.' It's just the way it is."
Mr. Clinton seemed intent on casting the terms of the political debate in a way that put him and his program on the same side as the public in a battle against business as usual, special interests, Republicans and whatever other opposition he might face in Congress.
 
Which Price Is Higher?
 "We need you to tell your members of Congress that we will support you if you make the honest, tough, hard decisions," he said. "We know we didn't get into this mess overnight. We know we are not going to get out of it overnight, but we cannot keep doing the same old thing. The price of doing the same thing is higher than the price of change."
Mr. Clinton also sought to paint some lawmakers as being in the grip of special interests, who he said were already choking the halls of Congress to block many of his proposals.
"The second thing you can do," said Mr. Clinton, who was introduced by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, "is support your members of Congress by demanding real political reform that will protect them in making courageous decisions."
 
Bonanza for Lobbyists
 Mr. Clinton's own economic and health-care proposals have created a bonanza for Washington lobbying organizations, who have been signing up customers who want to influence the package. And while Mr. Clinton has been urging campaign-finance reform, it is unlikely that he will press that too heavily on Congress this year, when he is already asking for some very tough votes on the economy.
While most of the signs echoed Mr. Clinton's message, there were a few that carried the Republican warning that people should watch their wallets. Or as one sign put it, "The Devil is in the Details: Proceed with Caution."
The President pointed that one out himself, chuckled and said, "That's right, the devil is in the details."
Mr. Clinton and his aides seemed buoyant, not only at their reception in St. Louis, but at the early polls that show strong support for his proposals. Aides say they think the success or failure of Mr. Clinton's campaign, which is to move to Hyde Park, N.Y., Friday and to the West Coast over the weekend after a stop tonight in Ohio, will set the tone, and may determine the fate, of his Presidency. They said the President's trip is only the first in what could be weekly whistle-stop tours for the next six months.
 
'A Lot of Courage'
 Kitty Coyne, a 34-year-old biologist who waited for hours to hear the President, said she thought his speech was "honest and told people that they will have to pay something, if they expect to get something. I thought it took a lot of courage."
Diana Rickard, a 39-year-old title researcher, said what she liked most in Mr. Clinton's proposal was "how he said that everyone is going to have to make a sacrifice."
But some people remained highly skeptical that his initiative would survive. "I enjoyed every moment of his speech," said Marcella Haessig, a 68-year-old retiree. "But I think he will have great difficulty passing some of this because of the Congress. But we've just got to make some changes."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Vice President;
In Selling His Boss's Domestic Program, Gore Is Also Selling Himself

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore kicked off a high-profile effort to sell the Administration's economic package today with a round of meetings and travels that could enhance his stature as an important adviser to President Clinton.
Mr. Gore has been a constant presence at the economic policy meetings and Cabinet sessions that the President has held since he took office. But his role has often been overshadowed in news reports by accounts of the influence of Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary. 
 Mr. Gore set out to alter that impression today. He appeared on three television talk shows this morning and spent the rest of the day meeting with reporters and members of Congress. He will leave Friday on his own sales trip, traveling to Raleigh, N.C.; Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala., and Tampa, Fla. And on Sunday he will join the President on a trip to the West Coast.
Seated behind Mr. Clinton at Wednesday night's speech to the joint session of Congress, Mr. Gore nodded his head in agreement as the President made his points. On one occasion he even motioned silent Republicans in the chamber to join their Democratic counterparts in applauding Mr. Clinton's call for gun controls.
"Maybe there was a slight bit of a taunt in it," Mr. Gore acknowledged today, smiling.
 
Vivid Sailboat Image
 He did more than taunt his former colleagues. He goaded them, and made it clear where his loyalties lie.
"Political change has sometimes been described as the metaphor of a sailboat tacking against the wind," the former Senator from Tennessee said at a breakfast meeting with reporters. "When one side comes up out of the water, it's a vivid image. That image and that metaphor remind me very much of what happened in the chamber last night.
"I saw the mirror image of it during the beginning of the Reagan era, when one side of the chamber stands and applauds wildly and the other side sits with their hands folded in their laps," he continued. "Visually, the image is very much that of a great ship changing course, with one side out of the water and the other, sort of sinking."
Mr. Gore played the role of negotiator today, meeting in his Capitol Hill office with three Democratic Senators, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina.
 
'Time to Face the Facts'
 For critics of Mr. Clinton's economic program, the Vice President, who normally measures every word for weight and diplomacy, carried an unusually blunt message. "Put up or shut up," he said at the breakfast meeting. "It's time to face the facts."
In a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last week, 44 percent of the registered voters surveyed said they did not know enough about Mr. Gore to have an opinion of him, up from the 14 percent who offered that response in October. The evidence that he has been shrinking in the public eye mirrors a similar phenomenon with Vice President Dan Quayle in 1989.
The difference between the two men, however, is that most of those who say they are familiar with Mr. Gore have favorable impressions of him. The opposite was the case with Mr. Quayle.
Mr. Gore's aides insist that the Vice President, who jokes about references to how stiffly he stands behind the President at public sessions, is not trying to change his image.
"It's all about the same thing," said Marla Romash, the Vice President's press secretary. "And that is doing as much as possible to help President Clinton."
 
Few Scores to Settle
 But before he gets to the American people, Mr. Gore, who the President said would be his chief emissary to the Congress, seems to have a few other scores to settle on his old turf.
He was not happy at all, for instance, when Republican members of Congress laughed at the President outright on Wednesday night when Mr. Clinton sought to illustrate the veracity of his budget numbers by crediting the underlying assumptions to the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Clinton, a bit rattled by the outburst, snapped at the lawmakers, challenging them to come up with better spending cuts.
"It was a serious overplaying of their hand," Mr. Gore said sternly today. "And the President yanked them up short. And they knew it. And the laughter from the Republican side was consciously dishonest."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Projections on Interest Costs Confuse the Treasury Market

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Traders and dealers in the Treasury market were confused yesterday by the Clinton Administration's projections that the Government would save $11.5 billion in interest expense over the next four years by shifting away from longer-term securities and selling more shorter-term issues instead.
The subject is of vital importance to Treasury dealers because a shift in the mix of securities sold would influence the price of outstanding long-term notes and bonds, as well as the direction of long-term interest rates. For one thing, a scarcity of longer-term issues is likely to push up their prices, thereby reducing yields. 
 Speculation remained intense that the Treasury, which began to reduce the size of 30-year bond auctions during the Bush Administration, would continue and perhaps accelerate the shift with the Clinton Administration in power.
 
 
Potential Windfall
 On the surface, a shift away from long-term notes and bonds to short-term bills looks like it could be a potential windfall for the Government, because short-term interest rates are currently about four full percentage points lower than 30-year bond yields.
Still, analysts said they were skeptical about the projected interest savings. Short-term interest rates would need to remain low over the next four years to meet the projections, they said, and that assumption may rest on increasingly shaky ground as the economy recovers.
Moreover, huge amounts of debt now sold through 10-year notes and 30-year bonds would need to be sold instead as three-month Treasury bills in order to meet the estimated savings.
Finally, with 30-year bond yields at historic lows, traders and analysts questioned the wisdom of selling less long-term debt. "The Treasury makes every effort to sell its debt in the least costly, most efficient way," said Richard M. Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a primary dealer in Government securities. "But given their huge borrowing needs currently and prospectively, it makes no sense to be cutting back in any maturity area."
 Questions about the Administration's projections and tactics intensified as the day wore on, especially so after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told reporters that while the Treasury was studying the matter there would be no "radical change" in the mix of Treasury securities to be sold.
"I had been assuming that a major reduction in the amount of bonds to be sold was virtually assured," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, a Wall Street economic consulting firm. "But Secretary Bentsen's muddied the waters all over again."
In fact, Mr. Bentsen's comments yesterday seemed consistent with what the Treasury said and did late last month, when it announced the quarterly refunding auctions held in early February.
At that time, the Treasury cut the amount of 30-year bonds sold to $9 billion from $10 billion.
However, the estimated interest savings released late Wednesday were not produced by the Treasury Department, but by White House budget director Leon Panetta's Office of Management and Budget.
 Last year, the Bush Administration, seeking to take advantage of low short-term interest rates, cut the size of the 30-year bond auctions from $11 billion.
Mr. Crandall said he assumed the Treasury would move to eliminate the bond auctions altogether because according to his estimates the more than $11 billion in projected interest savings could not be realized unless the Treasury increased the size of its three-month bills by around $36 billion.
Currently, the Government sells about $20 billion of three-month and six-month bills each week.
A spokesman at O.M.B., who asked not to be identified, said the budget office had been in close consultation with the Treasury before making its projections.
"There are ways of accomplishing this that are entirely reasonable," the spokesman said.
But some analysts said they were not so sure. They wondered if, under intense pressure to produce evidence of savings on a tight deadline, the budget office made some unrealistic assumptions.
 "It's called a plug, and I wouldn't be surprised if that isn't what they did " said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns & Company who served as David Stockman's chief economist at the budget office during the first Reagan Administration. "You find you have a hole in your numbers, and you plug it."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: Ross Perot;
Perot Sees Some Good Intentions But Too Much Old-Time Politics

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Ross Perot said today that it was "completely unrealistic to expect meaningful cuts in Government spending from Congress" as long as the present political ground rules remain in force.
Speaking on the morning after President Clinton unveiled an economic program combining spending cuts and increased taxes in an effort to reduce the deficit, Mr. Perot praised Mr. Clinton for "assembling a team full of wonderful intentions." He also said he thought the President understood "the disaster of these huge deficits." 
 But Mr. Perot, who was briefed by Mr. Clinton on the plan Wednesday afternoon, said he was not prepared to take a definitive position on the President's package, because he was unsure how large the spending cuts would be. He had not yet seen the detailed charts, made public by the White House only this morning, that indicated that the net spending cuts were much smaller, especially in the first two years of Mr. Clinton's term, than had originally been suggested.
Mr. Perot, who opposed Mr. Clinton in the 1992 campaign, controls no votes on Capitol Hill, but his populist ideas have a wide following throughout the country. He is organizing intensely in many states; this weekend, he has planned appearances in six Florida cities.
 
The Importance of Perot
 The question is whether he can convert his personal popularity into effective pressure on senators and representatives. The President thought enough of Mr. Perot's potential to make the telephone call on Wednesday, and some Clinton aides consider backing from the Texan an important element in building a coalition behind the economic plan.
"If you want the American people to pay more taxes, then I think they're willing," Mr. Perot said. "But first we need honest government."
For himself and his pressure group, United We Stand, America, "job No.1 is political reform, because we won't get our finances in order until you change the system," Mr. Perot said in a telephone interview from his private jet as he flew from New York to Dallas. As things now stand, he asserted, lobbyists for corporations and interest groups will find it "easy pickings" to persuade Congress to block the President's proposed cuts.
"If you wanted to get rich, there's no place better to be than a Washington lobbyist," Mr. Perot said. "They've got all these senators and Congressmen who need to raise all this money for their campaigns. Well, those officeholders will get enough in the next 30 to 60 days to take care of them for years, and the payoff will be elimination of most of the cutbacks."
 
A Barely Addressed Agenda
 For that reason, he said, his group has a detailed agenda that Mr. Clinton barely began to address in his speech to Congress on Wednesday night.
The agenda includes a balanced budget amendment, a line-item veto power for the President, the elimination of all political action committees and their contributions to candidates, an end to the use of the Social Security trust fund for general Federal purposes and the curbing of foreign lobbyists.
Mr. Perot, who won almost 19 percent of the vote in last November's election, said he had little confidence in the Congressional leadership because "there is still a compulsion to spend, but there's no compulsion to cut."
"The key question is whether we get what we pay for," he added. "Are the taxes really going to be used on the deficit, or on more spending? Is spending really going to be cut, or are you going to end up with $1.83 in new spending for every dollar raised, the way we have so many times in the past?"

HEADLINE: Republicans Honor Weinberger

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
At a gathering of conservatives attended by three of the men pardoned by President George Bush for their roles in the Iran-Contra affair, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas tonight paid an emotional tribute to Caspar W. Weinberger, the Defense Secretary in the Reagan Administration, for having escaped the relentless efforts of the special prosecutor in the case, Lawrence W. Walsh.
Senator Dole, the minority leader, called Mr. Walsh, "Not a prosecutor, but a persecutor," and added, "It seems to me that the time has come for Lawrence Walsh to move on to another line of work." 
 The banquet was the culmination of the Conservative Political Action Conference. Early in the day, conservative politicians like the Rev. Pat Robertson and Patrick J. Buchanan made it clear in a string of stinging speeches that they were not ready to go along with the trend toward greater moderation that many Republican leaders have urged in the wake of Mr. Bush's defeat last fall.
 
Attacking Clinton Plan
 The Weinberger dinner provided the Republicans with a forum not only to criticize Mr. Walsh but to take aim at the economic package President Clinton unveiled Wednesday night.
In his remarks to the audience of about 300 people, Mr. Weinberger referred briefly to his case, which ended on Christmas Eve, when he and five others were pardoned.
Mr. Weinberger otherwise chose not to dwell on the past, declaring "I'm heartily sick of Iran-contra, and I want to talk about something else" before going on to attack Mr. Clinton's proposed tax increases.
Among others pardoned by Bush who joined Mr. Weinberger at the dinner were Clair E. George, a former top official of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Elliot Abrams, a former assistant Secretary of State. The three others who received pardons were Robert M. MacFarlane, the former national security adviser; Duane Claridge and Alan Fiers.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: New Spending;
The President's Fine Print Asks Fundamental Change

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Embedded in the fine print of President Clinton's budget request are fundamental changes in Federal policy: less money for the military, more aid for children, greater emphasis on the prevention of disease, and a new view of environmental protection as a source of jobs, not a drag on the economy.
Whereas in January 1992 President Bush anticipated a yearly Pentagon budget of $289 billion by 1997, Mr. Clinton's plan calls for cutting military spending to $249 billion in that year, mainly by cutting troop levels and outlays for the Star Wars antimissile defense program. 
 Mr. Clinton would pump more money into the Head Start preschool program, the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, the immunization of preschool children, summer school and summer jobs for teen-agers from poor families.
Head Start, currently budgeted at $2.8 billion a year, would get an extra $500 million this year and a total of $13 billion more over five years.
WIC's current budget of $2.9 billion would be increased $75 million this year through a supplemental appropriation, followed by a total of $3.6 billion more by 1998. With the extra money, the WIC program could serve 300,000 more children under 5 years old this year, in addition to the 5.6 million people already getting assistance.
 
Praised by Child Advocates
 President Clinton also proposed a huge expansion of Federal tax credits that aid low-income working families with children.
Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, and Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who rarely had a good word to say about budgets in the George Bush and Ronald Reagan years, lavishly praised Mr. Clinton for making a big investment in children.
Environmentalists also saw a shift in priorities. Environmental projects, like sewage treatment plants, account for a significant share of the public works proposed by Mr. Clinton. His plan, for example, calls for $1 billion a year in grants to local governments for water-quality improvement projects and a total of $2 billion over the next five years dedicated to improving parks and wildlife areas.
 
'Environmentally Smart'
 "The Reagan and Bush Administrations continually told us that jobs and the environment don't mix -- that if you spend Federal money on the environment, you're hurting the economy," said David D. Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Clinton is saying that there are lots of ways to spend Federal dollars that are environmentally smart and create jobs."
William Roberts, chief lobbyist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said Mr. Clinton's proposals reflected "a major shift in the way our Government approaches economic and environmental problems."
"New investments in mass transit, waste-water treatment and energy efficiency will create jobs while cleaning our water and air," Mr. Roberts said. The Administration maintains that construction of environmental projects and development of new environmental technologies will stimulate economic growth and create jobs.
 
Familiar Budget Themes
 Mr. Clinton repeats many budget-cutting proposals that Mr. Reagan or Mr. Bush had made unsuccessfully. The proposed justifications are similar. But Mr. Clinton's language is different. He does not repeat the zealous attacks on wasteful Government spending that became a familiar theme in budget documents over the last decade.
Like his predecessors, Mr. Clinton wants to reduce or eliminate Government subsidies and charge fees for Government services. Democrats and some Republicans resisted such user fees when they were proposed by the Reagan Administration, but lawmakers of both parties have become more receptive to the idea in recent years.
For example, Mr. Clinton wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to charge higher fees to corporations registering new securities for sale to the public. And he wants to charge higher fees for public use of national parks, forests, recreation areas and camp sites.
In addition, Mr. Clinton wants to charge higher fees to ranchers grazing cattle, sheep and horses on Federal lands. He wants to require slaughterhouses to reimburse the Government for the full cost of meat and poultry inspections.
 
Walking Well-Worn Paths
 Many of Mr. Clinton's proposals are hardy perennials, made year after year. He wants to slash "impact aid" payments, made to local school districts to offset the cost of Federal installations that are exempt from the local property taxes that finance schools. He wants to eliminate Federal subsidies to honey producers and to limit Federal payments to producers of wool and mohair (a program adopted in 1954 to insure a "strategic reserve" of wool in time of war).
In addition, Mr. Clinton wants to eliminate Federal payment of crop subsidies to farmers who have adjusted gross income of $100,000 a year or more from sources other than a farm. The Administration says this proposal would direct Federal aid to small family-owned farms, away from big agricultural enterprises.
Mr. Clinton would also reduce Federal subsidies paid to growers of wheat, corn, barley, cotton and rice.
These proposals, which look simple and appealing to budget examiners at the White House, invariably prove more complex on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers like E. "Kika" de la Garza, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee, warn that such proposals will undermine the farm economy, threatening the output of "food and fiber" on which the nation depends.
 
Eliminating Programs
 When members of Congress have tried to cut popular Government subsidy programs one-by-one, they have usually failed. But when the cuts were bundled together in comprehensive deficit-reduction bills in 1981 and 1990, the efforts were successful.
Whereas Mr. Bush proposed eliminating several hundred Government programs, Mr. Clinton would eliminate a handful.
For example, Mr. Clinton asked Congress to eliminate the trade adjustment assistance program of the Commerce Department, which provides aid to businesses harmed by imports. Mr. Clinton would also eliminate subsidies for nuclear reactor research that have no commercial applications.
In addition, Mr. Clinton wants to eliminate fertilizer research conducted by the Tennessee Valley Authority, saying the fertilizer industry was "fully capable" of conducting such research without Government subsidies.
Mr. Clinton also proposed freezing the pay of Federal employees, including uniformed military personnel, in 1994. In the three years after that, he wants to raise the pay of Federal workers by less than the increase in the cost of living. Congress has often refused to go along with such proposals in the past.
 
'A Poor Way to Do It'
 Gregory O'Duden, general counsel of the National Treasury Employees Union, said Mr. Clinton's pay proposal was "as bad as what Reagan proposed."
"We have heard much talk from the Clinton Administration that it wishes to reinvent Government," said Mr. O'Duden. "This is a poor way to do it. Congress just passed a law recognizing the need to make Federal pay comparable to pay in private industry. Clinton's proposal would frustrate that goal."
The politics of Capitol Hill suggest that lawmakers are more likely to approve new taxes than cuts in Federal spending of the type proposed by Mr. Clinton.
Senator Pete V. Domenici and Representative John R. Kasich, the ranking Republicans on their respective Budget Committees, applauded Mr. Clinton's emphasis on deficit reduction but said they were sorry to see him propose large tax increases.

The Clinton Plan
Debate over President Clinton's economic program began as new White House figures showed that almost all of the deficit reduction proposed for the next two years would come from tax increases, with almost none from spending cuts. [Page A1.] New budget tables showed that the cumulative deficit reduction for the next four years would be $325 billion, not $500 billion. [A15.]

The Economy
Consumer prices jumped a surprisingly strong five-tenths of 1 percent, to an annualized rate of 6.1 percent. Unemployment claims fell, the industrial operating rate rose, and exports and imports grew. [D2.]

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: In the Region;
Tax Package Seen as Net Gain for New York Area

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
President Clinton's fiscal program would be a net plus for the New York metropolitan region, fiscal and energy policy analysts say. And that would be a big change for a part of the country that has grown accustomed, under recent Republican Administrations, to feeling neglected by Federal taxing and spending policies.
The energy tax will bite less deeply here because households and businesses are more energy efficient than in the rest of the country, and the region's industries are favored by the President's economic stimulus program. Where the region would pay is in income tax increases, because household wealth is greater than average. 
 "The bottom line, on a regional basis, is that this is the first budget in 13 years that is pro-New York and pro-New York region," said Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn. "We've had 12 years of budgets that were decidedly anti-New York, but surprisingly the strongest cuts in the President's budgets are in rural programs, and the strongest increases are in urban and suburban programs."
New York City alone stands to gain at least $515 million from the President's one-shot economic stimulus package, Mr. Schumer estimated, including $130 million in community development grants and an additional $140 million in mass transit subsidies that would be paid this year.
 
An Energy Tax Benefit
 The region's high concentrations of poor people stand to benefit in particular from the President's proposed expansion of programs for low-income home ownership and improvement. The President's economic stimulus package also offers incentives to the region's research-based industries in electronics and pharmaceuticals and promises to inject billions into mass transit, highway and community development programs.
The key to the region's advantage on the tax side of the President's program is his decision to use a broad-based tax that would apply to the energy content of nearly all fuels, as measured by the British Thermal Unit, or B.T.U.
 
More Rigid Conservation
 Because energy prices are higher in the region, owing partly to a heavy reliance on oil for generation of electricity, homes and industries here have adapted more rigid conservation measures than in many states where energy is cheaper, said David Nemtzow, energy adviser to Representative. Edward J. Markey of Massachussetts, a member of the House Energy Committee.
Using this broad-based tax, instead of focusing on oil imports or gasoline consumption, rewards states that are most efficient in overall energy consumption, he said.
"The B.T.U. is favorable because the Northeast has been doing exactly what it should have been doing since the energy crisis of the seventies, which is making its economy more energy efficient," Mr. Nemtzow said. "New York is one of the most forward-looking states in the nation in terms of energy policy. As a result, the region just uses less energy per capita than the rest of the country."
According to Representative Markey's New England Energy Caucus, New York comprises 7.2 percent of the country's population but would pay just 4.6 percent of the energy tax once it is fully phased in in 1997. Connecticut has 1.3 percent of the population but would pay 1 percent of the tax, which would raise $22 billion nationally. New Jersey, with 3.1 percent of the population, would pay 3 percent of the tax, the caucus says.
 
Long Island Is an Exception
 The caucus says the Northeastern states would pay 79 percent of the average per-capita national energy tax, while the South and West would pay 111 percent. Those states had favored a tax on imported oil, which would have raised domestic oil prices to the disadvantage of the Northeast.
The Northeast-Midwest Institute, which is associated with the congressional delegations from those regions, calculated that the average extra cost from the energy tax for each household would amount to $233 annually in Connecticut, $199 in New York and $273 in New Jersey. The national annual average household cost would be $236, the Institute reported.
These figures exclude use of energy in industry.
The one area of the region that will be hit hard by the the energy program is Long Island, where 70 percent of the homes are heated by oil and where reliance on automobile travel is heavy.
 
Higher Costs on Long Island
 Francis J. Murray Jr., commissioner of the New York State Energy Office, estimated yesterday that household energy costs on Long Island would increase by an average of $320 for each household under the President's proposed tax, compared to $120 in New York city and $265 upstate.
Meanwhile, the President's $56 billion economic stimulus package contains elements that are favorable to the region, said Norman Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University.
"This is a region that does a lot of research, in pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, in electronics in Connecticut, and making permanent the research tax credit, which amounts to about a third of the total investment credits the President proposed, is a boost to this area" Dr. Glickman said.
 
Effect on Housing Values
 Others, however, have raised flags about how Mr. Clinton's vow to rein in health care costs would affect the pharmaceutical industry.
Dr. Glickman also noted that the President's program foresees more spending on community development and enterprise zones for poor cities, a particular benefit to places like Trenton, Buffalo and Bridgeport.
Because the President's roads, bridges and mass transit spending package is aimed at boosting employment quickly, it will favor places like New York City and New Jersey that have already filed plans with the Federal government for construction projects that are ready to go, awaiting only funding, Dr. Glickman added
Because Connecticut and New Jersey are ranked first and second in household income nationally, with New York ranked sixth, the President's proposed increase of top income tax rates from 31 to 36 percent, plus a surcharge on incomes over $250,000, will fall harder on the region than elsewhere, Dr. Glickman said.
 
Ending Tax-Break Bonanza
 In part, the new taxes would take away the tax-break bonanza of the Reagan years that many economists believed helped fuel the region's housing and consumer spending spree during the 80's.
But even higher income taxes may offer a silver lining, several economists said. By increasing the value of tax deductions, higher income tax rates may stimulate demand for larger mortgage loans, which have deductible interest payments, and so help housing values. And because state and local taxes are also deductible, higher Federal income tax rates might make it easier for states to raise taxes.

Nationsbank Using Option To Buy MNC

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Nationsbank Corporation said today that it was exercising its option to buy MNC Financial Inc. of Baltimore in a deal valued at $1.3 billion.
Nationsbank will remain the fourth-largest bank in the country after acquiring MNC, which has $16.7 billion in assets and nearly 250 bank branches in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Nationsbank, which is based in Charlotte, said the purchase might be paid for entirely in Nationsbank stock or up to 49.9 percent in cash. 
 Stock in Nationsbank, which is continuing a string of major acquisitions, rose 12.5 cents today, to $51.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, as MNC's shares jumped $1.375, to $14.25.
 
Quick Action
 Under an agreement last year, Nationsbank acquired a 16 percent nonvoting stake in MNC for $200 million and the option to acquire the company outright for about $1.2 billion more by Sept. 30, 1997. MNC, which has struggled under the weight of bad real estate loans, desperately needed the cash infusion to bolster its capital levels.
Moving rather quickly to exercise its option, Nationsbank said its action reflected a "clear" improvement in MNC's financial performance. If MNC's condition continued to improve, the price of the acquisition would have increased.
 A Nationsbank spokeswoman, Lynn Drury, said it was too early to estimate how many layoffs or branch closings might result from the merger, which is expected to be completed in the second half of the year. She said, however, that Nationsbank expected to cut MNC's costs by about 25 percent.
 
Little Overlap
 "We have some overlap, especially in the Maryland suburbs, but the two franchises are complementary," Ms. Drury said, adding that Nationsbank does not anticipate any antitrust problems.
Nationsbank said it had not yet decided if it would pay any of the purchase price in cash. The Federal Reserve usually discourages cash purchases, unless more stock is issued, because it likes to keep capital in the banking system. The deal is subject to approval by banking regulators.
Nationsbank has not discussed the payment issue with the Fed, Ms. Drury said. "We are certainly sensitive to maintaining strong capital levels," she added.
Diane Glossman, an industry analyst with Salomon Brothers, said that the MNC acquisition "cements Nationsbank's market share in the metropolitan D.C. area, which under normal conditions is a good market." The region and many of its banks have been hit hard by the regional recession and plummeting real estate values.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Deficit;
Another Look at the Figures: A Smaller Trim in the Deficit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The deficit reduction proposed by President Clinton on Wednesday night would total $325 billion over the next four years, not nearly $500 billion, as The New York Times and some other news organizations reported today.
This became clear in more complete budget tables issued today by the Administration. The $500 billion figure -- actually $493 billion -- represents the total amount of tax increases and specific spending cuts that Mr. Clinton proposed. It was emphasized in documents the White House handed out Wednesday. But it does not take account of $169 billion in tax cuts and new Government spending Mr. Clinton wants for programs he favors. 
 Since deficit reduction is the combination of the net change in revenues and in expenditures, the total reduction would actually be $325 billion, rounded off. That correct figure was reported today by some news organizations.
 
'A Failure to Communicate'
 Mr. Clinton did not mention either figure in his address to Congress, and Administration officials insisted that no deception was intended. They said the problem stemmed from the haste in putting together the final elements of the package; the final tables were not put together until just before the President began his speech.
The problem, said Bruce Lindsey, one of Mr. Clinton's closest advisers, was "a failure to communicate."
Asked about the situation today as he boarded a helicopter on the White House lawn, Mr. Clinton said: "Call Panetta. That's his department."
A spokesman for Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, said the problem developed because the Clinton Administration regards proposals to lower the deficit and proposals to stimulate the economy (which the Administration calls "investments") as two separate tracks.
"There was no intention not to be honest," said the spokesman, Barry J. Toiv. "We feel very strongly that there is about $500 billion over four years of deficit reduction measures, the combined total of tax cuts and spending increases. Next to that we had the investments of approximately $160 billion."
Asked at a hearing today of the House Budget Committee which number, $500 billion or $325 billion, was correct, Mr. Panetta said, "They're both correct," one a gross figure and the other a net one.
At a briefing for reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Panetta did not distinguish between the conventional definition of deficit reduction and the new one the Administration has adopted, using one definition in one sentence and the other one in the next sentence.
He said: "With regards to deficit reductions, it tries to achieve close to $500 billion in deficit reduction by 1997 -- almost $708 billion in deficit reduction by 1998. Two-thirds of that amount goes for deficit reduction and one-third of that amount goes for investments."
 
What the Documents Say
 The documents passed out after the Panetta briefing did not contain a year-by-year breakdown of taxes and spending. A White House summary called "Highlights of the President's Economic Program" declared, "The President is proposing the largest deficit reduction package in U.S. history -- almost $500 billion over four years and over $700 billion over five years."
Elsewhere, the documents mentioned about $160 billion in "long-term public investments in economic growth and jobs" but gave no indication that this figure should be subtracted from what they called deficit reduction.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: Defining the Terms;
Surtax: Whatever Its Name, It Still Equals 39.6% Tax Rate

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Although Clinton Administration officials have long referred to it as a "millionaires' surtax," the proposed 10 percent surtax on high-income households would in effect establish a new top tax rate. It would affect Americans with taxable incomes of $250,000 or more (a figure that translates into adjusted gross income of $305,000 or more).
In practice, the surtax would create a new top tax rate of 39.6 percent. 
 President Clinton is proposing to raise the current top tax rate to 36 percent, from 31 percent, for all taxable income over $140,000 for joint filers or above $115,000 for single people. The surtax would be an extra tax on the income earned over $250,000. It would be 10 percent of the base tax on that income.
Here's how it would work for a household with $350,000 in taxable income:
The $100,000 in income in excess of $250,000 would be taxed at 36 percent, a tax of $36,000. Then the surtax would levy an additional 10 percent of that amount, or $3,600 more. Together, that would mean a tax of $39,600 on the $100,000 in income in excess of $250,000, equaling a 39.6 percent rate.
Another way to view this is that for the taxable income between $140,000 and $250,000, the taxpayer would be subject to the proposed 36 percent rate. Then, for the household's $100,000 in taxable income above $250,000, the taxpayer would be subject to a tax rate of 39.6 percent.
Administration officials today indicated that it was politics, rather than economics, that drove the President to propose a surtax rather than officially asking for a top new marginal rate of 39.6 percent. They suggested that for many Americans, including many earning far less than $250,000, officially creating a new top tax bracket of nearly 40 percent might have sounded exorbitant.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The Cabinet;
Pitching Clinton Program, the Cabinet Hits the Road to Talk of Better Times

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Feb. 18

 BODY:
Members of President Clinton's Cabinet were deployed around the country today to plead for passage of his economic-recovery package, mixing promises of better times with warnings that they would not come soon.
"There will be no big turnaround the first year," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told students at a high school auditorium here. "That's not going to happen. It is too complex a problem." But Mr. Bentsen, citing job-training programs and the youth service component of the President's program, pledged to the students, "We're investing in you." 
 Several other Cabinet secretaries returned to their home states to deliver a pitch for the program, which combines spending cuts and tax increases intended to cut the budget deficit by nearly $325 billion over four years.
 
'A Call to Arms'
 In Brooklyn, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown toured Metrotech Center, a high-tech complex built with public and private money, and called the President's speech "a call to arms" to boost the economy. "The public wants to unite," he said. "They're ready for the truth."
Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy spoke before a joint session of the Mississippi State Legislature in Jackson and urged support for the program "because it represents real change."
And Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, speaking at University Hospitals in Cleveland, where she grew up, focused on the health-care overhauls proposed by Mr. Clinton. "We're going to deal with it," she said, listing a litany of problems with the nation's medical system ranging from people who had lost insurance benefits to the high cost of drugs. "And we're not going to take 50 years."
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, speaking in Tucson, Ariz., and echoing one of the theme's of Mr. Clinton's speech to Congress on Wednesday night, sought to minimize the tax increases by casting them as a burden that would fall mainly on the rich. "Those who got benefits in the 1980's are going to be asked to bear the lion's share," he said.
The stops by the various secretaries were clearly coordinated to highlight different aspects of the program and were aimed for consumption by much larger audiences than the few hundred students Mr. Bentsen addressed here or the dozens of workers Ms. Shalala encountered in her tour of the hospital.
Mr. Bentsen's remarks, for instance, were ultimately aimed at a far larger audience: the nearly seven million students who are scheduled to watch his speech on Friday on Channel One, the commercial and news program broadcast in about 300,000 classrooms.
But if there was any expectation that the students in Austin might go easier on the Administration than their parents, it was dashed when several of the teen-agers peppered Mr. Bentsen with sharp questions about how tax increases would help businesses create jobs or how their community could hope to recover from cuts in the military budget.
Mr. Bentsen countered by saying that the taxes on businesses would only rise slightly and that they were necessary to keep the Federal deficit from choking the economy and destroying the prospects for job creation. "You have to cut this deficit," he said. "That means you have to raise some funds."
Despite expressing skepticism about the tax increases, Alex Kuperman, a 17-year-old junior at the school, the A. N. McCallum High School, did speak approvingly about both Mr. Bentsen and the overall program.
"It really pertained to my generation," he said. "He focused on things that would really help us, not just the nation."
Asked by reporters why he traveled to a high school to plug the program, Mr. Bentsen said, "Because what we're talking about is the young people of the country and what's going to happen to them, what kind of economy they're going to have."
In Mississippi, Mr. Espy told the state legislators, "It's better to build on the future rater than borrow against our future." He also drew loud applause when he said the Clinton program was aimed at asking foreign corporations that "make a profit in the United States to pay the same as U.S. corporations."
But he still drew a largely negative reaction from the Gov. Kirk Fordice, a Republican, who told reporters afterward, "You can't bring prosperity to America with a tax increase."
In New York City, Mr. Brown's pitch for the plan, and Mr. Clinton's speech the night before, did seem to go over well, even with one person in the audience, Bruce Ratner, who said he would be hit in the wallet by the new program.
"It's clear we have to cut our deficit and it's a real plan to do that, which hits everyone fairly," said Mr. Ratner, president of the Forest City Ratner Companies, the real-estate developer of Metrotech. "I'm one of the well-to-do. I should be hit."
 
'Somebody's Got to Pay'
 Others at Metrotech who heard the President's speech were a bit more ambivalent. "The realities are he's going to save the world and somebody's got to pay for it," said Bob Nawn, a 50-year-old computer analyst.
Metrotech is generally regarded as one of the city's success stories. It is home to the Polytechnic University, an engineering school, and the computer operations or corporate offices of businesses like Chase Manhattan Bank, Brooklyn Union Gas, and the New York and American Stock Exchanges. Mr. Brown described the complex as "a model of what should be going on in America -- a real public-private partnership."
And he said that recent news of large layoffs by the International Business Machines Corporation and other large corporations was "exactly why we put forward a stimulus" program.
In Cleveland, Ms. Shalala staunchly defended Mr. Clinton's program but seemed, at one point, to make a small jibe at her boss, who was overheard swearing on a microphone the other night.
Tapping the wireless microphone she wore at the hospital, she said: "I hope you've noticed I don't swear. Even in private. Particularly not with my mother here." Ms. Shalala was accompanied by her 80-year-old mother, Edna Smith Shalala, a lawyer.

HEADLINE: Senate Opposes Immigration Of People With AIDS Virus

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
In a sharp rebuff to President Clinton, the Senate voted overwhelmingly today to stop the Administration from allowing the immigration of people infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
Although the Senate action has little chance of becoming law, the 76-to-23 vote, in which 34 Democrats voted against the President, illustrated both the lingering discomfort in the Senate over AIDS and immigration issues and the new President's lack of control over the Senate. It could foreshadow trouble as Mr. Clinton moves beyond economic issues to pursue his social agenda, which includes support for actions long advocated by homosexual-rights groups. 
 The vote followed an emotional debate between Republicans, who argued that the country could not afford to risk admitting AIDS patients, and liberal Democrats, who said Americans should show no less compassion than other industrialized countries that offer sanctuary to such immigrants.
 
Shifting the Focus
 The Administration did not lobby strenuously against the Republican-sponsored measure, fearing that it would become as intensely disputed as the President's insistence on allowing openly homosexual people to serve in the military.
Gay-rights advocates privately expressed disappointment in the Administration's inaction. But Senate Democrats said it was understandable that the White House chose to focus its attention on the economic program that Mr. Clinton introduced on Wednesday, particularly since the immigration measure will probably die in the House. Powerful liberals there, reinforced by the Congressional Black Caucus, are mobilizing in opposition and are given an excellent chance of killing the amendment.
Only one Republican, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, voted against the measure.
The restriction that prevents people with the AIDS virus from entering the country is now included in regulations, and the President could simply reverse these. The measure passed by the Senate would make the restriction a matter of law that could be reversed only by Congress.
The current rule includes infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, on a list of medical conditions that disqualify people seeking to immigrate legally into the United States.
 
Haitians Are Detained
 The White House announced two weeks ago that Mr. Clinton planned to eliminate all diseases from the list except contagious tuberculosis. The action has been delayed pending a review of policies regarding immigration from Haiti. Some 215 Haitians hoping for admission to this country have been detained at the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, because they are infected with H.I.V.
"The Senate has spoken firmly," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. "The President has to take this vote into account as he reviews the policy." Mr. Stephanopoulos added that the President and his aides have not yet discussed whether Mr. Clinton would veto the bill to kill the amendment, were it to pass both houses.
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, who was a sponsor of the amendment, estimated that every H.I.V.-infected immigrant would cost American taxpayers $100,000 or more in medical expenses. "I do not think it is compassionate to open up a sign that says, 'Come to America and Uncle Sam is going to take care of your medical expenses,' " he said.
"Compassion begins at home," Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said in agreement.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who led the opposition to the measure, argued that the ban jeopardized public health by forcing infected immigrants to go underground, since the disease could subject them to deportation. Mr. Kennedy offered a substitute amendment that would have retained the current ban for 90 days, then allowed the President to lift the regulation without approval of Congress. His measure was defeated 56 to 42.
 
'An Outrageous Act'
 Michael Ratner, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents the Haitian refugees on the Guantanamo base, called the Senate action "an outrageous act" comparable "to the days when we kicked kids out of high school for having H.I.V."
The overall bill to which the immigration measure was attached was the National Institutes of Health Reauthorization Act, and it passed the Senate today by a vote of 93 to 4. It now goes to the House. The overall legislation died in the Senate last year because conservatives opposed a provision that would permit research using tissues derived from aborted fetuses. That issue was settled when Mr. Clinton lifted the research ban with an executive order.
Of the $5.9 billion authorized in the health package for 1994, most of it is earmarked for research into AIDS, cancer and heart and lung diseases.
The immigration prohibition dates to 1987, when a similar measure was enacted by Congress. But Congress backtracked three years later, passing legislation that allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine if H.I.V. infection, like tuberculosis, should disqualify a person from entering the country.
 
International Opposition
 The former Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, concluded that it should not be a bar to immigration and recommended that President George Bush lift the ban. But Congressional conservatives lobbied successfully to convince Mr. Bush to keep the rule in effect.

HEADLINE: A View From a High-Tech Perch

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, Calif., Feb. 18

 BODY:
Like many of the engineers in Silicon Valley, Geoffrey S. Goodfellow, a computer hacker turned high-tech entrepreneur, is a cynic when it comes to Washington. Normally rising at 5:30 A.M., he has little time to ponder politics, and he was still working Wednesday night when President Clinton gave his economics address.
Despite Mr. Goodfellow's detachment, he acknowledged that after catching up with the news this morning he was grudgingly optimistic about the President's economics plan, which would give small companies like his a permanent investment tax credit. 
 Looking around his crowded two-bedroom apartment here, where he works alongside his 10 employees, Mr. Goodfellow said the tax credit might allow him to buy some more computers and communications gear and even hire a couple more people.
 
Electronic Postmaster
 In the grand tradition of the Apple Computer co-founders, Stephen Wozniak and Steven P. Jobs, Mr. Goodfellow, who is 36 and single, founded his tiny Radiomail Corporation in his bedroom five years ago. A pioneer in a new software technology, he now serves several hundred customers and finds his company at the intersection of Silicon Valley's most promising business: an electronic post office for the wireless communicating gadgets that many in the valley believe will be the next computer industry boom.
Radiomail has developed a service, including the necessary software, for routing messages between its customers' wireless devices. The service makes use of the public telephone network as well various wireless data networks like the RAM Mobile Data system. The Clinton plan could help Radiomail grow with the industry.
Mr. Clinton, in his address to Congress, singled out small businesses for special incentives.
"Because small businesses generate most of our nation's jobs, our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history," the President said. "We propose a permanent investment tax credit for small business, and new rewards for entrepreneurs who take risks."
Silicon Valley venture capitalists today were trying to assess how the entire tax package would affect the investment community. Despite grumbling that some provisions seem intended mainly to tax successful people, some venture capitalists voiced clear support for the incentives aimed at small businesses.
"It can't hurt," said Roger McNamee, a fund manager at Integral Partners, a Palo Alto, Calif., high-tech investment firm. "If you think about computers, they are the kind of things people want to spend money on. And in small business, a little more automation can often have a big impact."
Under the Clinton plan, medium-size and large businesses would get a 7 percent credit in each of the next two years for buying new equipment. Small businesses with annual revenues under $5 million would get a 7 percent credit for two years and a permanent credit at a slightly reduced rate of 5 percent thereafter -- or until they grow beyond the $5 million range. For the companies, the credit would free up money to spend on other things, like employees.
Despite such enticements, Mr. Goodfellow is not prepared to enthusiastically back Mr. Clinton -- or any other politician. "Right now," he said, "it seems they're more concerned about whether there is a dial tone in the White House than about getting on with things that will really make a difference in this country."
 
Remembering Kennedy's Move
 But the president that Mr. Goodfellow recently hired, an executive with long experience in the data networking business, seemed pleased.
"This will clearly allow us to make better use of our funds," said William R. Hipp, the new president, who is old enough to remember the success of a similar tax investment credit offered by the Kennedy Administration in 1962. "The economy took off like a rocket at a time when we were suffering."
Mr. Hipp said the latest investment tax credit might give Radiomail the money to support at least 2 of the additional 20 employees the company plans to hire this year. For each additional $20,000 of equipment the company buys, Mr. Hipp said, it will generate enough additional business to hire another person.
"The biggest thing for us," Mr. Hipp said, "is improving consumer confidence, and an intelligent President who makes good decisions will have a significant impact."
Mr. Goodfellow did say that at least one facet of Mr. Clinton's plan was an improvement over the policies of the previous Administration. "The most promising thing is that he is so pro-technology," he said, "especially the idea of backing the creation of a data superhighway."
 
Fine Dining Can Wait
 On the verge of closing a new round of financing from some large corporate backers, Mr. Goodfellow said he planned to move his company into a real office in May.
Mr. Goodfellow, who as a teen-ager dropped out of high school to concentrate on computers, now presides over a home office crowded with 20 of the machines, including a collection of Next Inc. work stations. He has been known to use a powerful minicomputer as a coffee table, and in November he removed his dining room table to bring in two new desks.
Like a number of other small-business men in Silicon Valley, Mr. Goodfellow said he had not set out to become a high-tech pioneer. Instead, his invention was a child of necessity.
"This is actually something I didn't want to do," he said. "I wanted to be a subscriber. But I talked to the big companies, and nobody was willing to set up this kind of service. So I had to do it myself."
And that is precisely the type of initiative the Clinton plan is supposed to foster.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Mixed Greeting for Clinton Plan; Bonds Jump

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The yield on the long-term Treasury bond sank to an all-time low yesterday as the credit market focused on President Clinton's plan for reducing Government borrowing by cutting the budget deficit.
As prices of Government securities soared, the yield of the 30-year Treasury bond sank to 7.02 percent, down from 7.10 percent on Wednesday and the lowest level for the issue since the Government began selling 30-year bonds in 1977. 
 Stocks, however, drew little direction from the Clinton plan. The Dow Jones industrial average gyrated in a wide range until closing only 10 points lower. [Page D6.]
Bond traders shrugged off Government reports that consumer prices edged up five-tenths of a percent in January, an unexpectedly strong increase, and that the economic recovery continued to strengthen on a number of fronts. [Page D2.]
Such data usually depress bond prices because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities. But yesterday, the bond market found its strength mostly in the plan outlined by the President on Wednesday night for cutting the deficit by $500 billion over four years.
"For all intents and purposes, the C.P.I. came in higher than expected," said Kevin Flanagan, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds. "But the Treasury market is still dealing with a political agenda."
Smaller Federal deficits would have a profound impact on the overall bond market, since the Government is the largest borrower. If the Treasury were to issue less debt, the overall supply of new securities would fall, and so would interest rates, because issuers attract buyers for their debt by offering higher interest rates than competing issuers.
Active trading yesterday in the 30-year Treasury bond pushed its yield down to as low as 7.014 percent, as the offered price rose to 10112/32 , up 14/32 from Wednesday. By the close on the New York cash market, the offered price was at 10112/32 , up 11/32 , or about $10.33 for each $1,000 of bonds held. Bond yields fall as prices rise.
Some bond market traders said yesterday that Mr. Clinton's plans for higher taxes to help close the budget deficit would be good for debt securities. They argued that higher taxes would reduce the disposable income available to consumers, slow growth and lower inflation.
"The market recognizes that by zapping disposable income, you in effect put a brake on economic expansion and a temporary brake on the standard of living," said Joseph Battipaglia, director of research for Gruntal & Company. "All of which has the effect of keeping demand from bringing back forms of inflation."
Mr. Battipaglia also pointed to a part of the Clinton plan that calls for the Government to issue more short-term securities, where interest rates are lower. Such a shift would reduce the supply of 30-year bonds, helping to drive up prices and lower yields.
Mr. Battipaglia also said that the market drew confidence from the fact that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had played an early role in devising the Clinton plan. Today, Mr. Greenspan will present his semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, and the market will no doubt be watching closely.
Traders also said another factor in the rally was talk of another cut in the discount rate.
In when-issued trading, two-year Treasury notes to be auctioned next week were offered at a price to yield 3.96 percent, down sharply from 4.07 percent on Wednesday. In when-issued trading, the yield for a five-year note that is also to be auctioned next week was 5.26 percent, down from 5.43 percent.
 
Municipal Bonds
 Municipal bonds were up 1/2 to 3/4 point in active trading as investors continued to buy the tax-free issues to hedge against the proposed tax increase, traders said.
Yields of some long-term bonds plunged 10 basis points. One actively sought issue was the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power revenue bond due in 2017, with a 5 1/2 percent coupon. The bond gained 1 1/4 points to an offered price of 96 1/2 to yield 5.791 percent. For an investor in the top 36 percent tax bracket proposed by Mr. Clinton, the bond's tax-equivalent yield would be 9.011.
Investors in municipals also shrugged off yesterday's economic data since they are more focused on taxes, one bond trader said. Retail bond demand is up and the question of higher taxes has become a reality, another trader said.

Who'll Speak Up for Russia Now? Nixon, No Less

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Old cold warriors need not fade away. Take Richard M. Nixon -- at 80, he is battling on with much of the same fervor he showed in his celebrated jousts with Nikita S. Khrushchev 34 years ago. Only he is not fighting against Communists now, but for Russia.
In speeches, on Op-Ed pages and today in Russia, the former President has become one of the most dedicated advocates of the notion that the United States must not ignore Russia now that Communism has collapsed. 
 Interviewed in the official guest house where he was staying, Mr. Nixon ranged over the arguments he planned to press on business executives and politicians when he returns home: the new Russia was an investment in peace, prosperity and freedom. Success of Russia's economic and political reforms would spell billions in investments and thousands of jobs; failure could mean redoubled military spending. A successful Russia would be a powerful antidote to the Chinese model, living proof for the third world of the benefits of freedom.
Mr. Nixon couched his arguments in the hard logic of national interest -- "gooey friendship" and sentimentality, he declared, have no place in the upper reaches of international affairs. But there was a keenness to his arguments that belied the professions of pure realpolitik.
"I'm an anti-Communist but a pro-Russian," Mr. Nixon confessed. "That's an unusual combination."
 
No Weak Leaders
 This was his ninth visit to Moscow, he said -- he made one as Vice President, two in the 1960's, two as President and four since -- and he seemed still captivated by the land that had figured so largely in his life, that launched his political career as a crusading anti-Communist, and provided some of the greatest triumphs of his tragic Presidency. Now it seemed almost a point of personal pride that Russia be given proper credit for throwing off Communism.
"I've been around a long time; I knew Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Kosygin, Brezhnev, Gromyko and so forth," he said, listing powerful men who had run the Soviet Union after Stalin's death. "There's an interesting thing about Russian leaders, and that includes the current crop -- I have yet to meet one who is a weak one.
"They are strong, very strong. Believe me, they are strong. Perhaps it's the system, perhaps it's in the genes. I would say that under the circumstances, because they are so strong, it's quite remarkable that this revolution has occurred in a peaceful way."
What was remarkable, Mr. Nixon said, was not that President Boris N. Yeltsin's ratings were down, but that he not only remained at his post but could continue to pursue reforms in such daunting conditions.
"His popularity is down, that's quite evident," Mr. Nixon said. "It's down because the economy is down. When you consider, just taking the number I have seen, when you consider that this country is going through a recession much deeper than the Great Depression in the 1930's in the United States, how any government could still go forward with reforms is just amazing."
 
'A Very Tough Sell'
 However obvious his own admiration and support for the processes under way in Russia, Mr. Nixon had no illusions about the difficulty of rousing interest in an America that was turning increasingly inward. But that, he said, was a President's job.
"It's a very tough sell," he said. In the debates in the Presidential campaign, he said, aid to Russia was raised in only one question to Ross Perot. "Since then it's been dropped. The reason is polls: the latest Gallup Poll I saw found 4 percent of American people care about foreign policy -- any foreign policy. Last week we had another example -- Clinton appeared on a town meeting in Michigan, a national town meeting, where he took questions, no holds barred. There was only one question about foreign policy -- it was about Bosnia, not about Russia at all.
"In view of that, any politician is going to say, well, I'm going to concentrate on domestic policy. But it's the responsibility of a leader to educate the people so they will support what needs to be done. Putting it more simply, you don't take people where they want to go, you take people where they ought to go."
Foreign and domestic policy, Mr. Nixon argued, are like Siamese twins: "separate them and they die." That is what he would argue when he returned home, that if economic and political reforms fail in Russia, "you can kiss the peace dividend goodbye and you have to raise defense spending by billions instead of cutting it.
 
'This Wave of Freedom'
 "That failure would have a far greater impact on the American economy than anything President Clinton can do with his 50 billion here and 50 billion there in a $6 trillion economy."
Furthermore, he argued, the success of democracy in Russia would give "dramatic impetus to this wave of freedom that is sweeping over the world."
Mr. Nixon recalled his first trip abroad in 1953, when he visited 17 third world countries. "Over and over, I heard people say they were looking for a model of quick progress. For some this was China, but mainly it was Russia, where they were sending students and so on. Now instead of having Russia exporting Communism, it will be exporting freedom to the world."
Their very pride, he said, would push Russians toward reform. "Today they're being treated as a second-rate power," he said. "This hurts them. That's one of the reasons why a strong case can be made for reforms. If Russia does not reform, it's dooming itself to being a second-rate power."
That same pride, he warned, could turn Russia against the West if it felt it was being patronized.
"One of the things that is absolutely essential is that we not consider Russia to be a defeated enemy," Mr. Nixon said. "It was the Russian people who gave the coup de grace to Communism in December last year. We played a role, the United States, but it was the Russians who finally defeated it. So we should treat them not as a defeated enemy, but as an ally."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose At 6.1% Rate in January

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Consumer prices jumped five-tenths of 1 percent in January, the biggest increase in two years, and industrial output recorded its fourth straight monthly advance, the Government reported today.
The latest outpouring of economic statistics also included a third weekly decline in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, the highest industrial operating rate in 15 months, and record volumes of both exports and imports for December. 
 Taken together, the data pointed to a business expansion that has now found solid footing, even in light of continuing layoffs by major companies and weak economies abroad.
But it was the unexpectedly large increase in the Consumer Price Index that captured much of the attention, setting a pace that if compounded would be 6.1 percent annually. Analysts disagreed whether the rise was an aberration or a sign of revived inflation that could threaten the Clinton Administration's plans to stimulate the economy.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is to appear before Congress on Friday to discuss the central bank's view of the economy and inflation, and to outline monetary strategy. He has recently indicated approval of the Administration's deficit-reduction plans, and most analysts said today's inflation report was not likely to change that.
The bond market apparently reflected that view today, as prices soared.
Today's inflation report may have been a fluke, according to Richard S. Peterson, chief economist at Continental Bank in Chicago. "If it happened twice in a row," he said, "I'd start taking notice. Three times and I'd change my forecast."
Other forces may also have clouded the market's message, including details of the deficit plans of the Administration and its hopes for shifting borrowing away from bonds with the longest maturities, which carry the highest interest rates.
Some analysts found elements of the inflation figures worrisome, particularly when combined with other results since early autumn. "While inflation appeared dead in the summer, it was really just playing possum," said Joel Popkin, a former Labor Department price specialist and now a Washington consultant.
 
Core Inflation Rate
 Mr. Popkin, who has been less optimistic than most, noted that all seven major expenditure groups reported in today's index posted bigger increases in January than in December, and that the so-called core inflation rate averaged about 4.5 percent from October through January.
Patrick C. Jackman, one of those who compiled the index, said, "We do not believe this signals a significant acceleration" in the inflation rate. Among other things, he said, some of the January increases -- for apparel, gasoline and home furnishings -- were natural rebounds from exceptionally big December declines, while price rises in products like tobacco were unlikely to be sustained.
Among the factors in the price report were a 1.7 percent increase in the cost of beef, the biggest since January 1990, and a sharp rise in automobile finance charges that followed a 22-month period during which these costs fell 20.7 percent. Airline fares rose again, too.
Before rounding, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4922644 point for urban residents, a 6.1 percent annual rate. Over the last 12 months, the index has risen 3.3 percent.
Today's report on the output of factories, mines and utilities showed a four-tenths of 1 percent increase for January. This was a bit better than December's two-tenths of 1 percent gain -- revised down from three-tenths -- but not as strong as in October and November.
The Fed also reported that the nation's industries, nearly one-third of the economy, operated at 79.5 percent of capacity last month, two-tenths of a point higher than in December and the highest since October 1991.
The Labor Department said that initial jobless claims declined by 19,000, to 321,000, for the week ended Feb. 6. This was the lowest level since Christmas.

HEADLINE: Boeing Will Cut One-Fifth Of Work Force in 18 Months

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, responding to a slump in orders from the world's struggling airlines, said yesterday that it would eliminate 28,000 jobs over the next 18 months.
Three weeks ago, the company said that declining aircraft orders would force a cutback in production of all its commercial planes and that significant job reductions would be made. Yesterday it provided the details of the cuts, which were at the high end of analysts' estimates. 
 Boeing, the largest producer of commercial aircraft and one of the world's leading aerospace companiers, began 1993 with a work force just over 143,000. The reductions announced yesterday, therefore, mean that every fifth employee will lose his or her job.
There was little effect though, on Boeing shares. They closed yesterday at $33.875, up 12.5 cents.
Boeing, which is based in Seattle, estimates that in 1993, it will eliminate 15,000 jobs in Washington state, with an additional 6,000 in Wichita, Kan. A further 2,000 jobs will be cut at other Boeing locations nationwide.
The company said it expected the process to continue in the first half of 1994, with about 5,000 jobs to be cut.
Economists generally agree that every job lost at Boeing results in 2.8 additional jobs lost in the Puget Sound area. When Boeing scales back, its subcontractors will presumably also reduce their work forces, and other businesses that prospered from sales to Boeing's workers will suffer as those newly unemployed cut back all but essential spending.
Boeing's work-force reduction "eliminates virtually all of the growth you might have seen in Seattle in 1993," said Paul Sommers of the Northwest Policy Center at the University of Washington. The area created about 30,000 new jobs in 1992 and stands to lose that many in 1993 as a result of the Boeing cuts, he said. But "it's not as bad as either the 1969-70 period," he said.
Between mid-1968 and 1971, Boeing's payroll for commercial aircraft fell precipitously -- from 85,000 to just 21,000, prompting the posting of billboards at the edge of town asking, "Will the last person leaving Seattle please turn out the lights."
Today, thanks to high-tech companies like Microsoft, the city is less vulnerable to the business cycles of one company. Still, Boeing is a major source of high-wage jobs.
Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said at a news conference this morning: "These reductions reflect the realities of the current market in the aerospace industry. We recognize the impact on our employees, their families and the communities we live and work in, and will try to minimize the effects."
Mr. Shrontz said Boeing would seek to reassign people within the company, replacing contract workers with regular employees. Boeing said it also planned to explore alternatives to layoffs, including a two-year education leave with paid tuition and continued benefits, and job placement of Boeing employees with suppliers.
Larry McKean, the vice president for human resources, said early retirement would not be offered, as it is company policy to place its most senior employees in crucial positions.
William Whitlow, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle, cited some cushioning effects. "The 777 buildup is going to mitigate it somewhat," he said, referring to Boeing's next midsize airliner, which is due to enter production next year. "Defense has been a mitigator in past cycles," he added, "but will be less of one this time."
The job reductions accelerate a process well under way last year, when several thousand positions were eliminated. Boeing said a company-wide hiring freeze, begun in October 1991, would continue.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Among Traders, Words Of Qualified Approval

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
A disembodied voice began to give a report card on President Clinton's economic address at 7:40 A.M. yesterday as broad-shouldered young men in shirt-sleeves who trade stocks sipped coffee in plastic foam cups.
It was the morning huddle on the trading floor of the First Boston Corporation, and the traders were listening to a a call from London on the early optimism of the overnight European markets. 
 "The dollar is stronger across the board," the unseen First Boston official said in clipped British tones. And he noted that in early trading in London, American stocks and bonds were also up sharply.
 
Adding Up Clinton's Proposals
 The principal business of Wall Street is to set prices on stocks, bonds and money itself. And yesterday, hundreds of professionals in this bright, cavernous room used their computers and telephones to calculate how prices were affected by the economic proposals outlined in Mr. Clinton's hourlong address Wednesday night.
At First Boston and elsewhere on Wall Street yesterday, traders and analysts complained that the proposed spending cuts might be too low and that the tax increases might be too high.
For the most part, however, they concluded that the worst part of the plan for business, the higher corporate tax rates, would not have dire consequences and that a smaller deficit would probably help most markets. In short, the President's medicine for the country seemed good for their business.
One of the President's proposals would increase taxes on firms like First Boston by taxing the value of securities that rose in value before they were sold. This could cost First Boston $35 million over the next three years, the firm said. Yet Archibald Cox, Jr., the firm's president and chief executive, said he was not opposed to the idea.
 
 
Sharing the Pain
 "Yes it's painful, but everyone has to share some of the pain," Mr. Cox said. "If every special-interest group starts fighting the things that affect them, you don't get anywhere at all."
And over all, the President's plan should help Wall Street.
"If interest rates stay low, that's obviously beneficial for our fixed-income business," Mr. Cox said. Since low rates tend to lead investors to continue putting more money into stocks, the trend would likely improve the firm's equity business as well, he predicted.
During yesterday's morning huddle, Joyce M. Albers-Schonberg, a health-care analyst, called in with some bad news. She said that the proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid might lower earnings of hospital companies by 5 to 10 cents a share. But since the health-care stocks had fallen so much recently, she recommended investing in drug company stocks like Merck and Pfizer for the short run.
Although a detailed health-care plan is not due from Mr. Clinton until the spring, she is wary of the pharmaceutical industry's long-term prospects.
 
 
Optimism on Oil
 On the other hand, James F. Clark, an oil company analyst, was optimistic. He predicted that oil industry stocks would rise in the next few months. "These taxes aren't going to be a big deal for the industry, nor will they be so offensive to OPEC that there will be a reaction," Mr. Clark said as he hunched over a microphone that looked like a brown dinner plate.
Mr. Clark and the dozen other stock analysts sat yesterday morning in a room of glass walls that looked out on the trading floor as their opinions were broadcast to First Boston offices in Tokyo, London and across the United States.
And unlike the nearly all-male trading floor, half the analysts were women. They took turns commenting on a different industry, with the opinions ranging from the cautiously optimistic to the enthusiastic.
 The investment picks of the morning were the stocks of pollution control companies, which would benefit from Mr. Clinton's continued emphasis on environmental issues and from a new investment tax credit.
Speaking to the firm's bond traders, Neal M. Soss, the firm's chief economist, predicted a strong bull market for bonds. "The fact that Alan Greenspan was seated next to Hillary Clinton, indicates he has signed on to the program and the Fed isn't going to raise rates soon," he said.
A few minutes later, some traders crowded around Mr. Soss and asked him what the proposals would mean for bond investors.
"The spirit of the market is that the funds rate isn't going above 3 for the rest of your life," he said, referring to the Federal funds rate, the interest charged banks in the Federal Reserve system for overnight loans. "So anything that yields over 3.01 is a buy," he said.
With long-term bonds now yielding more than 7 percent, rates could fall sharply, he said.
 
Giddiness on the Bond Desk
 Over on First Boston's Government bond desk, traders were giddy as prices jumped sharply in early trading. Traders and their customers were particularly impressed with the financial sophistication and command of the material that Mr. Clinton exhibited in his speech, said John P. Costas, First Boston's head Government bond trader.
"The level of experience that Clinton has in terms of the financial markets is unprecedented," Mr. Costas said. "The market appreciates facts and reality, not smoke and mirrors."
While First Boston is an investment bank that works mainly with corporations and institutions, it also serves wealthy individuals.
Off to the side of the trading floor, several dozen brokers in densely packed cubicles, spent yesterday morning chatting about the speech with their clients. There were more orders than usual, largely from customers who worried about higher income tax rates trading in Government bonds and buying tax-free municipal bonds.
"You could not have heard a more clear message that taxes are going up, and we started having people say, 'Enough is enough, let's buy munis,' " said Anthony Werley, the head of the retail department.
Away from the trading floor, the firm's investment bankers saw opportunities in Mr. Clinton's plan.
"Whenever the President creates change or even the specter of change, corporations need financial advice. That's what we do," said Charles P. Murphy, the firm's head of investment banking.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Foes of Corporate Tax Say It Hurts Investment

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
If President Clinton wants to jump-start investment and kick the American job machine into higher gear, why would he raise corporate taxes?
Arguing that the corporate tax makes capital more costly, favors debt financing and gums up the tax system, conservatives from Milton Friedman to Alan Greenspan have long advocated that it be abolished. The Treasury could easily replace the $100 billion or so it raises from corporations, they point out, by treating all businesses as partnerships and then taxing business owners -- the shareholders -- for profits or losses. 
Many public finance economists are inclined to agree that the corporate tax has serious drawbacks. But as a practical matter few are particularly upset by the President's proposal to raise the tax rate on large companies to 36 percent, from 34 percent. Combined with a temporary investment tax credit, they say, the increase is apt to raise money without discouraging new investment.
 
'Hard to Get Alarmed'
 "It's hard to get alarmed about a 2 percentage increase in the corporate tax rate," said Alan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania and, until recently, the chief economist at the Joint Tax Committee.
"I prefer lower rates and fewer preferences, including investment incentives," said Joel B. Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan. "But it's not the biggest deal in the world."
James M. Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, "It's a tax on past investments," adding, "A tax on something that can't be changed is a public finance economists' idea of a terrific tax."
In general, economists favor low rates over high ones because they believe that the free market allocates resources better than government tax writers. And the existence of two parallel tax systems, one for corporations, another for individuals, creates opportunities for people to shift income back and forth in hopes of evading the tax man, along with plenty of make-work for tax lawyers.
 
Reporting Less Here
 What is more worrisome to economists is that in a global economy populated by huge multinational corporations, raising corporate tax rates could actually reduce the Treasury's take by encouraging companies to report less income here and more in tax-friendlier nations.
"The lower the rate," Professor Slemrod said, "the greater incentives multinationals have to report income in the United States."
Still, the proposed increase would push the United States rate up only to 42.3 from 40.3 (including 6.5 percent of state and local taxes). That is higher than Britain's 33 percent rate but still comfortably below Germany's 45.5 percent and Japan's 51 percent.
The corporate tax also encourages debt financing, an inclination that got lots of companies in hot water when the 1980's economic boom abruptly ended. That is because the corporate tax is a double whammy. The I.R.S. peels off 34 cents of a dollar earned by a company and if the remaining 66 cents are paid out in dividends, Washington collects another 20 cents (31 percent times 66 cents) from shareholders. Since interest is deductible, the company can avoid the second whack by borrowing to pay for its new plant rather than selling stock to shareholders.
Anxiety about corporate debt has waned as corporate balance sheets have gotten lighter. Besides, economists point out, the rate increase is modest and still leaves the corporate tax 10 percentage points below its level in 1985 of 46 percent.
 
Bar to Investment?
 The biggest worry is that higher corporate taxes will raise the cost of capital to corporations and therefore discourage investment in new equipment and plants that would help the growth of productivity and living standards.
A higher rate would indeed make capital more costly for the following reason: Say investors demand a return of 8 percent. If the corporate tax is 34 cents for a dollar of profits, a company has to earn 12.1 cents for every dollar invested to pay them the return they want. With a higher 36 percent rate, they would have to earn 12.5 cents, roughly 3 percent more.
"If President Clinton simply raised the corporate income tax and did not change the investment tax credit or depreciation rules," Professor Poterba at M.I.T. said, "that would raise the cost of capital and discourage investment."
In fact, though, the Clinton Administration also wants to revive investment breaks that were done away with in the 1986 tax revision. It is proposing a two-year, 7 percent investment tax credit for big businesses and a permanent one for small companies, which would decline from 7 percent to 5 percent after two years. The credits would apply only to investments above and beyond some base amount.
The Treasury estimates that the credits would cost about $28.9 billion a year over the next five years, a bit less than the $30.6 billion the rate increase is expected to bring in.
"If you raise a dollar by increasing the corporate tax and gave it back through an investment tax credit, on balance, you lower cost of capital," Professor Auerbach said. "The two things together increase taxes on existing income and decrease taxes on future incomes."
 
Tax Not Permanent
 A drug company, say, that is earning lots of profits from a 10-year-old patent will pay more tax on those profits. That hurts the bottom line and may reduce the value of the company, but it does not affect decisions about whether to develop a new drug.
The real trouble with the Clinton proposal, experts said, is that the investment tax credit on big businesses is temporary.
"That's a big mistake," Professor Auerbach said. "they're trying to jump-start the economy and they have to catch it first to do that. We certainly do need more capital formation but we don't need it just in the next year or two."
A temporary credit, most evidence and experience suggests, does not increase the level of investment permanently. But by speeding up investments that companies planned on anyway, it risks robbing from future spending.
"A temporary I.T.C. will speed up investment now and then create a problem two years down the road," Professor Auerbach said. "Having more investment now at the cost of more investment later is not a good idea unless we want to find ourselves in another recession two years from now."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Industry Gauges Costs Of Proposed Energy Tax

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Energy analysts and industry officials said today that the new tax that President Clinton has proposed on the heat content of most fuels would alter costs unevenly among producers in the coal, oil and natural gas industries. Most said the impact on producers would outweigh any reduction in fuel consumption.
For instance, producers of thick, heavy-grade oil from California fields would face higher costs not only from the new tax on the oil itself but also because of new taxes on the natural gas they pump into reserves to loosen the oil and cause it to flow to oil wells. 
 Moreover, natural gas producers would be forced to add the taxes to their production costs at a time when cash prices in some areas remain depressed below $1.25 for 1,000 cubic feet. Some producers will be able to pass along the increases more easily than others because their relative costs are now lower.
Denise Bode, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a trade group that represents small oil and gas drillers, said that various officials, including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, had recently led natural gas drillers to believe that the Administration's policy proposals would favor increased production.
But after attending a White House briefing on the energy taxes this afternoon, Ms. Bode said she was taken aback. "We're talking about a serious problem," she said. If those California oil drillers produce less, demand for natural gas could fall.
But she added that the proposal is not yet final. Officials at the White House briefing welcomed comments that could lead to significant changes in the tax formulas before a bill is sent to Congress in late March.
In all, the oil industry will confront $3.5 billion in taxes on crude supplies purchased for the nation's refineries, according to Philip K. Verleger Jr., visiting fellow and energy economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Refiners had recently shown signs of recovering from two years of weak profits caused by the recession, slack demand and stiff competition. If demand is adequate, they will add the higher taxes to prices for gasoline and other refined products, but if the economy sputters, profit margins could be squeezed anew.
Allen E. Murray, chairman and chief executive of the Mobil Corporation, the nation's second-largest oil company after the Exxon Corporation and a big refiner and gasoline retailer, attacked President Clinton's call for a higher tax on oil, compared with other fuels like natural gas and coal.
"Any tax designed to discriminate against particular segments of society is clearly unfair and not in the best interests of the nation," Mr. Murray said. He added that a tax on consumption would be more equitable.
In choosing a tax on the heat content of each fuel, as measured by British thermal units, President Clinton picked a tax that will affect all corners of the American economy, many in indirect ways. A British thermal unit, or B.T.U., is the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water one degree.
The Clinton proposal is for a tax of 59.9 cents for each million B.T.U.'s of oil, or about $3.50 a barrel, and 25.7 cents for a million B.T.U.'s for natural gas, coal and nuclear power.
Some natural gas producers said that by taxing natural gas and coal equally, the Clinton proposal would delay or diminish the gas industry's hopes for displacing coal as a source for electric power generation.
"The biggest growth in gas usage in the United States can come from utilities, where gas competes directly against coal," said Anthony R. Lentini, a spokesman for the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation in Houston. "This B.T.U. tax just keeps things the way they are. We think gas should get more favorable treatment because of its environmental benefits over coal."
Theodore R. Eck, chief economist at the Amoco Corporation, which holds the biggest natural gas reserves in North America, said: "I wouldn't think that many environmentalists think this is very good. This is not a 'green' bill. It's a greenback bill that puts greenbacks into the Treasury."
 
See Harm to Competiveness
 Large manufacturers in the Midwest that can heat or power their plants with coal or natural gas said that an energy tax probably would not change their consumption patterns because the tax as proposed would not favor one fuel over the other.
Rita Castle, a government-affairs manager at Caterpillar Inc., in Peoria, Ill., said the taxes would raise Caterpillar's production costs. And some economists said that companies like Caterpillar that are engaged in pricing wars with global competitors would be hurt by an energy tax.
"The Administration doesn't realize the trade impact here," said Mr. Eck of Amoco. "This bill would be a major problem for heavy industry that has to compete either in export or import markets like steel."
The Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research firm that analyzes the impact of Federal policy on states in those regions, estimated that the B.T.U. tax would raise the most revenue in the 14 Southern states from Virginia to Texas.
The institute said those states would contribute $7.6 billion of a total of $21.7 billion that the tax would generate yearly by 1997. The 6 New England states would pay $1.2 billion in higher energy taxes; the 5 Middle Atlantic states, including New York and New Jersey, would pay $3.4 billion; the 8 Midwestern states would pay $3.9 billion, and the 17 Western states would pay $5.7 billion, according to the institute.
 
Praise and Criticism
 Some large industrial energy suppliers and users applauded the President's proposal as a necessary step toward curbing the nation's widening budget deficit, even though their operations would be hurt.
Al Becker, a spokesman for American Airlines, said the nation's largest airline could see its yearly jet-fuel costs rise by tens of millions of dollars. Over all, the airline industry has lost $10 billion in the last three years.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Clinton's Aides Sell Message on the Trading Floor

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Two of the top economic aides to the President went to Wall Street yesterday and were greeted with praise for the Administration's efforts to reduce the deficit but were questioned on his commitment to cut spending.
The aides, Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council, and Alice M. Rivlin, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, met about 45 executives for lunch in the New York Stock Exchange board room to assure them about the President's plans. 
 The meeting, attended by the leaders of the nation's largest banks and investment firms and several other corporations, came at the Administration's request.
 
Friendly but With Doubts
 Mr. Rubin, in familiar surroundings as former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and Ms. Rivlin received a friendly reception spiked with some doubts about whether Mr. Clinton would keep the best interests of business at heart.
"There's a general fear among some business executives that the President might well be taking a harder position than they expected," James A. Harmon, chief executive of Wertheim Schroder, said later as he was sending a note of thanks to Mr. Rubin. "To my point of view, Bob was very effective in alleviating those concerns."
But Mr. Harmon, noting the tone of the President's attacks on the pharmaceutical industry, added that he still worried about whether the Administration could retain business support.
The support of financial executives and investors is crucial for the President's economic plans, because stock and bond prices determine how readily companies can raise money to expand and hire.
 
Strong Support
 The President's aides found strong backing for their efforts to cut the deficit and ready acceptance of the need for tax increases. "We were concerned about the same issues," said Donald B. Marron, chief executive of Paine Webber and a major supporter of President George Bush.
He said he found the President's Wednesday night speech generally persuasive, adding, "This is the first time that the deficit has been so much on people's minds."
Several executives, however, pressed for more spending cuts and said that the President should have discussed them in more detail Wednesday night.
"There were people who wished there were even more -- the 2-to-1 ratio Panetta wanted," said Stephen Robert, the chairman of Oppenheimer & Company, referring to calls by Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, for twice the level of spending cuts as tax increases.
The President proposed greater tax increases than spending cuts and some at the meeting wondered whether Congress might grant him the spending cuts he requested. "They were all worried that by the time you finish with Congress, you get tax increases but less expense reduction," Mr. Harmon said.
 
Attracting Attention
 After the lunch, top executives of the exchange led Mr. Rubin and Ms. Rivlin onto the littered floor of the stock exchange. They attracted far more notice from a gaggle of photographers than from the scurrying traders and specialists.
In a news conference, the President's aides said Mr. Clinton deserved credit for the bond market's rise, but argued that the stock market's recent decline had nothing to do with his policies.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 83 points on Tuesday -- the worst decline in 15 months -- after the President announced his broad budgetary themes on Monday evening. The stock market finished relatively even after swinging wildly yesterday, while yields on long-term Treasury bonds hit record lows.
In his decades of experience as a trader and executive, Mr. Rubin said, the stock market's response to new policies is more difficult to judge than the bond market's. "I don't view the stock market's behavior as related to anything the President has or hasn't done," he said.
 
The Alice and Bob Rally
 He jokingly noted, however, that the Dow Jones industrial average gained sharply during his stock exchange visit. "It was down 45 points when Alice and I went in to lunch, and it was up one point when we came out," he said.
Asked about Goldman's recommendation this week that in view of the President's program, clients should reduce their stock holdings, Mr. Rubin said, "It shows you how independent my former firm is from me."

HEADLINE: When the President Comes to Hyde Park;
Selling a Plan in the Town Where the Spirit of Roosevelt Is Everywhere

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HYDE PARK, N.Y., Feb. 18

 BODY:
Verne Newton, director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library here, received the strangest phone call at his home last Sunday afternoon.
It was from a guard at the library who said that some New York Telephone technicians were at the front gate and needed permission to install 20 new phone lines there. Immediately. To the amazement of the guard, and of Mr. Newton, the President of the United States was planning to come to town on Friday to sell his economic plan. 
 By the way, he wanted to stop at the library that housed memories of another President who led the nation through difficult times.
 
How to Get a Ticket?
 Forty-five minutes later, the White House called Mr. Newton to confirm that the trip was under consideration. And less than an hour after that, a Presidential advance team was knocking on his door. Little in Hyde Park has been the same since.
"A year and a half ago, I was a police sergeant," said Michael C. Clinch, a former New York City transit police officer who is the town's police chief. "Now I'm worrying about security for the President."
And he's not the only one. Secret Service agents, joined by dozens of other Federal and local law-enforcement officials, have spent the week combing the darkest corners of the library and the Haviland Middle School, where President Clinton will address about 500 people on Friday afternoon as part of a cross-country tour to rally support for his program.
Ever since word of the President's two-and-a-half hour visit to Hyde Park leaked out, the phone at the Town Supervisor's office has been ringing constantly: each of the town's 21,230 residents, it seemed, wanted to be in the audience. But no one -- certainly not town officials -- had any idea how the townspeople could get tickets.
"That's the question on everyone's mind," Merrilee Brown, the administrative assistant to the Town Supervisor, patiently told one caller who was angling for a seat. "We don't have a lot of firm information."
They do know why Bill Clinton is coming here: Hyde Park is Franklin D. Roosevelt's hometown -- and his spirit is everywhere.
The town's unofficial trademark, a silhouette of F.D.R.'s profile with a cigarette holder clenched in his mouth, is stenciled on the the menus at the Town n' Country Diner, on the Rotary Club banner and even on the business cards of the Town Supervisor, Nancy Alden.
The library and its adjoining museum -- crammed with President Roosevelt's papers and mementos, and run by the National Archives -- sit on the 188-acre Roosevelt estate, near the home that the President used as a vacation White House. A few miles down the road is Val-Kill, the house that Eleanor Roosevelt called home after her husband's death in 1945 and until she died in 1962. Both are buried in Hyde Park.
 
Invoking Roosevelt Aura
 Fiercely protective of the Roosevelt legacy, many people here said they were honored that President Clinton had chosen their town to sell his message of sacrifice in tough economic times.
"I think it's nice for the townspeople to have that here," said 99-year-old Helen Fink, who recalled shaking hands with President Roosevelt after he was elected Governor of New York and worshiping with him at St. James Episcopal Church. "I voted for Bush, but I do think we needed a change."
Some here cautioned the President, as he invoked the Roosevelt connection, not to overemphasize the parallels between the early 1930's and 1993.
"We're not in a depression," said Mary Ann Lohrey, who lives in nearby Poughkeepsie and once shared a memorable Washington cab ride with President Bush when he was a Congressman. "If Bush came up with too little too late, is this guy Clinton coming up with too much too early?"
Nevertheless, in a town heavily populated by people who work -- or once worked -- at one of the three struggling I.B.M. factories nearby, Mr. Clinton's address to Congress on Wednesday night provided fresh reasons for optimism, however cautious.
"I'll pay the tax, I'll pay my share," said Herman Staats, 65, the retired owner of a trucking company, as he ate an English muffin and sipped coffee this morning at the Town n' Country Diner. "The only reservation I have is that I would like to have some confirmation that this money will address the deficit and not be spent by Congressmen at their leisure."
After watching the President's address Wednesday night with about a dozen people gathered at the Town Supervisor's home, Katrina Brown, 18, said she was encouraged that Mr. Clinton was thinking about her generation.
"I just like how he said we had to do everything together," said Ms. Brown, a senior at Franklin D. Roosevelt High School. "I liked his environmental stance."
With the President's visit looming, however, his economic proposals took a backseat today to one, overarching question: Who will get to hear him speak?
Word had it that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, both Democrats, would accompany the President's motorcade from Stewart Airport in Newburgh, about 25 minutes away. But an official who saw the list of invited guests, and who insisted on anonymity, said prominent Republicans were on it too, including Representatives Hamilton Fish Jr. and Gerald B. Solomon, whose districts include parts of the Hudson Valley.
The Town Supervisor, Ms. Alden, said she will be there, as will the four-member town board. The rest of the audience, selected in part with the assistance of the Governor's office, will be filled out by business and civic leaders, as well as by officials from state, county and local governments.
The superintendent of the Hyde Park School District, Lloyd Jaeger, said he had been given "a substantial number" of tickets to distribute to students and teachers from the elementary, middle and high schools. How did he make his selections?
"We've made some determinations on an equitable basis," he said cryptically. "That's how we're doing it."
With many people frantically turning their schedules upside down just to be in town on Friday, it was clear that life in Hyde Park has, of late, been anything but normal.
"I had planned on a very quiet week, making plans with my 11-year-old daughter that I have since had to cancel," said Virginia Carrig, executive director of the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce. "But I told her that this is what Chelsea Clinton has to go through all the time. She only has to do it for a week."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Executives Mix Worry With Praise

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Business ex ecutives found much to praise and worry about -- in President Clinton's economic program.
"Everybody's watching and waiting to see what happens," said Kenneth Pontikes, chairman and chief executive of Comdisco Inc., the nation's largest independent computer leasing company. Mr. Pontikes said that after speaking with his tax advisers and several customers, his growing optimism about the economy had been tempered by a feeling of caution that would persist until it was clearer what Congress would do with the proposals. 
 "Once it gets into the tax committees in Congress, you don't know what will come out," he said.
 
Churning Out Numbers
 But accounting firms and business consultants were quick to jump into any information void, racing to churn out analyses today of the impact of the proposals. In most cases, the numbers they used were provided by the Treasury Department. The analyses underscored how hard it is to pinpoint all the details of the Clinton program.
Consider, for example, the proposal to deny tax deductions for lobbying expenses. The Administration calculates that eliminating the deduction will add $978 million to Government revenues by the end of 1998. "What about trade association memberships?" asked Andre Fogarasi, managing director in the office of tax services for Arthur Andersen & Company in Washington. "How much of that is lobbying? How much of that is good will? How much of that is charitable? That's unresolved."
 
Waiting for Facts
 But a wait-and-see attitude was prevalent among business executives. The first impression of top management at the Sara Lee Corporation, for example, was that the new energy tax could be passed on to customers and that investment tax credits would more or less offset the proposed increase in corporate taxes. The provision to lessen tax breaks for United States companies operating in Puerto Rico would not have a major impact on Sara Lee's factories there.
A reduction in deductions for entertainment from 80 percent to 50 percent might lead to some belt-tightening, and a limit on the deductibility of executive compensation over $1 million might alter some compensation packages, suggested John H. Bryan Jr., Sara Lee's chairman and chief executive. But major investments are dictated by long-range strategic goals and the proposals would not affect those decisions, he said.
"It's interesting theater, but it's not going to change the way we do business," said Mr. Bryan, who was one of Mr. Clinton's most prominent supporters during the Presidential campaign. A longtime critic of using taxes to shape policy, Mr. Bryan said he was dismayed at the prospect of raising overall tax levels as a means to finance specific tax relief. But he said that the general program was "courageous" and did not push corporate taxes out of line with those paid by most foreign competitors in their home countries.
"The key thing that makes this palatable is that it is the first dramatic move against the deficit," he said.
 
Troubling Outlooks
 To be sure, some companies foresee a major negative impact on their operations from the proposals. And some saidd they are already planning to lobby Congress against certain parts of the Clinton plan.
"The energy tax is a major concern," said Donald J. Schneider, chief executive of Schneider International Inc., the nation's largest trucking firm. Fuel accounts for 18 percent to 20 percent of his company's costs, Mr. Schneider said, and the industry is too competitive for price increases to be passed on to customers.
"This gives railroads an unfair advantage, and it penalizes people like the paper industry with operations in remote areas," he said.
 
Entrepreneur Commitments
 Some executives said the most important aspects of the Clinton plan were not changes in policies but commitments to existing policies. "When I heard his technical agenda, I had to rub my hands and say, that's us," said Joseph Engleberger, founder of Transitions Research Corporations Inc. in Danbury, Conn. The start-up company has been designing robots to work as nurses' aides in hospitals and in home maintenance tasks and would benefit from Government funding of high-technology programs.

HEADLINE: Solid if Unheroic, Regan Leaves Books Tidy

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Edward V. Regan, who announced his resignation as State Comptroller today, leaves behind a record as a sound manager of the state's pension funds, a prolific auditor of state agencies and local governments and a consistent critic of the state's heavy borrowing and fiscal gimmickry.
But he also leaves a legacy as a government official who, despite more than 14 years as Comptroller, never really became a major force in either the fiscal or electoral politics of the state. 
 Mr. Regan, a Republican, announced his resignation today at what arguably may be the pinnacle of his influence.
After lobbying for years against the state's growing indebtedness, he succeeded this year in negotiating with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a package of changes in how the state handles its debt. He also played a role in turning public opinion against the Governor's economic-development bond act, which failed at the polls last November. It was the second major bond act rejected in two years after being criticized by Mr. Regan.
 
He Cites Goals Met
 Mr. Regan suggested strongly today that he was stepping down at a time when many of his goals had been accomplished.
"For the first time in 30 years, school districts, New York City and local governments received their vital state-aid payments on time because the state's practice of rolling over deficits each year was eliminated," he said in a statement. "The acquisition of debt by the state is, with the enthusiastic leadership of the Governor and many legislators, about to be disciplined and put under the oversight of the voting public. And the state and local retirement fund has an international reputation for excellence."
And yet Mr. Regan, partly because of the limitations of his office and partly because of the tentativeness of his personality, still has not won the political respect afforded Mr. Cuomo or the leaders of the Legislature. His critics complain that he rarely used the strongest devices at his disposal to force the Governor and the Legislature to change their fiscal practices.
Never, they said, did Mr. Regan refuse to certify the state budget as balanced -- which is necessary for the state to sell bonds -- in order to force the Governor and the Legislature to reorganize the state's finances. And only once did Mr. Regan file suit to block one of the state's budgetary gimmicks for creating cash.
That was in 1991, when Mr. Regan challenged the state's decision to borrow $80 million from the Thruway Authority for its general fund. Mr. Cuomo eventually killed the scheme, and Mr. Regan withdrew the lawsuit.
 
Dogged by Early Reputation
 Mr. Regan earned a reputation for weakness and naivete early in his career in Albany and never succeeded in shedding it.
He was on a ski slope in Vermont, unavailable to reporters, when he authorized an aide to announce that he would run for Governor in 1982. Shortly thereafter, he withdrew from the race after Edward I. Koch, a Democrat, joined it.
In 1988, prosecutors investigated Mr. Regan's fund-raising practices after the disclosure of a memorandum from a top aide that suggested that financial firms contributing to Mr. Regan's campaign would receive state business. He also faced enduring criticism for recommending in the early 1980's that school districts place money in a high-risk investment fund that collapsed.
But Mr. Regan, who is the administrator of the state's pension fund, the second largest in the country, generally had a good record as an investor.
 
Managerial Role
 The state's pension fund grew to $56 billion from $10 billion during his 14 years in office. Over time, Mr. Regan invested a much larger percentage of the fund in the stock market, and it averaged annual growth of 13.4 percent over the last 10 years.
The Comptroller has long been a leading voice in Albany for fiscal responsibility. During his tenure, he helped persuade state leaders to change accounting practices so that the practices now account for appropriations and not just cash expenditures. He also was instrumental in encouraging Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature to end the annual practice of borrowing huge sums every spring to make aid payments to school districts and local governments.
The 62-year-old Mr. Regan, who married for the second time last year, was first elected Comptroller in 1978 after losing a race for the office in 1974. He is a former Erie County Executive and Buffalo City Councilman.

HEADLINE: A Revised Cuomo Budget Reduces Cuts for Schools

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo released a revised budget today that gives an additional $78 million in aid to public schools, greatly reducing proposed cuts for dozens of middle-income school districts on Long Island and in Westchester County.
The revised budget still calls for a $52 million reduction in the $8.6 billion school aid package. But by tinkering with his proposed school aid formula, Mr. Cuomo softened, and in some cases eliminated, cuts for 255 districts. Yonkers, for instance, which would have lost $536,841 under Mr. Cuomo's original budget, would now gain $1.5 million in aid. 
 Mr. Cuomo's budget and his proposed school aid formula still face an uncertain future in the Legislature. His formula, which is intended to give significantly more money to poor school districts, has come under fire from suburban legislators whose districts stand to lose the most aid.
But by altering his formula to give more money to suburban districts of average wealth and by sweetening the total school aid pot, Mr. Cuomo is seeking to broaden support for what had been a highly unpopular proposal, his aides said.
 
'Responsive to Concerns'
 While that is not likely to lead to wholesale support for his plan, it means that aspects of it could pass the Legislature this session provided the school aid cuts are reduced even further, legislators said.
"If there is overall increase in aid, the Senate might go for some changes in terms of redistribution," said Senator Charles D. Cook, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Education Committee. "I'm pleased he has apparently been responsive to concerns he's heard."
The $78 million in new school aid was shifted from other parts of the budget and will not increase Mr. Cuomo's proposed $31.5 billion general-fund budget, his aides said. The largest part of the money came from recalculations in Medicaid costs, which were found to be $34 million less than anticipated, budget officials said.
Mr. Cuomo portrayed his changes to the proposed school aid formula as minor tinkering that hewed closely to his goals of simplifying the complex aid system and redistributing aid to poorer districts. "It more truly reflects wealth, it more truly reflects people's cost of living," Mr. Cuomo said of the revisions in a radio interview tonight.
 
Targets Some Districts
 But his aides acknowledged that the original plan had cut aid to some districts with large concentrations of poor students. The new formula restores much of that aid by targeting districts of average or below-average wealth that also pay relatively high school taxes. It also creates a safety net that insures that no district will lose more than 2 percent of its total budget next year.
"We wanted to make sure no district was disproportionately hit in the transition year," said Andrew J. Zambelli, Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff. "This increases its probability of success in the Legislature."
New York City's aid would not change under the revised formula, remaining at $2.76 billion, $6.2 million more than last year. But Mr. Zambelli said the revised formula would provide much more money to the city in better economic times.
 
3 Districts That Benefit
 Other districts that benefit from Mr. Cuomo's revisions include Hempstead in Nassau County, whose cut was reduced from $1.9 million to $359,993, and the Three Village School District in Suffolk County, whose cut was reduced from $2.9 million to $254,709. In Westchester County, the Port Chester School District would receive an additional $331,863 in aid instead of the original proposed increase of $93,937.
But scores of wealthier school districts, most of them in New York City's suburbs, would continue to receive sharp cuts under the revised formula. School administrators in those districts have said the aid reductions could lead to teacher layoffs, larger classes and higher property taxes.
While Republican applauded Mr. Cuomo's revisions as "a step in the right direction," they said they will fight any cuts in school aid.
And they remained critical of other aspects of his budget, saying it still gives too much money to welfare programs, still takes money from a dedicated fund for transportation projects known as the "locked box," and is still based on predictions for the economy that are too gloomy.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Resigns Albany Post To Head Institute at Bard College

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 18

 BODY:
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, the top-ranking Republican in state government, announced today that he was resigning the job he has held since 1979 to become president of an economics institute at Bard College.
Mr. Regan's announcement stunned his staff and the state's political establishment, setting off a whirl of speculation about whom the Legislature would select to replace him. 
 Carol Bellamy, the former New York City Council president who narrowly lost the 1990 state comptroller's race to Mr. Regan, quickly announced her candidacy. Assemblyman G. Oliver Koppell, a Bronx Democrat, said he was considering the race.
 
Other Possibilities
 Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, a Queens Democrat who has been planning a race this year for New York City comptroller, will not formally announce a campaign for state comptroller, his political consultant, Hank Morris, said. "But if lightning were to strike, he wouldn't step out of the way," Mr. Morris added.
Several prominent black legislators said they would push for a minority candidate to be elected to a statewide office for the first time, and they said their first choice would be H. Carl McCall, president of the New York City Board of Education.
The State Constitution calls for the 211 members of the Legislature, sitting in a joint session, to select someone to fill the Comptroller's unexpired term. Because 127 of the 211 lawmakers are Democrats, the election of a Democrat is virtually assured. The numbers will give a king-making role to Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat who presides over the 101 Democrats who form the majority in his house.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who may run for re-election in 1994, also is likely to play a central role. He almost certainly will want a comptroller who would help balance his ticket and pull out Democratic votes in next year's election.
Mr. Regan, whose term runs through 1994, said he would leave office at the end of April. Mr. Weprin, who returned to New York City from a Florida vacation this afternoon, said he "hadn't had time to digest" the situation but saw no need to rush a vote.
In both a statement and a news conference in Manhattan, Mr. Regan offered few clues about why he was leaving his job in the middle of his term to become president and governor of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute. The center describes itself as a nonpartisan research center and is on the Bard campus in Annandale-on-Hudson.
 
Contributor to Campaigns
 Founded in 1986, the institute makes economic forecasts, keeps 10 scholars in residence, sponsors conferences and publishes books and papers. Mr. Regan had served on the institute's advisory board for the last two years. Leon Levy, who founded the institute in memory of his father, has been a contributor to Mr. Regan's campaigns, giving $2,500 in 1991.
Mr. Regan, who makes $110,000 a year as Comptroller, is to receive a salary of $175,000 at the institute. Officials in the Comptroller's office said Mr. Regan would immediately be eligible to receive a state pension estimated at $49,370 a year.
Mr. Regan called his new job a "prestigious national post" and said he was excited by the prospect of trying "to improve the capacity of the United States to create jobs and employ people."
Several state officials could not shake off their amazement, however, that Mr. Regan was stepping down to take what they characterized as a decidedly low-profile job.
 
'Hard to Fathom'
 "If he was resigning to become president of the Rockefeller Foundation, maybe I'd say, 'O.K., I understand,' " Mr. Koppell said. "But this doesn't sound like a very prestigious position. It's hard to fathom."
Several state officials close to Mr. Regan, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Nr. Regan had decided to resign after concluding that he would not run for governor and that he wanted to change careers before he grew too old to do so.
Some Republican leaders faulted Mr. Regan, who is 62 years old, for giving the Democrats the chance to fill the vacancy with a Democrat, which would leave Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato as the only Republican official elected statewide.
Mr. Regan did not inform his closest aides of his decision until late Wednesday night. Those who work with him daily, many of whom may find themselves looking for work, said they had no idea that he was considering a change.
"Do you have any more information?" one Regan aide asked. "I mean, this is nuts. You'd think we would have seen signs. The only sign I can think of is that he's been in a really good mood the past three weeks."
While many in state government pondered Mr. Regan's reasoning, politicians around the state wasted little time jockeying for a job that could serve as an instant springboard to statewide prominence.
 
Some Quick Support
 Ms. Bellamy, a Democrat, made a point of getting out of the box first by announcing her candidacy at an afternoon news conference in Manhattan. She received a quick boost from the State Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, a Manhattan Democrat, who issued a statement urging "my fellow Democrats to strongly consider Carol Bellamy." Mayor David N. Dinkins said he would also support her.
Mr. Ohrenstein's endorsement was significant because even if a candidate received all 101 Democratic votes in the Assembly, the candidate still would need 5 Democratic votes from the Senate to compile a majority.
One Albany-based political consultant, William Cunningham, joked that it would only be fair for Ms. Bellamy to get the job because "she got 49 percent of the vote in 1990 and there's about 49 percent of the term left."
 
Balance for Ticket
 Looking ahead to the 1994 elections, the state Democratic chairman, John A. Marino, said that "it would be preferable at this point" to appoint a woman or a member of a minority group to the comptroller's job. That would provide some balance to a Democratic ticket that would include three white men if Mr. Cuomo, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine and Attorney General Robert Abrams all run for re-election.
Two black Democratic members of the Assembly, Clarence Norman Jr. and Albert Vann, both of Brooklyn, called for a minority candidate to be appointed. They both mentioned Mr. McCall as a top choice, but Mr. McCall's spokeswoman, Linda Scott, said he had not decided whether to seek the job.
Republican leaders, including the state party chairman, William D. Powers, and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, quickly united around Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., the Assembly minority leader from Norwich.
"I would welcome the opportunity to wrestle with New York's fiscal problems as state comptroller," said Mr. Rappleyea, who also has been considering a 1994 race for governor. "But since the Democrats in the Legislature will pick who gets the job, I'm not optimistic about my chances."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Student Lending Stocks Plunge

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan to phase in direct Government lending to students sent the shares of companies in the business into a virtual free fall yesterday.
Investors feared that the plan -- called a "national service loan" by the President in his speech Wednesday night -- would ravage the business of the Student Loan Marketing Assocation, known as Sallie Mae, as well as the Student Loan Corporation, which is controlled by Citicorp. 
 Sallie Mae shares dropped $9.375 each, or 17 percent, to $47.25. It was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with more than 3.6 million shares changing hands. Student Loan also fell 17 percent to $15.50, down $3.25.
Sallie Mae, a federally chartered company based in Washington, does not originate loans, but it buys and services about a third of all student loans made by banks. Student Loan, based in Rochester, which went public late last year, is the second-largest holder, with 6.5 to 7 percent of the market.
The companies had already been under pressure for weeks on speculation that the Administration would propose a radical change in the guaranteed student loan program.
Under the proposed changes, student loans would be changed to 50 percent direct lending beginning in 1997, with the total shift taking place the following year. The phase-in was an attempt to cushion the effect on the agencies.
While the plan announced on Wednesday seeks only a gradual shift to direct lending, analysts said the companies still faced big political uncertainties.
Comments by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that "valuable dollars" could be saved from the fees being paid to commercial banks to operate the program helped to depress the stocks, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Shifts in Tax On Income Are Blocked By Weicker

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. ignored a last-minute plea by legislative leaders today and vetoed legislation that would have given tax relief to the middle class by shifting the burden to those with higher incomes.
Almost two years after Connecticut enacted its first income tax, Democrats controlling the Legislature adopted revisions that they said would make the tax more fair. 
 But Mr. Weicker, who had repeatedly said he would veto the measure, scoffed at that notion. In his veto message he said the proposal "faintly whispers of tax relief, but shouts loud and clear that our revenue system will again be subject to political tinkering."
Under the plan, couples earning more than $145,000 and single people earning more than $75,400 would have had their incomes above that threshold taxed at 6.25 percent. The current rate is a flat 4.5 percent.
 
Seeking an Override
 The $156 million generated by the tax increase would have paid for some middle-class tax cuts, like a deduction for dependents and property tax credits.
Mr. Weicker's veto was attacked by legislative leaders.
"This veto is a slap in the face for every working man and woman," said the Senate President Pro Tem, John B. Larson. "It just seems to me Weicker doesn't get it. He doesn't have to struggle to make ends meet."
Mr. Larson and House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter promised to seek votes for an override. "We're not going to have this session be dominated by this, but I think in the next couple of weeks, we'll see whether there are votes," Mr. Ritter said.
In the House, the bill passed 84-66 -- far short of the 101 needed to override the veto. However, Mr. Ritter said he might seek support by tacking on items Republicans had sought, such as day-care tax credits.
 
A Warning of Instability
 In his two-page veto message, Mr. Weicker, an independent third-party Governor, said that the income tax was enacted to bring stability to Connecticut's tax system, which had become a victim of the state's volatile economy.
In part because of dwindling revenues and in part because of unwieldy spending in the 1980's, the state had accumulated a $2 billion debt by the time Mr. Weicker took office in January 1991.
To tinker again with the income tax, Mr. Weicker said, would inject another dose of instability.
"The introduction of a new, higher tax rate into our current flat rate tax system shatters our recently reacquired fiscal order and confirms the worst fears of those who believe Connecticut has not learned anything from its painful past," he said.
The Governor also disputed lawmakers' contention that the proposed changes in the tax system would not bring in additional state revenue.
Mr. Weicker said it would increase revenue by $13 million in the next fiscal year and $29 million in the following year.
Several days before the Legislature voted on the bill, Mr. Weicker said that it would raise an additional $38 million. Legislators then added another $38 million in middle-class tax cuts to fulfill their pledge to keep the revisions revenue-neutral.

HEADLINE: Mark Ellingson, 88, Educator Who Led Technology Institute

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Dr. Mark Ellingson, educator and president of Rochester Institute of Technology for 33 years, died at his home in Rochester on Feb. 12. He was 88.
Complications from a stroke caused his death, William McKee, the spokesman for the institute, said. 
 During Dr. Ellingson's lengthy tenure in office from 1936 to 1969, enrollment in day and evening classes rose from 2,250 to 16,000. The endowment increased from $1.5 million to about $22 million and total assets climbed from $2.4 million to about $111 million.
 
Introduced New Programs
 Through Dr. Ellingson's vision, the institute built the present 1,300-acre campus in Henrietta, a suburb of Rochester. Under his direction, new programs were introduced in science, engineering, printing, photography, the crafts and business administration.
One of his first acts as president was to incorporate into the institute the Empire State School of Printing, founded by Frank E. Gannett. Dr. Ellingson also brought to the university the School for American Craftsmen in 1950 and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in 1966.
He joined the faculty of the Rochester Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute, forerunner of the Rochester Institute of Technology, in 1926. He served as an economics instructor for 10 years before becoming president.
Born in Magrath, Alberta, Canada, he graduated from Gooding College (Idaho), receiving a master's degree from the University of Rochester and a Ph.D. from Ohio State University.
He is survived by his wife, the former Marcia Cooke Randall; three daughters, Laura Kathryn Allen of Carlsbad, Calif., Louise, of Rochester, Karen Marie Trueheart of Pittsford, N.Y.; a son, Jon Eric, of Missoula, Mont., and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Grew 29% in 1992

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened last year as the economic recovery revived Americans' appetite for imports and as economic stagnation in Japan and Western Europe dampened demand for American goods there, the Commerce Department said today.
The amount of merchandise imported into the United States exceeded the amount exported by $84.34 billion, a 29 percent increase from $65.40 billion in 1991. The deterioration in the overall trade balance followed four years of steady improvement from a trade deficit of $152.12 billion in 1987. 
 "It basically shows us how much our recovery depends on recovery in our major trading partners," Robert D. Hormats, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said. Rising exports accounted for half the economic growth during the Bush Administration, while weak demand abroad is hurting the American economy now.
 
Administration Response
 Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, issued a statement saying the trade imbalance shows how real President Clinton's concerns about the economy are. "As long as we invest too little, as long as we neglect the budget deficit, as long as we fail to stimulate the natural creative energy of this country, we will continue to suffer trade deficits and leave Americans idle," Mr. Kantor said.
Stephen L. Cooney Jr., the senior policy director for international investment and finance at the National Association of Manufacturers, said he expects the trade deficit to widen in 1993, as the American economy continues to pick up steam and foreign markets languish. After four years of trade surpluses with the European Community, the United States had trade deficits with the community in November and December, he pointed out.
The seasonally adjusted trade deficit for December narrowed slightly to $6.95 billion from $7.35 billion in November, the Commerce Department also said today. Exports rose by 4 percent in December, to $39.73 billion, while imports increased by 2.5 percent, to $46.69 billion.
Total merchandise trade exports last year were $448.16 billion, while imports totaled $532.50 billion, the Commerce Department said. Critics have suggested that the figures may be misleading because the exports tend to be underreported and because the merchandise trade figures do not include trade in services, like insurance. The United States consistently runs a small trade surplus in services. Overall trade figures, including services, will be published later this winter.
As other industrialized economies remain mired in recession, American businesses have been shifting their sights to the developing world. Almost all of the nation's growth in exports last year came from sales to poor and middle-income countries, which rose 13.6 percent.
Accounting for much of the increase, exports to Mexico rose to $40.60 billion, from $33.28 billion in 1991.
 
Fewer Exports to Japan
 Exports to other developed countries rose only 1.7 percent last year, and exports to Japan dipped by three-quarters of a percentage point. The trade deficit with Japan widened to $5.09 billion in December, the largest monthly deficit since $5.21 billion in October 1988.
Japan's Finance Ministry announced on Tuesday that the Japanese trade surplus with all countries, including the United States, widened in January to a seasonally adjusted figure of $9.82 billion from $9.48 billion in December.
 Most of the increase in the American trade deficit last year came in consumer goods other than automobiles. Imports of cotton apparel showed the biggest increase, surging by $3.09 billion, to $13.80 billion. Imports of toys, games and sporting goods rose to $11.35 billion, a $1.94 billion increase.
By contrast, the nation's trade deficit in automobiles was virtually unchanged at $44.86 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Mixed After Advancing Overseas

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed yesterday after advancing in foreign markets, as traders worldwide assessed President Clinton's sweeping economic plan.
Gold prices declined. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $330.70 a troy ounce, down 30 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 10 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $330. 
 The dollar rallied in overseas trading in an early technical response to Mr. Clinton's $500 billion plan to cut the deficit through tax increases and spending cuts.
When activity shifted to domestic markets, trading started with a jolt after stocks on Wall Street shot up early in the trading session and bond prices soared as interest rates declined. But the stock market soon retreated.
 
Rally Was Expected
 "The foreign exchange market thought the dollar ought to rally, too," said Lisa Pazer, an analyst with MMS International. "But then rationality set in, and the market started to consider the contractionary implications of the Clinton plan."
Higher taxes levied at both corporations and consumers could cut back on spending over all. And Mr. Clinton's pledge to work toward lower interest rates was also negative for the dollar.
Low interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, thereby decreasing their need for the United States currency.
Trading was active and choppy. Dealers essentially ignored Government reports showing a five-tenths of a percent surge in consumer prices in January; a modest decline in jobless claims earlier this month, and a deterioration in American's trade balance last year.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 119.97 yen, up 0.72 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 119.60 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 119.15 yen, down from 119.65 from yen on Wednesday.
In London, the pound rose to $1.4460, from $1.4435 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.4475 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.4455.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6310 German marks, up from 1.6250; 1.5060 Swiss francs, up from 1.4990; 5.5210 French francs, up from 5.5025; 1,554.00 Italian lire, up from 1,542.00, and 1.2604 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2636.

HEADLINE: Tax Provision on Donations Could Be a Boon to Museums

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Buried in the sweeping economic plan outlined by President Clinton on Wednesday is a provision on tax deductions for charitable gifts that would produce far-reaching benefits for museums, universities, conservation groups and other nonprofit organizations.
The provision, by eliminating a measure in the 1986 Tax Reform Act, would make all major gifts to nonprofit organizations fully deductible at current market value rather than at the purchase price, which is nearly always much lower. This would encourage art collectors, for example, to donate paintings to museums rather than holding onto them or selling them on the open market.
 
The Cost in Lost Revenue
 The proposal would cost the Federal Government about $70 million a year in lost revenue, the Treasury Department estimated in a document released yesterday. 
 Mr. Clinton's proposal, included yesterday in an elaboration on his televised economic address, was greeted enthusiastically by officials at a number of nonprofit cultural organizations, which have seen a steep decline in gifts as a result of the 1986 act.
"It's superb news," said William H. Luers, the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "It means that the Clinton Administration supports investment in our large cultural institutions around the country."
As part of the President's new tax package, the proposal must clear the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. The same provision was passed by Congress last year in a comprehensive tax bill that was vetoed by President George Bush.
Under the 1986 provision, a collector who gave a painting to an art museum could claim only the purchase price as a deduction, not the full market value, as the earlier rules provided. For example, a donor who bought a painting for $100,000 in 1970 and saw its market value soar to $1 million in 1986 would be allowed a charitable deduction of only $100,000. In the booming art market of the 1980's, such increases were not all that unusual.
Museums and other nonprofit institutions were hit hard by the change. In the two years after the 1986 Tax Reform Act was passed, gifts to museums dropped more than 60 percent, according to a survey conducted by the American Association of Museums, a professional organization that represents 2,700 American museums.
Congress suspended part of the 1986 rule for the 18 months between Jan. 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992. The suspension applied to tangible property, like paintings or scientific specimens, but not to nontangible property, like securities, or to real estate.
The change caused a surge in gift-giving that museum officials cited when speculating on the probable impact of the Clinton proposal.
The Art Institute of Chicago, for example, received 1,895 works of art as gifts in December 1991. In December 1992, after the temporary suspension of tax restrictions expired, that number declined to 27. The Metropolitan Museum experienced a fourfold increase in the value of its gifts during the suspension, Mr. Luers said.
 
To 110 Gifts From 10
 Monticello, the museum at the home of Thomas Jefferson in Charlottesville, Va., received 10 gifts of objects in 1991. That number jumped to 110 when the 1986 rule was suspended.
Museum officials said they expected Mr. Clinton's proposal to have a similar effect. And officials at universities, which depend heavily on donations of securities and real estate, also expressed optimism that they would now reap the same kind of benefits as art museums did under the lifting of the 1986 rule.
Although discussion of the 1986 rule tends to focus on wealthy donors giving artworks valued in the millions of dollars, it has affected small and medium-sized institutions that depend on donors of modest means.
"It makes gift-giving possible for people who do not have a lot of money," said Susan Stein, the curator of Monticello. "Many of the gifts we received in 1991 were valued at perhaps $10,000."
Ms. Stein said she hoped the new provision would make it possible for Monticello to avoid competing with wealthy private collectors on the open market for acquisitions.
"Now we can tell people that if they give the object, it will be as valuable to them as if they sell it," she said.
 
Big Impact in New York City
 Evan H. Turner, the director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, said: "The window that closed last June led to our receiving gifts that donors had long considered giving us, and when the window was opened they did so immediately. The opening of that window again will have a significant impact."
New York City, because it has such a large concentration of major museums, would feel the impact of the proposed change perhaps more than any other city. Luis R. Cancel, the city's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, said: "Restoration of the full tax benefit for the donor is going to immediately translate into a windfall of important cultural objects coming to New York City. This is something that the museum community has championed for many years now, and we are very, very pleased."
The proposal's sponsor in the Senate will Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who in his first public remarks as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee two weeks ago reiterated his strong support for it. "If there is a tax measure I will vote for, it will have that measure," he said.
Some museum officials described the proposed changes as a return to sanity. Mr. Luers of the Metropolitan said: "The paradox of this whole thing is that at the time when the 1986 law was passed, putting an end to decades-old patterns of behavior, the Europeans were trying to institute it. They had discovered over the last 30 to 40 years that one of the benefits that made our cultural institutions world-renowned was that the Government had encouraged this type of philanthropy through tax policy."
Referring to the Clinton proposal, James R. Wood, the director of the Art Institute of Chicago, said: "It's good on many levels, and it comes at an important time. The museum world has no illusions; the next four to five years are going to be tough. But this gives us an incentive to go out and make it on our own."

A Collection in Danger
The London art world is in an uproar over what may turn into de-accessioning at the highest level. An internal British Treasury Department document that was leaked to the press last week proposed selling off the Government's extraordinary holdings of paintings and furniture. These works of art, which include paintings by artists like Gainsborough, Walter Richard Sickert, Augustus John and Frank Auerbach, adorn British Embassies and Government offices around the world. 
 "It's outrageous," said George Levy, a former president of the British Antique Dealers Association. "To denude our embassies -- well, we would be made a laughingstock all over the world. Next we'll hear the Government wants to sell off the pictures in the National Gallery so they can turn the building into a hotel."
The Treasury Department takes a less passionate view. "This area, like all areas of public expenditure, are routinely kept under review," said Irene Campbell, a spokeswoman for the department. "It's natural that the value be examined."
Meanwhile, the Department of National Heritage, the arm of the Government in charge of overseeing the nation's art treasures, is trying to minimize the document's importance. "The Treasury Department is looking into all aspects of Government spending, so it is not surprising that they would examine the art holdings," said Frances Elliott, a press officer for the arts, libraries and museums at the National Heritage Department. "But we have no plans to sell off anything at the moment."
In the House of Commons on Monday, Anne Clwyd, a Labor M.P., asked the National Heritage Department to detail the value and size of the Government's collection and specify in which public buildings the works are kept. Robert Key, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the department, responded, "No market valuation of the Government art collection exists, because the art is not actively traded."
He did say, however, that the collection includes 2,464 paintings, as well as other works of art, and that they are in about 600 British Government buildings throughout the world. Mr. Key himself is said to have a Cecil Beaton photograph of the composer Benjamin Britten on a wall in his office, while Sir Peter Brooke, the Secretary of State for National Heritage, has two paintings by John Piper and a painting by Mr. Auerbach in his office. They are all Government property.
In Washington, Peter Beene, who heads the press office at the British Embassy, said that no requests had been made to give up works of art in the embassy and that he knew of no plans to sell off any of the furniture and paintings in either the embassy or in the ambassador's residence, which was built by Sir Edwin Lutyens and which is currently occupied by Sir Robin Renwick.
If the British Government does put any of its art treasures up for sale, it might have a bit of a problem: many of the works would probably be declared national treasures and therefore could not be sold for export, a stricture that would significantly limit the market for these pricey works of art.
 
Mallett's, Anyone?
 Mallett Plc., an institution in the London antiques world, may be up for sale, too. Or it may become the victim of a takeover. Since December, the word among furniture experts has been that the 128-year-old publicly traded London gallery was so battered by the recession that it was looking for a white knight. Sales at Mallett's, which is based on New Bond Street, began suffering in the early 90's, when many Americans, discouraged by a highly unfavorable exchange rate, stopped coming to London to buy furniture; they had accounted for about 45 percent of Mallett's business.
The House of Fraser, owner of Harrods, holds 29.9 percent of Mallett's stock. Another major presence is Asprey, the venerable silver, jewelry and antiques store on New Bond Street, which purchased 6.8 percent of the gallery's stock in December. "It's a business in tune with ours," said Edward Green, the director of Asprey in New York. "It's good to have friends in the same camp. What the future holds, at this point I can't say." 
Other parties who have expressed interest in becoming involved with Mallett's include Bruce Newman, the owner of Newel Art Galleries, on East 53d Street. "I had discussions with them in November, geared toward working out a merger of sorts," he said. "It's a great company. I don't want to take them over, but to expand is another thing." Mr. Newman said he was still hopeful that the two businesses could work together.
Peter Dixon, Mallett's finance director, said that the company had also been approached by a suitor, whom he declined to name but who had offered to buy the entire business. "But at this point there have been no concrete developments," he said.
 
This Round, to Sotheby's
 In New York, Sotheby's and Christie's are scrambling to get what few name collections are up for grabs. Recently, Sotheby's snagged one, the Old Master paintings, Renaissance bronzes, European furniture and decorative objects, and color bookplates amassed by the real-estate magnate Peter Sharp, who died in April. The works are estimated to be worth more than $15 million.
Diana D. Brooks, the president and chief executive of Sotheby's in New York, confirmed that the auction house had secured the sale but said that no auction date had yet been scheduled.
In the hope of winning over Mr. Sharp's heirs, Christie's had inserted a brochure advertising his Manhattan apartment into catalogues for its sale of Impressionist and contemporary art last May. But Sotheby's won out in the end.
Some in the art world say that Sotheby's offered the Sharp heirs a more attractive financial package. Whether this means an advance on the property is uncertain. All Mrs. Brooks would say is that "there is a financial deal attached" but that "the family told us the financial aspects were a secondary consideration."
 
DeathMurder of a Young Artist
 Fifteen-year-old Christopher Hernandez, one of six people slain in a Bronx apartment on Sunday, was a member of the artist collective Tim Rollins and K.O.S. (for Kids of Survival) and was considered a promising young artist.
Mr. Hernandez joined the group, which is led by Mr. Rollins, when he was only 11, two years earlier than most of the members. Mr. Rollins accepted him early as a favor to the youngster's mother.
"He was one of the most involved members of K.O.S.," said Michael Lerner, who works with Mr. Rollins and K.O.S. "Chris was preparing a portfolio for High School of Art and Design." He was in the eighth grade at Intermediate School 52 in the Bronx and had worked worked on the Tim Rollins K.O.S. show last June at the Mary Boone Gallery in SoHo. The police said yesterday that they still had no idea about the killers' identities or motives.
Recalling that "Christopher was one of the most innocent kids," Mr. Rollins said: "In the 19th century we have the allegory of the massacre of the innocents. Now the allegories are realities."

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber

 BODY:
The author of 'Jacob Zulu' faces an unpleasant choice: giving up a Broadway production or his Dramatists Guild membership.
A rancorous dispute between the Dramatists Guild and the Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago surfaced this week when five leading playwrights aired their grievances over a Broadway production contract they say Steppenwolf bullied another playwright into signing. 
 Calling the terms of the agreement signed by Tug Yourgrau, whose first play, "The Song of Jacob Zulu," is to open at the Plymouth Theater on March 24, "quite literally the worst  the Guild has ever seen," the five playwrights -- Michael Weller, Craig Lucas, Paul Rudnick, Wendy Wasserstein and Marsha Norman -- spoke in an informal meeting at guild headquarters in Manhattan. They said they had the support of three other members who were unable to be present: David Henry Hwang, George C. Wolfe and Arthur Kopit.
"Their posture was 'Take it or leave it,' " said Mr. Weller, referring to Steppenwolf and to the production's general manager, Albert Poland. Steppenwolf, he added, is supposedly in the business of fostering new work. "But if the end result of the process is you get the worst possible deal, how is that encouraging new playwrights?"
Ms. Norman added, "If that's the way they think of writers, then we have to rethink how we think of them."
"The Song of Jacob Zulu," an unusual drama about apartheid that features the a cappella singing group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, was developed at Steppenwolf and has had two successful runs in Chicago. Last fall, after a first attempt by the Shubert Organization to bring the play to New York went awry because of a labor dispute with the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, Steppenwolf stepped in and decided to produce the play on its own, raising $1.4 million to do so.
That would ordinarily be a happy ending. The problem, the guild now says, is that the money was raised on the basis of the playwright's having signed a substandard contract, forgoing all royalty payments in favor of a flat fee until the production recoups its investment.
In effect, the guild says, Mr. Yourgrau has been asked to help finance the play and shoulder what should be the investors' burden. Further, the guild contends the offer was made to Mr. Yourgrau in the spirit, if not the exact form, of an ultimatum: accept these terms, which would mean losing guild membership, or the show does not go on.
Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Yourgrau is to receive $3,750 a week until the investors have been repaid; from then on he is to receive 16.7 percent of the weekly operating profit. Neither stipulation meets the requirements of the guild, which says that a reasonable royalty arrangement, based on established standards, would grant the writer 18 or 19 percent of weekly operating profits throughout the run. That means for every $100,000 the show earns above its expenses, Mr. Yourgrau would earn $18,000 or $19,000.
Mr. Poland said that under the agreement signed by Mr. Yourgrau, before recoupment the potential weekly operating profit of "Jacob Zulu," if the show sells out, is $167,000. The calculations get a little dicey (if Mr. Yourgrau is paid more, the profits dwindle), but under the guild stipulations Mr. Yourgrau could earn more than $20,000 a week from the time the play opens.
Steppenwolf's position is relatively simple: without concessions from the creative partners in the show, it would not have been able to raise the money to put on the play. Mr. Poland pointed out that both the director, Eric Simonson, and the producer, Steppenwolf, who would have been the other participants in a royalty pool, had also accepted flat fees. Adding that Mr. Yourgrau could make as much as $35,000 a week, after recoupment, Mr. Poland said, "We don't view that as sticking it to the author."
Stephen B. Eich, Steppenwolf's managing director, said the financial package was put together so that investors would have the opportunity to recoup their money as quickly as possible, optimally within eight weeks.
"In this economic climate, to find a way to prioritize the investor is a very important concept," said Mr. Eich, speaking from Perth, Australia, where "Jacob Zulu" is now being performed. The idea is that if investing in plays can be made more attractive, more plays -- and more unusual, riskier plays -- might find their way to the Broadway stage. He said Mr. Yourgrau signed the agreement "without any coercion."
Dana Singer, a co-executive director of the guild, agreed the numbers would create a public perception that "the writer will make a fair amount of money, so what's he complaining about?" But, she added, it's the writer's job to write; it's the investor's job to take the risk that a play might not recoup. "The whole enterprise is taking place because the writer wrote a play," she said. "And even in a royalty pool situation, it's not like the investors aren't getting money every week. They take home the lion's share of it."
The dispute emphasizes anew the struggles of the Dramatists Guild, which, in fighting for the claims of writers in a difficult economy, has suffered its share of setbacks, including the resignation of one of its officers, A. R. Gurney, two years ago over a matter in which the guild refused to sanction a contract for one of his plays with a regional theater company.
And indeed, the guild seems uncertain of its clout. For example, at a time when Wendy Wasserstein's play "The Sisters Rosensweig" is set to move to a Shubert theater, the guild decided not to protest that organization's involvement in "Jacob Zulu" (the Shuberts own the Plymouth and have invested $500,000 in the production) or to ask that the Shuberts intervene on its behalf. Is this lily-livered or wise? Bernard B. Jacobs, the Shubert president, is squarely with the producers.
"The arrangement is a fair arrangement," he said. "It's the kind of situation in which the guild should cooperate."
The five playwrights at the meeting this week did say they would not submit plays to Steppenwolf unless this situation were redressed. This creates an interesting problem for Mr. Kopit, whose play "The Road to Nirvana" is to be staged at Steppenwolf this spring.
Reached on a skiing vacation in the Berkshires, Mr. Kopit said he would not withdraw his play because it was a done deal long ago. But he added, "I wouldn't dream of allowing Steppenwolf to do another play."
In danger of being lost is everyone's good will toward "Jacob Zulu." And everyone seems to agree that Mr. Yourgrau does not deserve his central place in the tug of war. The guild, reluctantly, has suspended him.
"I feel like a guy whose wife is giving birth at the same time there's a sickness in the family," he said from Los Angeles before leaving for Perth. "I really regret having to choose between a Broadway production and sticking in the guild."
Told that it sounds as if Steppenwolf gave him an ultimatum, he replied: "I think there were times in the negotiations where it was 'This is it.' I might experience that as an ultimatum. They might experience it as negotiation."

Exploring A Labyrinth Of Ambiguities

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
THE exhibition of Joseph Beuys's drawings, which opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, is the largest and best survey in this country in more than a decade of the man who can fairly be called Europe's most influential postwar artist. Still, an exhibition of Beuys's drawings, even one that encompasses installations and multimedia pieces as this one does, can go only so far. Seven years after Beuys's death at 64, his art remains a maze of conundrums and enigmas. And what show could do more than hint at the charismatic persona that became the essence of Beuys's work through the performances and political activities that made him world famous?
One of the canonical images of 20th-century art is surely the death-masklike image of Beuys himself: gaunt, hollow-eyed and hollow-cheeked, invariably dressed in vest and battered hat. Shaman or charlatan? For more than one generation of politically minded artists, and especially for his fellow German artists, Beuys has been regarded with a reverence matched in its ferocity only by the ridicule that has also been heaped upon him. It was part of his openness of spirit that he reacted to mockery with disarming courtesy. Among the many aspects difficult to reconcile about Beuys was that he was both a kind of megalomaniac and also virtually indifferent to art-world success in the traditional sense. 
 A member of the Hitler Youth and then a pilot with the Luftwaffe, he emerged from a period of mental and physical collapse during the 1950's to become a leader of the student movement, a founder of the Green Party, an advocate of women's rights, the ultimate anti-establishment man. Art became for him a means of healing morally a society that he saw as deeply wounded, and in the case of postwar West Germany, obsessed with economic rather than spiritual recovery.
Yet in the absolutism of his vision and in his self-appointed role as savior, there is something in Beuys's later life that harks back to the Germany of his youth. Certainly he was aware of the potent ambiguity of his art. In his drawings, he repeatedly uses the symbol of a cross, for example, which can bring to mind the Iron Cross as well as the Christian cross or the Red Cross. No wonder Beuys is such a difficult man to come to terms with, quite apart from the daunting eccentricity of his materials and of his visual vocabulary.
Beuys (it rhymes with voice) identified the roots of all his art in his drawings, and you can clearly see why from this exhibition. Here are to be found in their first incarnations the Beuysian images evocative of ancient myth and religious symbolism: the stags, elks, sibyls, priestesses, swans and bees, the references to creation and metamorphosis. Here is the early evidence of his penchant for natural materials, like blood, fat, pressed flowers and felt made from hair.
From the start, Beuys drew incessantly, producing thousands upon thousands of drawings: on the backs of envelopes, on newspapers, on calendar pages, on scraps of paper. During the 1950's, when as a shy, intense veteran recuperating in isolation from the war, he devoted himself almost exclusively to drawings. Beginning in the 60's, when he joined the faculty of the Dusseldorf Academy and increasingly turned into a public figure, the notes he made in conjunction with ritualistic performances, or actions, became drawings, as did the blackboards on which in later years he outlined lectures, which were themselves actions.
The later works, because they are fragments, or souvenirs, from larger events, can seem dry, without context. The early works are different. It's wrong to talk of Beuys's drawings in relation to conventional "good taste," about which he couldn't have cared less. Nonetheless, many of these early works are peculiarly exquisite. Beuys reveals in them a formal sensibility, a feel for the poetry of materials and a delicacy of touch that belie his anti-art posture.
There is, for example, a drawing from 1951 called "Stag, Woman, Child," whose almost vaporous lines demonstrate how meticulous a draftsman Beuys could be. There is the "Nude" of 1954-55, a kind of inky Rorschach blot that emerges on close inspection as an elegantly drawn woman, redolent of sexuality. There is "From: Intelligence of the Swans" (1956), a work of condensed power that contains within its frantic crisscross of sweeping pencil lines a series of subtle pirouettes representing the swans' curved necks. And there is "Death and the Maiden," from 1957, an astonishing shadowy ink and watercolor image of a skeleton and woman in stiff embrace, drawn on the back of an envelope stamped with the word "Auschwitz."
Beuys's early drawings are remarkable, as well, in their sheer diversity, sometimes scrawled as they are like children's sketches, sometimes mimicking the Romantic landscapes of Friedrich or the Expressionist figures of Lehmbruck, sometimes all over the page in their energy, sometimes barely more than a few nervous, nondescript lines so faint you have to put your nose right next the page to make them out. As a group, these works express, above all, the sense of someone tirelessly, painfully, searching for his identity, not just his identity as an artist but as a man.
Both the early and later drawings demonstrate the intertwining of art and science that became one of Beuys's principal aims. Leonardo was a major influence on him. Many of the drawings here, and most of the blackboards, resemble scientific charts or circuitry diagrams. Some of them depict imaginary gadgets. There are lots of lists among the drawings, typed and written out longhand, that suggest the artist's obsession with ordering and categorizing things. It is yet another contradiction that Beuys's art aspired to a total vision of the universe at the same time that it embraced freedom, happenstance and individual will.
The drawings prove that Beuys looked at lots of art. Despite the weighty reverence with which he is sometimes treated, he was full of wit in the way he playfully referred to Pop, in works like "Cascade" (1966), or to Lucio Fontana's punctured canvases, in "Fontana Cinnabar" (1966). Other drawings are reminders that however much of an individual he was, he came of age professionally at roughly the same time as the Fluxus movement, as the Arte Povera artists in Italy, as John Cage and Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly and Claes Oldenburg and the Minimalists in the United States, all of whom his work, in various ways, summons to mind.
What separated Beuys from them, ultimately, were his actions. At the center of the exhibition has been installed his "Directional Forces" (1974), a painstaking reconstruction of a space in which he lectured for hours on end using 100 blackboards, each blackboard tossed to the floor once Beuys finished writing on it. The effect is like coming to a party after everyone has left: you're clearly missing a crucial part of the action. Still, this performance-turned-sculpture epitomizes the interconnectedness in Beuys's work among drawing, theater, politics and pedagogy.
"Words That Can Hear" (1979) illustrates a similar point in a different way. A suite of 92 sheets of paper, it presents variations on the theme of a spiral, or an ear, each image made up of words, one word drawn on top of another as if to simulate a cacophony of voices. The work exemplifies the use of repetitive structures that links Beuys to Minimalism. But more to the point, it suggests a visual metaphor for the relationship between drawing and sound, or speech, that became essential to Beuys's art.
The spiral has another possible meaning. Beuys's life and his art increasingly became one, not only in the sense that he made an art of his political activities but also in the sense that he retrospectively shaped his life's story as a work of art. The shape was a bit like a spiral, with events from his youth echoed in later years. Who knows whether drawings like "Herb Robert" and "Lucko (Croatia)" are from the 1940's, as Beuys said and as the exhibition presents them, or whether they are, as they look, later works to which he gave earlier dates?
The important issue is that the dating underscores how Beuys wished to see his life as neatly cyclical. "Lucko" presages drawings of the 1950's, while "Herb Robert," with its dried and pressed flowers, prefigures the very last group of drawings on which he worked before his death, "Ombelico di Venere Cotyledon Umbilicus Veneris" (1985).
At the Modern, the difficult underground galleries in which this exhibition has been installed are arranged something like a spiral, with the works proceeding chronologically from the outside in. The show, including about 180 works, has been organized by Ann Temkin of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Bernice Rose of the Modern.
It is to take nothing away from what they have done to say that Beuys remains at least as difficult to grasp after seeing the show. His example set the stage for the complex and serious work of compatriots like Sigmar Polke and Anselm Kiefer, and well as for a lot of political and didactic art that carries none of the moral and historical weight of his own achievement. It's not his fault that so many people took him up on his famous declaration: "Everyone is an artist." No one, however, is quite like Beuys.
"Thinking Is Form: The Drawings of Joseph Beuys" opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, and remains there through May 4. It travels to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (May 30 to Aug. 15); the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Oct. 10 to Jan. 2, 1994), and the Art Institute of Chicago (Feb. 15 to April 25, 1994).

Pride and Craftsmanship in a Blue-Collar Family

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
The place is Queens, the time the mid-1950's and the occasion the wake for Papa Vitelli (Joe Paparone), an immigrant carpenter from Italy who came to America as a young man to make a new life. Amid the rich confusion of talk, arguments and laughter, the old man's three sons, Niccolo (John Turturro), the eldest, who's called Mac; Vico (Michael Badalucco), and Bruno (Carl Capotorto) stare down at the embalmed remains.
Their silent recollections are shattered when the old man suddenly sits up in a fury to point out the shabby craftsmanship of the coffin. How could they have allowed it? Doesn't anybody care? Doesn't anybody pay attention anymore? Just as abruptly, the tirade is over and the corpse lies back, exhausted. Again properly dead. It's almost as if it didn't happen. 
 This is the wonderfully vivid introduction to "Mac," Mr. Turturro's loving and contemplative eulogy to his own father, who died in 1988, and to a kind of immigrant experience that is probably forever gone. "Mac," which Mr. Turturro wrote with Brandon Cole, is the actor's very self-assured debut as a director, something that is evident in almost every frame of the film. A more experienced journeyman director, a gun-for-hire type, might have insisted that "Mac" have a stronger, clearer, more conventional story line, one with a more dramatic payoff.
Instead, "Mac" is very much an actor's film. Mr. Turturro conceived it as a screenplay in 1980 and then, with Mr. Cole, turned it into a play, scenes from which were staged and revised over the years at various theaters around New York, apparently with the collaboration of the actors, including Mr. Badalucco and Mr. Capotorto. The result is a movie that is rich in characters and scenes, that wanders, often creatively, and that expresses as much affection for the craft of the actor as it does for the craft of the blue-collar laborer who takes pride in his work.
Mac enthusiastically carries on his father's tradition. Working as a member of a construction gang building private houses, Mac has repeated run-ins with the foreman, who objects to his meticulous attention to detail. Time and money are being wasted. Vico is in the same crew; he works in construction because it's the only thing he knows. He's good-natured, lazy, something of a ladies' man. Bruno, the one brother to attend college, wants to be an artist but goes into construction to make ends meet. The three sons still live at home with a mother who, throughout the film, remains a nagging, unhappy off-screen voice.
In the course of the 8 or 10 years covered by the film, Mac marries and begins his own family while continuing to live at home. The brothers start their own construction business, come close to financial disaster, fall out and then move on. Vico and Bruno enthusiastically embrace the progressing postwar American culture and economy. By the end of the film, only Mac has some idea of the cost of that progress.
Compared to "Riffraff," Ken Loach's new English comedy about nonunion construction workers in London, "Mac" is an intensely romantic work. It reflects the differences not only between American and British labor, but also between the concerns of one very American artist and one who is quintessentially English.
"Riffraff" is politically sophisticated. It's obsessed with particular conditions. Nobody has to tell its characters that the world is old and often unfair. They know that too well. "Mac" seems to be surprised that standards of excellence are slipping. It expresses a longing for the way things were when America was still a dream in the process of being realized. It's not about today, but rather about the past, about things lost that, in time, become idealized.
Mr. Turturro has written a good role for himself and realizes it beautifully, though not at the expense of those around him. Mac is a difficult, exacting man who is out of step with everyone else. Among other things, he likes his work. He's a perfectionist. He has a temper so short that he almost self-destructs. Complementing Mac, and saving him on occasion, is his wife, Alice, nicely played by Katherine Borowitz (who is married to Mr. Turturro), a woman who turns out to have surprising entrepreneurial skills.
"Mac" is the kind of movie in which all of the principal cast members have scenes that define them both as actors and as the characters they play. Mr. Badalucco's is a night out with the boys in which he tries, unsuccessfully, to teach his younger brother how to pick up women. Mr. Capotorto's is a casual encounter on the bus with a woman with whom he manages to have a heated if brief affair without a word being spoken.
Ellen Barkin is very funny as an artist's model, first seen in Bruno's sketching class, who comes to represent all of the glamour that Vico and Bruno are convinced awaits them outside Queens. Also noteworthy is Olek Krupa, who plays the crooked Polish foreman of a construction gang whose men (white, black, Irish and Italian) passionately hang on to their bigotries as a way of asserting themselves.
There are times when Mr. Turturro appears to shoot scenes too safely. He depends entirely on a succession of close-ups to emphasize the emotions in a crucial encounter among the three brothers toward the end of the film, which is movie making for television. More often, though, he loosens up to let the actors have more than just their heads. "Mac" is a very good movie with a mind.
"Mac," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and some sexual situations.

 BODY:
A front-page summary of the Clinton economic proposals yesterday described a proposed income tax change incorrectly in some copies. The proposed surtax would raise the tax rate on taxable income above $250,000 by 10 percent, from a rate of 36 percent to one of 39.6 percent.
A table of case studies showing the impact of the proposal calculated the surtax incorrectly in one case. A family with a taxable income of $283,746 would owe a surtax of $1,215; the family's total tax would be $94,692, an increase of $12,545 over the tax bill under current rules. 
 A front-page article about the economic plan referred imprecisely to the amount by which it would reduce the Federal budget deficit. The miscalculation is discussed today in an article on page A15.

Political Body Language

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
Scenes from the economic speech: Bill Clinton throwing away the script as he chides Republican snickerers in the balcony. Vice President Al Gore, perhaps thinking he was off camera when he was still on, baldly gesturing to the chamber for more applause.
Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois wearing a curdled face, preoccupied by scandal. Colin Powell, seeming a bit on the surly side after battling Mr. Clinton on military budget cuts and homosexuals in the armed services. 
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, leading cheers from the balcony -- and annotating her husband's remarks for her strategically placed seatmate, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, whose impassive countenance seemed equal to any challenge, including being surrounded by Democrats.
Body language speaks as loudly as words, and often louder. The cutaway shots during Wednesday's speech revealed an array of silent conversations and brooding concerns worthy of a Bruegel canvas.
The gooniest gesture was surely Al Gore's appeal for more applause. Mr. Gore later said he was taunting Republicans about Mr. Clinton's call for gun control. But at the time, he looked like a warm-up act. One can imagine his handlers wincing. Is their man running for the White House or a slot on the new Letterman show?
For Mr. Clinton, Dan Rostenkowski's scowl and feeble clapping bode ill. Mr. Rostenkowski is either the unhappiest Democrat or the most worried. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, he faces a wide-ranging investigation that, if it leads to indictment, would force him to resign his chairmanship. That could mean rougher sailing for Clinton initiatives.
For his part, Mr. Clinton seemed to be having a good time, perhaps because he was the one person in the hall who knew when, or whether, his speech might end. His pet gesture -- the hammering thumb and forefinger lifted from J.F.K. -- saw heavy use on Wednesday. His vitality and penchant for complete sentences seemed a striking new style of Presidential communication after George Bush's more self-effacing but twitchy style.
Mr. Bush at least educated people to body language. The man who said "read my lips" might have been able to read Mrs. Clinton's when her husband made a point about health care. Mrs. Clinton turned to Mr. Greenspan and, if we read her lips correctly, said in her firm and increasingly familiar way, "He's exactly right." Mr. Greenspan presumably heard this, but his expression gave nothing away.

HEADLINE: The Vision Beyond the Plan

 BODY:
All President Clinton promised was an economic plan, but his speech to Congress offered something even rarer along the marshy rim of the Potomac -- a vision. If Republicans and Democrats in Congress will only step back from Mr. Clinton's specific proposals, they will discover, perhaps to their horror, that he has assumed the best about them -- namely, that they are capable of conducting business in a brand new way, lifting their sights beyond the short political horizons that normally govern Congressional deliberation.
So what is Mr. Clinton's vision? At its simplest, that it doesn't matter whether you tax and spend by Democratic or Republican rules, as long as you are willing to make politically difficult choices. Ronald Reagan did not much like choosing, so he came up with the idea of cutting taxes, revving up defense spending and assuming that diminished revenues would strangle spending on pesky social programs. 
 The Democrats in Congress did not like choosing either. So their habit has been to mix the stew of taxes and debt ever richer and thicker, making sure that lots of it got ladled into things like unneeded military bases and consulting fees for Democratic Congressmen and cabinet secretaries who had retired to the law-and-lobbying firms.
Comes now Mr. Clinton, who may actually be a new Democrat if he has the grit to follow the map he sketched on Wednesday night.
Like most Clinton speeches, it was long-winded and lanky. But the core was clear enough. Republicans say no new taxes are needed. Mr. Clinton said he wanted more revenues and that he was willing to risk his political health by saying exactly which taxes would go up and who would pay them. He went on to say that not all the spending of the Reagan-Bush era could continue, and that as President he was willing to start choosing.
He advocated stopgap savings in Federal wages and Medicare-Medicaid. Then there were 150 piecemeal cuts touching some sacred Democratic porkpies like rural electrification. Mr. Clinton's trickiest wrinkle was to declare as "investments" a variety of social programs such as Head Start and the Job Corps. Even so, he managed to slam-dunk the Republicans when they snickered at his figures by reminding them that both Mr. Reagan and President Bush favored fictional budget numbers.
But the real hook was his invitation to his hosts. If Congress had a better idea, he was eager to see it step up and make its choices in public. You had to wonder why the Democrats kept jumping up and applauding this approach. The House leadership, in particular, is larded with plump fellows who never saw a tough choice they could not dodge.
At least the Republicans seemed to know what was going on. Never in recent memory have they been so thoroughly wrong-footed. It was no accident that cagey old Bob Dole let his House counterpart, Bob Michel, grin and grind through a threadbare opposition speech.
Presidents must seem to grow larger in office. By that standard Wednesday evening was a plus for Mr. Clinton and for the nation. But it is too early to rejoice. The man's record in Arkansas shows that his vision is sometimes greater than his guts, and the obstacles of entrenched interests and parochial greed that sometimes stalled him in Little Rock are nothing compared with what lurks in the heart and habits of this Congress.
Mr. Clinton urged its members to "have no sacred cows except the fundamental interest of the American people." The instant polling showed that 79 percent of the American people endorsed this view and the harsh prescriptions dashed off by Mr. Clinton. Now let the Congress earn its keep by either enacting this program speedily or coming up with something more honest.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
That $100,000 Ilk

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Between President Clinton's first economic speech and his second, two days apart, something important turned up missing.
The best thing that could happen to Mr. Clinton and his chances of becoming a successful President would be to keep it missing -- the divisive class-conflict tone that ran through parts of the first speech. 
 That talk, laying the ground for the Congressional address, carried too much of the old, dreary, left-wing cant that implies that making money is inherently nasty, that people who had worked hard to earn more could be taxed painfully without a by-your-leave and that "special interests" are all evil unless of course they turn out to be your own cabinet members.
After voting once for George Bush, I decided that was plenty and cast my vote for Bill Clinton. So I knew I could expect more taxes, and should be prepared to put my wallet where my vote was.
Like many others of my dark ilk -- Americans who after a lifetime of work are earning more than the $100,000 a year that now is the economic mark of Cain -- I believe that the U.S. can bear up under more taxes.
I do not believe that makes me a patriot, as Mr. Clinton said folks think back where he comes from. But I will not be happy if my epaulettes are stripped from me by the President if I do not agree with the justification for this tax or that new spending.
And however Arkansans define patriotism, I am sure they are also brought up to say please and thank you and to talk straight.
On Monday, Mr. Clinton said that the $100,000 rich folk were going to pay 70 percent of the raise in income taxes. He did not bother to say please or that he hoped they would think about it and see the necessity. Treated without contempt, they just might.
And then there was that strange bit about how higher taxes were justified because of tax breaks the upper-income people got in the 80's.
But those who received tax breaks had not committed any crime for which they should now be flogged. And the President must know that a lot of people did not even attain the $100,000 punishment level until the 80's and then only because of years of risk-taking and fruitful work, not tax manna.
And he might have had the good humor to acknowledge that $100,000 is not all that guilt-laden an income if you do not have free government housing, limousines, weekend retreats, jogging tracks and household help, know what I mean?
But on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton just about dropped the class-struggle tone. He said some pleasant things about business and actually asked the $100,000 pariahs for support. Nice, polite.
Also he dispensed with that time-honored Arkansas Patriotism Test that he had just invented. Good for you, Wednesday.
We have weeks to examine the Clinton program. Long and groundbreaking as it is, Mr. Clinton will have to put considerable flesh on it for certain Americans.
We are the people who are ready to pay more, even painfully more, provided we also know more -- about where the new money is going, and what it will do to reduce what we detest most. In his speeches, Mr. Clinton barely mentioned it -- the daily violence of life coming from race hatred, AIDS, crime, drug addiction.
During the campaign, America acted as if the world did not exist. Fantasy time is over. So how will the new taxes help America fulfill its international role, if at all? Doesn't seem too much to ask, for the money.
The same man created and gave both speeches. This is a complicated man, this young, open-faced President of ours -- as are most people of great achievement. Many people are struggling for his mind -- and he is one of them.
So his tone and rhetoric are extremely important. If he cannot rid himself of divisive us-against-them, if he echoes the left's eternal paranoid suspicions about business, success, endeavor and visions of America other than its own, he will hobble himself and be unable to lead the country to the fullness of his talent and energies.
One Clinton mind or another will have to prevail, or a rational and candidly explained compromise between them. He has it in him to lead, but not if he sets one tone on Mondays, another on Wednesdays.

HEADLINE: Taxes vs. Growth

BYLINE: By Jack Kemp; Jack Kemp was President Bush's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Clinton campaign that promised a plan for economic growth has suddenly turned into an Administration demanding across-the-board sacrifice from the American people. Indeed, the myth that Americans are undertaxed has become the defining principle behind President Clinton's economic policy. The truth is that Americans are overtaxed, not undertaxed.
Sacrifice is not an economic policy and it's certainly not a goal for which the nation should be striving. Besides, it's not the people who need to sacrifice, it's the bloated Government. 
 More important, raising tax rates will not reduce the deficit but weaken our fragile economy. The faulty premise behind the 1990 budget agreement was that higher taxes would lead to more revenue, lower deficits and growth. Instead, the deficit increased from 3.1 percent of G.N.P. in 1990 to 5 percent by 1992 because the anticipated tax revenue failed to materialize, as it always does when taxes rise.
According to some estimates, the slowdown in growth after the budget agreement cost the Treasury $183 billion, six times the amount of Mr. Clinton's $31 billion "stimulus" package. Expanding growth and opportunity for everyone, not redistribution of wealth, must be the highest goal of economic policy. In fact, we should set a goal of doubling the size of our economy, to $10 trillion from the present $5 trillion, in no more than 12 years.
Achieving the needed 4 to 6 percent growth rates requires a radically different path than the Clinton plan of higher income taxes, surtaxes, new energy taxes and taxes on Social Security recipients. Instead, we must build a strong foundation of incentives for entrepreneurship and productivity.
* Taxes. In his campaign, Bill Clinton accepted the principle that cutting capital gains taxes spurs growth. Our unindexed gains tax is a huge barrier to capital formation and job creation. We should eliminate this tax or at least reduce and index it for inflation. We must also reverse the trend toward higher income taxes with a flatter, fairer and simpler tax code, one that rewards, not punishes, success.
* Government spending. Government at all levels spends too much, consuming nearly 40 percent of G.N.P., up from 26 percent in 1960. If the private sector is the engine of economic growth, then we must restore the balance between the public and private sectors. One proposal would be freeze spending and limit the growth rate of entitlements, except Social Security, to inflation plus population growth. This would still allow a 5 to 6 percent annual increase, permitting us to meet social obligations while producing substantial savings.
* Trade. Restricted trade forces companies to compete for special treatment from government instead of competing to develop better products. Open trade forces governments to compete to lower taxes and reduce regulations to make their economies more competitive.
Unfortunately, the Administration seems intent on a protectionist path of higher tariffs matched by retaliation by our trading partners. Tariffs averaging 27 percent on imported steel and restrictions on U.S. purchases of European communications equipment have already been proposed. While Mr. Clinton has endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement, our goal should be nothing less than global trade liberalization.
Mr. Clinton has outlined some laudable goals: : creating new jobs, ending welfare as we know it, reducing the deficit, encouraging the private sector as the engine of growth. Unfortunately, his tax increases directly conflict with these goals. While at times he sounded like John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, tragically his policies are closer to those of Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter.

HEADLINE: New Clinton. New Era.

BYLINE: By Paul E. Tsongas; Paul E. Tsongas, former Senator from Massachusetts, sought the Democratic Presidential nomination last year.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The Bill Clinton you saw on TV was not the Bill Clinton I ran against. I am pleased the evolution has taken place. Finally, a President who talks about the deficit, competitiveness, long-term growth and generational responsibility. A new era. A hard look at hard choices.
Does the economic package go as far as I, Warren Rudman and my Concord Coalition colleagues would go? Not really. We're more focused on deficit reduction. Are the savings as real as claimed, and will they survive the Congressional journey? I don't know. 
 We're on a new path, led by a very intelligent President who can absorb data and the realities they represent in a way his immediate predecessors could not or would not.
What are the true options? I believe there are four. First, steady as she goes, status quo. If Bill Clinton did nothing else, he awakened America to the stark consequences of doing nothing. Doing nothing means catastrophe. Status quo is not an option. Second, follow the Congressional alternative. Ha! What alternative? You will hear the cries of outraged Republicans. No new taxes! We need a strong defense! These positions and deficit reduction are incompatible! Listen to the Democratic committee chairmen and caucus activists. You will hear pleas for expanded entitlements and increased domestic appropriations. You will never see a specific Congressional alternative. And certainly not one that comes close to the President's deficit reduction package. Remember, these are the same people who lay dormant as Ronald Reagan and George Bush racked up $3 trillion of debt. They are incapable of a true balanced budget proposal.
Third, the Clinton plan. To use very rough numbers, the package breaks down as follows: a little over $202 billion in savings (from the 1994 to 1997 fiscal years) and $267 billion in new taxes in that same period; that's $469 billion in possible deficit reduction. From that total, subtract $109 billion in stimulus and people-first investments and $60 billion in investment tax incentives. This results in about $300 billion in deficit reduction plus $24 billion in interest payments that will not have to be paid -- $324 billion less debt. Not bad.
The danger is that a package will pass without some of the tougher measures and deficit reduction will fade to a low-impact number. Instead of the fiscal 1997 deficit going from $346 billion to $206 billion, it could end up at $260 billion. After all the agony and tax increases, the public will feel deceived.
As for the fourth option, a growing consensus says that the deficit reduction bottom line has to be raised. The original hope expressed by Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, of a 2 to 1 ratio of spending cuts to new taxes is now seen as less than 1 to 1. Congress could add new cuts here and there and reduce the level of investment and stimulus spending just enough to cause the fiscal 1997 deficit to drop below $200 billion -- to, say, $180 billion. Thus, the mystical goal of reducing the deficit in half in four years would be realized (close enough), and we would enjoy business confidence. The public would feel it is on the path to fiscal solvency and Bill Clinton would sweep to re-election.
A caveat. If a $30 billion to $90 billion health care proposal is dropped on the table in the middle of all this, it will disrupt everything. Fast-tracking a health care proposal that requires extensive deliberations and vast new revenue sources is to undertake an initiative that will compete with the economic package in a way that will harm both. We need a health care package, but it must delay its debut until after the economic plan has been passed, taken root and begun to bear fruit.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
'What Will Happen?'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
Bangladesh has a land area small er than Wisconsin and a population of 114 million. Its numbers are growing so fast that by the year 2025 it will outstrip the present U.S. population of 250 million.
"What will happen to those poor people?" M. F. Perutz of Cambridge University asked last fall in a piece in The New York Review of Books. "Even if by some miracle of science enough food could be produced to feed them, how could they find the gainful employment needed to buy it?" 
 The case of Bangladesh is just one among many stark examples of a profound world concern. World population is growing at a staggering rate, and almost all the increase is occurring in the poorest countries.
The earth's population was around one billion in the year 1800, two billion in 1920, three billion in 1960. Today it is five billion. By 2025 it is expected to be more than eight billion, and 95 percent of the increase will have been in the third world.
Prof. Paul Kennedy of Yale makes this demographic outlook -- the overwhelming of already overcrowded and poverty-stricken lands -- a main focus of his new book, "Preparing for the Twenty-First Century." He makes the point that the situation will affect not just those countries but all.
The population explosion in South Asia, Latin America and Africa leads in all those areas to overgrazing, soil erosion and clearing of tropical rain forests. But, Professor Kennedy argues, it also tends to produce regional conflicts, global warming, flows of refugees and great pressure on developed countries to admit emigrants from the underdeveloped.
Anyone who has visited there knows that the pressure of population is taking its toll already, in nature and human psychology, in many places. In the cities of China the crowds can be claustrophobic. In the mountains of India and Nepal people desperate for fuel have denuded forests, so topsoil is being washed into rivers and out to sea.
India has about 880 million people now. It is growing so fast that experts say it will pass China as the most populous country by the year 2035, and the growth may not end until there are two billion people in India. China, with about 1.165 billion now, is expected to reach 1.5 billion.
Mexico is a telling example of population growth and its social and political consequences. It has made dramatic progress in reducing the birth rate recently. But the increase had been so great in previous years that the population is very young and will therefore continue to grow rapidly.
With about 85 million people now, Mexico is expected to have 150 million in 2025. In Professor Kennedy's vision, that means a terrible strain on schools, health care, the environment. It means the crowding of more and more people into "mega-cities."
Already 20 million Mexicans live in Mexico City, many under appalling conditions. Half the country's people live without sewers and a quarter without safe water. Can anyone be surprised that, despite the country's improving economic record, many Mexicans are desperate to get into the United States?
Rational self-interest, not just humane concern, should make the rich countries do all they can to prevent overpopulation and the suffering and strife it brings.
But rationality has not been the mainspring of American population policy lately. Presidents Reagan and Bush shaped their policy to please the anti-abortion movement and the Christian right.
The Reagan Administration sabotaged the world population conference here in Mexico City in 1984 by taking the position that rapid growth was a "neutral" phenomenon. That was, ironically, the classic Marxist view of population growth.
Since then the U.S. has drastically reduced aid to population-control efforts abroad, at a time when underdeveloped countries were recognizing the need for restraint. Michael S. Teitelbaum, writing about the policy in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, calls it "self-inflicted blindness."
Here is one problem that President Clinton can address quickly, without great legislative complications. He has ended the Reagan-Bush distortions of domestic policy on birth-related matters. The need for change in foreign policy is even more urgent: the need to face a reality more menacing in the long run than just about any on earth.

HEADLINE: Get the Cancerous Pesticides Out of Our Food;
Time for Irradiation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Tainted Hamburger Raises Doubts on Meat Safety" (news article, Jan. 27): 
 The Western United States epidemic of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 caused by contaminated undercooked hamburger patties raises the question of how these disease-causing bacteria can be eliminated from the food that human beings consume. It is natural for someone to say, "It is unbelievable that such a low level of Federal meat inspection exists."
Federal inspectors examine about 117 million animals annually, of which 30 million are cattle, from which most of the hamburger is prepared. More than two million pounds of raw beef are imported from Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This beef is thoroughly inspected, as in the United States. E. coli 0157:H7 was first identified in 1983 in the northern United States. In an unpublished 1987-90 survey of raw beef, only two samples were positive out of more than 1,600 samples taken.
E. coli 0157:H7 is not known to cause any diseases with clinical signs in cattle. Cattle are passive carriers of this virulent form of colon bacteria, and there is no way Federal inspectors can identify a carrier animal by physical examination. This problem is not limited to examination for E. coli, but is the same for determining what animals and poultry may be carriers of salmonella, campylobacter, listeria and yersinia. The presence of these pathogens in raw meat is undesirable, but unavoidable.
However, irradiation of the raw product is one way to eliminate the pathogenic bacteria. All of these bacteria can cause disease in humans of varying severity and are especially dangerous to older people, sufferers from chronic diseases and those receiving therapy that compromises their resistance. Children are even more susceptible.
Food irradiation research to eliminate pathogenic bacteria has been in progress by Federal agencies since the 1950's. These studies have demonstrated that pasteurization of meat and poultry by irradiation is effective, economical and safe. The results have been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, the Public Health Service, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Army. Some 14 countries have approved irradiation of poultry to prevent food-borne disease.
Public health officials and administrators face a problem similar to one 100 years ago, when pasteurization of milk was proved effective in prevention of disease. It took 50 years more for pasteurization to be widely accepted. Do we have to wait 50 years and treat 50 million more cases of food-borne illnesses before we institute food irradiation of raw meat and poultry?

HEADLINE: Corporations Have to Pay Fair Tax Share

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Press Harder on Deficit Reduction" (editorial, Feb. 5) couldn't be wronger. For a clear explication of our deficit, I suggest the book "Who Will Tell the People?" by William Greider. He analyzes the deficit in about four pages following page 71: 
 It started as a result of bipartisan Administration-Congressional effort in President Carter's term; during President Reagan's and President Bush's terms it was brought to its present, engorged, state when it carried the national debt to heroic pro portions. The keystone of this program was to excuse American corporations from paying Federal tax.
The real snowball began in 1981, when the corporate segment of our country, which controlled 65 percent of our national wealth and income, was freed from the obligation to pay taxes. It had been paying 25 percent of the national tax burden. I think that's the 25 percent "tax reduction" Senator Phil Gramm takes credit for in his campaign oratory.
The immediate result was a $50 billion yearly shortfall which, with interest on the resulting debt, as well as increased (untaxed) corporate profits, is now around $300 billion. No gasoline tax, no tax on yachts, no tax on wealthy individuals, no suspension of cost-of-living adjustments, no cap on welfare, no diddling with aircraft carriers and missiles, no management of health care -- or any combination of the above -- can make up for the tax giveaway to the corporations since 1981.
By all means, let us have efficiency and economy in all affairs. But the deficit must be made up by those who created it.
The rest of us will have enough to do to achieve full employment, wage, price and profit control, universal single-payer health care, training and education (to all levels) for our youth, adequate food and housing for all and a progressive tax structure that rises to 50 percent for the upper income of individuals and corporations.
That last may seem Draconian -- except for those of us who are trapped in the maelstrom called spending down. To us, all the one-liners about "paying our share," "no free lunch" and "the truly needy" are hypocritical.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies Discuss Sanctions To Force Mobutu to Yield Power

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the rioting and looting this month that claimed hundreds of lives in Zaire, the United States, France and Belgium are considering political and economic sanctions against Zaire and its leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, Western diplomats said today.
Such a move would put pressure on President Mobutu, who has ruled for 28 years, to hand over real power to an interim government. 
 A State Department paper outlining possible steps describes Zaire's plight as extremely dire. Zaire, one of the world's poorest countries, is developing into "Somalia and Liberia rolled into one, with vast potential for immense refugee flows, regional destabilization and humanitarian disaster," the paper said.
 
Clinton's Approval Expected
 The paper, dated Feb. 11, added that if the United States and its allies "allow Mobutu, one of Africa's strongest and longest dictators, to destroy the country in order to prevent the emergence of democracy, United States efforts to foster democracy in Africa may suffer a tremendous setback."
The final form of the sanctions has not been decided, but officials said they would be debated and probably approved by President Clinton within the next few days. An official indicated that at the very least, the allies would seek to freeze Mr. Mobutu's personal bank accounts in the United States and Europe.
African and Western diplomats say President Mobutu has used his position to make himself one of the world's richest men. Critics estimate his personal fortune at $4 billion.
The State Department paper said seizing "personal assets (plane, yacht, and houses) would send a strong message to him, without affecting the Zairian economy or, for that matter, seriously disrupting United States or European business."
But the paper cautioned, "It may be difficult to identify the personal bank accounts of Mobutu and his supporters: they may be under aliases."
 
Other Options
 Other steps being discussed are the ouster of Zairian diplomats from various posts, the denial of visas to Zairians closely associated with Mr. Mobutu, suspension from the International Monetary Fund, an arms embargo and a ban on exports from Zaire, particularly copper and cobalt.
The options were discussed in a meeting last week of senior officials, including Herman J. Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. The subject was also raised Wednesday in Washington in a meeting between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Foreign Minister Willy Claes of Belgium. Zaire was once the Belgian Congo.
Western diplomats involved in the discussions acknowledge, however, that even if stringent sanctions are imposed, it is far from certain that they will have much impact on Mr. Mobutu, who has repeatedly defied predictions of his imminent ouster.
So far there has been little indication that recent efforts to pressure Mr. Mobutu have made any headway. Early this month, in a pointed rebuff to the Western allies, Mr. Mobutu dismissed Etienne Tshisekedi, who was Prime Minister and head of the interim Government, and indicated he would not relinquish his tight control over the treasury and the armed forces.
Still, moves to impose sanctions mark a dramatic change in United States policy. During most of his tenure, President Mobutu has had close links with Washington, and the Central Intelligence Agency in particular.
The current crisis began early this month when soldiers rioted after being paid in new high-denomination bank notes that were issued by the President but outlawed by Mr. Tshisekedi and rejected by traders. Among those killed was the French Ambassador.
As the pillaging and unrest spread, France and Belgium flew in hundreds of troops to evacuate their citizens.

HEADLINE: MORTGAGES;
Old Refinancing Rules Are Out the Window

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:
WITH the nation gripped by the third mortgage refinancing boom in slightly more than a year and mortgage interest rates at their lowest levels in 20 years, the question of when and how to refinance is affecting more and more homeowners.
Until the mid-1980's, there were widely accepted rules of thumb for estimating the appropriateness of a refinancing. Among them: the new rate must be at least 2 percentage points lower than the old rate, you must remain in the home for at least two more years and you must have lived there for at least two years. 
 Now those rules are pretty much gone with the wind. And the major reason is the great variety of mortgages currently available to people contemplating a refinancing.
"You used to traditionally refinance a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with another 30-year fixed-rate mortgage," said David Lereah, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers of America. "Now there is a varied menu of mortgage products out there."
Among them are many kinds of adjustable-rate loans as well as some esoteric kinds. There are balloon mortgages, which are amortized on a long-term basis yet have short-term maturities, and there are two-step mortgages, which have fixed rates for five to seven years and then convert to adjustable rates.
In addition, some lenders have been offering refinancing without closing costs in recent years. With such loans, the mortgage rate is increased slightly to compensate for the absence of closing costs, which otherwise might add from $1,000 to $5,000 to the price of the mortgage. "You don't have to come up with any money at all and the outstanding balance remains the same," said Sidney Lenz, executive vice president of the Countrywide Funding Corporation.
Thus the decision whether to refinance has become more subjective, based on such goals as cutting monthly payments or reducing the term of the loan. Another consideration is the market value of the home.
"If the value of the property has been clobbered, there isn't much that can be done other than paying down part of the mortgage debt or not refinancing," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. "My advice is pay down the debt and refinance. It's one of the best deals around."
In making a refinancing determination, a time frame evaluation comparing your current mortgage with a new mortgage is essential. As outlined in a Refinance Kit sold for $3 by HSH Associates (Department Refi, 1200 Route 3, Butler, N.J. 07405), all of the costs of a refinanced mortgage -- points, lawyer services, application fees and title search and insurance -- should first be totaled, with 10 percent of the total added for miscellaneous expenses. Each point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.
The monthly payment for principal and interest on the refinanced mortgage is then subtracted from the higher payment on the existing mortgage. Then the difference is divided into the refinancing costs to determine the number of months it will take to recoup the costs.
"Ask yourself if you are going to remain in the house long enough to recoup your closing costs on the refinancing," said Paul S. Havemann, vice president of HSH. "Your break-even point should be short enough that you enjoy at least a year or two of savings."
But with changes in mortgage rates occurring more frequently than in the past, it makes sense to consider the possibility of refinancing more frequently, too. "You should look at your mortgage every six months and see what packages are being offered on refinancing," said Howard Culang, managing director of Prudential Home Mortgage.

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Hyde Park Visit, Urges A Renewal of Roosevelt's Legacy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HYDE PARK, N.Y., Feb. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton paid homage to the memory of Franklin D. Roosevelt today and then, walking arm in arm with the grandson of the 32d President, laid a red rose on the grave of the statesman to whom he would like to link his policies and his political fortunes.
"I think of President Roosevelt in the depths of the Depression having gone through his personal journey to cope with his personal problems, summoning interior strength and reserve to lift the nation's vision," Mr. Clinton said in a speech at the Haviland Middle School, which was built by Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration during the New Deal. 
 Now, the President added, "we need that kind of experimentation, based on the plain evidence that we are in a rut."
Mr. Clinton's words made clear the special purpose of his visit today to this Hudson River town, and his appearance with Roosevelt's grandson, James Roosevelt Jr. As the 42d President sought to evoke the personal spirit and political presence of his predecessor, he was clearly trying to make the nation believe that its current economic difficulties are a crisis of nearly similar magnitude to the Depression, and require the same spirit of national unity that fueled the New Deal.
The more he can make that case, Mr. Clinton's advisers believe, the more pressure he can bring to bear on Congress to enact his economic programs and the more sacrifice he can demand of the American people. And, evoking Roosevelt's memory, the President seemed to be searching for a way to persuade Americans that they could trust the Government to work for their common good.
 
Tempest Over Casual Remark
 Mr. Clinton came to Hyde Park, Roosevelt's home north of Poughkeepsie, from Chillicothe, Ohio, where he and White House staff members scrambled to dampen a tempest spawned by the President's casual mention of the possibility that "in the years ahead," the Government might consider applying a national sales tax, or value-added tax.
That comment sparked a flurry of press interest, and Mr. Clinton and his aides quickly assured reporters that it did not reflect the President's current thinking and that it could be a decade or more before such a tax might be necessary.
Addressing his audience here, Mr. Clinton said: "We've got to do things that make it possible to create high-wage, high-growth jobs so that all the students who go to school here will have a future, and so that America will be strong. That's what I think we have to do. In other words, that is my vision. That is not what we have done. What we have done is to try for 12 years to cramp the role of government."
Such policies "have lowered the taxes on the wealthiest Americans," Mr. Clinton said. "Taxes on the middle class have actually gone up in the last 12 years. We have run a horrendous Government deficit."
 
Political Experimentation
 Defending his spending priorities, Mr. Clinton once again turned to Roosevelt's legacy of political experimentation. "You know what an experiment is in science -- it is trying out a new thesis," he said. "If it works, you incorporate it, you build on it, you go on to the next experiment. If it doesn't work, you quit. Government has a one-way experiment. We're very good at starting things and absolutely terrible at stopping them."
Thus, Mr. Clinton said, he wanted to spend less Government money on the special fund to clean up the worst pollution sites and make businesses shoulder more of the burden. He added that he wanted to spend money on programs like Head Start and his vision of a national service program, under which college students would be able to work off their tuitions by serving as teachers or police officers or mentors to distressed children.
On Saturday, the President will meet with children at the White House to discuss issues in a 90-minute program to be broadcast by ABC at 11:30 A.M.
In Chillicothe, a market town of 25,000 people south of Columbus, Mr. Clinton addressed a crowd of about 1,700 packed into a high school. The audience, picked by lottery, was quite receptive to his economic proposals, but asked many questions about the details. One woman asked why the President had not proposed a national sales tax, instead of the tax on energy prices that he did offer Congress.
"It is something I think we may well have to look at in the years ahead," Mr. Clinton replied, going on to discuss the notion of a value-added tax in detail.
But later in the day, Clinton aides found that the reports of news organizations were focusing on those comments, threatening to overshadow Mr. Clinton's efforts to drum up support for his economic package. The President then went out of his way to back away from the national sales tax idea.
He told reporters while shaking hands with schoolchildren on the way out of Chillicothe: "It is not something that is now under consideration. If we start considering it, I'll tell you. I did not mean to float a trial balloon."
Aides said the idea of a national sales tax was considered when Mr. Clinton was drawing up his economic plan in the last three months, but was rejected for political and economic reasons.
It came back to Mr. Clinton's mind, a senior White House aide said, after a meeting this week with Senator Ernest F. Hollings Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, who had been circulating a paper on Capitol Hill calling for a 5 percent value-added tax.
Senator Hollings tried to persuade Mr. Clinton to support the idea, and received in reply only a polite "maybe down the road," the aide said. The value-added tax is favored by many labor leaders and manufacturers because of its potential to make imports more expensive.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
CLINTON'S PROGRAM GETS ENDORSEMENT OF FED'S CHAIRMAN

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton's hand in the coming budget struggle was strengthened today when the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, who is a Republican and a staunch conservative, endorsed Mr. Clinton's proposal to cut the budget deficit.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan, who is widely respected on Wall Street, called the plan "serious" and "credible" and praised it for including detailed cuts, rather than relying on vague goals to cut the deficit. 
 Mr. Greenspan said the deficit and the mounting Federal debt, "are corrosive forces slowly undermining the vitality of our free-market system."
"If we fail to resolve our structural deficit at this time, the next opportunity will doubtless confront us with still more difficult choices," he said.
 
Effect on Interest Rates
 The Administration has vigorously courted Mr. Greenspan's endorsement because a thumbs-up from the Fed chairman, a Republican appointee, could help push long-term interest rates down further and could persuade some ambivalent Democrats and Republicans that the President's program is solid. The rates on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to another record low today. [Page 33.]
The Administration was so eager to show that Mr. Greenspan was on board that Hillary Rodham Clinton invited him to sit next to her when the President unveiled his plan in a televised speech to Congress on Wednesday night.
In more good news for the President, Mr. Greenspan signaled that the Federal Reserve thought there was no immediate need to raise short-term interest rates, saying that there was still enough slack in the economy to allow it to grow fairly rapidly without a threat of inflation.
 
Hints at Lower Rates
 In fact, he indicated that the Federal Reserve would consider lowering rates if Mr. Clinton's plan began to drag down economic growth. Speaking in his usual understated, indirect way, Mr. Greenspan said the central bank would "certainly need to take into account" cuts in the Federal deficit and their effect on the economy when it adjusted interest rates. But he added that it was not possible for the Federal Reserve "to specify in advance what actions might be taken."
In a strong signal to the financial markets, Mr. Greenspan said that the President's plan to reduce the deficit, if enacted, would reduce inflationary pressures, something that should help drive down long-term interest rates. Mr. Greenspan, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman expires in March 1996, formerly ran an economics consulting firm in New York.
The Federal Reserve chairman defended the President's program on a day when Republican lawmakers stepped up their attacks on Mr. Clinton's proposals for cutting the deficit by $325 billion over the next four years. The Republicans asserted that the plan relied too much on tax increases and not enough on spending cuts.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House's budget director, fueled the Republican resistance when he told members of Congress that the Administration was considering additional taxes on tobacco and alcohol to help pay for its plan to overhaul the health-care system.
 
Wouldn't Be Baited
 Mr. Greenspan, in his three-and-a-half hours of testimony, turned aside repeated invitations and entreaties from Republican senators to attack the President's plan, especially for not relying more on spending cuts.
"I just don't think that it is appropriate for any of us at the central bank to be involved in the debate which is in the process of emerging on the various priorities within the total budget system," Mr. Greenspan said. "Our concern is the end result, and we wish you well."
The Federal Reserve chairman said he was not worried by President Clinton's plans to spend $30 billion to stimulate the economy this year. Some Republicans have attacked that proposal for short-term stimulus, saying it was unnecessary and threatened to overheat the economy.
 
Downplays Stimulus Spending
 "The argument that the Administration is making is that what they perceive they need is an insurance policy, so to speak, on economic growth," Mr. Greenspan said. He added that the size of the stimulus package was not "particularly of concern to us."
"If it were a big number, I would tell you," he said. "It would really concern us."
Unveiling the central bank's annual economic forecast, Mr. Greenspan said the economy would grow by 3 to 3.25 percent this year. He predicted that inflation would remain low and that the jobless rate would dip from its current rate of 7.1 percent to between 6.75 percent and 7 percent by the end of the year.
Throughout the hearing, Mr. Greenspan took pains to avoid commenting on whether Mr. Clinton's ratio of spending cuts to tax increases was desirable. But he did assert, as he often had in the past, that efforts to cut the deficit should concentrate on spending cuts. He said this was important because Federal spending had been growing far faster than the tax base.
 
Empathy for Budget Cutters
 Nonetheless, he displayed some unexpected understanding for why Mr. Clinton's plan ended up focusing less on spending cuts than many Republicans wanted and less than several Clinton advisers had hoped.
"It is very difficult to cut spending when we get down to specific programs," he said. "There is a constituency under every single item in the Federal budget for anybody who has endeavored to squeeze it down. When you get to the details, it gets very difficult."
Mr. Greenspan noted that the 3.3 percent core rate of inflation in 1992 -- the rate after factoring out volatile changes in energy and food prices -- had been the lowest in two decades. He expressed pride that the central bank believed that inflation had nearly achieved price stability.
He said price stability "does not require that measured inflation literally be zero, but rather is achieved when inflation is low enough that changes in the general price level are insignficant for economic and financial planning."
"At current inflation rates, we are thus quite close to attaining that goal," he said.
In an almost mocking tone, Mr. Greenspan said it was wrong for lawmakers to worry that they might cut the deficit by such a large amount that it would dangerously weaken the economy. Borrowing a phrase from his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, he said the notion of too much deficit cutting was "nothing I would lose sleep over."
In Mr. Greenspan's view, deficit cuts might pull down long-term interest rates by so much that the stimulative effects of low rates would offset the drag that tax increases, for example, could have on the economy.
The Federal Reserve chairman said that if he could have one wish to help the economy, it would be to lower mortgage rates. That would unleash a flood of home building, which would spur sales of durable goods like sofas and dishwashers.
 
Lower Money-Supply Target
 Mr. Greenspan announced that the central bank's main policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, had decided to reduce its targets for growth in the money supply this year. The new target for M2 -- the most closely followed gauge of the money supply -- is growth of 2 to 6 percent, down from the current range of 2.5 to 6.5 percent. M2 includes cash, savings and checking accounts, and money market funds.
Mr. Greenspan said that lowering the target was just a technical move, asserting that recent developments show that less growth in the money supply is needed to produce a desired level of economic growth.

HEADLINE: Connecticut, New Jersey and New York Report Tax Revenue Increases

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut this week reported substantial increases in tax receipts for December, with income tax revenue in New Jersey and Connecticut rising almost 40 percent over the previous year. The increase in New York was more than 20 percent.
The figures came within days of the release of a national study that found that growing economic activity had increased the sales tax and income tax receipts of most states in September, October and November. 
 In Connecticut, the state hardest hit by the recession in the metropolitan region, the national study found that tax receipts had declined for the three months ending in November. However, yesterday, Connecticut officials said their collections had jumped sharply in December.
In all three states in the region, analysts said the improvement resulted in part from unusual factors -- including a tendency for high-income people to take their bonuses and deferred paychecks at the end of last year, thereby paying income taxes at the 1992 rate and avoiding higher rates expected under President Clinton.
Much of the increase in receipts, they said, may therefore be temporary. And while the report on Tuesday led analysts to predict that there would be calls for lower state tax rates elsewhere in the nation, experts in the metropolitan region said they see little chance of reductions soon.
"I'm not sure that this all means anything more than we had very strong Christmas sales," said James W. Wetzler, the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance in New York State, which said its sales tax receipts in January, reflecting Christmas sales, rose by 3 percent, to $945.7 million, from $917.5 million for the year-earlier period.
 
The 'Clinton Effect'
 January income-tax receipts in New York State soared by more than 20 percent, to $1.752 billion from $1.456 billion the year earlier. In New Jersey, the increase in January income tax receipts was 39.6 percent, to $662 million, from $474 million.
Mr. Wetzler said most of the income tax gain resulted from what he called the "Clinton effect," and the disproportionate number of high-income executives in the region -- particularly on Wall Street -- who elected to take their bonuses and pay their taxes in 1992.
Still, other officials said the expanded tax revenues in New York and New Jersey reflected an end to the recession and better times ahead, if not a fiscal bonanza.
"We are seeing real increases, and they will continue," said Samuel F. Crane, the State Treasurer of New Jersey, who predicted the income tax receipts in his state would increase 6 percent for the fiscal year that ends in June.
The national tax study, released on Tuesday by the Center for the Study of States, a research group in Albany, found that New York's receipts in personal income tax, corporate income tax and sales tax rose by a total of 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter. Since receipts precede tax payments by a month, they reflected incomes and purchases in September, October and November.
The increase in New York compared with an average increase for all states of 6 percent.
 
Other States Less Fortunate
 In the study, researchers said they accounted for things like changes in tax rates and collection techniques to measure the actual increase of funds flowing into the states.
Fourth quarter tax receipts increased by eight-tenths of 1 percent in New Jersey, and declined by 2.4 percent in Connecticut, the study found.
For the states in the metropolitan region, as elsewhere, analysts said any increase in tax receipts is particularly good news now, not only because it reflects increased economic activity but because it may relieve the pressure to raise taxes at a time when increased Federal taxes are being proposed by the Clinton Administration.
In New Jersey, officials said their sales tax receipts in January -- reflecting Christmas sales -- fell to $372.8 million from $397.4 million the year earlier. But the state's sales tax rate, currently 6 percent, had been lowered from 7 percent in 1992, and it said its receipts would have actually increased by 9.4 percent if the lower rate had not been enacted.
In Connecticut, the state's Department of Revenue Services released data yesterday showing that sales taxes collected for December had increased by 9 percent, to $234 million from the year earlier. It said income tax collections for the month had jumped 39 percent, to $280.2 million.

HEADLINE: Proposal for Sludge Plant In Brooklyn Is Withdrawn

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
After a torrent of local opposition and mounting political pressure, the Dinkins administration yesterday withdrew its proposal to build a large sludge-treatment plant along the waterfront of Sunset Park in Brooklyn.
The administration's announcement that it would reconsider its plans came only three days before the City Planning Commission was to vote on the $250 million plant. 
 The commission's members had become the focus of intense lobbying by elected officials from Brooklyn, who said the plant would pollute the environment and harm the struggling economy of the largely Hispanic, working-class neighborhood. Those officials rejoiced last night.
"It's a victory," said Joan Griffin McCabe, the City Councilwoman who represents the neighborhood and led the opposition to the plant. "I think it shows that the city has listened."
 
Unpopular Plants
 The decision to withdraw plans for the plant -- one of five sludge-treatment plants to be built, one in each borough, at a cost of $1 billion -- leaves the administration with the difficult task of finding a new site in Brooklyn. Administration officials said they would have to look for a new site in Brooklyn, a search that could include the Sunset Park site with modified plans for the plant.
"We spent a long time looking for a site," said Albert F. Appleton, the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, who announced the decision to withdraw the plant in a letter to the Planning Commission yesterday afternoon. "Among a series of less-than-ideal sites, Sunset Park was the best."
The city's efforts to find sites for the plants, being built in response to a Federal law that bans dumping sludge at sea, has been fraught with difficulties. After proposing eight plants, the city reduced the number to five last April.
The plants will transform sludge -- the dark, thick liquid residue left after treating raw sewage -- into fertilizer and similar products. Contractors now haul the 13,000 tons of sludge the city creates daily to landfills in other states. Once the plants are built, scheduled to be by 1998, though, the city hopes to sell the sludge products.
The Planning Commission has approved plans for three plants -- on Wards Island, in Maspeth, Queens, and in Mariners Harbor on Staten Island -- and construction has begun on a plant in Hunts Point, the Bronx.
In a letter yesterday, Richard Shaffer, the commission's chairman, told the Department of Environmental Protection that the commission's 13 members believed that the department should reconsider the impact the plant might have on "the community's economic revitalization."
Mr. Shaffer said the opposition had raised legitimate issues about the site, along the waterfront between 45th and 50th Streets amid a bustling manufacturing area.
"We lobbied very hard," said Marilyn Gelber, an aide to Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn. "I don't believe they had the votes."
Residents and civic leaders in Sunset Park had raised concerns that the plant would cause congestion and pollution. They also said the plant would have displaced about 400 jobs in more than 20 businesses already operating on the proposed site.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
If Roger Finke and Rodney Stark are right, the current understanding of American religious history ought to be turned upside down. If Martin E. Marty is right, Professors Finke and Stark might want to wash their mouths out with soap and water, then offer other scholars an apology.
The cause of this difference of opinion is a pugnacious book, "The Churching of America, 1776-1990" (Rutgers University Press, 1992). The title sums up the two professors' overarching thesis: Since colonial days the United States has gone "from a nation in which most people took no part in organized religion to a nation in which nearly two-thirds of American adults do." 
 Historians have long pointed out that church membership hit its low point in the 18th century. But the authors, who are sociologists, draw upon a "sociology of frontiers," noting that colonial settlements like New York and Charleston were disproportionately populated by uprooted young males and no more "filled with God-fearing, Sunday-go-to-meeting folks" than later Wild West vacation spots like Dodge City and Tombstone.
"On any given Sunday morning there were at least as many people recovering from late Saturday nights in the taverns of these seaport towns as were in church," the authors write.
And in 18th-century New England, they write, "non-Puritan behavior abounded." At a time when only a fifth of New Englanders were church members, a third of all first-born children were born to mothers who had been married less than nine months. "Single women in New England," they write, "were more likely to be sexually active than to belong to a church."
Re-examining historical statistics for church membership, Professor Finke (pronounced FINK-ee), who teaches at the University of Washington, and Professor Stark, who teaches at Purdue University, conclude that 17 percent of the population were "religious adherents" in 1776, 37 percent in 1860, 53 percent in 1916, 59 percent in 1952 and 62 percent in 1980.
Among scholars, the most contentious part of the book has less to do with the thesis that America has become more "churched" than with the authors' explanations of how and why, best summed up in the book's subtitle: "Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy."
The authors use an explicit market model in which churches are viewed as "firms" competing for souls. Competition is good; monopoly is bad. Growth in religious participation is due to the sharp conflicts and infighting among churches, not despite them, the authors say.
The "winners" in this process have been the "upstart sects" that once included the Methodists, Baptists and Catholics and today include Pentecostal groups like the Assemblies of God and the Church of God. The winners had entrepreneurial energy, organizational flexibility and a clergy who knew the needs and spoke the language of ordinary people.
The "losers," the authors say, have been the country's mainline churches, especially the Congregationalists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians, who insisted on a well-educated, seminary-trained clergy, spurned the raucous religion of tent meetings and tried to minimize rough-and-tumble competition for new members by interchurch cooperation.
The authors agree with the argument that the Rev. Dean M. Kelley made 20 years ago in "Why Conservative Churches Are Growing." Religious groups grow when they impose sacrifices on their members, Mr. Kelley argued, and decline when they ease the burdens of belonging.
But where Mr. Kelley was offering an explanation for the sharp drop in the mainline churches' membership in the 1960's, Professors Finke and Stark argue, in economic terms, that even when these churches were still gaining adherents, they were already losing "market share" to the upstart sects.
"Religion," they write, "is a collectively produced commodity." Its emotional and psychic rewards are greater, they say, if the believer interacts with others who display an intense confidence in the faith's tenets and a great readiness to sacrifice in time and money for the group and its projects.
Professors Finke and Stark complain that the religious history of the United States has been written largely as a story of the well-established churches and of religious ideas, with an implicit equation between progress and the refinement of these ideas to suit modern secular standards.
They propose instead a history of religious actions and groups in which "theological refinement is the kind of progress that results in organizational bankruptcy" and the heroes are the emotional and unsophisticated religious movements that respectable theologians have often derided.
Their chief example is Methodism, which ceased to grow once it settled its fervent circuit-riding clergy, sent them to seminary and de-emphasized sin, hellfire and damnation.
Applying their findings to recent changes in American Catholicism, the authors conclude that as the church modernizes its teachings and practices, it will change "from an energetic sect into a sedate mainline body," and its membership will begin to decline.
They acknowledge that there are limits to the sacrifices people will accept and that the Catholic Church may have surpassed those limits in its ban on contraception and its requirement of celibacy for priests. Unfortunately this qualification weakens the power of the authors' model to predict future trends.
Last month, "The Churching of America" came under fire from Dr. Marty, a pre-eminent historian of American religion and a man known for his equable temperament. In a recent issue of The Christian Century, Dr. Marty, a professor at the University of Chicago, accused the two authors of a "consistently sneering mode" toward previous scholarship.
They are guilty of reductionism, he said, writing a kind of religious history that "contains no God or religion or spirituality, no issue of truth or beauty or goodness, no faith or hope or love, no justice or mercy; only winning and losing in the churching game."
But Mark Noll, who teaches at Wheaton College in Illinois and has just published a history of Christianity in the United States and Canada, had a more serene view. "I don't see it as a new Bible for American religious history," he said of the book. "But this will be a real good discussion starter."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
G.O.P. SEEKS ALLIES AMONG DEMOCRATS

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Although they are virtually united in criticizing the Clinton economic plan as the same old Democratic tax-and-spend policies, Congressional Republicans concede that when it comes to fighting it they are outnumbered and outgunned.
So they are looking for help from an unexpected source: Congressional Democrats. The Democrats are unlikely to help them kill the plan, the Republicans reason, but it might be possible to seduce enough away from the party to modify the proposal along Republican lines, with more spending cuts and fewer tax increases. 
 Some conservative Democrats, like Representatives Pete Geren and Charles W. Stenholm from Texas, have already begun to grumble that the Clinton package is overly dependent on new taxes rather than spending cuts.
 
Off to a Slow Start
 Most Republicans think it is wishful thinking to believe they can enlist Democrats to abandon their President en masse. And they concede that they have got off to a slow start in developing a single alternative economic policy and selling it to the voters.
Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate Republican whip, said Republican lawmakers did not have to come up with a single alternative plan because the House Democrats and their special-interest allies would disembowel the program. "We'll just sit and watch," he added.
But the Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, predicted that the House Democratic Caucus "will stay together to enact a very large percentage of the program," even in the face of solid Republican opposition.
This view won support today when Leon E. Panetta, the Director of Management and Budget, was greeted warmly by Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee.
Later, Mr. Panetta agreed with Senator Trent Lott, a Republican of Mississippi, about the prospect of a second, later set of tax increases to pay for the Administration's health-care proposals. "It's a little early to say," Mr. Panetta said, "but I suspect that some of the sin taxes are going to be used."
Administration officials said earlier in the week that they were considering two dozen new taxes, including levies on alcohol, tobacco and guns, to pay for extending health coverage for all Americans.
The Republican predicament of opposing the new taxes underscores the broader problem they face of changing gears from cheerleaders of the Bush White House to minority opponents of the new Democratic Administration.
"I'm frustrated because it is hard for us to get our message out," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. "We're going to come up with some kind of program. Leon Panetta has 500 staff people and I have 12, so it's going to take us a little more time but we are working at it."
Mr. Kasich is one of several Republican lawmakers working on alternative budgets and economic plans. Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, supports a plan to cap the growth of certain programs with automatic benefits, like Medicare, Medicaid and some veterans programs.
Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, wants to kill the President's stimulus package of $16 billion in new spending and enact a balanced-budget amendment.
A number of Republicans are putting out lists of expenditures they want slashed, like financing for the space station and the Superconducting Supercollider, a particle accelerator, but their efforts are opposed by still other Republican lawmakers whose districts would benefit from such programs.
Only hours before Mr. Clinton addressed Congress on Wednesday night, Republican lawmakers gleefully expressed confidence that his economic program was doomed. Telephone calls to Capitol Hill were running 10 to 1 against the plan. But polls after the speech show that Mr. Clinton halted the slide and won majority support for the broad outlines of his plan.
To counter such support, Republican lawmakers are fanning out across the nation this weekend, holding town meetings and appearing on local television stations. But with so many different Republican alternatives, Republicans concede that the party lacks a single voice voters can focus on.
Senator Gramm said that once the voters understood the details of the plan, public opinion could be changed. By Mr. Gramm's calculations, the Clinton plan will raise nonmilitary domestic spending by $13 billion over five years. The kernel of the plan is $313 billion of net tax increases. Therefore, he concluded, "This idea of shared sacrifice is totally fraudulent."
"Our first challenge now is to get the facts out," he said. "I can't defeat President Clinton's speech. There has got to be a reality check."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
Meeting Hope and Doubt Arm in Arm

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHILLICOTHE, Ohio, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The audiences hearing President Clinton's traveling salesman's pitch for his economic package have been friendly, even awe-struck, carefully stocked with Democrats and eager to be persuaded.
Yet beneath the ovations and the roars of approval, there has been a skepticism expressed by many who heard Mr. Clinton's hard sell firsthand over the last two days. 
 "I don't want to wake up in four years and have him tell me, 'Uh oh,' " said Jeri Sexton, a 30-year-old homemaker here who said she had voted for Mr. Clinton. "I'd like to be behind the program, but I don't want to be the rat following the Pied Piper. I want to trust him, but I still need to see the facts and figures."
Telling Mr. Clinton that "Ross Perot spoiled me with flip charts, pointers and poster board," Ms. Sexton asked him for such specifics at the President's appearance in a high school here this morning. But as much as she wanted to be a believer, she said afterward, she was not convinced by the statistics he gave and still wanted more details.
 
'A Lot of Enthusiasm'
 Tom McKean, a 49-year-old plant manager who heard Mr. Clinton in downtown St. Louis on Thursday, said he had voted for President Bush last year but added: "Clinton shows a lot of enthusiasm, which is good. I'm not wild about the higher taxes. But if there's a way to get the pork barrel out of politics, I would support it. And I won't be convinced until I see the spending cuts actually taking place."
This mix of cynicism and hope that often surfaced in last year's Presidential campaign emerged again and again in interviews with about 50 people who attended the President's question-and-answer session today in this gritty mill town in southern Ohio, or heard his speech at a restored train station now used as a shopping mall in St. Louis.
They praised Mr. Clinton for, as many put it, having "the guts" to propose tax increases and then to confront people who would have to pay those new taxes personally. But they also demanded proof that he intended to trim Federal spending enough to justify the tax increases. And some said they feared that the endemic problems of unrestrained spending by Congress and greedy influence peddlers in the capital were too overwhelming for any one person -- even a President -- to tackle.
Peg Grimes, a homemaker who also works with animals on her family's 100-acre farm near here, said the one remark by Mr. Clinton that encouraged her came when he assured the audience today that "I have no interest in raising a penny in taxes if we're not going to do the cuts."
 
'Show Me the Cuts First'
 But, she said: "I'm just uneasy. We're used to tax and spend. He's talking tax and spend and cut. And he can flip the numbers any way he wants to make them say anything he wants. We'll see."
Randy Howard, who sells recreational vehicles in St. Louis, said he, too, was waiting for proof that Mr. Clinton was serious about cuts. "Show me the cuts first, and then show me the tax increase one year from now," he said.
Mr. Howard, a 38-year-old Republican who voted for Mr. Bush, said that while it was important to reduce the deficit, it was unfair for middle class people like him to be expected to help foot the bill. "Every week when I stop to fill up my tank, when I turn up my thermostat, it's going to hit me," he said of the President's proposal. "He said he would not raise taxes for the middle class. It's almost identical to 'read my lips.' Show me the difference."
Mr. Clinton may not have won many converts, but his maiden barnstorming tour to promote his economic plan seemed to at least win him good will. Once again demonstrating his ability to charm audiences, the President today stood at the edge of the stage in the high school auditorium here, microphone in hand, looking earnest and concerned as he locked his gaze on his questioners.
While his audiences in Ohio and Missouri looked random, they were actually sprinkled with partisans. In St. Louis, for example, Doug Hall, a senior at Washington University, waved a hand-painted placard that read, "Sacrifice for Tomorrow."
The sign and others like it were nothing more than props for Mr. Clinton to mention as he opened his speech. Mr. Hall said he and others were given the signs by Democratic workers who had made them in advance.
But he insisted that he believed in the message. "I think our country's at a point of sacrifice right now," the psychology major said. When asked if Mr. Clinton would succeed with his program, Mr. Hall said, "The question is whether the average person gets talked out of it by propaganda and special interests."
The crowds also included uninvited spectators who were unwilling to cheer for the President and who were squeezed into the back, far from the cameras and the President. But even some of those people said they were encouraged.
 
'At Least He's Trying'
 "Even if it's a lot of window dressing, at least he's trying," said Christy Marshall, who said she worked in the United States Attorney's office in St. Louis and voted for Mr. Clinton. "Sometimes you can get lost in the rhetoric; he's very glib with the phrase. But I think he's trying very hard."
That was an assessment shared by some Republicans.
"I was impressed, and I'm a Republican," said Linda Yocum, a homemaker who came to the Ohio high school with a camera hanging around her neck. "He has so much information on the top of his head, and I liked his easy manner of communicating with people."
Her friend, Cindy Hanchin, a substitute teacher who said she had voted for Ross Perot, shook her head and added: "I don't agree with him, but it took a lot of guts for him to come to an area where this is going to be a hard sell. People are strapped, and a lot are going through tough times. But he seems to be really concerned."
Others, like Richard Gerding, a retired accounting manager in St. Louis, were still longing for the plain talk of Mr. Perot. "I'm glad I came because I saw a one-term President up there," he said, motioning toward the podium as crews took down the bunting after Mr. Clinton had left. "He's all symbolism. And he's no Perot. Perot had the necessary horsepower to pull off the change that's needed, to really put people's feet to the fire."
Despite their uncertainty about whether Mr. Clinton can press his plan through Congress, there were also plenty of people, including Republicans and independents, who said it was time for the nation to heed the President's call for sacrifice. It was precisely the message that White House officials wanted to hear.
"I'll pay the tax increase and smile the whole time," said Ed Warfield, a 33-year-old pastor who saw Mr. Clinton speak in St. Louis. " I didn't vote for President Clinton, but I will fully support him because if we don't stand behind him, we'll fall together."
Rick Proehl, an assistant manager of a gas station, was among many spectators in Ohio who said they were disappointed that Mr. Clinton did not mention something that won former President George Bush applause at virtually every stop in the campaign: calling for Congress to approve a line-item veto so the President could cut specific programs from the budget.
"He brought it up all during the campaign," Mr. Proehl said of Mr. Clinton, "but not once now. That's the one thing that will help him persuade the people. That's the way to go."

HEADLINE: White House: A Computer Nerdville

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In policy and practice, this is supposed to be a high-tech Presidency.
Bill Clinton's vision of America's future is of a nation linked by a "data superhighway" -- a web of fiber-optics wizardry able to bring everything from libraries to movies to blueprints into every home, school and office at the touch of a button. 
 On the campaign trail, his people regarded laptop personal computers as casual tools of everyday life, plugging them into computer bulletin boards and firing off electronic-mail messages around the country.
 
Big Job for 2 Mavens
 And through electronic town halls and electronic mail, President Clinton pledges to bring the Government to the people.
Perhaps, but the White House itself seems trapped in the technological dark ages. And it is the job of Andrew Aultz and Bill Krause, two technology mavens, to bring the telephones and computers in the Executive Offices into the modern world -- no small order, given the budget squeeze.
"We'd love to give this place all the latest toys, but we can't," Mr. Krause said, sitting beneath a freshly framed picture of President Clinton and leafing through a computer magazine.
Many phone calls in the White House are still connected manually by operators plugging cords into a switchboard. Mr. Aultz, a 35-year-old telecommunications specialist, says this archaic system is one reason callers cannot get through to register their views on the Presidential comments line, generating up to 50,000 busy signals a day.
Mr. Krause, a 42-year-old computer expert, complains of a chronic shortage of personal computers and tells of young staff members appalled to find typewriters on their desks.
The PC's that are there are a couple of computer generations old -- four years or more -- and are arrayed in a hodgepodge of 21 networks that cannot talk to one another. One result: the President's daily schedule is still printed on paper and distributed by hand, instead of by computer, so some people get it a couple of hours late.
In many ways, the challenge at the White House is similar to that confronted daily in corporate America as companies try to tailor fast-changing technology to their organizational needs.
"The White House is like a small holding company -- and a very important one," said Warren McFarlan, a professor at the Harvard Business School. "And it is grappling with the same technology issues that companies must address every day."
The Clinton staff got used to high-speed technology on the campaign trail, scouring the news wires constantly by computer and reacting almost instantly with statements, position papers and rebuttals to charges or controversies. These messages were distributed through an elaborate electronic mail system linked to campaign offices in all 50 states.
"Our motto on the campaign was that speed kills," explained Jeff Eller, the White House director of media affairs.
The technological hurdle for the White House is magnified by the generation gap between the Clinton and Bush Administrations and very different styles of government.
The use of modern technology to speed reaction times and deal with the public directly, whether in televised town meetings or a program for electronically distributing White House statements nationally, is a central tenet of the Clinton Administration. As much as possible, the President wants his message delivered as he presents it, not filtered, or analyzed, by the news media. The catch phrase, used by White House officials, is that Mr. Clinton intends to speak "to people" instead of speaking "through people."
It worked in the campaign, they say, and it will be used in the White House, especially to rally support for ambitious programs like the Clinton economic policy.
"Clinton plans to run his Government like a campaign," said Raymond Strother, a Democratic political consultant. "To do that, you need the technology to run at that speed."
The demand for technology by the young White House staff members is running well ahead of supply. Personal computers are being rationed and the backlog of PC's ordered but not yet delivered is 50, though that is down from 100 two weeks ago.
"Our people are hooked on the flow of information," Mr. Krause said, "so everybody wants his or her own PC."
 
A Flood of Daily Calls
 The jammed phone lines at the White House are apparently a result of the higher volume of calls from the public. During the Reagan and Bush years there would be about 5,500 calls to the White House general number on a busy day, though the numbers would rise in crisis periods like the Persian Gulf war.
By contrast, there are 40,000 to 65,000 calls a day now to the general number alone, according to Mr. Aultz. The steady flood of calls, White House officials say, is explained by the new Administration's more open, informal style.
"Where people might not have dared call when Reagan or Bush were in the White House, they will call here now," Mr. Aultz said.
While the White House phone service now badly needs upgrading, Mr. Aultz concedes it met the requirements in the past.
 
Working With Phone Company
 "In fairness, we found a telephone system that was suited for the way they did business," Mr. Aultz said. "But it is terribly inefficient for the way we do business."
The White House is working with the local phone company, Chesapeake and Potomoc, and American Telephone and Telegraph to streamline and expand the White House phone systems.
On the computer front, Mr. Krause plans to replace many of the White House PC's, mostly I.B.M. models dating to 1988 and 1989, with more powerful machines that run faster and can handle graphics and possibly even information in both video and audio form, so-called multimedia.
 
No Substitute for Decisions
 The Iran-Contra affair put a dent in the White House computer budget because all the hard disks had to be removed and replaced after a Federal panel ruled last month that all E-mail messages from the Bush Administration had to be saved. The Clintonites insist that the precedent for opening up E-mail messages to public scrutiny will not deter them from using the technology freely.
For the moment, the bigger problem is bringing the White House computer systems up to speed.
Not everyone is persuaded they should hurry. To be sure, cutting-edge technology lets organizations get, send and pore over more information than ever before. But more information and more technology are no guarantee that better decisions will be made, analysts warn. Banks with elaborate computer systems and E-mail setups have made terrible loan decisions in recent years, they note, and even the computer giant I.B.M. misjudged the computer market.
"I'm skeptical that technology really helps you all that much, particularly in getting big decisions right, like the ones the White House has to make," said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a computer consultant. "And to think technology is a panacea is to ignore the experience of American industry."

Mr. Aultz, by the White House switchboard, aims to engineer the archaic system to handle the minimum of 40,000 to 65,000 daily calls. (Michael Geissinger for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: 30-Year Bond Hits a Low Yield of 7%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The yield of the 30-year Treasury bond fell to another record low yesterday as many investors shifted from short-term to long-term issues.
The bond's yield fell to 7 percent, from 7.02 percent Thursday, which was then the lowest 30-year Treasury bond yield since the Government began selling the issue in 1977. 
 Short-term interest rates rose as Federal Reserve officials played down the chance of a rate cut anytime soon. Traders said the greatest factor for the rise in short-term rates yesterday was the realization that the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making body, had abandoned its bias for lowering rates in December, and had apparently taken a neutral position.
 
No Easing Seen
 Analysts said that realization quashed any hope among investors of an imminent easing, which caused selling in shorter maturities and buying into the long end of the market.
Peter Meyers, a trader at Bank Julius Baer, called the current market a "win-win situation."
He said investors were buying bonds because of the deficit reduction and the prospect for lower long-term rates, but that they were still buying shorter-maturity notes through mutual funds as a shelter against tax increases.
By the close of the New York cash market yesterday, the 30-year Treasury bond was offered at a price of 10118/32 , up 7/32 , to yield 7 percent. The rise was equivalent to about $2.50 for $1,000 of face amount.
The two-year note outstanding lost 3/32 to close at 10018/32 , with a yield of 3.95 percent. In when-issued trading, the two-year note to be auctioned next week was offered at a price to yield 4.01 percent, up from 3.96 percent on Thursday.
Traders said the yield gap between the two-year note and the 30-year bond narrowed 4 basis points from Thursday, to 306 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. The narrowing indicates that the price of long-term debt is performing better than short maturities.
On Thursday, the yield on two-year notes dropped 11 basis points, with investors persuaded that the Fed was getting close to cutting rates. But short rates rose yesterday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, made it clear in his semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed would wait to see how President Clinton's economic plan would work.
"The economy can grow more rapidly," he said, "while inflation is contained." He said that the economic outlook "is a lot more hopeful than it looked recently."
About $52.8 billion in Treasury securities traded yesterday through the major bond firms, down 38 percent from Thursday, according to Govpx Inc., a bond pricing service.
Among money market securities, the rate of a three-month bill was up four basis points, to 2.91 percent, or at the bond-equivalent yield of 2.97 percent. The six-month bill rate was up two basis points, to 3 percent, or the bond-equivalent yield of 3.09 percent.
Actively traded municipal issues gained a point for the week, as investors bought tax-exempt issues to hedge against the effect of the tax increases proposed by President Clinton.

HEADLINE: He Runs Trash Hauling With Silence and Pastry

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Every Tuesday, with unshakable punctuality, a gray-haired man, hobbling on two canes, arrives at noontime at a tan-brick building in lower Manhattan, often bearing pastries that he shares over cups of espresso with other men.
Outwardly the man, James Failla, 74, has a grandfatherly appearance. But law-enforcement officials say he is a mobster who, at these cannoli klatches, carves up New York City's rubbish-collection routes in a way that creates the highest private carting rates in the country. 
 Mr. Failla runs the Association of Trade Waste Removers of Greater New York, the largest private garbage-haulers' trade group in New York City. He has held the job for more than 30 years.
 
Cautious, and Wearing Brown
 Law-enforcement authorities depict him as a senior statesman in the Gambino crime family and organized crime's pivotal figure in extracting payoffs from the city's private garbage-hauling industry, a $1 billion annual business.
In recent court testimony and affidavits, underworld defectors and Federal agents asserted that Mr. Failla has influenced many hauling companies and dominated the industry's principal teamsters local.
Mr. Failla (pronounced FYE-yal-lah) has been identified as a capo, or captain, who briefly served as the Gambino's acting boss in the mid- 1970's. Investigators say he is known in the underworld by the nickname Jimmy Brown, because of a penchant for brown clothes.
Authorities say they have driven the Gambino family out of many legitimate industries but they have failed in the hauling industry. They acknowledge that many attempts to obtain evidence against Mr. Failla have failed.
"He is one of the wiliest and most cautious suspects we have ever encountered," said Edward Wright, chief investigator for the state's Organized Crime Task Force. "He almost never says anything inside a building. If he has to conduct business, he always walks and talks outside in the street where he can't be overheard."
In the mid-1980's, the task force planted court-authorized bugs in the trade group's offices on Catherine Street near the East River and at the Veterans and Friends Social Club on 86th Street and 14th Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
The Brooklyn storefront, investigators said, is Mr. Failla's main meeting place and is emblematic of his prudence. It had no telephone and on the wall there was a large picture of a cockroach wearing a headset with the caption: "Our Bugs Have Ears."
 
Top Garbage Charges
 Mr. Failla refused to be interviewed about his role in the garbage-collection industry. Salvatore Spinelli, the Trade Waste Association's lawyer for 20 years, said, "The allegations that this industry is mobbed up are just not true."
"I have never seen any improper influence exerted by Mr. Failla on the employers or the union," added Mr. Spinelli.
The association, with offices now at 180 West Broadway, represents hauling companies that have most of the business in the city. Mr. Spinelli declined to say how many companies were in the association or the amount of their business. He also declined to disclose Mr. Failla's salary.
Studies by the Organized Crime Task Force and the Rand Institute, a research group, maintain that Mafia influence has created cartels in commercial garbage collection. The payoffs are made directly for sweetheart union contracts or routes and through secret partnerships with mobsters, investigators said.
Mark Green, the City Consumer Affairs Commissioner, has contended that haulers carve up and sell routes among themselves to insure large profits, even if the routes are inefficient and lead to excessive charges.
The department estimates that the city's 250,000 private businesses pay hauling charges that are the highest of any big city in the country, twice as much as in Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.
 
A Throwback Style
 Ronald Goldstock, the director of the Task Force, said that mobsters discouraged outside companies from competing through threats of violence and vandalism. He said customers who complain or try to switch carters often receive higher bills.
A typical garbage removal bill for a grocery store is $15,000 a year, for a fast-food restaurant, $36,000, and for a medium-sized restaurant, $50,000, the city says. Macy's at Herald Square pays about $500,000 a year and Con Edison about $2 million.
Mr. Spinelli said hauling costs in the city were higher because of labor and dumping costs. He insisted that suggestions of monopolies and intimidation were "absolute fantasies."
Most of the Gambino group's reputed top leaders, including the family boss, John Gotti, are serving long prison sentences. But investigators call Mr. Failla the prototype of a previous generation of supercautious gangsters who were difficult to convict.
"In the carting industry, Failla resolves disputes, deflects attention and surrounds himself with trustworthy people," said Mr. Goldstock. "It's an approach that works well in the underworld."
 
'Dominant Guy in Garbage'
 Little is known about Mr. Failla's early career, except that he grew up in Brooklyn. He was first noticed when he became a chauffeur and bodyguard for Carlo Gambino -- the namesake of the crime family -- in the mid-1950's.
Mr. Gambino, after assuming control of the family in 1957, placed Mr. Failla in charge of the family's garbage-industry interests, said Ralph F. Salerno, the former head of the New York City Police Department's Organized Crime Detective Squad. "At that point he became the dominant guy in garbage," he said. "Without drawing too much attention to himself he has had a run of 30 years."
Mr. Failla was arrested on bookmaking and gambling charges in 1951 and 1966 in Brooklyn and each time paid a fine of $25. He was accused of criminal contempt of court in 1970 for refusing to testify before a state grand jury in Brooklyn. That charge was dismissed.
Undercover informants reported that after the death of Mr. Gambino in 1976, Mr. Failla was designated the acting boss. Paul Castellano, who became boss of the family soon after, kept Mr. Failla in his post in the garbage-hauling industry.
"He has always been a moneymaker for the family," Mr. Salerno said of Mr. Failla. "And nobody gets rid of moneymakers."
 
The Advantages of Silence
 Court records show that Mr. Failla visited Mr. Castellano's mansion in the Todt Hill section of Staten Island almost daily while F.B.I. agents monitored bugged conversations there for six months in 1983.
The F.B.I. inquiry produced the only felony charges ever brought against Mr. Failla. He was indicted in 1986 on Federal racketeering charges unrelated to his role in the garbage industry. He was accused of being a capo in the family and having engaged in a pattern of racketeering, involving loansharking, extortion and obstruction of justice.
He was acquitted of all charges in Brooklyn in 1987. Prosecutors said the case collapsed because, although he was present during conversations with Mr. Castellano and other reputed mobsters, he rarely uttered a word. Mr. Salerno said that Mr. Failla followed a maxim invoked by Carlo Gambino: "The man who says the least is the most powerful."
When Mr. Castellano was shot to death in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1985, he was on his way to a meeting with Mr. Failla and other top Gambino capos at Sparks Steak House on East 46th Street near Third Avenue. Federal agents and prosecutors claim that Mr. Gotti then took over and retained Mr. Failla as a major capo.
From his roots in Bensonhurst, Mr. Failla moved 20 years ago into a red-bricked ranch home at 275 Evergreen Avenue in the Old Town section of Staten Island that realtors say is valued at $135,000 to $150,000. His home, in a blue-collar neighborhood on a dead-end street, allows him to see if he is under surveillance by law-enforcement agents in cars or vans.
Except for Mr. Failla's Tuesday meetings in Manhattan and Sunday visits to his social club in Bensonhurst, he is rarely seen in public. He has been walking with canes for several months but investigators said they did not know why.
Mr. Failla has been linked to Bernard Adelstein, the former head of the 2,100-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 813, by two former self-described mobsters and a former official of the local who became prosecution witnesses.
At Mr. Gotti's trial last spring, Salvatore Gravano, the former underboss, or No. 2 leader, in the Gambino family, testified that "Bernie Adelstein answers directly to Jimmy Brown so he controls the garbage industry for his family."
Mr. Gravano claimed that Mr. Failla kept 50 percent of the payoffs for himself and sent 50 percent "for our administration."
Frederick B. Lacey, a Federal court-appointed administrator, in September ordered Mr. Adelstein ousted from his union posts, citing his ties to Mr. Failla and other reputed mobsters. Mr. Adelstein has been succeeded by his son, Martin.
The Organized Crime Task Force has recommended a change in city policy as the most practical method of eliminating what it termed the Mafia's economic stranglehold on the industry.
Following that recommendation, the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins has proposed establishing two experimental trade-waste removal districts in Manhattan. Under a plan called "exclusive licensing," the city would supervise and grant one company the sole right to pick up refuse in each zone. Mr. Green said that a bill to create the zones would goto the City Council in March or April.

HEADLINE: Supply Side Goes by the Wayside

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Call it Reaganomics in reverse.
One decade and one $300 billion Federal deficit later, President Clinton wants America to roll back the supply-side revolution that toppled marginal income tax rates to 28 percent, from 70 percent in the 1980's. And he wants to bring back many of the tax breaks that favored certain kinds of investment and charitable giving, many of which were abolished in the 80's as the nation embraced a bold economic experiment of generating growth by blending low rates with fewer loopholes. 
 In his economic plan, President Clinton dials back the clock by proposing to raise the effective top rates to well over 40 percent, when several measures like a broader tax on Medicare are taken into account, socking it to a million or so of America's richest families. By lifting rates, the President expects to raise $155 billion more over five years from the top 1 or 2 percent of American families.
 
 
Bite of State Taxes
 In fact, the top marginal rate may be far higher, once state and local taxes are considered. For while America whittled away at Federal rates in the 80's, several states raised taxes on the rich, and still more states are contemplating such steps. This means that well-heeled residents of high-tax states like New York and New Jersey will likely pay 50 percent or so in taxes on the last dollar they earn.
Critics, who range from supply-side tax cutters to Democratic champions of the 1986 tax reform measure, contend that lifting rates will not raise as much revenue as the Administration hopes and will make the tax system even more complex. They also contend that soaking the rich will do nothing to reverse the inequality of the 1980's.
"The top 1 percent are the most productive people in the country," said Norman Ture, head of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation and a Treasury official in the Reagan Administration. "If you think this will have no effect on their contribution to the economy's progress, then you have to assume they are very peculiar human beings."
But others say fears that higher rates will damage the economy by discouraging saving and investment are probably overblown. "Nobody disputes the fact that higher rates will have some negative impact on work and savings," said Alan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania who until recently was chief economist for the Joint Committee on Taxation on Capitol Hill. "The real issue is whether the money goes to deficit reduction. If it does, it will certainly increase national saving."
What is clear is that the Clinton plan is a deliberate repudiation of the supply-side credo -- one that swept the globe as as government after government slashed top marginal tax rates in the 1980's. The focus on lowering marginal rates reflected a belief that a system of lower marginal rates would affect people's incentive to work, save, invest and take entrepreneurial risks. From that vantage point, the average tax rate -- the total tax bill divided by pretax income -- mattered far less than the rate an individual faces if he or she decides to do more work, saving or investing.
The 1981 Economic Recovery and Tax Act slashed the top marginal income tax rate to 50 percent, from 70 percent, and reduced all other brackets by nearly a quarter. The 1986 Tax Reform Act went even further, replacing numerous income tax brackets with just three -- 15, 28 and 33 percent -- and eliminating hundreds of tax loopholes.
"What we did in 1986 was to broaden the tax base, make it more equitable and more stable," said Robert Cline, research director of the Minnesota Department of Revenue. "What President Clinton is proposing is to unravel that agreement."
But Reagan supporters critical of Mr. Clinton's plan have only themselves to blame. The Reagan-Bush Administrations never succeeded in cutting spending. While taxes bobbed around 19 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, or the total cost of goods and services, spending spurted to 24 percent of G.D.P., from 22 percent in 1980. The resulting deficit became a paramount issue in America's tax politics.
What President Clinton wants is to raise the top rate to 36 percent, from 31 percent, on taxable incomes of more than $140,000, slap a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $250,000, and a series of other provisions that raise the top tax rate.
 
 
Rich Can Shift Income
 But all of it may not raise as much revenue as the Administration says, Mr. Clinton's critics argue. The rich, who have lots of flexibility in how they earn their incomes, might simply report less of what they receive. In a vivid demonstration of the flexibility of the rich, large numbers of Wall Street investment bankers, corporate chiefs and Hollywood stars rushed after the November election to collect bonuses and to cash in stock options ahead of the anticipated Clinton tax bite.
Economists like Lawrence Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, suspect that part of the surge in income among the top 1 percent of American families reflected more reporting of income after tax rates declined. Indeed, a recent study found that the biggest gains among the top 1 percent occurred immediately after rates dropped in 1986.
What troubles economists even more is that raising rates will resuscitate the tax-shelter industry. A lot of the tax law's complexity before 1986 stemmed from the gulf between tax rates on capital gains from investments and the earned income from wages and salaries. As long as capital gains were taxed at a lower rate, the wealthy -- who typically earn more than half of their income from investments -- have a strong incentive to reshuffle their income.
"It's axiomatic: if rates go up, loopholes will follow," said Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who was a champion of the 1986 tax law that lowered rates.
Sticking it to the top 1 percent will not do much to reverse the income inequalities of the 1980's. Stagnating wages, not tax increases, were the root of income shifts in that decade that made the rich richer and the poor poorer. Slow productivity growth held down average income gains while changing technology rewarded the highly educated and punished the less skilled. "The consensus is that growth in inequality was not due to changes in tax rates," said Joel Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Analysis at the University of Michigan.
 
 
A New View of High Rates
 On the other hand, few economists are worried that higher rates will seriously damage the economy.
"Ten years ago, many economists thought high income taxes caused people to work less," said Robert Triest, an economist at the University of California at Davis. "More recent research suggests the effect is a lot smaller than we used to think."
The rich do, of course, account for a disproportionate amount of Americans' savings, with the top fifth of American families doing more than 60 percent of all saving. But during the 1980's, when marginal income rates fell by more than half and real interest rates were the highest in decades, the personal saving rate declined to historic lows.
"Based on the historical evidence, there's not a strong correlation between the tax rate and the saving rates," said Jonathan Skinner, a tax economist at the University of Virginia. "If anything, the tax-deferred nature of pensions would encourage savings through pensions."
Finally, there is concern that higher taxes will discourage entrepreneurs and stifle innovation and investment. The Microsoft Corporation, the computer software innovator, created more millionaries in the 1980's than many Wall Street firms. The 26-year-old engineers got rich by taking much of their pay in company stock. Under Mr. Clinton's plan, those capital gains will continue to be taxed at a 28 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Poverty Tied To Failures In Hartford

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The state's final witness in its defense against a lawsuit challenging segregated conditions in Hartford's schools testified today that integrating them with suburban schools would not raise the achievement of city children because their basic problem is poverty.
As happened so many times in this 10-week-old trial, the state drew opposite conclusions from the plaintiffs, who also blame poverty for the poor performance of Hartford's schools, but seek to overcome it by linking them with schools in 21 surrounding towns. The suit was brought by a coalition of civil-rights groups on behalf of Milo Sheff, now a Hartford eighth-grader, and 18 other schoolchildren. 
 In the end, the essential disagreement is not whether the concentration of poverty in Hartford's schools harms their children, but whether the benefits of a court-ordered integration plan covering the entire metropolitan effect are worth the risks of public uproar and white flight.
 
'Integration Can Do Something'
 "One side answers that there's not much integration can do, and that in fact integration is extremely troublesome and problematic," said John Brittain, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. "Our side's coming down saying integration can do something."
"If you say there's nothing you can do about the socioeconomic status," he added, "then to a large extent we're saying that these poor children in cities are relegated to a class and caste of future poverty."
The state's final witness, Prof. David Armor, a school-busing expert at George Mason University in Virginia, said today that the city's children achieve less than suburban students almost entirely because they are poorer, not because of racial segregation or the quality of their schools.
As a result, he said, a metropolitan integration plan would have little effect on the performance of Hartford's students, 90 percent of whom are black and Hispanic and two-thirds of whom are poor.
"The differences in achievement between minority and white, and poor and affluent, are important and should be addressed, but I think we should be addressing the socioeconomic differences," Professor Armor said. "The schools can only do so much."
"Simple changing of racial composition of schools is not likely to change very much," he continued. "What appears to hold promise is improving the socioeconomic status of those who are disadvantaged in our society."
The state has never contested the segregation in Hartford's schools, or that it is harmful. Instead, it has argued that the segregation results from complex social and economic forces that have concentrated poor people in cities.
Schools alone cannot counter those forces, the state has argued, calling elected officials more able than a judge to address issues like housing and transportation and contributors to poverty like unemployment, discrimination, drug abuse and crime.
The Sheff lawyers will complete their cross-examination of Professor Armor next week and then present their final rebuttal witnesses. But the Assistant Attorney General who led the state's defense, John Whelan, said today that the state had accomplished its goals.
 
Not That Bleak, State Says
 "The first objective was to show that the state was deeply concerned about the effects of racial isolation and has tried to address that issue and the problems of minority children," Mr. Whelan said. "The second objective was to show that the Hartford schools are not as bleak as the plaintiffs have presented them."
"The third objective," he said, "was to make it clear that the problems that exist are highly complex and cannot be resolved by a court order -- that the kind of solutions needed to address the problem require action by the General Assembly."
Since the trial began on Dec. 16, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has proposed a school-integration effort that would divide the entire state into regions, which would have two years to develop and carry out plans to achieve greater racial balance between their towns and cities.
The proposal stresses voluntary measures, like new magnet and regional schools that would attract students across town lines. The state would support the effort by paying for new interdistrict schools and transportation of their students.
 
Voluntary Measures Backed
 In its defense, the state has argued that it has supported similar, though less ambitious, voluntary measures over the last 25 years, while calling for a statewide strategy. It has also greatly increased its aid to schools in Hartford and other cities to counter the effects of poverty.
Experts for the state have also testified about the practical difficulties of carrying out a metropolitan integration plan, and about the high proportion of white parents who have removed their children from public schools in cities where mandatory plans have been imposed.
Today, however, Professor Armor returned to one of the plaintiffs' main concerns, the wide social and economic gap between the populations of Hartford and its suburbs.
Drawing from state data, he showed that 55.6 percent of Hartford's black fourth-graders qualified for free or reduced-price lunches in 1988, but just 4.5 percent of the white fourth-graders in the suburbs.
 
Little to Do With Race
 Similarly, only 11.9 percent of Hartford's adults had college degrees, compared with 27.1 percent of suburban adults, and 51.0 percent of the city's families were headed by single families, compared with 11.3 percent in the suburbs.
But those disparities, Professor Armor said, had little to do with race. Among Hartford's blacks, only 7.9 percent had college degrees, but in a group of five suburbs 19.2 percent of the blacks had degrees. Single parents headed 70 percent of Hartford's black families but only 36.2 percent of suburban black families. And suburban blacks had incomes nearly twice those of Hartford blacks.
The Sheff lawyers say these poor children overwhelm Hartford's schools and so are denied an equal educational opportunity. The proof, they say, is their performance on Connecticut's standardized tests, where they rank last in the state.
But Professor Armor said that nearly all of the disparity in scores can be explained by differences in economic status between city and suburbs. Better-educated, more affluent parents are more likely to read to their children, to stress education, and to do other things that help children do well in school, he said.
There is no evidence that the city's schools are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of poor students, and racial composition has no discernible effect, he said. The test scores of blacks were higher, he said, not when they attended integrated schools, but when their families were wealthier and better educated.
The disparity in test scores between Hartford and its suburbs, he said, "cannot be used on its face to conclude that there is inequality of educational opportunity."
John Brittain, a plaintiffs' lawyer, said that both sides agree that concentrated poverty "has tremendous burdens and impacts upon the educational performance of children."
As it comes time to decide what to do, he said, "one side answers that there's not much integration can do, and that in fact integration is extremely troublesome and problematic. Our side's coming down saying integration can do something.
"If you say there's nothing you can do about the socioeconomic status," he continued, "then to a large extent we're saying that these poor children in cities are relegated to a class and caste of future poverty."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN;
INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE ENERGY TAX

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
In addition to the direct effects of President Clinton's proposed energy tax, which are fairly easy to calculate for typical households, the new tax would ripple widely into the economy, affecting prices on items as diverse as air fares, aluminum siding and restaurant pizza.
In fact, according to the Energy Department, once the tax is fully in place in 1996 a typical family would pay about $120 a year through the gas pump, oil tank or electric meter and would pay about twice that in these indirect costs, for a total of $320 a year. 
 There was no way to confirm that estimate today. Private analysts with computer models of the economy, scrambling at week's end to estimate the broad effects of the tax, said they could not yet quantify these indirect effects in terms of the ordinary consumer.
 
'Modest Conservation'
 But DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., said the indirect effects would be significant for the economy at large, adding about one-tenth of a point to the inflation rate each year and, beginning in 1996, trimming gross national product as well.
"By 1998," said Christopher Probyn, a principal at DRI, "we have half a percentage point higher prices and half a point lower output."
The energy tax has been criticized both as a regressive tax that would fall on the middle class and as a potential contributor to inflation.
Energy carries a weight of 7.3 percent in the Consumer Price Index, which covers a basket of directly measured goods and services.
But there is no way of exactly telling what response consumers might make to higher prices. The Energy Department predicts that the measure would encourage "modest conservation and fuel switching" that would work toward environmental goals without injuring the economy.
But workers might respond to higher costs by continuing to consume as much by seeking higher wages, observed Joel Prakken, a vice president at Laurence H. Meyer & Associates in St. Louis. He said the $22 billion the Administration estimates the energy tax will raise beginning in 1997 could be understated by as much as $7 billion because the Treasury assumes no change in behavior.
In addition to potential environmental effects, the Energy Department asserted that the tax would have a number of broad beneficial effects. It would increase the energy efficiency of the economy, improve national security by reducing oil imports and strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, it said.

HEADLINE: 11 Are Vying To Replace Comptroller

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The list of candidates competing to fill the unexpired term of State Comptroller Edward V. Regan continued to grow today, with strong signs that H. Carl McCall, the president of the New York City Board of Education, would join the fray.
By the end of the day, 11 people, 9 Democrats and 2 Republicans, had expressed interest in the job. New names that emerged included Peter Tufo, New York State Thruway Authority chairman; Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Codes Committee; former Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer, who was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for 12 years, and Comptroller Joel A. Giambra of Buffalo. 
 The State Constitution calls for Mr. Regan's successor to be selected by the 211 members of the State Legislature sitting in a joint session. Because 127 of the 211 lawmakers are Democrats, the Legislature is almost certain to select a Democrat.
 
Calls From Several People
 Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, who will play a pivotal role in the selection of the new comptroller, said he received calls today from several people, including Mr. McCall and Mr. Tufo, asking to be considered for the job.
Mr. McCall's spokeswoman, Linda Scott, said he would not announce his plans until early next week.
Mr. Tufo said in an interview that he was not a candidate and was not seeking to be considered.
"Maybe it's a question of wording," Mr. Weprin said. "Tufo called me and said, 'Look, I just want you to know I'm available if you need me. I think I've got the credentials.' Maybe he didn't say, 'I'm a candidate.' But it sounded to me like he was a candidate."
The newcomers join a field that began forming on Thursday almost immediately after Mr. Regan made the surprise announcement that he was leaving state government after 14 years to become president of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College. Mr. Regan plans to step down at the end of April.
Mr. Regan is one of only two Republicans elected statewide in New York, and Republican leaders have criticized him for leaving in a way that will allow the Democrats to handpick a successor.
The Democrats who expressed interest on Thursday were former New York City Council President Carol Bellamy, Assemblyman G. Oliver Koppell of the Bronx, Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens and Assemblyman Robin L. Schimminger of Kenmore in Erie County. The Republicans include the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr. of Norwich, and Senator Nicholas A. Spano of Yonkers.
A number of lawmakers are trying to persuade Mr. McCall to run, reasoning that the vacancy provides an opportunity to put a black in a statewide office for the first time.
Mr. McCall is a former State Senator who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the 1982 Democratic primary. Party leaders tried but failed to enlist him to run for comptroller in 1990.

HEADLINE: Hyde Park Scrambles to Provide a Banner Day for President Clinton

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HYDE PARK, N.Y., Feb. 19

 BODY:
What would a visit from the President of the United States be like without a banner welcoming him to town? To her horror, Kate Hinz-Shaffer almost found out.
Ms. Hinz-Shaffer, the owner of Riverwood Signs here, was tapped late Thursday morning to provide the 20-foot-by-4-foot royal blue banner that would be draped on the curtain behind President Clinton as he spoke at the Haviland Middle School today about his economic program. 
 With no time to spare, Ms. Hinz-Shaffer located a blank, vinyl sign at a wholesaler in New Jersey who was willing to deliver it to her Thursday afternoon.
Instead, it somehow ended up in New Hyde Park, L.I., about 100 miles away.
The confused courier finally arrived here at 8:30 P.M., keeping Ms. Hinz-Shaffer up until 2 A.M. affixing the red and white letters that blared: "Hyde Park Welcomes President Bill Clinton."
"It didn't hit me right away," she said as she hung the sign on schedule this morning, "but I never did anything that was going to be seen on national TV before."
 
End of a Vacation
 She was not the only who will need to catch a breath now that the President has come and gone.
The Haviland school principal, Richard C. Kuralt, was on vacation this week because the schools were closed, planning to play a little tennis and sit on the beach in Naples, Fla.
Everything was going fine until the school superintendent called on Tuesday to reveal the news that the President was coming.
"My first reaction was, 'You got to be kidding,' " Mr. Kuralt said this morning, his tan already peeling after an abrupt flight home.
 
A Substitute Lesson
 Thomas Kirwan, 20, and Chris Vandal, 21, roommates at nearby Marist College, were among several dozen students picked in a lottery this week to assist the White House advance team. As they shuffled invitations inches from the President's lectern, they marveled at their good fortune.
"It's a very strange feeling," Mr. Vandal said, "when all of a sudden you're thrown into an environment with some of the most powerful people in the world."
Some were not as lucky. Naomi Seiler, 16, a junior at Spackenkill High School in nearby Poughkeepsie, tried in vain to get one of the 500 or so invitations to the Clinton speech, the most elusive ticket in town.
Undaunted, she awakened at 6 A.M. today and arrived five hours early to be among the 400 people picked to watch Mr. Clinton's speech on closed- circuit television in the school gym.
Almost one-fifth of the invitations to Mr. Clinton's address went to local school children. Because of their work on the Haviland student council, Adam Markoski, 13, and Paul Caiola, 12, were among the distinguished guests.
Seated in the second-to-last row, the two listened attentively as Mr. Clinton outlined his plan for the country's economic recovery. On any other day, Adam would have been in Mrs. Slakoper's math class, with Paul in Mrs. Linton's Spanish class.
"He was pretty strong," Adam said, after today's substitute teacher finished his Presidential lesson. "He wasn't nervous at all."
Paul was more critical.
"I could not understand some of the points about economic growth and status quo," he said. "But when he addressed how we felt and how we can make the country grow, then I felt great!"

HEADLINE: The Clinton Budget: Some Strategies to Help Ease the Pain

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The dust storm kicked up by President Clinton's economic plan this week is unlikely to settle soon, leaving few clear signals for people seeking ways to lessen the impact of the Administration's deficit-cutting program on their personal finances.
Still, some things seem certain. The wealthy will be hit hardest. Investment decisions will become trickier. And people should conserve energy -- the gasoline and home-heating kind -- as a way of easing the pain of the new energy tax. 
 Experts also suggest saving your own energy when pondering the Clinton plan, which faces inevitable changes before passing through Congress. "Don't panic," said Stuart Kessler, senior tax partner at Goldstein Golub Kessler & Company.
The impact of the budget package on individuals looks like this: Taxes, on energy use and income, for households earning $250,000 a year would rise by about $10,000. Households earning about $80,000 would face a tax jump of about $560. For a family earning $45,000, taxes would rise about $225. And for a family earning $25,000, taxes would go up about $25.
Searching for a leak-proof shelter from these increases may prove fruitless, so be wary of salespeople pitching magical solutions. But there are some valid strategy suggestions.
More than any other group, the President's plan would affect the investment decisions of those at the top income tax rate. It would rise five percentage points, to 36 percent for individuals earning more than $115,000 in taxable income and for couples who earn $140,000 or more.
The reason is that the top rate for capital gains would remain 28 percent, creating an eyebrow-raising spread between investments that generate taxable income, like dividends, and those that gain in value, like growth stocks or real estate. A capital gain occurs when an investment rises in value and is sold, at which point the I.R.S. respectfully requests a portion of the windfall.
The spread between the capital gains rate and the personal tax rate is even more drastic for people earning $250,000 or more. Their tax bills would rise to 39.6 percent with the proposed 10 percent surcharge, or quarter-millionaire's surtax as some now call it.
Here are some strategies to consider:
 
Investments
 One clear avenue for saving is to start deflecting as much money as possible into tax-favored investments, like employer-sponsored retirement plans and individual retirement accounts.
Experts unanimously agree that the economic plan also added new luster to municipal bonds. The vast majority are tax-exempt at the Federal level, and many are also exempt from state and city taxes.
But investors began scrambling last week to buy into munis, threatening to skew the market. "They're likely to become fairly overvalued," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist for Oppenheimer & Company.
Another oft-cited strategy is to shift from investments that earn income that is taxable at the higher rates -- like C.D.'s, money markets and stocks that yield regular dividends -- to stocks that pay low or no dividends but hold out greater promise of increasing in value. Any profits on the stock's rise would be then be taxable at the lower capital gains rate.
Mary Farrell, an investment strategist at Paine Webber, cited Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Pepsico as examples of such growth stocks. Others recommend so-called value stocks, or small-capitalization stocks that are likely to grow in price but not in dividend yields.
Many experts warn against trying to pick so-called Clinton plays -- stocks that are likely to rise from the political decisions -- because of the volatility of both the budget and the market. "That's a losing game for even the professionals," Ms. Farrell said.
 
Real Estate
 The search for investments that offer capital gains rather than income leads inevitably to real estate. With property prices low, the prospects for capital gains look good. But Charles I. Clough, the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, cautions that such gains would be long in coming. "The demographics don't point to a recovery any time soon," he said.
 
Estate Planning
 The President's program calls for the highest estate-tax rates to rise from the current 50 percent to 55 percent for estates with more than $3 million, and to 53 percent for estates with $2.5 million or more.
One idea for escaping those top rates is to consider shifting some assets to your children if they face a lower tax rate. Current law states that you can donate $10,000 a year ($20,000 when your spouse pitches in) to each of as many relatives and friends as you like before the gift tax applies. "You may be inclined to do so now," said Samuel P. Starr, a tax partner with Coopers & Lybrand.
 
Contributions
 The new budget added a carrot for people thinking of donating art or various investment vehicles that have risen in value. The provision makes all major gifts to nonprofit organizations like museums fully deductible at current market value rather than at the purchase price, which is usually lower.
But remember that making many contributions may invoke the alternative minimum tax rate, which, as its name suggests, insures that everyone pays at least some taxes. The A.M.T., currently 24 percent, will rise if the President gets his way to 28 percent for people with minimum taxable income above $175,000, and 26 percent for people below that mark.
 
Energy Savings
 The energy tax is estimated to cost the average family an additional $100 to $150 a year. While relatively small, it may prove onerous enough to prod people to reconsider some familiar ways to reduce home-heating costs and outlays at the pump:
* Install a setback thermostat, which can reduce the temperature automatically when the house is empty. The devices cost $30 to $100 and pay for themselves in a year or less.
* Lower the water heater temperature to no more than 120 degrees. Many are set as high as 140 degrees.
* Invest in a tune-up for your air- conditioner, an expense that generally pays for itself in a year.
* Call your utility. Many companies offer home audits, in which someone comes to your home and works up a program of measures to cut energy consumption. This service is provided free by many utilities.
* An overdue tune-up for your car and checking tire pressure regularly can improve gas mileage.
Such steps may yield small savings, but experts note that moves like these may in fact be the only solution for coping with the new Administration's budget.
"There's no magic bullet," said William J. Goldberg, national director of personal financial planning services at KPMG Peat Marwick in Houston. "It's going to be a mass contribution."

Silver Prices Drop Sharply On Fears About Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Fears of an economic slowdown drove silver futures prices to a two-year low yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Platinum and palladium futures also fell sharply. All three metals have industrial uses, which means demand would suffer in a weaker economy. 
 Silver for March delivery dropped 6.8 cents, to $3.565 an ounce. The contract traded as low as $3.56 an ounce, the lowest for a near-term contract since Feb. 26, 1991.
On the Mercantile Exchange in New York, April platinum plunged $6.10, to $357.40 an ounce; March palladium fell the permitted daily limit of $6, to $107.35 an ounce.
Gold prices also declined, but not as sharply. On the Commodity Exchange, February gold fell 40 cents, to $330.30 an ounce.
The plunge in silver, platinum and palladium extended steep losses posted earlier in the week in reaction to President Clinton's plan to raise taxes and cut Government spending. Traders fear the taxes will inhibit consumer spending and industrial growth. "A slowdown in the economy normally hits the white metals," said Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metals trading at Credit Suisse.
Silver is used in photography, electronics and a variety of other industrial applications. Platinum and palladium are components in catalytic converters, which reduce pollutants in automobile exhaust. Palladium is also used in electronic products.
Platinum and palladium were also under pressure from indications that Japanese car makers plan to buy less platinum from Russia, their main supplier. Traders fear a reduction in Japanese car production.
"The concern is, what happens to the platinum and palladium that the Russians have now if you suddenly take one of the largest customers out of the market," Mr. MacDonald said.
In other markets, prices of petroleum products and natural gas rose.March deliveries of light crude oil rose 20 cents, to $19.62 a barrel, on the New York Merc. March heating oil climbed 0.77 cent, to 55.32 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline surged 1.37 cents, to 53.46 cents a gallon, and March natural gas rose 3.3 cents, to $1.906 for 1,000 cubic feet.
March lumber rose $10 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to $425.70 for 1,000 board feet, the 19th straight record high for lumber futures.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Bentsen Call for Strong Yen Sends Dollar to a New Low

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a new low against the Japanese yen yesterday after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen startled the market with an emphatic call for a stronger yen.
Most of the action in domestic foreign-exchange trading focused on the yen, dealers said. The dollar finished in New York slightly higher against the German mark and mixed against other leading currencies. 
 Currency dealers dumped dollars and snapped up yen after Mr. Bentsen said he wanted a stronger yen to help reduce overseas demand for Japanese exports by making them more expensive. That would curb Japan's high trade surplus, a chronic sore point in Japanese-American relations.
Mr. Bentsen did not dwell on the subject in an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, but currency dealers interpreted his remark as the statement of a policy that the Clinton Administration would pursue aggressively.
 
Now on the Record
 The Administration has previously indicated a desire for a rise in the yen to help stem a flood of Japanese exports. But yesterday the foreign exchange markets were impressed that a high-ranking official went on record about it. The Bentsen comment also lent support to recent speculation that the Group of Seven major industrialized countries would recommend a higher yen at their meeting in London this month.
By the end of trading in New York the dollar had been knocked down to 118.23 yen, from 119.15 yen on Thursday. Currency dealers said this was the lowest level in the post-World War II era. The previous low, 118.60 yen, was on Sept. 30, 1992.
In London, the dollar fell to 119.08 yen. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar finished at 119.23 yen, down 0.74 yen from Thursday's close.
The German mark came under pressure from a downward revision in Germany's January money supply figures. In light of the revision, market players now foresee further cuts in German interest rates, which would reduce demand for marks.
Sterling strengthened, with one British pound quoted at $1.4535 late in New York, more expensive than Thursday's $1.4475. In London, the pound rose to $1.4528, from $1.4460 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Choosing an Executor
Q What factors should I consider when naming an executor of my estate?
 
 JOHN M. BURNS, MANHATTAN
A Executors are responsible for many things, including collecting the deceased person's property, paying debts and making the final distribution to beneficiaries. "While an executor generally retains professionals to help in this, he or she should have enough financial experience to perform the tasks or supervise the professionals' performance," said Laurence Keiser, tax partner in Greenfield Eisenberg Stein & Senior, a New York law firm. "Executors have personal liability for losses caused by their improper acts." 
 You can select an individual, a trust company or a bank as the executor of your will. "Institutions have a permanence but they normally won't accept small estates," Mr. Keiser said. "Family members selected as executors often will waive the commission, thus saving the estate an additional expense."
 
Pensions and Insurance
Q My company has been acquired by another and my employment is being terminated. I have been told that my retirement money will be used to cover my unemployment insurance. Is that true?
 
 DOROTHY CHARON, NEWBURGH, N.Y.
A The answer depends on pension and unemployment issues. In New York, unemployment insurance is paid for solely by an employer payroll tax.
However, when you are receiving a periodic pension or lump sum distribution from a pension fund that was financed by your employer, your unemployment insurance benefit may be reduced, said Helen Cleary, community services manager of the New York State Labor Department. The entire weekly amount of the pension will be deducted from the unemployment benefit payment when the employer is the only contributor.
Mrs. Cleary also noted: "If you contributed less than 50 percent, your weekly benefit will be reduced by 50 percent of the prorated weekly pension. But if you contributed 50 percent or more to the pension, there will be no reduction in your benefit."
 
Foreign Stocks, Sold Here
Q What are American depository receipts?
 
 LEO M. REISS, JAMESBURY, N.J.
A American depository receipts are designed to ease the purchase, holding and sale by American investors of securities issued by companies outside the United States. "They represent the ordinary shares of a non-U.S. company, but are dollar-denominated in terms of trading and dividends, if any," said Robert Britz, vice president of the New York Stock Exchange. "By bundling shares of a foreign company into one receipt, you can take, say, a $2 stock in the United Kingdom and make it a $10 stock in the U.S., a price that is more in keeping with the American market."
Mr. Britz added that "A.D.R.'s are a mechanism of convenience for American shareholders, because transactions look and feel like transactions in an American stock. They are generally created by foreign companies as an attractive alternative for U.S. investors who want to own non-U.S. shares." Examples of A.D.R.'s are Glaxo of Britain, Telefonos de Mexico and Sony of Japan.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Infected With AIDS

 BODY:
Should the United States allow immigrants infected with the virus that causes AIDS to enter the country for extended stays?
President Clinton said "yes" during the campaign. He pledged to remove the AIDS virus from the list of diseases that automatically exclude would-be immigrants. 
 But the Senate gave a resounding "no" this week. It voted overwhelmingly to turn the current ban into law, a move that would make it more difficult for the President to honor his pledge. Now the House must decide whether to go along, and the President must decide whether to veto any legislation that might emerge.
The White House, already battered by the struggle over whether to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military, showed little stomach this week for taking on yet another contentious social issue that might distract from its economic program.
That's not only sound politics, it's sound policy as well. Whatever their political motives, and whatever whiff of homophobia is in the air, Senate Republicans have raised serious cost and risk questions that need to be addressed. Based on current information, the ban is best left in place.
Public health authorities argue that the ban should be lifted because the AIDS virus -- unlike tuberculosis -- is not spread through casual contact. Infected immigrants are thus not a threat to the broad public but only to those who engage in risky behavior with them, such as unprotected sex or sharing drug needles.
But infected immigrants would pose at least a small risk to society. Some would inevitably spread the virus to their sexual partners or others. In coming years, the U.S. is apt to admit more than 700,000 immigrants annually. If just 1 in 1,000 is infected, as some early estimates suggest, then some 700 infected individuals a year would be admitted, and some unknown portion of those might infect someone else.
That's not much on top of a million or more existing infections in the U.S. But it's not so trivial that it can be ignored. And as AIDS continues to spread around the world, the number of infections in the immigrant pool will rise.
The infected immigrants would also impose costs on a health care system that is already overburdened -- especially in the urban centers to which immigrants typically flock. At an average cost of $100,000 to treat an AIDS patient from infection to death, the admission of 700 infected immigrants each year would commit the nation to$70 million for their lifetime treatment. This is not a commitment that is easy to justify at a time when the Administration is desperately trying to contain runaway health costs.
In theory, the cost problem could be handled through a provision in the immigration law that allows authorities to reject anybody likely to become "a public charge." That way infected immigrants with assets or high earnings potential could be allowed in while those apt to need publicly financed medical care could be screened out.
But the "public charge" criterion has primarily been used to reject immigrants who can't be supported by themselves or their families. There is little information on how effectively it works -- or how well it might screen against high medical costs. And although immigrants can be deported if they become public charges within the first five years of admission, it is hard to imagine expelling people dying of AIDS just because they can't pay their own hospital bills.
Cost is a valid criterion, but it needs to be applied broadly. Immigrants can come down with a wide range of costly ailments, including heart disease, cancer, stroke and end-stage renal disease. None can be detected as readily as AIDS, but some are more expensive to treat. Thus immigrants with any costly condition ought to be excluded. Any decision to single out AIDS requires careful justification.
Senators on both sides of the debate wisely called for estimates of the number of immigrants who will be infected with the AIDS virus, the probable medical costs and a comparison with the costs for immigrants suffering from other health conditions. The ban should be lifted only if assessments show that the risk of spreading disease is negligible and the costs can be readily met.

THE WAY THINGS OUGHT TO BE
By Rush H. Limbaugh 3d.
304 pp. New York:
Pocket Books. $22. 
 ON the air! On the tube! On the page! It's Rush Limbaugh, multimedia unicultural superstar!
With "The Way Things Ought to Be," the first book under his byline, still heading the best-seller list; a sequel, tentatively titled "See, I Told You So," promised for Christmas; the nation's most popular radio talk show yakking on; and a new, widely syndicated television talkie picking up viewers, the man makes a large presence.
I have encountered Mr. Limbaugh in my duties as a television reviewer, and I am told he has commented on his radio program about my comments about his television program. I don't want to make him a life's work, but his book defines his appeal in a more complete way than a sampling of television offerings does, and can stand some attention.
Anyone who has managed to avoid contact up to now can learn the Limbaugh in an hour or so by scanning these short-form animadversions on pro-choicers, multiculturalists, animal-rightsers, the "media elite," "socialist utopians" and "liberal compassion fascists." The book, in part a recycling of radio monologues, is a rant of opinions, gags and insults with a few facts or near facts sprinkled in like the meat in last week's stew.
In case you're wondering, the author explains in the first lines of the acknowledgments that though no writer, he was "determined nevertheless to actually write the book, rather than farm it out to a ghost writer." Two sentences on, he tells how John Fund, an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal, interviewed him on tape, then wrote the first draft. All clear?
However concocted, this is a work for its time. Despite Bill Clinton's recent victory, right-wing populism, an American perennial, is in bloom, and at the moment Mr. Limbaugh is its gaudiest flower. His appeal is to a part of middle America -- call it the silent majority or The American People or the booboisie -- that feels it has been on the receiving end of the droppings of the bicoastals as they wing first class from abortion-rights rallies to AIDS galas to save-the-pornographer parties.
Now their own superstar sweeps across the skies to dump on the have-a-hearters who seem to dominate press and television. When he announces that liberals believe "the average American is an idiot -- stupid, ignorant, uninformed, unintelligent," he is telling his fans they are really the smart ones. No matter how often such encomiums to The American People are served up at political gatherings, the stuff still goes down easily.
It has to be reassuring for folks who have been cowed from speaking in mixed company about the apparent connection of young black men and violent crime to be told flat out that the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers in the trial of Rodney G. King "was not motivated by racism" and that the 1988 Willie Horton commercial had nothing to do with race. No ifs or buts clog the book's rat-a-tat of assertions about everything from supply-side economics to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The positions pounded forth here are indistinguishable from those of Patrick J. Buchanan, whom the author calls his mentor, and Pat Robertson. (He dissociates himself from David Duke.) But he gets more fun than they do out of liberal causemongers who have been asking for it. Among his favorite punching bags are marriage-is-rape feminists, save-every-bug environmentalists and let-'em-loose civil libertarians, and he goes at them with zest. It's an easy job, but somebody has to do it.
Mr. Limbaugh has been called a blowhard, and indeed, to his admirers he is blowing down the temples of political correctness. For example, he defines the multicultural movement as it is represented by its most politically driven and racially driven exponents: "They teach that street slang is just as good as grammatical English, that whites are cold and logical but blacks are warm and intuitive, and that Africans have a different approach to numbers that doesn't emphasize precision." All right, that may be a touch reductionist as a summary of the fashion for diversity, but it is recognizable enough to set a susceptible audience growling.
Here and there the author assumes a pose of highmindedness or softheartedness, but don't worry, it never lasts long. He reports in a chapter on "Feminism and the Culture War" that people like him who have the courage to poke fun at the feminist movement are called women haters, bigots, chauvinists, sexists. And like some pointy head on the MacNeil/ Lehrer Newshour, he laments that "name-calling becomes a substitute for meaningful debate of the issues." A few pages on, he can be found labeling many feminist leaders man haters and "feminazis."
He applies the ad hominem ad nauseam. Any friend of the spotted owl is likely to be described as "a long-haired maggot-infested FM-type environmentalist wacko." But don't get him wrong. The man does not want to offend: "Anyone, without any talent at all, can do that."
Some passages alternate between slobberings of sincerity and slaverings of invective, but it is all in the service of the same cause. The author tells at length of his charitable impulses toward babies born with AIDS as a way of knocking what he sees as the homosexual political agenda. Yes, he melts around little dogs but would exterminate the whole animal-rights crowd. His chapter on homelessness is mainly an attack on "homeless hype" and "homeless hysteria." He is a therapist whose specialty is relieving patients of guilt over people who refuse to behave right.
The satire here is not subtle, but the performer or his script writer do come through now and then. I especially like the commercial for the Bungee condom, which has a daughter bringing Dad up to date on "the Bungee X27 model him-hugger with extra torque capability." She elaborates: "They come in a Kennedy Weekend dozen or the Wilt Chamberlain carry-home crate."
Mr. Limbaugh is not just preaching to the choir. He directs the anxieties of millions about uncontrollable crime, uncontrolled sex and other disorders onto identifiable objects. Feminists, he tells his audience, are angry, Hollywood liberals are unhappy, and multiculturalists are basically miserable. Conservatives like him are presumably afloat on a constant high of good, wholesome feelings.
When, dealing with the Los Angeles riots, he beats up on the "soft-on-crime crowd" for being tougher on the police than on the criminals, you can practically hear the cries of "Amen!" He dismisses most explanations for the riots as "liberal pandering" and declares: "Civilized people don't behave the way these rioters, looters and murderers did." Can that be pandering of another sort?
"We conservatives are the future," announces Mr. Limbaugh, and the reader may construe that as a political promise. On the evidence of "The Way Things Ought to Be," with its deference to religion and patriotism, its relentless self-promotion (which may be a put-on, but then again maybe not), its no-budge line on crime, welfare and sexual disarray, its massagings of honest, hard-working, clean-living, do-it-on-their-own folks, I'd guess Mr. Limbaugh will be running for office before very long, as America's white hope.
 
 
 
SICK AND TIRED
 In this 500th anniversary year of Columbus's voyage, I'm tired of hearing him trashed. I don't give a hoot that he gave some Indians a disease that they didn't have immunity against. We can't change that, we're here. We're the best country on earth and I'm sick and tired of people trying to change history so as to portray this country as an instrument of evil. It isn't true. I'm sick and tired of hearing Western culture constantly disparaged. "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western culture's got to go," is the chant at Stanford University. What would Stanford be if the pioneers that are so reviled today as imperialists, racists, sexists, bigots and homophobes hadn't fought their way across a continent to California? The American middle class is just plain tired and worn out. They get blamed for everything in this country. They are taxed more than ever, and now they have to put up with lectures about how we have to ship billions of dollars to the former Soviet Union so they can eat this winter, even though it's cold there every winter and the people there have been hoarding food in their cellars for months. -- From "The Way Things Ought to Be."

INSIDE GORBACHEV'S KREMLIN
The Memoirs of Yegor Ligachev.
Translated by Catherine A. Fitzpatrick,
Michele A. Berdy and Dobrochna Dyrcz-Freeman.
Introduction by Stephen F. Cohen.
Illustrated. 369 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $27.50. 
 AS political memoirs so often do, Yegor K. Ligachev's tantalize and frustrate in roughly equal measure. Tough, teetotaling, hard-working, rigidly honest and imbued to the marrow with old-fashioned Bolshevik values, the 72-year-old Mr. Ligachev was a central figure in the maneuvering that brought Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the helm of the Soviet state in 1985 and his first ally in the process of renewal that came to be known as perestroika. But within three years Mr. Ligachev was already the estranged scourge of "radicals" and "pseudodemocrats," crying in a deepening political wilderness that his Gorbachev and his perestroika had been hijacked and perverted.
From the beckoning title, "Inside Gorbachev's Kremlin," we expect, and find, many a juicy morsel from those remarkable years. There is a conspiratorial trip with Mr. Gorbachev to a hospital to see the dying party leader Konstantin U. Chernenko in order to claim his mantle for the battle to come. There is the confrontation with the massively corrupt party boss of Uzbekistan, Sharaf R. Rashidov, who is stunned that a newly appointed Central Committee functionary would dare summon him. "Who do you think you're talking to?" he demands. "I answered calmly, emphasizing that I wasn't troubled. 'I'm talking with Comrade Rashidov.' " Within three months Rashidov is mysteriously dead.
Rummaging through earlier history, Mr. Ligachev discloses a curious wrinkle to the Kremlin's failure to join in the technological revolution -- a failure most often attributed to the Communists' fear of losing their monopoly on information. Mr. Ligachev recounts the powerful effect of an article by the veteran America watcher Georgy A. Arbatov in 1975 in which he argued that the United States had succumbed to an "enormous overestimation of the role of computers in management." That, writes Mr. Ligachev, "gladdened the hearts of some of our leaders to whom automated systems posed a threat."
There are flashes of wisdom that verge on aphorism, as when Mr. Ligachev laments that his letter of protest to Mr. Gorbachev has received no attention: "Under Stalin, you would have lost your head for a letter like that. Under Khrushchev, you would have been fired. Under Brezhnev, you would be made an ambassador to Africa. And under Gorbachev, you were simply ignored."
But such tidbits only feed a hunger for larger insights into the way a process of renewal managed to devour the entire Soviet state within a scant six years. Perhaps we expect too much: almost by definition, political memoirs are the apologias of their authors, pre-emptive bids to bolster a place in history, to answer lingering charges and settle old scores.
Of that there is plenty in this book. A large portion is devoted to refighting old intrigues in which, Mr. Ligachev claims, his role was maliciously misrepresented. These are the bloody repression of a political demonstration in Georgia on April 9, 1989; accusations by two subsequently discredited prosecutors that Mr. Ligachev accepted bribes in Uzbekistan; and allegations that Mr. Ligachev was behind the infamous "Nina Andreyeva letter," the bitter blast at perestroika published on March 13, 1988.
Together, these incidents dominate roughly half the book. They obviously still gnaw at the aging Communist, but there are so many other events about which most readers would far prefer to read. Too often, Mr. Ligachev is either silent or curiously uninterested in events or decisions about which he had to know. We long to learn more about the purges he led within the provincial party machines after 1985. There is almost nothing about the decision to expel Boris N. Yeltsin from the party leadership in October 1987; in fact, there is almost nothing on Boris Yeltsin. And there is nothing at all about the decision to bring Andrei D. Sakharov back from internal exile in the city of Gorky.
To be fair, Mr. Ligachev wrote his book less as an autobiography than as an attempt to explain his stormy relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. The Russian title of the memoir is "The Gorbachev Enigma," and Mr. Ligachev planned it as only a first installment.
But the Gorbachev who emerges from this ably translated book is less enigmatic than unconvincing. Mr. Ligachev, refusing to accept that a good comrade like Mr. Gorbachev could ever have entered on so radical a course alone, develops a portrait of a fundamentally sound Communist who, through indecision and yearnings for the "aura of the 'enlightened monarch,' " comes under the sway of pseudodemocrats. It is they who lure him off the true course. The chief demon is Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, the liberal strategist who became one of Mr. Gorbachev's closest advisers. Mr. Ligachev's contempt seems almost to sputter off the page whenever he invokes Mr. Yakovlev or the others aligned with him.
There is something to the charges of vacillation and imperiousness, but the image of Mr. Gorbachev helplessly manipulated by Mr. Yakovlev, Eduard A. Shevardnadze and other "radicals" is hard to reconcile not only with the historical record, but even with Mr. Ligachev's own assessments of Mr. Gorbachev at other periods. "He's not a meek fellow himself; he's psychologically steadfast and not that impressionable," he writes at one point. At another: "I remember someone once saying to me about Gorbachev, 'Mikhail Sergeyevich is a president who wants to go down in history as a clean man, whom no one can accuse of dictatorship.' " At another point, Mr. Gorbachev's "indecision" becomes a virtue: "He preferred reproaches for being too late to attacks for making mistakes."
Yet even if partial or inconsistent, Mr. Ligachev's shifting vision of Mr. Gorbachev is in itself a part of the historical record. And that, ultimately, is what renders this book so compelling. Because Mr. Ligachev writes before the passions have cooled, his perceptions can still be viewed in all their authentic ambivalence and emotion.
Mr. Ligachev is simply too close and too central to serve as historian or commentator. For that, there is the excellent introduction by the Princeton historian Stephen F. Cohen, whose own conversations with Mr. Ligachev are recounted in the memoir. Mr. Cohen not only offers a critical guide through the arcane byways of an insider's book; he argues that understanding Mr. Ligachev and what he called "healthy conservatism" offers invaluable insight into a force that is certain to play a major role in shaping Russia's destiny.
Mr. Ligachev left the stage ignominiously lumped together in the public mind with "reactionaries," "hard-liners" and other Communists headed for the much-ballyhooed garbage heap. That is inaccurate and unfair. As his memoirs reaffirm, and as Mr. Cohen argues, Mr. Ligachev was conservative, but not reactionary. He enthusiastically threw his lot in with a perestroika that he envisioned as a liberalization, modernization and cleansing of Communist rule. He saw the limitations of centralized economic control, the dangers of stifling discourse, the destructiveness of corruption. But the democracy he sought was "socialist democracy" and "socialist pluralism," and his enemies were the classic villains of romantic Bolshevism -- the party careerists and "office theoreticians" with no experience of "real life," those who "groveled before the strong and lorded it over the weak." Mr. Ligachev's opposition to Mr. Gorbachev was always loyal: he had nothing to do with the putsch in August 1991 and was not asked to be a part of it.
At the dawn of perestroika, he perceived Mr. Gorbachev as "one of us," an enlightened Communist who would lead the party in a great renewal. But either because he was 10 years older than Mr. Gorbachev or because, as he proudly notes again and again, he preferred action to thought, Mr. Ligachev very quickly reached the limit of what he was prepared to change. Private property, open criticism of Soviet history, political pluralism were all anathema to him, and by 1988 he had changed from comrade in arms to chief critic. There is no shortage of his thunder in the book, and many an "I told you so." But for one quaint moment, he abandons all the Leninist claptrap and lapses into native Siberian candor: "The party was faithful to the idea of struggle with former ways, but they threw the baby out with the bath water."
Yet Mr. Ligachev was of that party, and it is this that drives him to seek explanations for what went wrong, to understand his own role. Among his more evocative passages is a description of the all-night vigil in the Kremlin before the Politburo was to decide whether to make Gorbachev its leader:
"Standing in that predawn hour with Gorbachev on the Kremlin steps, could I have predicted what an odd trajectory our relations would take?"
Five years later, almost to the day, he would write an impassioned and prophetic plea to his erstwhile ally to turn back from the brink: "Now, as many say with anxiety, the country has reached a limit. There is a real threat to the unity of the Soviet federation, to the unity of the C.P.S.U." The initials stand for Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
When the Communist world was crumbling, and even long after it collapsed, Mr. Ligachev seemed incapable of accepting that he had been so mistaken. Mr. Gorbachev and perestroika had been his faith, his mission. How could they have led to the collapse of the party and the state? If Mr. Gorbachev abandoned the true path, it could only be because he was hijacked by "radicals." If Communism collapsed, it could only be that it was betrayed.
It was the strength of his faith that carried Mr. Ligachev near the pinnacle of Soviet power and assigned him his fateful role in history. He seeks to be candid, but he cannot be dispassionate. In the end, the bewilderment of this honest Bolshevik is what draws us to his story.

HEADLINE: Mississippi Learning

BYLINE: By Alexis Jetter; Alexis Jetter writes frequently on culture and politics.

 BODY:
Keep inside the Mississippi Delta, where he once dodged Klan bullets and sharecropper adulation, Bob Moses has quietly returned to finish the task he started 30 years ago.
It's midnight in Mississippi, and memories stir as Moses walks through the deserted Jackson airport. Black men once feared traversing this state after dark. Tonight, despite the hour, he dials Doc Anderson, a local physician who in the 1960's had a busy sideline stitching up civil rights workers. "Guess what?" Moses says, laughing softly at his own audacity. "I'm here. Can you come get me?" 
 A call in the night from a man gone almost 30 years doesn't seem to faze people whose bonds were forged in the flames of civil rights era Mississippi. Few here have forgotten the shy, bespectacled math teacher who in 1964 guided Freedom Summer, busing hundreds of college students into backwoods Mississippi to educate and register black voters. "The purpose," Moses says, "was to break open Mississippi as a closed society."
Today he's seeking to open another closed society: the world of educational opportunity denied to poor children, black and white alike. His trademark overalls and baby face are gone, but the curiously unblinking gaze and hushed voice haven't changed at all. And now, in the same Delta towns where he was beaten and jailed three decades ago, Moses has reappeared -- retooled for the 90's as director of the Algebra Project, a crusade that experts say could revolutionize math education.
"It's our version of Civil Rights 1992," Moses says. "But this time, we're organizing around literacy -- not just reading and writing, but mathematical literacy." The parallels to the past, he says, are clear. "The question we asked then was: What are the skills people have to master to open the doors to citizenship? Now math literacy holds the key."
Labor and education experts agree. According to the Department of Labor, more than half of today's high-school graduates lack the analytic skills required for jobs. And minority groups, which by the year 2000 will constitute a third of all students, are lagging far behind.
Determined to reverse that trend, Moses established the first Algebra Project in Cambridge, Mass., in 1982. The idea was simple: Without algebra, the door to college and most skilled professions is locked. But many black and Hispanic students, if they take algebra at all, learn it too late to get on the college-prep mathematics track. So why not expose every child to algebra in middle school?
The techniques are vintage 1964. Just as Freedom School volunteers used examples from sharecroppers' own experiences to teach history and writing, Algebra Project students learn to think and "speak" mathematically by tackling problems that arise in their daily lives. The philosophical link is universal access: "It wasn't the right to vote for a few people," Moses says. "It was the right to vote for everybody."
The idea struck a deep chord in parents, teachers and school reformers. By its 10th year, the program stretched from Boston to San Francisco, winning accolades from the National Science Foundation and reaching 9,000 inner-city youths. But for Moses, something was missing; call it a matter of the heart. Last year, joined by Dave Dennis, who co-directed Freedom Summer, Moses found his answer: the Delta Algebra Project of Mississippi.
Together, Bob Moses and Dave Dennis have returned to the bloodiest battleground of the civil rights movement. This time they're talking more about education than liberation. But the stakes are just as high, for they hope to revive a dream deferred.
Moses fears that, without critical thinking skills, the Delta's children will be "tossed by the wayside," like their parents and grandparents, the black sharecroppers of the 1960's. "They didn't have the citizenship requirements of their age," he says. "And so they were serfs, absolutely without power. What is happening now is that we are watching the new serfs emerge."
THE SLEEK BLUE VAN HURTLES PAST misty bayous and scrubby pine forests as Moses and Dennis head toward the Mississippi Delta. Dennis, his eyes red from fatigue, sips iced tea in a fruitless effort to stay alert. Moses grips the wheel and stares straight ahead. After a grueling weeklong Algebra Project workshop in New Orleans, they're on their way to another teacher training session in Itta Bena, Miss.
They make an odd pair: Moses' penetrating eyes and soft voice are virtually hypnotic; Dennis, with his easy laugh and fast talk, is an openly emotional man impatient with the pace of change. But they both came of age in Mississippi, and that experience shaped an intimacy that requires few words.
In the back seat, nibbling soybeans, is a long-haired young drummer, Ben Moynihan, lost in thought. He uses the contrasting rhythms of African drumming to explain math ratios to children, and he has come from Boston to demonstrate his techniques to Delta teachers. But this trip is largely a journey of discovery. For Ben is the child of two Freedom Summer volunteers -- one black, one white -- whom he has never met. And now, for the first time, he hopes to find some clue to their identities.
Inside the Delta, the road narrows, bisecting ramshackle towns where Coca-Cola still comes in green bottles and cotton is still king. Bits of fluff blow off the bale-laden trucks, forming a white spine down the highway, and cotton gins rumble beside the railroad tracks. Time and the catfish industry have subtly altered the Delta landscape. Many cotton fields are now flooded, gridded catfish paddies, with Canada geese paddling lazily on top. And there are no "Whites Only" signs at roadside rest stops. But for all that, the clock seems to have stopped here, and every mile is steeped in memory.
Moses once described Mississippi as "the middle of the iceberg." No other state so defiantly hoisted segregation as its banner; no other state so openly used the sheriff's badge, the lynch mob and the burning cross to enforce it. "Mississippi set itself up to be our destiny," Moses says. "And so it attracted what it eventually got: us."
Moses arrived alone in 1960. Dennis rolled in a year later on the first busload of Freedom Riders to go into Mississippi, a daring crusade to break the South's color bar. In 1964, together with a band of young activists from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), Moses and Dennis embarked on a historic drive to teach Mississippi blacks about their constitutional rights and register them to vote.
Only a case of bronchitis prevented Dennis from meeting Mickey Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, civil rights workers, at a bombed-out church in Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. He has never quite shaken a sense of responsibility for their deaths, or forgotten the horror uncovered in the search for their bodies: other corpses, of black men mutilated beyond recognition, caught on snags in Mississippi rivers.
But Mississippi holds more than nightmares for Dennis, who went on to become a successful lawyer in New Orleans. He recalls the deep affection the activists had for each other, the revolution of hope they inspired and the work they left undone. "When I left Mississippi," Dennis says, "I felt that there was a part of me missing. I didn't finish something."
MOSES SAYS HE, TOO, LEFT PART OF his soul in Mississippi. Raised in the Harlem River Houses in New York, he had been a Harvard Ph.D. candidate in philosophy and was a middle-school math teacher when news of the lunch-counter sit-in movement drew him south in 1960. In Atlanta he met EllaBaker, director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, godmother of SNCC and a fierce believer in the power of common people to move mountains.
With Baker's backing, Moses set out on a solitary tour of rural Mississippi, written off by most civil rights leaders as too dangerous to organize. By 1961, he was registering blacks to vote in towns where few had dared to claim even their most basic rights. Exhibiting almost mystical calm in the face of terrible violence, the soft-spoken young man quickly became a legend.
When a sheriff's cousin gashed his head open with a knife handle, a badly bleeding Moses still managed to stagger up the courthouse steps to register two black farmers. Seemingly oblivious to danger, he fell asleep in a SNCC office where only hours before workers had leaped out a window to escape an armed mob of local whites. And in Greenwood, when three Klansmen opened fire on his car, Moses grabbed the steering wheel with one hand, cradled the bleeding driver with the other and somehow managed to bring the careening car to a halt.
Arrested and jailed countless times, he resisted his growing "Moses" reputation -- going so far as to change his name to Parris, his mother's maiden name. But his exploits fed the legend. "In Mississippi, Bob Moses was the equivalent of Martin Luther King," says Taylor Branch, author of "Parting the Waters," a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the early civil rights movement.
Moses' insistence on Socratic reasoning and bottom-up organizing, which often dragged SNCC meetings late into the night, alternately inspired and maddened his colleagues. "Bob combines Calvinist, absolute certainty with a deep commitment to democracy and poor folks," says a longtime friend, the Rev. James Breeden. "He can be the most charming, open guy you'll ever want to meet or a totally inside-himself, enigmatic mystic. But one rarely runs into such an implacable being."
After Freedom Summer, however, something snapped. He watched in pain as SNCC's interracial "Beloved Community" fractured in a season of violence that left 4 people dead and 80 beaten, and 67 churches, homes and businesses destroyed. "That summer," Moses says, "people who were talking to each other stopped. People who had been working together left. The whole spectrum of race relations compressed, broke down and washed us away."
Moses' personal life, too, lost its moorings. His marriage to Dona Richard, a SNCC worker, ended in divorce. And as he grew more actively opposed to the Vietnam War, Federal authorities -- who hadn't accepted his claim of conscientious objection -- drafted him. In 1966, Moses fled to Canada. For two years he lived under an assumed name and scraped by with a medley of jobs. Finally, Moses and his second wife, Janet Jemmott, a former SNCC activist, moved to a dusty village in Tanzania, where they lived for eight years.
It was a good time to be away. Assassinations, the war, racial polarization: "I was glad to miss it all," Moses says. "It was a good time to duck. The notion that you can fight everything is crazy." Instead, he taught high-school math, raised four children and gradually recovered from the "deep sea pressure" of Mississippi. "You just felt like you were underwater all the time."
IN 1976, AFTER 10 YEARS in exile, Moses returned. Janet entered medical school, and he resumed his doctoral studies at Harvard. But he was soon distracted. Unhappy with the math instruction his eldest daughter, Maisha, was receiving at Martin Luther King Jr. School in Cambridge, Moses insisted on tutoring her at home.
"Doing math with my dad was part of our responsibility in the family," Maisha recalls, "like taking out the garbage or doing laundry." By 1982, however, Maisha was in open revolt about learning math at home, instead of with her schoolmates. So when her eighth-grade teacher invited Moses to come in and teach algebra, he followed his daughter to school.
It was the end of his doctoral studies and the beginning of the Algebra Project. Freed from financial burdens by a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant, Moses turned his full attention to teaching -- and watching. Some found his beetle-browed gaze unsettling. Mary Lou Mehrling, Maisha's teacher, recalls one frightened little girl running out of the classroom in tears. "His steady, constant demands, that intensity, just unnerved her," Mehrling says, laughing. "And it unnerved us!"
But all that watching paid off. Moses noted that children had difficulty moving from an arithmetic understanding of numbers -- usually associated with the question "How much?" -- to the more flexible algebraic concept, which requires an additional question: "Which way?"
Getting the right answer wasn't the point, Moses realized. Students needed to puzzle their way to the right questions, then chart out a variety of solutions. Watching children distill lessons from concrete experiences, he created a five-step model that reproduced their natural learning process. In an Algebra Project exercise, a child experiences an event, draws or models it, writes and talks about it, translates it into mathematical language and then develops symbols to represent it.
Moses came to believe that even tricky mathematical concepts like negative numbers, which make little sense to children but are critical in algebra, could be more readily explained if linked to everyday applications. He scouted around Cambridge for a simple, vivid example and found one staring him in the face: the Red Line in nearby Central Square.
Herding his students into a subway car, Moses took them inbound to Boston, then back past Central Square to the end of the line in Cambridge. Back in class, armed with magic markers, students assigned a value of zero to the Central Square station. Soon they had transformed the train route into a number line with positive values for inbound stops, negative for outbound.
Students got the point, a fun ride and a chance to make art out of numbers. One boy who used to hide behind a piano during math class emerged. Groans diminished. Resistance ebbed. Soon Moses was experimenting with other ways to teach algebraic concepts: zodiac games to teach multiplication and division and lemonade concentrate to teach ratios.
Moses next began a series of weekend tutorials for parents and breakfast workshops for children who needed it. Not everyone was thrilled. "It was like torture," says Claude Sneed, now 19, whose mother roused him from sleep for those 7:30 A.M. sessions. "I know for myself, whenever math time came around I got a sick feeling in my stomach. They worked us hard."
But Sneed sailed through the ninth-grade qualifying test for honors math and moved directly into the sequence of geometry, trigonometry and precalculus. Even those who didn't pass advanced to honors algebra, which is still on the college-prep track. Today Sneed is an electrical-engineering student at Northeastern University. Maisha Moses is a Harvard graduate and Algebra Project developer in Oakland. And the King school is using project techniques in every grade from kindergarten to eighth.
Moses has just begun to assess his project's long-term impact; as yet, there is insufficient data to judge its success. But anecdotal information and standardized tests from several schools appear to confirm what Algebra Project teachers have long suspected: "When these kids get the privilege of creating their own mathematics, they become independent learners," says Dorothy Strong, director of mathematics for the Chicago public schools. "And that works on the whole child."
The best example is the King School, where the program has been in place for 10 years. Before the Algebra Project, few students took the optional advanced-placement qualifying test in ninth grade, and virtually none passed. By 1991, the school's graduates ranked second in Cambridge on the test.
In Chicago, parents emboldened by a citywide school reform movement imported math Moses-style into 19 elementary schools, beginning in 1990. Several skeptical teachers resisted, but last year many students showed marked improvement in reading and writing as well as in math. And in Louisville, Ky., one principal credits the project with nearly doubling the number of students who scored at or above the 50th percentile on a national math achievement test.
News of the project's success spread quickly. Soon schools in Boston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Oakland and San Francisco jumped on board. Reports trickled south, but Moses -- already leapfrogging across the north to personally train every Algebra Project teacher -- gave little thought to expanding there.
Then "Mississippi Burning," Alan Parker's 1988 film about the murder of the three civil rights workers, stirred long-repressed anger. Outraged at what they considered the film's distortions, and particularly galled by its heroic depiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, former activists held a symposium in Jackson. Their informal title: "Why Was Mississippi Burning and Who Put Out the Fire?"
It was a wrenching reunion; Dennis had not seen Moses for 24 years. "For us to come together again after a white man makes a crazy movie is insanity," Dennis said that day, his voice choked with emotion. "We have to get back in here. We've got a lot of stuff that's unfinished."
Dennis spoke about the tongue-lashing he'd got from the aging Mississippi firebrand Annie Devine. "Mrs. Devine compared Bob and me to runaway fathers. She said: 'You gave birth and you left, and you haven't done anything to support your children.' " Dennis paused, laughed through his tears and said, "Maybe that's what's been nagging me for so many years."
Rising at dawn, the men spoke for hours by the edge of a Jackson motel pool, and when they parted they still had 10 years to fill in. Both had remarried, both had children to brag about. But Moses kept coming back to the same thing: the Algebra Project. It's the future, he said. And it's the legacy of our past.
Moses pointed to the example of their late friend Fannie Lou Hamer of Sunflower County in Mississippi. Hamer was 44 when she learned she had the right to vote. But encouraged by SNCC, the plantation worker rose to become one of the movement's most eloquent and savvy leaders. And when, in televised testimony at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, she passionately demanded an end to all-white delegations, she shook the conscience of the nation.
"Immersing everyone in the process, insisting that everyone get in there and do it, accelerated the development of leadership," Moses told Dennis. "Here, you immerse the child in a physical event he understands, and show that child how to take from that event the mathematics he needs. It's the same process that raised someone like Fannie Lou Hamer until she could speak to the whole country."
Last year, Dennis left his law practice and moved to Jackson with his wife, Carolyn, and two youngest children to coordinate the Algebra Project's Southern Initiative. He now administers programs in Louisiana, Kentucky, Arkansas and Mississippi, where he hopes to put some old demons to rest.
"Coming back to Mississippi, you see what you left," Dennis says over a hasty cup of tea in Greenwood. "Yes, there's been progress. But then you wonder what direction that is going in. There still is no format for saving the children."
BUT IN Greenwood itself, and in Sunflower and Washington Counties to the west, seeds planted by the Algebra Project are beginning to bear fruit for more than 2,000 Delta schoolchildren in 10 area schools. Inside Thelma McGee's classroom in Indianola, children are sprawled on the floor, under their desks, drawing on butcher paper, debating in groups, writing stories -- doing everything, in short, you wouldn't expect them to do in a sixth-grade math class.
McGee, a sweet-tempered woman who keeps a Bible on her desk for personal reference, answers an inquiry here and there but lets her young charges answer most of their own questions. "It's embarrassing to ask your teacher," explains Robert Kent, a lean, serious boy with metal-rimmed glasses and a gray sweatsuit. "But you can ask your friends. They're trustworthy."
On the walls are drawings of their recent bus tour through town: the courthouse, National Guard armory, fire station, airport and graveyard. One boy's cemetery has a gravestone with "JoJo" written across it. "He's an imaginary friend," explains a squirming Davis Willis. Next are slightly more abstract renderings of the trip, with directional symbols of the students' own design. The idea, says McGee, is to acquaint children with numerical equivalents for distance, direction, time and space in their own living, breathing environment.
Moses' "transitional curriculum" for sixth graders is designed to introduce students gently to concepts they will need later in algebra. Children draw, write and discuss their ideas in small, cooperative teams and concoct stories from their own experience that illustrate mathematical concepts. "Mostly you have to talk about it before you're ready to solve the problem," Robert Kent says, drawing vigorous nods of agreement from his teammates.
Getting children to talk to each other about math is exactly what Moses intends. There's no need, he says, to teach children better ways to compute. "Today, drill and practice doesn't take you front and center," he says. "Computers can crunch more numbers than anyone's going to dream of crunching. There are no jobs out there for people who know how to divide."
Educators say his approach flips traditional math instruction, often used to filter out weaker students, on its head. "Seeing mathematics as a language leads naturally to the assumption that everyone can learn to be math literate," says Claudia Henrion, a Middlebury College math professor working to reform high-school and college teaching. "We would never say to a student: 'Sorry, you're not bright enough to learn English.' "
And an observer doesn't have to look far to find the echo of Fannie Lou Hamer in McGee's classroom. "I think that I am good at math since we started the Algebra Project," says Shemetric Falconer, a slender girl in a pink T-shirt and jeans. "I can grow up and get a job and be good at this stuff."
Shemetric, who last year wanted no part of school at all -- and was considered at risk for dropping out -- now says she wants to teach algebra. "She's gradually coming out of her shell," McGee says. "They sit there and explain things to each other, so she's beginning to feel more comfortable."
Moses wants students to discover their own mathematical thinking. So rather than taking an abstract approach to concepts like equivalency -- the idea that one-half is equivalent to five-tenths, even though it doesn't look a thing like it -- the Algebra Project asks students to write "make-do" parables that demonstrate equivalencies in real life. In Thelma McGee's classroom, children write about substituting baking soda for toothpaste, flour for pancake mix and liver for fishing bait.
Equivalence, any theoretician will attest, is a fundamental concept of modern mathematics and a stepping stone to higher math. Moses makes it child's play. Using snap-together cubes, Play-Doh, jump ropes and Chinese zodiac restaurant menus, Moses has found ways to introduce even such difficult notions as displacement, integers and vectors. "It gets harder as you go along," confides another student. "But it seems like they cover it up by making it fun."
Rural reality does pose problems for the Algebra Project's urban-based curriculum. Since there are no subways, teachers use a bus route for the number-line exercise, and students pick their own landmarks.
Often Algebra Project bus tours teach more than just math. During a recent training, one white teacher on a bus full of educators pointed out the former site of Greenwood's swimming pool. Her grandfather built the pool, she said. And in the 1960's, when the town was ordered to let black people swim there, her father was one of the men who poured it full of concrete.
OF COURSE, MISSISSIPPI has changed since Bob Moses and Dave Dennis left. Blacks, who constitute 36 percent of the population -- the highest concentration in any Southern state -- now occupy nearly a quarter of the seats in the State Legislature. And in the former heartland of the Ku Klux Klan and White Citizens Councils, overt racism is no longer in vogue. Moses, who once slept on the floors of those bold enough to give him shelter, is greeted politely by white clerks at Greenwood's Best Western motel when he comes to town.
But Greenwood's blacks still live apart from whites, separated by the traditional dividing line: railroad tracks. The Magnolia State leads the nation in poverty, infant mortality and illiteracy. And its schools are still segregated.
In 1970, as court-ordered desegregation plans went into effect, Mississippi's dual public school system simply changed form. It became, for the most part, a black-public, white-private system, as predominantly white institutions like Pillow Academy in Greenwood sprang up overnight. The educational legacy of Jim Crow still cripples the Delta's black populace. Into the mid-60's, the black school year was substantially shortened by white administrators more concerned with the cotton crop than with educating black children. That shortchange, coupled with agricultural mechanization and a virtually nonexistent industrial base, has mired Delta blacks in illiteracy and unemployment.
For too long, says Howard Sanders, superintendent of schools in Hollandale, black parents have told their children to leave Mississippi and "never look back." The Delta's calcified, semifeudal economy left aspiring young blacks little choice. Now he and local business leaders are looking to the Algebra Project to lay the groundwork for economic revival.
Visions of economic renewal have attracted whites as well as blacks. Rebecca Baird, a plucky teacher from Williamsburg, Ky., hopes to lure corporations to her depressed coal town with the promise of a math-literate work force. "We're trying to train our kids so we can compete with bigger cities," says Baird, who attended a recent Algebra Project training in New Orleans. Her school district is offering free videos, fast food or T-shirts to kids who sign up. Baird calls it stealth learning: "They'll learn without realizing they're learning."
Other Southern whites have embraced the Algebra Project for reasons that have little to do with civil rights or economic development. Debbie Murphy is a blond, blue-eyed daughter of the Confederacy. She grew up in the small Delta town of Ruleville, attended an all-white private academy and didn't realize until her first day of college at Ole Miss "that this was not a segregated world." Murphy never heard of Hamer, who lived on the black side of Ruleville, until the day she died.
But Murphy went on to become a public-school math teacher. She's committed to teaching at Lockard, an integrated school in Indianola. And what draws her to the Algebra Project is that it works. At first, she admits, she was far from convinced. "I was very, very skeptical," she says. "But I just fell into it. It was so easy. They learn from each other."
"Mrs. Murphy, can we break into our groups, please?" asks one insistent girl. Murphy nods, and the classroom explodes with activity. Teams of students measure the floor, Murphy's desk and the windows, using rolls of tape, books, pieces of chalk or just their own feet. "One-two-three-four" mutters one youngster atop a table. "Before, they could just sit there and ignore the teacher," Murphy says. "But they can't ignore this." The one drawback? As the math class files out, a girl from Murphy's incoming class surveys the scene. "It's messy," she sniffs.
BOB MOSES HAS WATCHED WITH satisfaction as the Delta Project has grown and flourished. But he never forgets the way things were. "It's interesting to work with teachers who 30 years ago you couldn't talk to," he muses one afternoon in Dennis's backyard. "There was no way even to approach them."
Mississippi has extended a bittersweet homecoming to the veterans and offspring of Freedom Summer. Nightmares still stalk Dave Dennis's nights, but his days are filled with ever-expanding plans to reform Southern education. Ben Moynihan found no trace of his parents, but discovered blood ties to a fiercely loving family. "I know whose boy you are," MacArthur Cotton, a former SNCC activist, said to him one night in Dennis's Jackson home. "You belong to us."
Next year, Cotton hopes to hold a Mississippi reunion to mark the 30th anniversary of Freedom Summer. Many would make the pilgrimage, for that distant summer was the defining moment of their lives. But others never recovered from the terrible violence unleashed against them, and for them there can be no homecoming. Some are alcoholics on the streets where they all once marched, some are in jail and at least one woman has been in a mental institution. "Some of us didn't survive psychologically through this," Dennis says. "When the movement moved on these people were left behind, like the M.I.A.'s from the Vietnam War."
Moses, off to yet another training session, grabs his backpack, extends a warm hand in farewell and climbs back into Dennis's blue van. "It's taken a quarter of a century to move through this," he says with a small smile. "But it may be that the times are ready."
 
 
 
THE COLLEGE-BOARD METHOD: MATH AS THE GATEKEEPER
 THE CREATORS OF THE scholastic Aptitude Test -- the much-feared college entrance exam -- have decided to assist students who might otherwise fall off the college-prep track. "I believe in elite education for the non-elite," says Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, in New York City. "Having spent a lot of time defining and raising standards, we have decided to help students meet those standards."
The board's response: Equity 2000, an attempt to close the college-bound gap between white and minority students by the end of the century. The two-year-old program, now involving more than 450,000 students in 200 schools across the nation, eliminates middle-school tracking, insures that every ninth grader learns algebra and trains teachers in the most effective techniques for math instruction.
Why focus on math? "Math is the gatekeeper to the academic track," says Stewart. In a recent study, the board found that minority students who mastered algebra and geometry in high school succeeded in college at almost the same rate as white students. But many black and Hispanic students are still tracked into dead-end math classes.
"Once a child becomes remedial, they never get 'fixed,' " says Anthony Terceira, math administrator for the Providence, R.I., school system, one of six Equity 2000 sites. "And it does a lot of harm to children's attitudes."
Call it consumer math, business math or vocational math, it all comes down to "a cruel hoax," says Equity 2000's national director, Vinetta Jones. "But you can't just by edict say: 'Thou Shalt Not Track,' " she adds. "You've got to provide training."
Equity 2000's summer workshops show teachers and guidance counselors how to reach all students with new materials and teaching styles. In Providence, school administrators have eliminated math tracking in every grade, from first on up. And next September, they plan to enroll every eighth grader in pre-algebra, every ninth grader in algebra and every 10th grader in geometry. Schools at the other sites -- Fort Worth, Milwaukee, Nashville, San Jose, Calif., and Prince George's County, Md. -- are setting similar goals.
Still, many teachers and parents wonder how they can de-track their schools without boring the bright kids and overwhelming the slower learners. The answer, say experts, is to raise the floor without capping the ceiling. In Providence, quicker learners advance through math at their own rate; those who need more help to reach Equity 2000 thresholds receive after-school help.
Most important, says Terceira, emphasis has switched from workbooks to creative thinking. Two years ago, seventh-grade students sat in six rows of five desks, alternately staring at their teachers, the clock and their work sheets. Today, they're huddled in small groups, gripping rubber dolls and animatedly debating the height ratio of Beauty to the Beast. And in the upper grades, lessons start with real-life problems rather than abstract concepts.
"The old thing we always heard was: 'I'm never going to use this stuff,' " says Terceira. "That's true. You are never going to get a job where you are paid to open to page 256 and do those 15 factoring problems. Nobody's making money doing that except teachers."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Manaus

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE is the chief of The Times's Rio de Janeiro bureau.

 BODY:
With the vogue in ecotourism, this remote city 1,000 miles up the Amazon River system has suddenly become the first port of call for thousands of Americans visiting Brazil. Manaus is served by one of Brazil's most modern airports, and arriving at the heart of the Amazon has lost a little of the palm-trees-and-propellors charm it once had. Traveling on Varig flights from Miami and Los Angeles or on an increasing number of oceangoing cruise ships, Americans now account for 20 percent of foreign tourists visiting Manaus.
Most visitors come to explore the sea of Amazon forest that laps at the edges of this city of one million people. At first glance, Manaus seems to be a nondescript collection of moldy high-rises improbably wedded to a frenetic street life created by a free-trade zone. But, with a little discrimination, a visitor can discover stimulating diversions well worth exploring on both ends of a rain-forest tour. In getting around, it makes little sense to rent a car. Cabs will get you throughout the city and most roads stop once they reach one of the rivers in the Amazon system.
 
Sightseeing
 Remnants of Manaus's belle epoque can be seen on a two-hour walking tour. Sparked by a turn-of-the century rubber boom, the city was the first in South America to install streetcars and the second in Brazil to install electricity. Although Manaus is markedly safer than Rio, it is best to stroll with discretion and to avoid flashing valuables in public. 
 A good place to start is at the Municipal Market (Mercado Municipal). A sprawling stew of Amazon River life and commerce, it was modeled by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel after Les Halles of Paris and built in 1906 of imported cast iron. Imbued with strong smells reminiscent of its Parisian parent, the market offers huge slabs of Amazon fish, exotic tropical fruits, Indian handicrafts and close-up views of the boats that use the river as a liquid highway.
Keeping the river on your left, walk two blocks to the floating docks and Customs House (Alfandega). Imported piece by piece from Britain at the turn of the century, this passenger-ship dock is designed to accommodate the 40-foot seasonal rise and fall of the Rio Negro, the Amazon tributary that flows past Manaus harbor.
Plunging back into the city, walk seven blocks up to the Opera House (Teatro Amazonas) on Avenida Eduardo Ribeiro. Built in 1896 as a tropical miniature of La Scala in Milan, the opera house features frescoes and statues on Amazon themes, illuminated by French chandeliers. In 1990, the theater reopened after a painstaking three-year, $8 million renovation. Often called the jewel of the jungle, this elegant fantasy where Sarah Bernhardt would have felt at home is open to visitors every day except Monday, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Entrance fee is $2 (prices at 19,000 cruzeiros to the dollar). Check newspaper listings for programs. Past programs have featured performers as varied as a Polish pianist, a United States Air Force choir and a Brazilian ballet company.
Despite the shade of ficus trees, the temperature will probably be in the 80's, so it will be worthwhile to stop at a corner bar and freshen up with an ice-cream cone or glass of juice made from Amazon fruits -- acerola, cupuacu or graviola. (It's a good idea to avoid ice and unpeeled fruit, however, to avoid gastrointestinal upset. Food stands in the street are also dicey.)
Take the time to stroll around the neighborhood surrounding the opera house. Dominating a square in front, a 1900 monument of bronze, marble and granite hails the opening of Amazon ports to ships from throughout the world. In the back stands another 1900 neo-classical structure, the Palace of Justice.
Taking a swim often comes to a visitor's mind while exploring a humid metropolis that swelters three degrees south of the Equator, 100 feet above sea level but 1,000 miles from the ocean. Fear not, Brazilian beach culture is alive and well in the center of South America. The Tropical Hotel offers a swimming pool with artificial waves. But for more local color, try nearby Ponta Negra beach, which becomes a festive social center during the dry season, June through November. Manaus's elite retreat to Dourada Beach, which is about 10 miles beyond the airport. Consult residents on swimming conditions. Piranhas and electric eels can ruin an Amazon dip.
 
Sights
 Visitors to the Amazon forest sometimes return complaining "You can't see anything." Indeed, unlike the Kenya plains, the rain forest is closed and dense, with wildlife often lost in the cathedral canopy. The city zoo, at 750 Estrada de Ponta Negra, an old-fashioned cage and cement affair, is run by the Army's Jungle Warfare Training Center. About 300 Amazon animals, from snakes to black panthers, are on display. Open 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily. Admission is 50 cents.
The Ecopark, built along more sensitive lines, offers a "monkey forest" and an open-air aviary, both stocked with fauna rescued from dam projects and seized from illegal wildlife markets. With six miles of trails leading through 4,500 acres of forest, the park offers nature hikes with trained guides. Accessible only by a half-hour boat ride to the Taruma Igarape from the Hotel Tropical, the Ecopark, 234-0939, offers half-day excursions for $25 and full-day excursions for $50, boat transportation included.
Closer to town, the National Institute for Amazon Research (I.N.P.A.) opens to the public on Sunday its botanical garden, which includes 800 labeled species of plants and trees. The Army zoo has donated deer, herons, sloths, alligators and a jaguar. In the aquatic mammals department, visitors can watch Amazonian manatees swimming in large tanks. The institute is on Avenida Andre Araujo, also known as Estrada do Aleixo. Open from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is free.
Two Manaus museums offer keys to understanding the Amazon's inhabitants.
The 30-year-old Indian Museum (Museo do Indio), 234-1422, run by Salesian missionaries, displays masks, jewelry, weapons, tools and musical instruments developed by Indian tribes during thousands of years of living in the upper Rio Negro region before contact with Europeans. At the corner of Avenida Duque de Caxias and Avenida Sete de Setembro, it is open from Monday to Friday 8:30 to 11:30 A.M. and from 2 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. On Saturday, only in the morning.
Five blocks away, at 1385 Avenida Sete de Setembro, is the Museu do Homem do Norte, 232-5373, housed in a building that was the city's first firehouse. The walk takes the visitor over two igarapes, or river inlets, and past the neo-classical Palacio Rio Negro, the state Governor's mansion. Scheduled to reopen next month after a major refurbishing, the Museum do Homem do Norte is dedicated to the distinctive culture of the Amazon's mixed-race riverine peoples. Open Monday to Thursday 8 A.M. to noon and 1 to 5 P.M.; Friday, 1 to 5 P.M. Both museums charge about 50 cents admission.
 
Shopping
 Although Manaus is a free-trade zone, most Americans will not find any great buys among the duty-free electronic goods on sale. Baskets, necklaces, arrows and wood carvings made by Tukano, Baniwa, Dessana and Waimiri-Atroari and other Amazon tribes can be purchased at the Indian Museum, at the Municipal Market, at the Centro de Artesanato on Recife Street, and at the Funai shop operated by Brazil's Indian protection service on the same square as the Hotel Amazonas. The quality is fairly high, and the flat baskets are easy to pack; they range from $2 to $15, depending on size and workmanship.
 
Where to Stay
 Manaus's most modern hotel is the Taj Mahal Continental, which has a quirky India-meets-the-Amazon decor. Fairly comfortable accommodations and a good location two blocks down a hill from the Opera House, the Taj is at 741 Avenida Getulio Vargas; telephone 233-0006, fax 233-0068. A double is $100.
Cheaper and more centrally situated is the Hotel Amazonas, 622-2233, fax 622-2064. The city's oldest major hotel, the slightly run-down Amazonas is on Adalberto Valle Square, midway between the municipal market and the floating docks. A double is $110 with tax.
Budget: Across the square from the Hotel Amazonas is a cheaper alternative, the Ana Cassia Palace, 14 Rua dos Andradas, 622-3637, which offers a double room for $60 with tax. This 89-room hotel has a seventh floor restaurant with good views.
Luxury: Most foreign visitors head for Manaus's only real tourist hotel, the 358-room Tropical Hotel, 658-5000, fax 658-5026, 11 miles out of town. Complete with its own river dock and private zoo, this sprawling complex was built in the mid-1970's in a Mediterranean style with red tiled roofs and whitewashed walls. Drawbacks include spotty telephone service, a 20-minute drive to town and gloomy rooms. The Tropical often books up August to October. Doubles are $200 with tax.
 
Where to Eat
 It is possible to travel to the middle of the Amazon and eat Chinese, Japanese, Italian and French food. And, yes, the churrascarias specialize in steak. But Amazon cooking is an unexpected treat. Dishes rely on distinctive local ingredients: tucupi, a hot sauce made from manioc roots; tacacazeira, a fiery soup made of shrimp and paracress leaves, and a series of meaty river fish: pirarucu, tambaqui, surubim and tucunare.
The restaurant with the widest variety -- 20 shrimp dishes alone -- is La Barca, 684 Rua Recife, 236-8544. With nautical decor, La Barca offers live music. Fish entrees range from $5 to $10.
More informal, and closer to the Hotel Tropical, is the Restaurante Palhoca on the Estrada da Ponta Negra, 238-3831. Overlooking the river, this open-air restaurant features music, dancing and waiters who show you your fish before cooking it. Specialties include fish stews (caldeiradas) and a spicy duck (pato ao tucupi). Entrees are $4 to $8.
Another inexpensive restaurant with wonderful views of the river is Panorama at 199 Rio Negro Boulevard, 624-4626, in the Educandos neighborhood. It features most of the Amazon fare as La Barca for half the price.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Making the Most Of a Concierge

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
IF nothing else ever made you want to stay in a top-drawer hotel, the services of a senior concierge might do it. If they are good at their jobs, they know how to get tickets to the hottest plays, what the newest restaurant is and how to get a good table. As one historically minded concierge said, he and his colleagues have come to embody the core of a hotel's efforts to serve in a day when the inn is so large that the innkeeper can no longer personally attend to each guest. 
 In New York, all luxury hotels and all the new ones have concierges, and many others do as well. In the case of the Plaza, which has 800 rooms, a battery of 10 serves under the direction of Thomas P. Wolfe, who bears the impressive title of "executive chef concierge," and who brought the profession to the United States when he started out at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco in 1974. Some places, the 191-suite Waldorf Towers, for example, have only one, and in recent tough economic times, some hotels have combined the concierge desk with the registration desk under the catch-all title of Guest Services. But when you get a yarn-dyed concierge, with the distinctive crossed gold keys on each collar, on duty behind a handsome counter in the lobby, you have major problem-solving capacity available.
 
Mobilizing a Team
 The work is sometimes complicated. Mr. Wolfe and Ermelah A. Adams, chief concierge at the Marriott Marquis on Broadway, have each arranged three weddings since they settled at their current hotels, four years in his case, and seven years for her. "I get out my SWAT team," Mr. Wolfe said. "Minister, photographer, flowers, license, a suite for the ceremony."
Lauro Fernandes, chief concierge of the 600-room Drake Swissotel, who has two assistants, arranged to get a doctor for a guest with a heart attack and then saw him into the hospital; because the patient's wife was too upset to speak, Mr. Fernandes stayed initially and then visited each afternoon after work. "Of course," Mr. Fernandes says, "they tell all their friends they should stay at my hotel." Mr. Fernandes, who was born in Los Angeles, went to the Drake about a year ago from the Plaza, where he had worked for four years; before that, he was at the Helmsley Palace for 11 years. When he changes hotels, he says, he sends out 3,000 letters to guests to let them know where he will be. Many guests follow, he says.
The concierges' links to each other are supportive, not competitive, and the ties create important tools. The New York City Association, which has 70 concierge members from 30 hotels, has links to the national chapter of the international golden keys association, Les Clefs d'Or. The city group meets monthly, to hear from experts and to share bad experiences. If a particular place or service has been uncooperative, a letter is sent by the organization. Mr. Wolfe, the immediate past president, said: "It is not threatening. We always word it, 'How can we do this better?' "
On Feb. 1, the group presented its fourth annual awards, which are sponsored by Where magazine, American Express and the Rainbow Room. The year's senior concierge award among five nominees went to Eugenio Chinigo of the Plaza Athenee in New York and the junior award to Dwight Owsley, who is on the Carlyle staff, which is directed by John Neary, president of the national concierge association. Because a concierge relies on the support of the hotel that employs him or her, the organization also nominated five best supporting hotel managers: Philippe LeBoeuf of the Westbury won.
The senior winner, Mr. Chinigo, who began his career 30 years ago in Rome and eventually moved to Canada and Houston before going to the Plaza Athenee when it opened here eight and a half years ago, says that he often calls colleagues in other countries to find needed information. His hotel has four concierges for 150 rooms, and "we are always busy."
 
Facility With Languages
 Most concierges have languages. Mr. Chinigo says he "can make himself understood in seven" and is learning an eighth, Japanese. Several concierges noted independently, however, that languages, like a city, could be learned, whereas the idea of wanting to help people had to be a component of the personality.
Ms. Adams, who was born in South Africa, taught at Berlitz and trained as a wine expert, cites as her most satisfying task getting a French couple home when a family member had died. "They could not get a death certificate at that hour," she said, "and Air France wanted a tremendous price for a last-minute ticket. I got tickets through a friend for $270 and paid for them myself. When I looked at those tearful people, I knew I had made a difference." The couple repaid the fare.
Mr. Owsley came to the profession in 1980 as a part-time room service waiter at the Carlyle and then moved to bar captain. He was supporting himself and taking voice lessons. In 1985, he joined the concierge staff. He considers the Carlyle staff strong on the arts, with well-developed opinions on opera, theater and popular culture. "We never tell a guest not to go to something," Mr. Owsley said, "but if we are asked our opinion, we give it." They by no means stick to the tried-and-true, and have a good knowledge of funky jazz clubs for those who ask.
Mr. Owsley and Mr. Neary concurred with the other concierges that the most common request, from men or women guests, was "a certain show, a certain restaurant." The Matisse show at the Museum of Modern Art was a steady request that the concierges said they could all fill, and "Guys and Dolls" continues to be sought after. The experts all said that they could usually get a ticket for the hottest show on the same night, but that the cost could be formidable: Mr. Fernandes of the Drake said it might be $150 a ticket.
Most returning guests call the concierge ahead of time to give their requirements. The concierges' message was that the best, most comprehensive service was delivered to those hotel guests who asked specifically for what they wanted, and in the manner of a request, not a command. Advance warning is a plus, but "they all want it yesterday," one said wearily.
Ms. Adams said that although the Marriott Marquis had a ticket agency on the lobby floor, her guests, who increasingly are foreigners, prefer to have the concierge handle tickets, reservations and transportation.
Ms. Adams considers a reliable limousine service the basis of lots of her results. "When I found the yacht compass in New Jersey on a Sunday," she said, "I had to have a limo that would pick it up, not one that would tell me they couldn't find the store."
When are guests a trial to these service-oriented people? Mr. Wolfe does not like to be asked for help by someone who is eating. Mr. Chinigo says that the worst times are cancellinglast-minute reservations after he has pressed a restaurant with no space into accommodating his guest. All concierges have had to deal with obnoxious guests, but say they come with the territory.
What about the matter of money, beyond the surcharges on surcharges involved in some requests? The concierges hastened to reply that they never considered a tip a matter of course nor solicited one. Envelopes with personal notes were the nicest form of delivery, they said.

HEADLINE: Warhol Pops Up in Carpathia

BYLINE: By RUTH ELLEN GRUBER; RUTH ELLEN GRUBER, the author of "Jewish Heritage Travel: A Guide to Central and Eastern Europe" (Wiley), writes often about Eastern and Central Europe.

 BODY:
ANDY WARHOL never set foot in Mikova, the remote village in the far eastern corner of Slovakia where his mother and father were born. But in September 1991, four years after his death (and 70 years after his parents emigrated to America), a museum dedicated to the Pop artist's work, his family history and avant-garde art in general opened in the nearby little town of Medzilaborce.
Medzilaborce lies in the rugged wooded foothills of the Carpathian mountains about six miles from the border with Poland and 30 miles from Ukraine. 
 The idea of an avant-garde art gallery in a remote Carpathian town had fascinated me even before it opened. Months earlier, an art historian at the Slovak Culture Ministry had regaled me with stories about wolves howling in the surrounding snow-covered mountains as he met with local officials to discuss the setting up of what is now the Warhol Family Museum of Modern Art.
Still, when I finally did manage to reach Medzilaborce (pronounced MED-zil-uh-bor-tseh) last fall, I wasn't quite prepared for the contrast. At first sight, the town of 6,000 seemed little different from the others I had passed through on a drive of nearly 90 minutes along winding roads from Presov, the nearest good-sized city.
A hilltop Russian Orthodox church, its interior a bright display of lighted candles and folk painting, towered over drab Communist-era concrete buildings stretched along a grimy main street. In the center of town, an Eastern Rite Catholic church with an onion dome, a primitively painted roadside wooden crucifix and a few old houses were all that was left of anything prewar.
It was a cold, gray, wet Sunday, and the rain turned to snow as I walked down the street. Congregations spilled out of both churches; loudspeakers broadcast the services outside, and church bells, first from one church, then the other, rang out.
As in many villages in this area, the western edge of what used to be called Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia, many of the people, like Warhol's parents, Julia and Andrej Warhola, are Ruthenians, a Slavic ethnic group related to Ukrainians. The Ruthenian language is a dialect of Ukrainian. Many Gypsies live here, too.
On the main street downtown, I got a taste of post-Communist cultural clash: a teen-age Gypsy girl with long, dark hair was rhythmically practicing break dance moves on the sidewalk while watching her reflection in a shop window that advertised flashy American films: "Sleeping with the Enemy," "The Player," "Twins," "Double Impact," "Ruby," "Shining Through," "Stone Cold."
The street may once have been named for Lenin or some other Communist hero: today it is called Ulica A. Warhola, or Andy Warhol Street. A few steps away, below the Orthodox church, I found the museum. It would have been hard to miss. It is a bright, white, clean-lined new masonry structure, a long rectangle at least 35 feet high, set in a broad paved plaza. Picture windows run the length of the ground floor, and narrow vertical windows, apparently two stories high, are arranged on the overhanging upper section. The building gleamed in contrast to the rest of town.
Two giant mock-ups of Warhol's trademark Campbell's soup cans -- one Cream of Celery, one Tomato -- stood on either side of the broad glass entryway, like red and white sentinels at the entrance to another world.
I walked around the soup cans and felt a sense of dislocation as I looked up at the ornate, old-world Orthodox church and the mist-shrouded, forested autumn hills beyond and listened to the church bells -- while reading the familiar slogan above the perfectly painted giant bar code: "Campbell's Soup is 'M'm! M'm'! Good!"
Stepping into the museum was another dislocation: Medzilaborce into Manhattan. Sort of. An American video about Andy Warhol, with a voice-over in Slovak, blared from a monitor in the gift shop. The shop sells reproductions, posters, postcards and -- my favorite -- cans of locally made "Warholova Rajcinova Stava" ("Warhol's Tomato Soup") bearing red and white labels with Warhol's face in a yellow circle in the middle, in a parody of Campbell's labels.
An elderly attendant unlocked doors for me and an Austrian couple, the only other visitors. Our feet echoed on the marble floors as we entered the cavernous galleries.
The building's austere exterior conceals a complex of spacious, airy exhibition halls arranged on various levels. The ground floor is largely given over to the shop and offices, works by local artists and temporary shows, with the Warhol material on upper levels reached by broad stairways. The stark white walls of the two-story-high main hall showcase a well-lighted and well-hung group of 13 big, bright Warhol seriographs: more Campbell's soup cans (Hot Dog Bean and New England Clam Chowder), portraits of Lenin and Ingrid Bergman, a cow, an electric chair, flowers, a hammer and sickle. Wall placards in several languages reverently quote Warhol's ruminations on life, death and art, and high-tech neon decorative lighting adds to the New Yorky ambience.
In smaller galleries off the main hall are some works by Warhol's brother, Paul, an amateur artist, and a Warhol nephew (who, the guide said, is a science fiction illustrator), as well as other contemporary artists like the Warhol protegee Ultra Violet, who had a one-person show at the museum in August.
One entire gallery and several side exhibits in cases outside the main exhibition area are devoted to an extraordinary display of Warhol family history and memorabilia, a gluttonous feast for devotees of the trivial. Here I found Warhol's octagonal sunglasses, his first camera, his transistor radio, his mother's diary, the little white gown that he and his two brothers were all christened in, old letters from Warhol's mother to her sister back in the village, old photographs, Christmas cards, clippings -- even some bills.
This material has been lent or donated by Warhol family members, and the 13 Warhol prints are on long-term loan from the New York-based Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which also gave a small grant for the museum's educational programs.
The museum itself was conceived and established by the Slovak Ministry of Culture, which also runs it. According to a former Culture Ministry official, in 1988 and 1989, after the death of Warhol, Slovak artists and other public figures circulated petitions urging the ministry to open a museum in his honor. After the so-called Velvet Revolution ousted the Communist regime, the new Slovak Culture Minister, Ladislav Snopko, took an active role in getting the project off the ground.
"We did not want to 'prove' to the Americans that we can do something American-like here, in this region of the republic," said Michal Bycko, a bearded, shaggy-haired local artist who is deputy director of the museum and one of the artists who pressed the Culture Ministry to create it.
"All we wanted was to render homage to people who gave birth to the man who has influenced the world of the 20th century. Those people were Julia and Andrej Warhola from Mikova."
Mr. Bycko told me that increasing numbers of tourists, mostly from the region but also many foreigners, had found their way to the museum. Some 1,200 people visited in September, he said. Indeed, the guest book had signatures from as far away as Israel and Japan, as well as one entry, in English, that declared, "Ruthenia Rules O.K." I was told that 50 Italians had been there two days earlier and as I was leaving three Polish tour buses pulled up.
The Warhol museum, remote as it is, gave me a good excuse for exploring what is a beautiful but little known area, mostly poor and little touched by private economic initiatives or other outwardly visible post-Communist changes. I even passed a few rusting left-over propaganda billboards of the Peace Equals Communism variety.
The rugged landscape, the remoteness and the ethnic mixture of Slovaks, Ruthenians, Gypsies and, before World War II, Jews, has given the area its flavor. Bulbous-domed Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic churches rise picturesquely on hilltops above otherwise drab villages, and a number of villages in the area, including Humenne, Korejovce, Mirola and Hunkovce, have some exceptionally beautiful wooden churches, built between the 16th and 19th centuries, that bristle with cupolas, turrets and carved detail.
The ruins of several ancient castles also dot the craggy wooded hills, including those of 13th-century Kapusany Castle and 14th-century Zborov Castle. More modern ruins exist, too; the area near Svidnik, the scene of a major World War II battle between the Red Army and the Germans, is not only full of commemorative monuments and military cemeteries but also contains the remains of many destroyed tanks.
The ancient town of Bardejov, the gem of eastern Slovakia, has an exceptionally well preserved complex of Gothic and Renaissance buildings around its beautifully proportioned central market square. There is a fascinating icon museum, a well-presented local history museum in the 16th-century town hall, a 15th-century church with 11 altars, and also a massive abandoned synagogue dating back to the 18th century.
 
 
 
POP GOES SLOVAKIA
The Museum
 The Warhol museum is open daily except Monday, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission is about 40 cents. The best way to get there is by car, but be careful: The winding roads can be treacherous with rain, fog and snow as early as October and as late as April. From Presov, take Highway 18 to the turnoff for Highway 73, follow 73 north, then follow the turnoff signs on small roads for Stropkov, Havaj and Medzilaborce. From Bardejov, take Highway 77 to Svidnik, then take Highway 73 and follow the turnoff signs, again, for Stropkov, Havaj and Medzilaborce.
 
Hotels
 There are few good eating or sleeping possibilities in the immediate vicinity of Medzilaborce. I had a fairly pleasant single room with bath in Presov for $12 a night at the Socialist-style Hotel Saris, 1 Leningradska, Presov 08001, Slovakia; telephone (091) 46351. The direct dialing country code for Slovakia is 42.
The Saris also has a decent restaurant featuring typical Continental dishes and local specialties like trout and sausage. You can have a full meal, with wine, for well under $10 a person.
Another hotel in Presov is the Hotel Dukla, Nam 2 Legionarov, Presov 08001, Slovakia; (091) 22741, fax (091) 32134.
About four miles from Bardejov is Bardejovske Kupele, a pleasant spa resort with a fairly good modern hotel, the Hotel Mineral, Bardejovske, Kupele 08501, Slovakia; (0935) 4122. The town also has many remnants of Hapsburg-era charm (including Sunday band concerts) and an open-air folk architecture museum featuring some fine wooden churches and peasant buildings. There is also a modern hotel in Svidnik, another Hotel Dukla, KPT Nalepku, Svidnik 08901, Slovakia; (0937) 22255.
Kosice is the biggest city in eastern Slovakia and has several hotels, including the first-class Hotel Slovan, 1 Hlavna, Kosice 04001, Slovakia, (095) 27378, fax (095) 28413. I find it a little too far away, though, to make a good base to explore the Medzilaborce area.

The chain says the rates represent a discount of at least 20 percent off the standard price. Rates, which are good for one to four people in a room, must be prepaid by check or guaranteed with a credit card within seven days after the reservation is made. If the reservation is canceled within 15 days of arrival, there is no refund. Call (800) 325-2525.
SAILING IN ASIA Windstar has announced introductory rates for its cruises in Southeast Asia this year and next; the booking deadline is the end of this month. Effective for departures Nov. 21 through Dec. 12, 1993, and Jan. 9 through Dec. 11, 1994, the introductory rate is $1,648 a person, double occupancy. The rate reflects a discount of 50 percent on regular prices. The fares are good only for a certain number of cabins, but as of the second week of this month, all departures were "wide open," a spokeswoman said. From late fall through early spring, seven-day itineraries will operate round-trip from Singapore and call at Penang, Langkawi and Malacca, Malaysia, and Phuket, Thailand. In late spring through early fall, the ship will sail between Singapore and Bangkok, calling at Tioman Island, Terengganu and Perhentian Island, Malaysia, and Koh Samui, Thailand.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
Where Everybody Knows Your Job

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
NETWORKS TEND TO NAME TV series after jobs: "Nurses," "Coach," "The Commish," "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." If the tube accurately reflected real life, most Americans would work as attorneys, physicians, policemen, proud restaurant owners and neurotic entertainers instead of the cosmetics saleswomen, teachers and truck drivers they are. 
 Just as the American labor workplace offers some surprising trends (bulletin: service jobs may not be the wave of the future after all), so does its television counterpart. In 1993, here's what the networks are offering by way of occupational enlightenment.
 
 * A plethora of doctors, lawyers and cops
If all the fictional characters on prime time lived in one community, it would be a strange town. Roughly one of every five adults would be a police officer, lawyer or doctor. (And this doesn't include all the policemen running around on the reality-based shows.) It would be easy to get a good restaurant meal, have your house decorated or order a margarita. But good luck if you needed groceries, wanted to have your car fixed or expect your child to attend schools that had teachers in addition to coaches. There is one accountant in town, but Norm on "Cheers" hasn't worked for years.
 
 * Women who have mysterious careers
Katherine Howser (Belinda Montgomery) is a patient advocate at the same hospital where her son, Doogie, and her husband work on "Doogie Howser, M. D." but you could watch for weeks without seeing her outside the home. Bob Newhart's television wife, played by Carlene Watkins on "Bob," works at a museum, but viewers have never seen it. Vivian Banks (Janet Hubert) on "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" is reportedly an English professor. Jill (Patricia Richardson) on "Home Improvement" was hired to work part-time on Detroit magazine but apparently would rather stay in the kitchen.
 
 * People who don't seem to work at all
Tea Leoni's character on "Flying Blind" may have once worked as a fashion designer. Elizabeth Ashley's Aunt Frieda on "Evening Shade" is said to be living on alimony. But Kramer (Michael Richards) on "Seinfeld" has never had a career, and that's that. (He did pose for that fictional Calvin Klein ad.)
 
 * Yet no one's on unemployment
 Roseanne Conner (Roseanne Arnold), a onetime factory worker and waitress, suffered through joblessness on "Roseanne," but now she's running her own restaurant. Christine (Shelley Fabares), a television newswoman, had her show canceled on "Coach" but has picked up work doing coffee commercials. Only Norm (George Wendt) on "Cheers" has endured a long spell of unemployment, and even he had stints as a house painter and professional beer taster.
 
 * Upwardly mobile blue-collar workers
On "Roseanne," the title character left her factory work behind long ago. On "Roc," Roc Emerson (Charles Dutton) is still a sanitation worker but he's now a landlord too. Jake Hanson (Grant Show) on "Melrose Place" was a construction worker; now he owns a motorcycle shop. And on "Designing Women," Anthony Bouvier (Meshach Taylor), once a delivery man, is a partner in the design firm and working on his law degree. Thank God for Homer on "The Simpsons," who works at a nuclear power plant, and for Earl Sinclair (a puppet), who has a job as a tree pusher on "Dinosaurs," while his wife stays home tending the hatchlings and coping with the Jurassic Period.
 
 * Friendly Restaurateurs
On Monday nights alone, CBS takes us to Ossie Davis's place (Ponder Blue's) on "Evening Shade," Pat Corley's joint (Phil's) on "Murphy Brown," Susan Dey's Blue Shamrock on "Love and War," and John Cullum's Brick on "Northern Exposure." This is not to mention bars ("Cheers"), nightclubs ("Out All Night") or yet another restaurant, this one on ABC, "Jack's Place."
 
 * Rich people with no household help
The only domestics seem to work for lawyers ("I'll Fly Away" and "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air") or for politicians ("The Powers That Be"). Who keeps Murphy Brown's two-story house so clean?
 
 *Too many people who work in television . . .
Let us count them: the entire cast of "Murphy Brown" and "The Jackie Thomas Show" plus Tim (the host of a home-repair show) on "Home Improvement," Shelley Fabares (who lost her job as a news broadcaster) on "Coach," and the characters played by Bob Saget and Lori Loughlin on "Full House." Now Karyn Parsons has a job doing the weather on "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," and Jason Alexander is trying to write a pilot on "Seinfeld."
 
 * . . . or in publishing
Bob Newhart and most of the supporting cast of "Bob" are employed by a comic-book publisher. There are newspaper editors, reporters and columnists in "Love and War," "Evening Shade," "Major Dad" and "Key West." Angela Lansbury plays a mystery novelist on "Murder, She Wrote." And Julia Louis-Dreyfus, on "Seinfeld," is a reader for a book publisher. Doesn't anyone other than Al Bundy think about becoming a shoe salesman?

HEADLINE: Brutal Winter? Summer Rentals Warm the Brokers

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
WINTER winds may still be blowing along the East End of Long Island and the Jersey Shore, but the market for summer-home rentals has already started to warm up in most places, according to real estate brokers in the New York metropolitan region's most popular vacation areas.
Traditionally, the weekend around Valentine's Day and President's Day marks the time when prospective renters start trekking out to their favorite seaside or rural vacation towns in search of summer homes where they will spend a week, a month, weekends or the entire season. 
 This year, though, brokers in many vacation areas have noticed that more and more renters have started what is usually an annual rite of spring in the dead of winter -- and even earlier.
"Used to be that some of them would start coming down after the bowl games on television in January, but now they have even starting to come down in October and November," said Karen Myers, office manager of H.C.H. Inc., a real estate agency in Harvey Cedars, a small beachfront town on Long Beach Island in New Jersey where homes rent for $1,200 to $4,000 a month. "Then it closes down over the holidays, but right after it gets busier and busier.
"Everyone knows that they have to get down here early to find the accommodations that they are looking for, especially if they want oceanfront and oceanside," she added.
Rental-home shoppers, who generally put down half the rent when they sign a lease, appear just as eager in the Hamptons on Long Island, probably the most expensive vacation area in the region.
"It's unusually early and unusually lively," said Tina S. Fredericks, a real estate broker in East Hampton.
"The start of the season was the first of January this year -- it's amazing," added Peter Hallock, a broker with Allan M. Schneider & Associates in East Hampton, where homes rent for $25,000 to $35,000 and up to $100,000 for the summer.
"There is an awful lot of stuff for rent," he said. "And demand is definitely higher than it was for the past two years."
The rebounding rental market has also been detected in other vacation areas, like Litchfield County, Conn., and Cape Cod, Mass.
"There have been a lot of early bookings, but prices are about the same as last year," said Peter Fyler, a broker with Barbara Nevin on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where homes rent for $800 a week to $20,000 a month.
He added that people were also taking shorter vacations than in the past. "They are booking for one week instead of two or a month," Mr. Fyler said. "They are breaking up their vacation time and trying to spread themselves out, and going someplace else."
Despite the rise in early rentals, many renters are being as fussy as ever. Jeffrey and Melanie Tucker have been renting in the Hamptons for 12 years. "So far, it looks about the same this year as last," Mrs. Tucker said.
The couple -- he is an investment banker and she a former television producer -- are searching for a three-bedroom contemporary house in Sagaponack or Bridgehampton, south of Montauk Higheay. They are willing to spend $36,000 for a season, from Memorial Day to Labor Day.
AFTER looking all day Valentine's Day they still hadn't settled on a home. "This is late for us," Mrs. Tucker said. "Usually we are out looking at the end of January."
As would be expected with any increase in demand, prices for summer rentals appear to have stabilized, ending a pattern of decline in most places that began with the start of the recession in 1988 and lasted through last year. "People are not getting less money than last year for their homes," said Ms. Fredericks. "In some cases, they are getting more. We have had a recession for the last two years, and there is something pent-up out there that wants out."
"Rentals haven't really fallen in price," said Jeanne DiPaola, executive director of the Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, which covers such towns as Harvey Cedars, Ship Bottom, Surf City, Loveladies and Beach Haven on Long Beach Island. "What we have seen is no substantial increase in price since 1988."
Howard Panster is a bond trader from Edison, N.J., who owns a two-family house in Harvey Cedars that he rents out during the summer for $850 and $1,050 a week in July and August. "The rent is up $25 or $50 over last year," he said. "That may not sound like much, but there was a three-year stretch when it didn't go up at all or it was minimal. Years ago, we used to go up $50 or $75 a week every year, and we never had any problem renting."
IN some areas, a reduction in the number of rental homes available may be keeping prices level and prompting renters to start their search as soon as possible. "Last year, I had 100 less rental properties than I had a year before," Ms. Myers said. "It appears that when the clients are buying their homes they are doing so for their own use, if at all possible."
On the Jersey Shore, demand for rentals has also increased because of the recent completion of Interstate 195, which makes the beach easier to reach from eastern and central Pennsylvania. "We're also telling people to be nice and not treat them like 'Bennies,' " said Pat Padula, director of tourism for Monmouth County, N.J., referring to a common nickname given to tourists by the area's year-round residents, ostensibly -- according to one theory, at least -- because the visitors benefit from sun and surf and the residents benefit from the money that is spent.
Last summer's chronically bad weather hasn't been much of a concern among renters this year, nor has the fear of beach pollution, which in 1988 prompted some long-time renters to vacation elsewhere. The Outer Banks in North Carolina was a popular alternative at the time.
"Our biggest problem is that people think everything has been destroyed by the storms," Ms. Padula said. She added that only a small part of the beaches in the county sustained any lasting damage from the devastating storm last December.
MR. HALLOCK noted that that the spate of recent storms that had eroded beaches and damaged scores of homes in Westhampton, L.I., wasn't as destructive farther east in the Hamptons. Besides, he said, such fears would have an impact only on the sale market, "and then probably only beachfront property," he added.
On Fire Island, however, Lee Mehlig of Mehlig Realty in Saltaire said that the eroding beach on some parts of the island, which has been hard-hit by storms this winter, might make some renters look elsewhere this summer.
He also noted that because of the lingering recession some rentals were tough sells last year. He added, though, that that since the ferries had yet to start up it would be premature to gauge the early rental market on the island.
"The ferries don't even start on a limited scheduled until mid-March," he said.
One reason for the possible softness of the Fire Island market is its high percentage of shared rentals, which are not as popular as they were in the early and mid 80's. "It doesn't have the appeal that it had years ago," said Mike Turitto, a New York City sales representative who has been organizing groups to share houses on Fire Island for 17 years.
Mr. Turitto blamed the aging of the baby boomer generation and the social conservatism of the times. "There is no social scene anymore, just couples staying at home and watching videos," he said.
He added that those singles who wanted to share a house now waited until the season started and shopped around for the best deal. "Last year was the slowest year yet, and I think this year will be the same," he said.

HEADLINE: New for New York: Readable Tax Notices

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
PROPERTY owners have been getting something unexpected from New York City -- tax assessment notices that they can understand.
"Dear Taxpayer: The Department of Finance estimates the value of your property as follows," the notice begins. What follows are not only the assessed value and an estimate of the tax bite for the coming fiscal year, but the market value that city assessors have placed on the property. 
 Until last year, the city released only assessed values, not the market-value estimates from which they were derived. That made it impossible for owners to understand the rationale behind the assessment and whether the city was being reasonable and fair in its taxation.
"Market value is a number that's on everybody's lips," said Carol O'Cleireacain, the Finance Commissioner. "They always know what the apartments around them have sold for, or the house up the block."
"The most important criterion in assessment is market value," said Martha E. Stark, assistant commissioner and special counsel at the Finance Department.
In the past, owners of office and apartment buildings could divide the assessed value by 0.45 to get some glimpse into what the assessor had in mind, assuming that the assessed value was 45 percent of market value, as it is supposed to be for such properties.
But the owners of one-, two- and three-family houses (known to the Finance Department as Class I properties) were left in the dark. Although assessed values in this category are supposed to be 8 percent of market value, they might be much less.
That is because the assessment of Class I properties cannot, by law, increase more than 6 percent annually or 20 percent over five years. In neighborhoods where market values rose quickly in the 1980's, assessed values did not keep pace. As a result, an assessment of $15,000 could apply to a house whose market value was $187,500. Or $250,000. Or $375,000. There was no way for homeowners to tell.
"They had to do algebraic computations," Ms. O'Cleireacain said, "and I felt this was not at all helpful in getting people to understand the tax. They felt there was no justice in the tax, that it wasn't linked to anything, that it was an abstract concept."
There was, indeed, something abstract about the way value was calculated, she said. Technocrats in the finance agency focused on adjusting the current assessed value in relation to previous assessed value, Ms. O'Cleireacain said, rather than relating assessed value to market prices.
"They didn't have a history of determining market value," Ms. O'Cleireacain said. "They didn't do their work that way."
Moreover, bureaucrats do not tend by nature to be eagerly forthcoming with the data they use to make decisions. "There's a certain comfort in keeping things a secret," Ms. Stark acknowledged. "It gives you the feeling you have a power over people that you don't necessarily have. But one thing Carol would say is, 'Why shouldn't we tell them?' "
One reason was a fear that logistical nightmares would result when homeowners got their first glimpse of how the city pegged market values. "The Tax Commission was a little concerned that people would be up in arms, come rushing in and clog the process," Ms. Stark said. "The Tax Commission said, 'Please don't publish market values, it will bring our operations to a halt.' "
But that did not happen, she said. While the number of homeowners applying for an assessment correction increased threefold, to 9,000 in 1992 from 3,000 in 1991, the owners of some 600,000 other one-, two- and three-family properties did not apply.
"Yes, they get angry perhaps about the level of the tax," Ms. O'Cleireacain said. "But I've had people all around the city come up to me and say, 'You got the market value right.' I said: 'Thank you. That means your taxes are right.' "
Not everyone believes the city hits the target. Patricia Dolan, president of the Queens Valley Homeowners Association in Kew Gardens Hills, said the concept of market-value disclosure was "excellent" and "by and large, a very useful feature."
"The problem," she said, "is that the real market value and the market value on the form have nothing to do with each other." As an example, she cited row houses on the south side of 73d Terrace that had been assigned higher market values than detached, one-family houses on the north side.
CO-OP and condominium owners maye also be surprised when they see the "market value" line on their notices. Their properties are treated as if they were rental buildings. By law, assessors cannot factor in the sales price of individual units. Instead, they calculate the estimated net income for the building, then apply a capitalization rate to determine what a buyer might pay.
That yields a "market value" for condominium and co-op units that may be anywhere from 35 to 65 percent of the amount for which they might sell, Ms. Stark said.
"You have to read this value as a piece of a comparable rental building," counseled Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "It shouldn't distress you from the point of view of, 'Oh my God, if this is all I can get for my apartment, I might as well kill myself.' "
A condominium that would sell for $150,000 might be assigned a market value of $55,000. Its assessed value would be 45 percent of that, or $24,750. A single-family house that would sell for $150,000 might be assigned exactly that market value. But its assessed value would be 8 percent of that, or $12,000.
To determine the value of one-, two- and three-family houses, Ms. Stark said, assessors use an economic model that permits them to produce mass appraisals based on actual sales registered in New York City.
The computerized model assigns value to the location of the property (near a park, near the shore, on a corner), the year in which the house was built, the style of the house (colonial, A-frame, brownstone), the quality of the construction, the exterior condition and the square footage of the building and the parcel it sits on.
"We develop values for property not unlike how a person going out to buy their house would," Ms. Stark said. "You'd compare the house you're thinking of with houses that have sold. You'd ask whether the roof needs repair, whether it needs a garage."
"WE don't get enough interior information," she allowed. "We don't know, unless someone comes forward to tell us, that it's a two-bedroom house or a three-bedroom house. A lot of what we do is the exterior."
Ranked by market value, Class I properties constitute the most valuable category of real estate. Taken together, the Finance Department estimates, one-, two- and three-family homes are worth $132.2 billion, or 41 percent of the total market value of all taxable property in the city.
Residential properties with four units or more -- rental, co-op, condominium -- have a market value of $70.2 billion, or 22 percent of the total. By contrast, all of the office buildings in the city are worth $56.0 billion.
The disclosure of market-value estimates is one of a number of steps that Ms. O'Cleireacain has taken to "demystify" city taxes. The department is also furnishing taxpayers twice a year with a "statement of account," showing the charges that were imposed, the payments that were received, delinquent taxes and credit balances.
This winter, the department also scheduled 20 help sessions -- 14 more than last winter and 20 more than in 1991. Taxpayers are invited to come and put their questions directly to assessors and other finance officials. Two sessions remain on this winter's calendar: tomorrow, 5:30 to 8 P.M., on the fifth floor of 150 Nassau Street, at Spruce Street, in Manhattan and Tuesday, 5:30 to 8 P.M., in Room 200, 350 St. Marks Place, in St. George, Staten Island.
Gerry O'Connor, deputy director of the taxpayer assistance division, said there were a number of commonly asked questions.
"How is the market value of my property arrived at?" "Am I eligible for a senior-citizen exemption?" "How do I file a Tax Commission protest application?"
Another common refrain, Mr. O'Connor said, was: "The estimated market value of my property is too high! Would the city like to buy it from me at that amount?"
Ms. O'Cleireacain's reply: "What would I do with it? I much prefer they live in it."
