HEADLINE: VITAL SIGNS: CHOICES; 
When Smoking Is a Matter of Money

BYLINE:  By ERIC NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Getting people to quit smoking may be hard, but discouraging them from starting, at least when they are young, may be as simple as raising the taxes on cigarettes.
 A new study reports a link between the price of a pack of cigarettes and the likelihood that a teenager will start smoking. 
After surveying a total of 12,000 8th- and 10th-grade students for seven years and taking into account the local price for cigarettes, the researchers concluded that a 10 percent increase in price decreased the odds of teenagers' starting smoking by as much as 10 percent. 
 The study was conducted by ImpacTeen, a research partnership at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and by researchers from the University of Michigan. Based on data collected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the project was part of a long-term study into substance abuse among children.
The researchers said the study helped resolve a debate over whether cigarette prices affect the number of teenagers who begin smoking. Previous studies showed that higher prices did decrease the number of children smoking and the amount they smoked.
The lead author, Dr. John A. Tauras, said the evidence was clear. Indeed, to hear Dr. Tauras, an economist, tell it, the study says almost less about public health than it does about basic economics: if you charge too much for something, fewer people are likely to buy it. Noting its addictive nature, other experts have doubted that this would hold true for tobacco. 
"Cigarette smoking does actually adhere to the fundamental principles of economics," he said.
The study also illustrates another fundamental of many teenagers' lives.
"Youths have very little disposable income," Dr. Tauras said. "They have certain fixed dollars each month to spend."

HEADLINE: Brazil Bounding Forward As Genomics Powerhouse 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
It has no laboratories or research teams of its own, only a modest administrative staff working out of a nondescript building in a residential neighborhood here. But through canny management and careful choices, the Research Support Foundation of the State of Sao Paulo is rapidly becoming a powerhouse in genomics and a model for scientific investigation in the third world.
 Last July, a Brazilian consortium organized and financed by the foundation became the first anywhere to decode the genome of a plant pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa, an insect-borne bacterium that infests oranges. A few months later, the foundation, known as Fapesp, announced that the consortium had completed the genetic sequence of a second pest that plagues this country's thriving fruit export industry, Xanthomonas citri, or citrus canker. 
 "From the moment we began, our objective has always been the same: to work on the frontiers of science while addressing issues of social and economic relevance," Dr. Jose Fernando Perez, the foundation's scientific director, said in an interview here. "The genome project has served that purpose and created an image of leadership for us." 
Indeed, Fapesp's twin successes have not only established its international reputation but also led to important collaborations, including one with a group that is sequencing human cancer genes, financed in part by the Ludwig Institute in Switzerland. In another unusual turnabout, the United States Department of Agriculture recently contracted Fapesp to sequence the gene of a bacterium that afflicts vineyards in California.
"What they are doing is science of the highest quality, comparable to anything that is being done at the largest sequencing centers in the United States or Europe," Dr. Claire Fraser, president of the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., said in a telephone interview. "As a result, they have really become recognized as an important player in the field, making a major contribution to the international genome effort."
Increasingly, Fapesp's accomplishments are also making it the standard for scientific research in the third world. In an editorial last year, the magazine Nature called the genome work here "a political as well as a scientific achievement" that refutes the "common misconception that only advanced industrialized nations have the wherewithal and skilled human resources needed to achieve cutting edge science."
The foundation's rise to prominence is just one of several recent signs of the advance of Brazilian science, in which the government, through a cabinet-level Ministry of Science and Technology, and the private sector have begun to invest.
In March, for instance, Brazil became the first country in the developing world to clone an animal, a calf named Vitoria, or Victory.
Brazil has the largest commercial cattle herd in the world, more than 160 million animals, and Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, the minister of agriculture, said Brazilian research into cloning intended to "improve animal and plant health and technology," including the eventual development of cattle resistant to foot-and-mouth and mad cow disease. "This is the first step to gaining complete mastery of this technology," he said.
Brazil's progress can also be measured in the increase in the number and variety of papers its scientists publish in international journals. Brazil now accounts for 1.2 percent of scientific papers produced around the world, three times its rate of just 15 years ago, according to the Institute for Scientific Information, which tracks the number of papers produced around the world.
Even more notably, since 1996 "the number of citations of Brazilian scientists has grown three times faster than the worldwide level," Ronaldo Sardenberg, the minister of science and technology, said in an interview in Brasilia last year. "We are determined to do everything we can to encourage that process to continue because we realize that research is good business."
A large part of Brazil's success, however, can be attributed directly to Fapesp, which has a degree of institutional autonomy rare in this part of the world.
Since the foundation began operations in 1962, state law has guaranteed it a fixed share, now 1 percent, of all the tax revenues collected in Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and most populous state, with 37 million people. Along with federal contributions, that allows Fapesp to pump $270 million a year into research projects as diverse as a catalog of biodiversity and the syntax correction software used in the Portuguese-language version of Microsoft Word.
Fapesp's charter states that it can spend no more than 5 percent of its budget on administration, preventing the political featherbedding so common in government agencies in developing countries.
The same statute also prohibits Fapesp from assembling its own corps of scientists, requiring it to work through some 50 university laboratories and research departments around the state.
"I guess you would have to call us a virtual institute because we don't have our own research facility or programs," Dr. Perez said. "We seek systematically to identify niches that are of strategic interest to the nation and then to encourage others to develop them."
Though the genome projects have led Fapesp to apply for several patents and to open a clone bank, the research is not yet generating profits. If and when that happens, Dr. Perez said he expected that gains would be divided according to Fapesp's usual formula: one-third to Fapesp, one-third to the participating institutions and one-third shared among the individual researchers.
Early on, Fapesp began to invest in training young scientists, offering scholarships for them to study abroad. But it was largely able to avoid the problem of brain drain by requiring beneficiaries to return to Brazil for at least four years and by guaranteeing them university teaching positions even before they left.
"This program was extremely important to Brazil at the time because it allowed us to be trained in areas where we did not have competence," said Dr. Glaucius Oliva, director of the Center for Structural Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Sao Carlos, a Fapesp affiliate. "But you also had a signed contract that established a tie and made you a university employee, so that you would have to pay back the salary you had earned if you didn't return."
With only 80,000 researchers, compared with more than a million in the United States, Brazil is still struggling to develop a critical mass of scientists. "We have quality, but not quantity, because we lack the financial resources to train more researchers and create more research institutes," said Francisco Romeu Landi, Fapesp's director-president.
But Fapesp has sought to diminish that handicap with an "induced research," which pushes scientists into areas it sees as most promising or important. It also stresses cooperation over competition.
"If you have dozens of groups with dozens of researchers, it's fine to have a competitive model in which those who get the best and most rapid results get the financing," Dr. Oliva said. "But for developing countries with limited resources like ours, it's suicide."
Almost always, Brazilian science emphasizes projects that will produce a practical return, like the aeronautical programs that led to the formation of Embraer, which is now the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer. Indeed, that was the motivation when Fapesp began its genome effort in 1997.
"We were asking ourselves, what can we do to stimulate the formation of a biotechnology industry in this country," Dr. Perez recalled. "The traditional answer would be to send a group abroad to be trained, but that is slow and expensive and doesn't guarantee success. So we decided to create not a single genome project, but to mobilize behind a series of efforts."
The initial success and experience gained with the plant pathogens have led to more ambitious efforts. Scientists supported by Fapesp and local sugar cooperatives, for instance, have just finished sequencing the genomes of sugarcane, one of Brazil's most traditional exports.
"These research efforts are of great economic importance because Brazil is the leading world exporter of these products," Mr. Landi said. "If we can identify the genes of sugarcane and activate those which increase the index of sweetness and the rate of growth, we will increase productivity in the field."
This year, 25 laboratories associated with Fapesp are to begin sequencing the genomes of the eucalyptus tree, cultivated here by a paper and cellulose industry because it grows faster than native trees. The private sector will pay part of the cost.
In March, Fapesp announced a plan to sequence the genes of the worm that causes schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection that afflicts millions. Fapesp officials also hope other genome projects will lead to the development of drugs to fight endemic tropical diseases like malaria, leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease.
"I think that what Brazil has done is brilliant, because they have selected research projects that are important to them and the rest of the developing world but are low down on the list of priorities of funding groups" in the United States and Europe, Dr. Fraser said. "They have carved out a unique niche for themselves, making an important contribution in terms of their own economy, and in a sense regaining control of their own destiny."

HEADLINE: Goodyear Cuts Jobs In Mexico 

BYLINE:  By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: TULTITLAN, Mexico 

 BODY:
Gonzalo Ugalde Gamez, a 68-year-old union leader whose right eye hunkers down into a mean slit during moments of brutal honesty, took the lectern before a smoke-filled auditorium of 1,357 Goodyear tire makers to deliver bad news.
 "I'm here with you today to inform you," Mr. Ugalde began, leaning on one elbow, right eye crashing down, "that the plant is closed, and it will not open again." 
 For more than half a century, the Goodyear plant was a steady source of employment here on the outskirts of Mexico City. That all ended abruptly when the company said on April 6 that the factory would be shut for good because of high costs and unfavorable economic conditions. 
As the economy in the United States slows, American manufacturers are respondng with rapid moves to cut costs, cut production and especially, cut work forces. And it is becoming clear that these days, when America cools, Mexico shivers. Many Mexicans who thought they had secure middle-class jobs in American-owned factories are discovering that those headlines about global layoffs often mean them.
In the first three months of 2001, about 240,000 Mexican jobs were eliminated or scaled back, mainly in manufacturing. Industrial output in February was 3.7 percent below that of February 2000. Mexico's Central Bank expects economic growth of only 3 percent in 2001, a long way from the 6.9 percent of 2000.
Mexico has weathered its share of economic ills, but this downturn is different. It is happening while inflation is under control, the peso is strong, consumers are still spending and no general recession appears to be on the horizon, at least for now.
Seven years under the North America Free Trade Agreement have wedded Mexico intimately to America's economy. Just as good times in America fueled a boom here, any decrease in demand or swell in inventories north of the border quickly translates into cutbacks to the south. 
The automotive industry has been hit hardest. Delphi, the world's largest auto parts manufacturer, has eliminated 8,000 Mexican jobs the last year. Chrysler is planning to close three plants in 2001 and may cut up to 2,500 Mexican jobs. Grupo Industrial Saltillo, Mexico's largest maker of engine blocks, has laid off 450 people in five months.
Mr. Ugalde and his fellow union officials tried to negotiate a compromise with Goodyear over the fate of the Tultitlan plant and its workers. Goodyear officials told them that the slowing American economy was part of their decision but that productivity and high costs were greater factors. The plant cut back to a four-day week last October.
Still, employees said they were taken by surprise. "We never thought the plant would close," said Ricardo Velez, 58, who worked in the plant for 36 years.
For severance pay, Mexican law calls for three months' base salary plus 20 days' pay for each year worked at the plant. Mr. Velez said he could expect enough money to last him about a year and a half. He will have no pension or retirement benefits and will need another job when the money runs out.
"But who will hire me at my age?" he said. "Once you hit 35, no one wants to hire you in Mexico, especially when the market is bad."
Cheap, young labor is what attracted many foreign-owned, labor-intensive companies to Mexico, and turnover can be very high, more than 100 percent annually at many assembly factories. But Goodyear was different, with long-term worker loyalty more like that seen in plants in the United States. According to the union, more than half the work force had other relatives working at the plant and more than a third had been there for more than 30 years.
Employees prized a Goodyear job as one that allowed a worker "to have your kids in school, take a trip every so often, eat well and own a car," said a mechanic with 15 years at the plant, who would not give his name. "That's all come to an end."
Mr. Ugalde said that when he first came to the plant in 1955, there was nothing around it but cornfields. Since then, Bacardi and Ford Motor have built factories nearby, and despite the encroaching sprawl of Mexico City, Tultitlan retained the flavor of a safe, prosperous community with Goodyear at its center.
No longer, Mr. Ugalde fears. "I've always been honest with you," Mr. Ugalde told the laid-off workers in his impassioned 45-minute speech after last-ditch efforts to win a reprieve for the plant failed. "I've always looked out for your welfare, and I'll continue to fight to keep you and your families from the misery and the mediocrity that waits."
The Goodyear closing also poses a political problem for Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, who hopes to push through an ambitious tax bill that is growing more unpopular by the day. To raise more revenue in a country with one of the lowest rates of tax collection in the world, Mr. Fox has proposed levying a 15 percent value-added tax on food, medicine, books and other goods. The tax proposal and the plant closings here and elsewhere are combining to engender a feeling of betrayal in some workers. 
"This is not the change that people wanted when they voted for Fox," said Juan Jimenez, 45, a 23-year Goodyear employee who followed his father into the plant. 
Mr. Jimenez is no struggling proletarian. His Goodyear pay let him build a comfortable home for his wife and five children, with a new computer in the dining room. His oldest son is studying engineering at a local university; his youngest attends a professional soccer camp. And he is eager to bounce back from the plant closing, perhaps by starting a small printing business.
"When there's not enough money, I try not to show it," he said. "If my family sees I'm mediocre, then they'll be mediocre. My job is to show them that I can support them."

HEADLINE: Conquering Europe, Word for Word 

BYLINE:  By Peter Schneider; Peter Schneider is the author, most recently, of "Eduard's Homecoming." This article was translated by Philip Boehm.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va. 

 BODY:
For Europeans uneasy with the social and economic changes being wrought in the name of continental unity, a new specter is haunting Europe: the specter of English. National identities are shaken, mutual antipathies threaten to spread, the governments of great European nations contemplate increasingly drastic measures as language police sift through newspapers and monitor television programs for contraband English.
 All this uproar is coming a little late. Although the administrative architects of the New Europe evidently refuse to acknowledge this fait accompli, the people of Europe have long since made their decision. 
 The nations most offended by the Anglo-Saxon ascendancy are the larger ones: after all, the new lingua franca is not the speech of Voltaire, Goethe, Dante or Cervantes -- it's the language of McDonald's, Disneyland and Jerry Springer. It is also the language of Shakespeare, the American Constitution and the Beatles. But you don't hear the Danes, the Dutch or the Hungarians grumbling -- smaller countries are used to learning other languages. And there's little indication that these linguistic "traitors" are complaining to their therapists of acute identity trauma.
I myself have come to welcome the English specter as a friendly ghost that is forcing -- no, luring -- the Europeans back to a common language for the first time in about 500 years. Establishing a new lingua franca is the most significant milestone on the road to a unified Europe -- more important even than the euro. And of course, accepting English would allow Europeans to compete better with the United States in business as well as in the marketplace of ideas.
The last common tongue in Europe was Latin, and there's no doubt that 2,000 years ago countless Greek and Egyptian scholars, in addition to various Gallic or Germanic sages, decried the Roman anti-culture just as French, German or Italian intellectuals today bemoan the dominance of American English. It's also true that all the great dissidents of Rome, as well as of the Catholic Church -- including Giordano Bruno, Copernicus, Luther and Spinoza -- used Latin to broadcast their ideas to the world at large.
In one crucial matter, however, the alarmists have a point. Linguistic dominance means much more than the imposition of translated words and thoughts: languages also serve to smuggle values, cultures and philosophical systems. Every translator knows how difficult it is to find exact matches for words, even if they appear synonymous. It's silly for the language police to attempt to replace words like "computer" or "marketing" with artificially constructed French, German or Spanish expressions. "My job" implies something more transient than "mon travail" or "mein Beruf." Even everyday phrases like "take it easy" or "have a good time" are more difficult to render than it would seem.
But while they have justifiable reasons for concern, Europeans ought to recognize the simple fact that their national languages, regional dialects and even entire cultures have no choice but to change under the pressure of American English. Next they should ask the very American question "So what?" The rise of a new Latin is by no means a signal that their own linguistic worlds are going to disappear. But Europeans are right to worry that their national languages will be reduced to languages used only in moments of intimacy, solace and private thought.
Still, there is no replacing the mother tongue. In fact, globalization may even accentuate individual ethnicity. Within our highly interlinked world nearly everyone harbors, somewhere inside, not just one but many identities, which by and large they manage fairly well. In Berlin I don't particularly feel that I'm a Berliner or even a German -- I just feel at home. But when I'm in Munich I can't deny the fact that I am indeed from Berlin. In Rome or Paris I'm aware that I'm a German. And in America I become a European. I wouldn't want to give up one or more of these identities in favor of another. In a similar way, multiple linguistic identities daily enhance the lives of millions across the globe. 
So native English speakers, born to the new lingua franca, take note: we who are compelled to acquire second languages may have the most to gain.

SolidApril Takes Some of the Sting Out of March Losses

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Technology stocks posted moderate gains yesterday as the Nasdaq composite index ended its best month in percentage terms since June.
 April was a strong month as well for the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index as the economy showed signs of reviving, even though those two gauges retreated from early gains yesterday. 
 Still, the month's gains merely erased March's painfully steep losses, leaving the three indexes within 3 percent of their closing prices at the end of February.
The move back toward February's valuations came as investor psychology changed sharply over the two months. 
Expectations of corporate profits were not "as realistic back in February as they are now," said Brian G. Belski, fundamental market strategist for U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "The Fed achieved a soft landing. That doesn't mean we didn't have a technology recession or an XYZ-sector recession."
The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained 40.56 points, or 2 percent, to 2,116.24. It is now 1.7 percent below its close of 2,151.83 at the end of February and 15 percent above its close at the end of March.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.08 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,734.97. The Dow was up 8.7 percent for the month but only 2.3 percent for the two months.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,249.46. It was up 7.7 percent for the month and 0.8 percent for the two-month period.
Stocks were bolstered in early trading yesterday by more signs that the economy appears to be recovering. The Commerce Department reported that personal income and consumption grew more rapidly in March than economists had expected. That came after a report on Friday that the nation's gross domestic product grew an unexpectedly strong 2 percent in the first quarter despite a volatile stock market and slowing corporate spending.
Both reports gave investors some reasons to hope that the worst might be over for corporate earnings.
"The heavy cloud of pessimism gave way to a cloud of optimism," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist for Fahnestock & Company, a brokerage firm.

HEADLINE: Reports Show Gains in March In the Economy 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
Personal incomes and spending rose in March, and manufacturing in the Midwest showed signs of emerging from a slump, government and private reports showed today.
 The Commerce Department reported that personal incomes rose 0.5 percent in March after a similar gain a month earlier. Spending rose 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent increase in February. Americans still spent more than they earned. 
 Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Management said that its monthly index of regional manufacturing rose to 38.9 in April from a 19-year low of 35 in March. The index, based on a survey, was still below 50, the threshold between growth and decline. The numbers suggested that manufacturers were struggling in an economy that grew 2 percent in the first quarter. 
Neither report offered an unqualified picture of a rebounding factory economy. The employment index in the purchasing report fell to its lowest since October 1980. The spending report showed increased demand for services, no change for nondurable merchandise like clothing and food and a decline for durable goods like cars and appliances.
Regional manufacturing has been in decline since October, and manufacturing nationwide has been in a slump since August. A national report on Tuesday is expected to show a second month of improvement without the index moving into positive territory.
Still, the Federal Reserve's four cuts in interest rates this year may help increase spending on factory products. "I think that it can be helpful to spending by consumers for durable goods," Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said last week.
Today's reports indicated a reduced threat of inflation, making further interest rate cuts more likely. 
The manufacturing report showed the index of prices paid for raw materials fell to 55.8, the lowest since May 1999. The Commerce Department's price index for personal consumption expenditures, a measure of inflation, was unchanged in March.
Personal savings remained in decline. The savings rate changed to minus 0.8 percent during March from a minus 1 percent in February and a record minus 1.3 percent in January, the government said. A negative reading is possible because the number is based on current income. It does not account for money obtained through borrowing, selling investments or other assets, or drawing on savings.
The rate indicates that consumers "are also willing to use up some of their wealth to maintain living standards," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.

HEADLINE: Withdrawals Set a Record at Stock Funds 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Investors took a record $20.6 billion from stock mutual funds in March, a mutual fund trade group said yesterday. 
 The big withdrawals in March capped a quarter of discontent for investors. 
Stock mutual funds took in just $2.56 billion in the first quarter, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1990, according to the trade group, the Investment Companies Institute. That contrasted sharply with the first quarter of 2000, when stock prices were surging and investors poured $140.1 billion into mutual funds that invest in stocks. 
 The March withdrawals followed withdrawals of $3.3 billion from stock funds in February and created the first back-to-back monthly outflows since 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the institute said. 
Investors disappointed with equities poured about $6.9 billion into taxable-bond mutual funds in March, the third consecutive month of sizable inflows, the institute said. 
The tide shows signs of turning in April, however, after a surprise interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve ignited a rebound in the stock market. 
Stock funds took in an estimated $8 billion in April, based on activity through April 27, according to TrimTabs.com, a data service based in Santa Rosa, Calif.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Just What Is It That Icahn Sees in Visx?

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire financier, made his reputation and most of his fortune buying and selling shares of big companies like Texaco and RJR Nabisco. So why is he battling for board seats at Visx, a much smaller company that manufactures equipment for eye laser surgery? 
 Mr. Icahn, who has bought about 10 percent of Visx for $15 million since late last year, says the company has "a great product in a phenomenal industry," but he accuses the current management of failing to make the most of its strengths. 
 He is trying to oust the Visx board in a proxy battle that will culminate at the company's annual meeting in Santa Clara, Calif., its headquarters, on Friday. 
But some Wall Street analysts wonder why Mr. Icahn is betting on Visx when growth in the market for laser eye surgery is uncertain and competitors are chipping away at the company's market dominance. 
There were more than 1.3 million laser eye procedures last year and more than 400,000 in the first three months of 2001. Visx supplied the machinery -- and collected fees -- for most of them. But some analysts say the technology is becoming a commodity as more competitors enter the business.
"There are five players selling these lasers, and a good surgeon can get good outcomes on any of them," said Ted Huber, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. 
Visx currently gets about half of its revenue from royalties each time its machines are used.
Its revenue plummeted 34 percent, to $184.6 million, in the year ended March 31, after it dropped the royalty to $100 from $250 in the face of growing competition from a Japanese manufacturer, Nidek, which does not charge such fees. 
Visx says its royalties have started to rebound and rose 23 percent in the first quarter of this year over the previous quarter as procedures and Visx's share of them both increased. The company would not say how much the royalties contributed to its revenue, which also includes sales of machines.
Visx, meanwhile, has accused Nidek of federal patent infringement in a lawsuit that Visx expects will be tried early next year in San Francisco. In a rare instance of agreement, Mr. Icahn and Elizabeth Davila, president and chief executive of Visx, both expect Visx to win. But some analysts are not so sure. 
"If they don't win, they will have a much lower-profitability business," Mr. Huber said. Visx operating margins are currently 35 percent, he said. 
Irving J. Arons, an independent consultant in Peabody, Mass., said Visx had "an old technology that they are trying to update," while competitors were selling newer technology. 
But Ms. Davila said the Visx machines offered surgeons more and better choices than the competition's. For example, Alcon Laboratories of Fort Worth, a unit of Nestle, offers machines that feature a narrow-beam laser developed by Autonomous Technologies, while Visx machines can vary the size of the beam, she said.
Visx systems are used in 62.4 percent of procedures in the United States; Alcon's in 22.1 percent; Nidek's, 9.9 percent; and several others account for the remaining 5.6 percent, said Dave Harmon, senior editor of Market Scope, an industry newsletter. TLC Laser Eye Centers, previously one of the two biggest Visx customers, said recently that it was now buying Alcon machines.
Even as new competitors are entering the business, the growth in laser eye surgeries is slowing from the torrid pace of past years. Mr. Harmon said the number of surgeries increased 40 percent in the first quarter of 2001, to 440,000, compared with 314,000 in the 2000 first quarter and 377,000 in the fourth quarter. The growth rate peaked in 1999 when total procedures doubled to about 950,000. Now some industry analysts project a further slowing as the economy weakens.
Laser eye surgery, which corrects nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism, is "a discretionary spend," Ms. Davila said. She forecast 20 percent growth in procedures nationwide in 2001. Already, the slowing growth is hurting some parts of the laser eye surgery business. Lasik Vision, a chain of surgery centers that had grown rapidly by advertising prices as low as $499 for surgery on each eye, filed for bankruptcy on April 4. Most surgeons charge $1,500 to $2,000.
Mr. Icahn said Visx had been foolish to cut its royalties and erred again when it recently agreed to license its technology to Bausch & Lomb, a late entrant in the market.
When Mr. Icahn started buying Visx stock, the company adopted a so-called poison-pill strategy to forestall a takeover. But last week, the company said it was temporarily lowering its defenses and would not object to letting shareholders consider an all-cash offer for the company at the $32-a-share value that Mr. Icahn has mentioned. 
Mr. Icahn said Visx was just engaging in "verbal jousting" because a purchase would be hard to finance under the company's terms. He would not be able to use the company assets as collateral for borrowing and would also be precluded from using information obtained in the due-diligence process to encourage holders to tender shares, he said. 
Wall Street analysts remained skeptical that lenders or health care companies would snap up a deal that would value Visx at $32 a share, the price Mr. Icahn has mentioned. 
Visx stock, which roller-coastered from a high of $142.375 in May 1999 to $8.75 last December, fell 45 cents yesterday, to $20.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. "The issue is: is the stock worth more than the $23 he paid for it," said Kenneth Goldman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "Our target is $18."
But Mark Regan, a portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management, the largest shareholder, with 13.3 percent, said the company was worth much more than $32. He noted that Visx was "spending more on research and development, about $19 million this year, than the rest of the industry combined."
The Visx management got support last week from Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory company, which said shareholders should vote for the incumbents.

HEADLINE: Long Before Recent Unrest, Cincinnati Simmered 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI 

 BODY:
The outrage and regret in this racially divided city still focus on the killing of an unarmed black teenager by white police officers on April 7 and the street violence that followed. But the unrest has another source: the long-frustrated demands of black residents for a share of Cincinnati's prosperity.
 The progress toward that goal has been glacial. The current target is a share of the $900 million going into the building of two downtown sports stadiums, for the Bengals and the Reds. The Bengals' football stadium is built, and black-owned businesses were all but shut out of the money. Now Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, has hired Darraugh C. Butler to help black-owned companies bid for contracts they would not otherwise get to work on the Reds' baseball stadium. 
 Abel Building Systems, for example, has just finished installing the security alarms on the construction trailers where the Reds' stadium is rising. Until Ms. Butler called Abel's owners, who are black, they had not realized there was a $9,000 job up for bid, she said. She introduced them to the lead construction company, which was about to offer the work to a white-owned supplier. And now Abel has signed a second contract, for $50,000, to install more alarms, once the stadium -- now concrete pilings overlooking the Ohio River -- begins to look like a ballpark. 
Almost all of the revenue from construction, tourism, restaurants, office rentals and retailing in Cincinnati goes to white-owned companies. No one here disputes that reality or the frustration it brings to many black residents. In interviews, more than a dozen black and white leaders and business executives described this division of wealth as a secondary cause of the rioting or, at the very least, the tense background music to life in greater Cincinnati.
"The trigger for the rioting was the police shooting, but there are definitely deeper economic roots that have to be addressed," said John Pepper, chairman of Procter & Gamble, whose towering stone headquarters complex is only a few blocks from both the location of the shooting, in a slum, and the shiny riverfront revival, of which the baseball stadium is the latest jewel.
The vast project -- two stadiums now and eventually a museum, a park, restaurants and stores -- has become a focus of the racial tension, and Ms. Butler's presence is a belated response to the pressure from black leaders. She is a black entrepreneur herself, the 44-year-old proprietor of a small management consulting firm. From an office in a construction trailer, she "breaks heads," as she puts it, to increase black participation.
"The good-old-boy network was definitely in place at Paul Brown Stadium, and we are trying to break it here," Ms. Butler said, referring to the modernistic, $453 million football stadium. Although tax money pays for the stadiums, less than 5 percent of the contract dollars for Paul Brown Stadium's construction went to black-owned businesses -- in violation of a much-publicized promise by government officials to allot 15 percent, not only in contracts but also in construction jobs, another unmet goal.
"We got to vote on the tax to build the stadium," said the Rev. Damon Lynch III, pastor of New Prospect Baptist Church and leader of the Cincinnati Black United Front, referring to black support of a half-cent increase in a local sales tax to finance construction -- in return for the 15 percent promise. "Now, there is no vote on who actually gets the contracts, and they are not trickling down to us."
The struggle over wealth and income takes place in other arenas as well. Some black leaders, for example, demand that Cincinnati's schools, which are 69 percent black, restore vocational training. This would help lower the high school dropout rate of 50 percent, school officials say.
Ron D. Wright, a black college educator, puts it more bluntly. "Without vocational training in the public schools, we will have unskilled people destined for poverty," said Mr. Wright, who is president of Cincinnati State Technical and Community College, which provides vocational training at the college level for 7,400 students.
The college is housed in a graceful brick building that was a vocational high school until the city dismantled vocational training two decades ago for lack of money. 
"We have an auto shop now and a culinary program and cosmetology," said Steven J. Adamowski, the superintendent of schools, who is white. "But we have not invested in these facilities, and they are weak programs."
Tourism is another sore point. Cincinnati is a Midwestern center for conventions, and a summer jazz festival draws tens of thousands of black tourists. With some city financing, the African-American Chamber of Commerce organized a street fair in 1997 to channel the energies of black young people idling downtown during the jazz festival. The fair, known as the Ujima Festival, still gets city money, and many of its vendors are black. But black leaders say none of the hotels, restaurants and service companies that benefit from tourism are owned by blacks.
The founder of the African-American Chamber, James Clingman, a journalist, is campaigning to use part of the local tax on Cincinnati hotel rooms to develop black enterprises in the tourist industry.
"I think certain folks downtown are not comfortable with the message of black economic empowerment, which ultimately means spend more among your own people, and white folks get less," Mr. Clingman said.
Dividing the economic pie is a frequent theme in the debate over how to raise black residents' incomes and living standards. While many black leaders call for economic empowerment through greater support for black-owned companies that hire black workers, Mr. Pepper and other executives take a different approach. They emphasize education, infant care, housing, job training, mentoring and the like as necessary preparation.
"I come back to the enormous importance of early childhood," Mr. Pepper said, "of getting 10,000 families into early childhood programs, providing prenatal care all the way to Head Start and into the schools, so that children are reading by age 5 and don't enter school behind by two years." 
Corporate Cincinnati gives generously to this preparation and to help feed and house the poor in the meantime. United Way and Community Chest raise nearly $10 million a year for an array of support programs, and the city's big corporations give millions more.
But if philanthropy has eased the economic pain, the riverfront project has in some ways intensified it. The struggle is not unique to Cincinnati. To lure companies and jobs, corporate leaders here and in other American cities have invested heavily in downtown revival. But while the poorest residents are bunched downtown, job growth tends to be greatest in the suburbs, which are hard to reach on mass transit. In Cincinnati, Fifth Third Bank deals with this frustration by arranging special bus runs for low-wage employees at a new suburban processing center.
Greater Cincinnati consists of 13 counties, the most populous being Hamilton. That county's population of 845,000 is 23.4 percent black, while only 2.9 percent of the 1.1 million people in the 12 other counties are black, according to the Census Bureau. Although greater Cincinnati's overall unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, Hamilton County's is twice as high. And in Over-the-Rhine, next door to the glittering downtown, unemployment is more than 10 percent.
In a small way, Ms. Butler is trying to redress the imbalance. For a payment from Hamilton County of $492,000 over four years, she has compiled a database of 700 black-owned companies and now spends her days trying to steer construction jobs their way. She has arranged contracts for drywall installation, painting, electrical work and air-conditioning. And from a $22 million package, she carved out a $5 million portion for DAG Construction to do concrete work, excavation and trucking.
"If you are going to award $22 million packages, of course my companies will not get involved," she said. "But if you find ways to match the package to what they can do, it works."

HEADLINE: Politely, Tastefully, A Club Hits 25; 
Doubles, a Safe Haven For the City's Old Guard

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM NORWICH 

 BODY:
It may not have a golf course, but Manhattan does have a country club of sorts: Doubles, a redoubtable red-decorated private club in the belly of the Sherry Netherland Hotel at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue.
 "Doubles is an institution," said Wendy Norban Carduner, chairwoman of the board, who has nurtured the nonprofit club since its inception. 
 In an age when restaurants and clubs pop up and then fade like mushrooms, Doubles' longevity, members say, can be attributed to its old-fashioned values. "Staying the course, being consistent, maintaining and supporting a philosophy that isn't threatened by trend, wanting people to be comfortable, never being snobbish, having all kinds of members, really, all kinds, contributes to our success," Mrs. Carduner said. 
The philosophy includes reasonable prices (the fixed-price lunch is $23) and a dress code. For the men, this means jackets and ties. For the women, unwritten rules apply: hairdo crowns and helmets the color of decorative hothouse lemons, and suits, mostly. In some cases, the shoes and bags match.
Mrs. Carduner was pondering white flowers and music by Peter Duchin and his orchestra as the club was preparing to celebrate its 25th anniversary with a dinner-dance this evening. The party will honor Pat Buckley, Mica Ertegun, Nan Kempner, Pat Patterson, Harry Platt and Tom Pulling, who were among Doubles' founding members.
Over the years, Doubles has changed to suit the times and satisfy the inclinations of its members. "New York reinvents itself every 10 years," said Paul Wilmot, a public relations executive and frequent guest. "Some of Doubles' original members have moved on. They defected to Mortimer's years ago, and now Swifty's. Of course, these aren't private clubs."
Chappy Morris, a member whose family has the oldest racing colors in the United States, said the club is a traditional bastion in a helter-skelter age. "Doubles fills a niche," he said. "It is an old guard kind of place indigenous to a sense of native New York, genteel, and rooted in traditions of the past."
But it was not intended to be stuffy like the Union Club, or overly meritocratic like the Century Club. "We used to be a supper club," said Mrs. Carduner. "Now Doubles is a family-style dining club along English lines." 
Named after the doubling cube used for betting in backgammon, Doubles began with a gala preview party on Dec. 17, 1975. Approximately 800 members paid a $1,000 initiation fee plus annual dues of $200. When it opened, in 1976, lunch cost $7. Dinner was $10. 
The club now has about 2,300 members. The current initiation fee is $6,000 with annual dues of $920 (fees are lower for younger members). New members must be proposed and seconded by two current members of the club. In addition, prospects are asked to provide a list of about 10 friends who are club members. Mrs. Carduner interviews all the prospects.
"We look for people who understand Doubles," Mrs. Carduner said, smoothing the folds in her black, belted Valentino dress. "Who dress appropriately and whose guests will dress appropriately and, most importantly, will behave appropriately and treat the staff politely. Polite is good. I like polite. I respond to polite." 
In the mid-1970's, when Doubles opened, New York was suffering from a major recession and a major crime wave. At the preview party for Doubles in 1975, Diane Von Furstenberg told a reporter she always wore an "I Love New York" button when she traveled to other cities. "I think New York needs a place like this," she said then, "because New York needs help."
Nina Griscom, a founding member of the club's junior committee in 1976, said the club provided a safe harbor. "Doubles was a great place to bring a date," she recalled. "Your friends were there, so you felt sort of chaperoned, and the staff treated women as equals to men. That was thanks to Wendy. 
"Another reason Doubles was so popular in those pre-Studio 54 days," Ms. Griscom added, "was because there wasn't much going on downtown. People used to be afraid of downtown."
The lunch and dinner crowds have changed over the years. Nan Kempner finds that she doesn't lunch as much as she used to. "Times change, and one changes one's habits," she said. "Doubles is ancient by New York's standards. Now my children use the club more than I do."
While waiting for his host on a slow Friday, a visitor was surprised to find that even if one declined a beverage, formally attired waiters brought glasses of water to people waiting in the bar area of the club. "I don't like empty table tops," a waiter said. 
A distinguished man in a fine old tweed jacket extolled the virtues of the Vermeer show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In response, a friend felt compelled to disparage David Hockney, although, he said, Mr. Hockney did once write something about Vermeer and chiaroscuro in The New Yorker.
A young guest waiting at the bar became momentarily frustrated when her mobile phone was unable to connect with its appointed satellite. Few Doubles members mind that cellular service is unreliable this far underground, and the woman was directed to the club's only phone booth.
Rita Delafield Kip, whose family used to own the land known as Kips Bay, and Payne Whitney Middleton, whose family helped establish many of the city's cultural institutions and whose mother, Joan Whitney Payson, once owned the Mets, arrived for luncheon. About three years ago, Mrs. Kip and Mrs. Middleton gave a dinner-dance at the club to celebrate 50 years of friendship dating from their debutante days on the New York social circuit.
"It was so exciting in the first days of Doubles," Mrs. Middleton said. "You only saw people you knew. That really is the best kind of fun you can have." 
Mrs. Kip, who was visiting from Nantucket, Mass., where she lives most of the year, said, "The club casts a wider net now. 
"There are lots of new people here," observed Mrs. Kip. "They are younger, mostly, and have new money." She said the new people looked "crisp."
Mrs. Middleton, who also likes to have lunch at the Colony Club on Park Avenue, said, "If we run into friends we know today it will be a nice dividend. 
"We don't talk about social climbing," Mrs. Middleton added. "I find the subject tiresome. I always say about social climbing that, in America at least, no matter how many generations your people have been here, somewhere, someone in your family has been a social climber. So, never mind."
Along with the new people, a new attitude has changed Doubles. "For one thing," Mrs. Carduner said, "people are more health conscious." (Doubles' chef, Steven Mellina, avoids reductions, because he believes that the high concentration of amino acids disturbs the digestion.)
The club is also soberer. "Drinking habits have changed dramatically," Mrs. Carduner said. "With the competition on Wall Street from younger people versus how it was in 1976, sleeping habits have changed. At dinner, the witching hour used to be 2 a.m. Now it is 11 p.m. And 25 years ago, not nearly as many women worked. Now it is quite common for a wife to turn to her husband and say, 'Sweetheart, I have a 7 a.m. meeting, let's go home.' "
Mrs. Carduner greeted Nancy Holmes, an original member of Doubles. Mrs. Holmes's guests for lunch included Phyllis Redstone, the estranged wife of Sumner Redstone; Randall Jones, the chief executive and founder of Worth Media; and the novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford and her husband, Robert Bradford. 
Mrs. Bradford wore a white pantsuit made by her tailor in London, shoes from Mancini, "where everyone goes to in New York," and a pashmina shawl she received for Christmas from Mila Mulroney, wife of the former prime minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney. 
Mrs. Bradford read the label. "It isn't endangered," she said, and laughed. "It is a mixture of this and that."

HEADLINE: For China-Born U.S. Citizens, Visiting Homeland Has Risks 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 30 

 BODY:
Over the last six months, the State Security Ministry has started detaining American citizens born in China and questioning them about their affairs in China in what diplomats believe is a worrisome change in government policy.
 It is the first time since the Korean War that American citizens have been held by China's State Security apparatus, diplomats and China experts said. 
 Since late last year, six American citizens -- none of them prominent critics of China -- have been questioned and detained for varying lengths of time by State Security, a secretive ministry charged with ferreting out threats to China's national security, largely those from abroad. The group includes businessmen, writers and academics. Two, Li Shaomin, a professor of marketing at the City University of Hong Kong, and Wu Jianmin, a freelance journalist, are still in custody, apparently on suspicion of espionage, although there have been no official charges. 
A number of Chinese citizens with permanent residency status in the United States have also been held, a Western diplomat here said. But he added that it was harder to keep track of this group, since the Chinese government is under no obligation to report such detentions and American officials have no right to assist green card holders under current consular agreements with China.
The diplomat added that it was "certainly possible" that other detentions had occurred, particularly those lasting under four days, the time at which China is obliged to report detentions of American citizens to embassy officials here. 
"It was only in December last year that we became aware that there was a shift in the way Chinese authorities are dealing with this group," the diplomat said. "What links them all is that they are of Chinese origin -- although obviously they have settled out of China. All had previously traveled to China, some frequently."
The detentions highlight new government scrutiny of a group that has become prominent in China's business and academic sectors in recent years: Chinese citizens who went to the United States to study in the 1980's and 90's and are now returning in large numbers to work -- often armed with liberal ideas and a foreign passport or green card. 
In part because of the mystery surrounding the detentions, the State Department issued a travel advisory last month urging American citizens and green card holders originally born in China "to carefully evaluate their risk of being detained," even if they have traveled to China many times before without a problem. 
It suggests that people who have had links to Taiwan or who have "engaged in activities critical of Chinese policies" should take special care.
Diplomats and scholars both here and abroad say they are unsure exactly what has prompted the shift, although they note that it comes at a relative low point in American-China relations. Many point out that the current spate started around the time that a high-ranking officer in the Chinese Army defected to the United States, greatly embarrassing China's security forces.
One Chinese source, who provided information on condition of anonymity, said that a state blacklist of undesirable foreigners, which once contained a few dozen names, had recently been expanded to 273, and that most of the additions are people born in China who now live overseas. 
The source said several of those who had been detained were on the list, which tended to aim at people who had a history of contacts with Taiwan -- which China considers a breakaway province -- or people who were suspected of publicly discussing delicate information about political or military affairs in China. 
Gao Zhan, a green card holder who has been charged with espionage, is a sociologist affiliated with American University who specializes in women's issues and had attended conferences in Taiwan -- although the Chinese government has not said what activities led to the spying charge. Nearly 400 China specialists from around the world have signed a letter protesting her arrest. 
But others in detention, like Qin Guangguang, a green card holder charged by State Security with leaking state secrets, was a businessman, according to acquaintances.
Another possible reason behind the detentions is that China's leaders have repeatedly urged the country's police to be tougher on crime in the last half year. And that has included specific admonitions from President Jiang Zemin himself to be more vigilant about possible incursions by hostile foreign forces.
Other scholars speculate that some of the detentions may be linked to the publication abroad last winter of "The Tiananmen Papers," said to be a collection of secret documents from the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
But the government has offered little information to clarify exactly what offenses this group of obscure American citizens and green card holders are supposed to have committed. China's state secrets law is vaguely defined, and when charges involve state secrets, those detained lose many of formal rights granted others, including the right to see a lawyer.
"It's really scary, because no one understands what it is about," said a green card holder who is teaching at a prominent Chinese university. He said some prominent academics were fretting that "the State Security Bureau is turning into the K.G.B."
Dai Qing, a writer and social critic here, said, "They never define what counts as a state secret, so lots of people worry they could be at risk."
Western academics now working in China -- all of whom insisted on anonymity -- expressed concern that getting research funds from Taiwan might somehow be construed as spying or colluding with hostile forces. Many Chinese specialists now get research funds from Taiwan's Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation, or give papers at conferences in Taiwan.
And Chinese research institutes that once welcomed foreign academics have become skittish about collaborations and risky research topics, Chinese scholars said. At one recent faculty meeting, professors wondered aloud if some foreign scholars who had worked in China in the past had been spies for Taiwan. 
After the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, the United State government granted residence rights to thousands of Chinese students enrolled in American universities.
On the one hand, the Chinese government -- as well as businesses and universities -- is actively courting those overseas Chinese back for their skill and knowledge, offering tax breaks, high salaries and exemptions from the one-child policy if they had two children while living abroad.
Returnees form the backbone of American multinational corporations in China and serve as top professors at some of China's most prestigious universities. In one study, 25 percent of returnees said they had brought technology back with them -- technology that China desperately needs in its rush to modernize its economy.
On the other hand, the returnees constitute an influential and growing liberal force in Chinese society, people who are used to living in a democracy and often inclined to speak their mind. 
The latest crop of Chinese-born scholars -- mostly now in their 40's -- have often retained close ties with friends and family in China, some of whom are now fairly senior officials. And in a country where personal relationships open many doors, they have used their "guanxi" -- connections -- to get their hands on documents and statistics that probably would be inaccessible to true outsiders, often having a dramatic effect on fields like diplomatic history.
"There has been an outpouring of information in some fields, and the majority of new studies are being done by people originally from the mainland," said a professor of political science in Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Men's Retailer Moe Ginsburg Is to File for Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Moe Ginsburg, the Flatiron district institution long known as a no-frills retailer of quality men's clothing, plans to seek bankruptcy protection today, its president, Paul Ginsburg, said yesterday.
 The store, situated at 21st Street and Fifth Avenue since the early 1970's, has been struggling in recent months because of the economic downturn, layoffs on Wall Street, and the trend toward casual business wear, Mr. Ginsburg said. About 14 of its 50 employees have been laid off, he said. 
 In 1998, the store embarked on a multimillion-dollar makeover. Concrete walls were replaced with cherry and walnut paneling, and luxury labels like Joseph Abboud and Hugo Boss began appearing on the racks, while brands sold only at discount stores were discontinued. Mr. Ginsburg described the changes as "the right move at the wrong time" but denied that the upgrade had cost the store customers. "We gained far more new customers than we lost," he said.
Under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the store would remain open while a reorganization plan was put in place, Mr. Ginsburg said. "We hope to exit this process within six months to a year, and to exit in a more healthy and vital way than when we went in," Mr. Ginsburg said.
Mr. Ginsburg comes from a long line of clothiers. His great-grandfather sold clothes from a wagon in Russia, and his grandfather, Jacob, owned a clothing store in East New York, Brooklyn, where Moe Ginsburg, Paul's father, began working at 11. Moe Ginsburg founded his own store in East New York and then spent 15 years manufacturing men's clothing before he opened Moe Ginsburg, Men's Better Clothing in the mid-1960's.
In recent years, men's retailing has become increasingly competitive, with discount stores like Men's Wearhouse advertising heavily on radio and on television, said Benjamin Fox, a broker at Newmark New Spectrum Retail.
"You have a very aggressive company versus one that has been steeped in tradition," Mr. Fox said.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs; 
Low-Tech Democracy

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana 

 BODY:
The information revolution has come to Africa, and last December it had a direct impact on bringing about the first-ever peaceful transition from one elected civilian government to another in Ghana. This was a hugely important political event for West Africa, but it got lost in America's post-election ruckus. Ghana's turnabout would not have happened, though, without the information revolution here. Thank the Lord for the information revolution. You gotta love technology. Oh, I'm not talking about the Internet. I'm talking about FM radio.
 That's right, a simple transistor radio and a couple of batteries did the trick. In 1995 Ghana's previous government, led by Jerry Rawlings, gave up its monopoly on the airwaves and permitted the establishment of private FM radio stations. Since then, more than 40 have cropped up around Ghana, broadcasting in both English and native Ghanaian languages. They play local music, read their own news and, most important, offer hours and hours of live talk radio, where Ghanaians can tell the government and each other whatever's on their minds. 
 For Ghana's poor, illiterate masses, being able to call the radio, or be interviewed in the market by a radio reporter with a tape recorder, has given them a chance to participate in politics as never before. It was this national conversation, conducted over FM radio, that was critical in enabling J. A. Kufuor, a free-market democrat, to defeat Mr. Rawlings's tired, floundering party, which had run Ghana into the ground during 20 years in office.
"Everyone knew that Mr. Rawlings's wife, if she didn't like a program on our state-owned station, could just order it off the air," Said Yawowusu Addo, the director of the state-run radio GBC. "No one could do that with the private stations. When people saw something, they just called in with the news. These FM radios helped us liberate ourselves. The public found their voice. The politicians could all hear ordinary people talking about the problems -- corruption, unemployment. People were fed up and they told each other, and they told Rawlings."
Ghana is divided into 10 provinces. Eight of them have flourishing private FM stations, two don't. Mr. Kufuor won the eight provinces where there were FM stations, and Mr. Rawlings's party won the two that had no private stations. Not an accident.
Indeed, the FM stations were critical in making sure that Ghana's election was not stolen by the Rawlings team. Ghanaians going to the polls would call their local FM station if they saw any shenanigans, and it would be broadcast in seconds. The radios were monitored by the election board and it would quickly respond.
"On the day of the elections there was a polling station in Accra where soldiers started destroying voting boxes," recalled Joseph Ebo Quarshie, president of the Ghana Bar Association. "Immediately, someone called an FM station and it was reported on the air. I was at my bank at the time. A guy walks up to me, a pharmacist I know, and says, 'Have you heard what's going on at this polling station in Accra? What is the Bar Association doing about it?' So I got in my car and turned on SKY FM. Minutes later I got a call from JOY FM. I told them to call me back in a few minutes. Meanwhile, I got a copy of the Constitution. JOY FM called me back and I read over the radio the article in the Constitution which says that citizens had the right to resist interference in a polling station. JOY FM kept playing my interview over and over. A couple of hours later the soldiers were chased off by voters." 
Now that the elections are over, the FM radio stations, which are all run by young Ghanaians who were either educated or had worked in the West, are playing an important role in forcing transparency on the new government. "The minute people were able to talk freely -- and anonymously -- on the radio, and ask what officials were up to, was the beginning of accountability for government in Ghana," said Nana Akufo-Addo, the new minister of justice.
Fact: The four most democratic countries in West Africa today -- Benin, Ghana, Mali and Senegal -- all have private, flourishing FM talk radio stations. Sure, all of Africa will get the Internet one day, but for now, the real information revolution here will be based on cheap FM transmitters and even cheaper radios. So let's stop sending Africa lectures on democracy. Let's instead make all aid, all I.M.F.-World Bank loans, all debt relief conditional on African governments' permitting free FM radio stations. Africans will do the rest.

HEADLINE: River's Power Aids California And Enriches the Northwest 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN

DATELINE: GEORGE, Wash. 

 BODY:
Doing something nice for California has never been a priority here in the Columbia River Basin, where high-voltage power lines lope across irrigated fields of alfalfa, potatoes and wheat.
 Politicians from California, as farmers in this area will explain at great length, have been scheming for decades to siphon off the basin's cheap electricity and water. 
 Californians, however, have been noticeably less irritating as of late. Having fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from Sunday, they are skidding into the summer air-conditioning season desperately short of power. In the last year, much of their salvation has come from the Columbia River, whose monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America. 
All along the river, from Portland, Ore., to British Columbia, utility companies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save California -- but at a staggering price. Charging whatever California's dysfunctional power market will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have created a kind of Kuwait along the Columbia.
With their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the emptiness of Eastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel generators to make still more power and paying Wall Street-style wages to electricity traders -- while making sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North America. Just north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned utility luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to 1.6 million customers.
Their good fortune, though, has come with a measure of ambivalence and may well be short-lived. A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the region. If it continues, utilities along the river will have to buy power and may be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall.
"This is not nice money," said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. "It is something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their air-conditioners."
Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin.
North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly owned utility that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year than it ever had before. With just 35,000 local customers, the utility last year had a $58.2 million profit. It paid its two top power traders $285,000 each, an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less than $25,000 a year. The utility refuses to reveal the traders' names for fear their children might be kidnapped. 
The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were "huge" and "obscene." But the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added, "We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners."
Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that also owns two dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market. It had a record $88.8 million in profits last year -- more than double its best previous year.
Grant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000 retail customers, is using its windfall to help build a $70 million fiber optic network for local residents. It has also bought 20 diesel generators to guard against power shortages and, if possible, exploit the power gold-rush. The utility estimates that those generators could add $50 million to profits in the coming year.
Like Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity, when, as now, local needs exceed generating capacity in the river. Power rates in Grant and Chelan Counties are about one-fifth as much as in New York City.
Grant County's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea of giving a share of its profits to its customers. 
"How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people are paying more for electricity?" asked Lon Topaz, director of resource management for the utility. "It would be lousy politics."

An Upside-Down Economy
The second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined with California's deregulation mess to further distort the energy market. Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sold on the spot market -- 10 to 20 times as much as last year's price -- it has strengthened a compelling bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every megawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in, long-term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sent south to California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings and a long-distance bonanza.
As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower has been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to $440 an acre not to farm. 
Similarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion this year by not making aluminum. Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight Wall Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by reselling hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990's under a cheap long-term contract.
Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars from the power crunch. Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its customers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do not use, if their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last year's level. 
For utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from California's electricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia. A number of private American utilities have also benefited from California's troubles. 
BC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and Peace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history of the province to exceed $1 billion in profits, as measured in Canadian currency ($712 million in United States currency).
To celebrate, the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it had never done before. The utility mailed each of its customers a check for $130. BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates, which have not gone up for seven years.
"We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were built by people of great foresight," said Brian R. D. Smith, chairman of BC Hydro.
When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System Operator, which runs that state's power grid, accused BC Hydro of market manipulation and profit gouging, Mr. Smith was less happy.
"All they do is scream and shout and they won't pay you the money they owe you," he said, arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help California in its hour of need. Gouging has nothing to do with it, he said, adding that it was California's "awful mess" in deregulating power markets that fueled BC Hydro's record profits.

A Good Deal for Farmers
In the beginning, that is to say when federal money began transforming the Columbia from the world's premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable lakes, no one paid much attention to electricity. The river possessed a third of America's hydroelectric potential, but there were not enough people in the Northwest to use more than a fraction of it, and long-distance high-voltage transmission lines did not exist.
The main intention, when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in the 1930's, was to create family farms. Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam in North America and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily designed as a water-delivery device for farmers.
Since then, as 6,000 miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to shuttle water around in sagebrush country, each 960-acre farm in the Columbia Basin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least $2.1 million in federal infrastructure subsidies, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, which built it.
In addition, farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out of the river -- at $1.50 a megawatt. A megawatt of electricity currently sells for $375 to $400 on the spot market. As Paul Pitzer, a Columbia Basin historian, has written, farmers here have always felt that "no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill."
This year, though, the price finally became unbearably high for the Bonneville Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that markets electricity from 29 federal dams on river. The agency calculated that if it could persuade farmers in the project not to irrigate 90,000 acres of land, water left in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as $129 million (if it had to be purchased at current market prices).
In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville is paying 800 farmers a total of $30 million. The farmers receive $330 for each acre they do not farm. On top of that, Grant County's public utility is paying many of the same farmers about $100 an acre not to farm their land.
On April 13, about 20 irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe here in George to discuss the buyout. Since farm prices are low this year, they agreed that it was a good deal.
Still, the farmers, who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies that keep their irrigation system afloat, said they worried about the precedent they set when they traded water for cash.
"This has to be a temporary deal," said Tom Flynt, 52, who normally farms 900 acres but has taken 150 acres out of production because of the buyout. "If anybody thought this would affect their water rights, there would be no takers."
Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting the lifestyles of urban people, especially Californians, who, those who were interviewed said, do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their table.
"We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full," said Tricia C. Lubach, a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation farmer. "Not too long ago they didn't worry about where the power comes from. Someday they may think about where the food comes from."

A 'Wonderful Energy Fit'
A couple of hundred miles northwest of George, in a penthouse conference room that overlooks Vancouver harbor, Mr. Smith, the chairman of British Columbia's most profitable company, explained in mid-April what a pain it was selling electricity to Californians.
"People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful Californians," he said. It does not help, he added, that the state is behind on its bills by about $300 million.
Still, neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose California's money. The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial budget, which in the last decade has received more than $3.7 billion from BC Hydro.
"We have a wonderful energy fit," Mr. Smith said, referring to BC Hydro's power-trading relationship with California, if not to Californians themselves. "We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high demand, and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us."
BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell power when it is most needed -- and most expensive -- in California. The utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer, storing water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap off-peak power brought from across the West. In the morning, when prices peak, it opens the faucets and zaps electricity off to California.
"We spill water during the day," Mr. Smith said. "Why? Is it because we can make more money? No. It's because that is when everybody wants electricity, for God's sake."
Questions about profit gouging on the part of dam-dependent utilities in the Northwest may soon be moot. Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff so far this year to about half of what is considered normal.
The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for natural-gas-fired power plants and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and capacity to generate it.
"Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates," said Paul Norman, head of power operations at Bonneville. 
Unless conservation increases or the drought eases, Mr. Norman warned that by late summer, the Northwest's era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive end.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Vertex Buys Biotechnology Rival for $592 Million

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced yesterday that it would acquire the Aurora Biosciences Corporation for about $592 million in stock, combining two biotechnology companies with expertise in different aspects of developing drugs.
 The deal could presage additional biotechnology mergers, analysts said, as stock prices have sunk and it has become difficult for companies to raise money by selling shares. 
 In addition, many biotechnology companies specialize in one technology out of many needed to develop drugs, making it hard to build a business without merging. Companies might seek to merge to take advantage of the potential gold mine of information made available by the sequencing of the human genetic code -- one factor behind yesterday's deal. 
"We are going to seize as much of this ground as we can," Joshua Boger, chairman and chief executive of Vertex, said in an interview. "This is not something we can come back to in 20 years. The fun will all be over."
Aurora shareholders will get 0.62 share of newly issued Vertex stock for each Aurora share held. Based on Friday's closing price, that would mean a price of $24.34 per Aurora share, a 44 percent premium.
Yesterday, Aurora's shares shot up $6.35, or nearly 38 percent, to $23.20. Vertex's shares slipped 69 cents, or about 1.8 percent, to $38.56.
Executives at the two companies said they hoped to create a drug discovery powerhouse combining complementary technologies. 
"It's almost as if we met on a road at an intersection," Dr. Boger said, "and were going in the same direction." 
Aurora, based in San Diego, has technology for studying the effects of drugs on living cells and is working with companies like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer. Vertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., has experience in the chemistry of designing drugs.
By becoming a part of Vertex, Aurora will gain expertise in developing drugs from start to finish. Vertex already has one drug on the market, an AIDS treatment called Agenerase that it helps GlaxoSmithKline sell. It also has 12 drugs in or close to starting clinical trials.
The deal could be perceived as a step back for Vertex, toward becoming a technology company rather than a drug company. But Dr. Boger said Aurora's technology would speed Vertex's drug development and its efforts in genomics. Rather than focusing on genes for particular diseases, Vertex is studying families of genes and associated proteins that might play a role in numerous diseases, an approach that it believes offers economies of scale. 
With financing from Novartis, Vertex has focused on a family of more than 500 proteins known as kinases, which are involved in transferring signals within cells. Now it will gain access to a similar program at Aurora that is concentrating on two other families of proteins involved in cell signaling.
Aurora will become a subsidiary of Vertex but will keep its name. The unit will be led by Harry Stylli, currently senior vice president for commercial development. Stuart J. M. Collinson, Aurora's chairman, chief executive and president, will join Vertex's board but will not have a day-to-day role in the company.
Scott Greenstone, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in New York, said Vertex "got a good price" for Aurora, whose shares sold for more than $100 last August. Mr. Greenstone also said the deal was good for both companies. "The sum of the parts will be better than each one alone," he said.
Aurora, which was founded in 1995, was profitable last year but is now operating at break even as it has shifted from supplying technology to trying to develop drugs. Vertex, begun in 1989, is not profitable.

HEADLINE: More Care, More Resources 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The article "As Technology Improves, More People Breathe With Machines" (April 24) details the economic pressures that health care institutions and clinicians labor under when caring for patients on ventilators.
As a physician observing the treatment of my own father since August, I know that many such patients risk developing complications and need a high level of care best provided in hospitals. 
 The current reimbursement system demoralizes all concerned and creates situations in which such care for patients can be rationalized as meaningless. 
 But even people who are severely debilitated and on ventilators can have meaningful lives with hospital-level care. As America ages, we run the risk of becoming a society that treats some lives as more equal than others unless the reimbursement system is changed to provide more resources rather than less.

HEADLINE: Packed Alabama Jails Draw Ire of Courts Again 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ala., April 26 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, a federal judge walked through the doors of the Morgan County Jail in this tidy riverfront city and observed firsthand what happens when 256 inmates are crammed into a jail built for 96.
 He stepped around scores of inmates that the state prisons had refused to take. Most were sleeping on the floor next to toilets and on top of shower drains, because they had no beds. He saw the cells that no one cleaned and the linens that no one washed. He breathed the fetid air that the prisoners breathed and saw the small portions of unsanitary food that they ate. 
 Last week the judge, U. W. Clemon, wrote a blistering ruling ordering the state prisoners removed by mid-May and the jail cleaned. Judge Clemon's strong language has shaken up one of the country's most overburdened corrections systems. 
"To say the Morgan County Jail is overcrowded is an understatement," he wrote. "The sardine-can appearance of its cell units more nearly resemble the holding units of slave ships during the Middle Passage of the 18th century than anything in the 21st century."
More than 11 percent of the state's 27,000 prisoners are in county jails. Though it costs Alabama $26 a day to keep an inmate in a state prison, the state pays counties only $1.75 per meal to house its prisoners, the judge noted. Holding inmates in county jails saves the state more than $70,000 a day. 
The Department of Corrections "thus has a substantial financial incentive to leave its state prisoners on the barren concrete floors of the Morgan County Jail," Judge Clemon wrote.
His ruling was the latest in a series of federal court orders going back 30 years that have tried to improve conditions in the prisons and jails of Alabama, which has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, 571 per 100,000 people. . The pattern has become familiar: a court orders prisoners freed; the state grudgingly builds more prison beds; the problem recedes until the inmate population builds again and a new court has to step in.
But this time, lawmakers and prison experts say, the problem may have reached its most serious level. Alabama's rate of incarceration has risen unabated as the Legislature has increased drug penalties and reduced parole. The number of state prisoners -- most of them nonviolent drug offenders -- has grown sevenfold since 1970, and the prison population has been rising by 130 prisoners a month.
Only four states -- Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Mississippi -- and the District of Columbia have higher rates of incarceration, but though county jails in other states also have been crowded, few of the states have had a problem as widespread or as long-running as Alabama's. The low-tax state has always been among the nation's poorest, and a decline in revenue has made it hard to find money for new prisons or alternative programs.
Judges are getting angry, and even county sheriffs are threatening legal action if their jail populations are not reduced. In Birmingham on Wednesday, Sheriff Jim Woodward of Jefferson County said he would try to have the state corrections commissioner, Michael W. Haley, cited for contempt for leaving state prisoners in his jail.
In December, four judges in Houston County threatened to order 118 state prisoners taken from the jail and chained to the fence of the state prison if the state did not accept them. When other judges around Alabama started praising the idea, the state quickly found room for 1,000 prisoners.
But as unventilated county jails continue to fill up, some people in corrections say they fear violence or other hazards as the summer's heat approaches.
"It's becoming a dangerous situation," said Allen L. Tapley, executive director of the Sentencing Institute, a private research group in Montgomery that is a paid consultant to state government on justice issues.
Tamara Serwer, a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights, an Atlanta legal center that took the Morgan County case to Judge Clemon, said the group would continue its work in other counties with crowded jails.
Inmates are supposed to be transferred from a jail to a state prison within 30 days of being sentenced, but often that transfer never happens. Ms. Serwer said many prisoners were kept for months in the small jails, which were not built for long-term incarceration.
Morgan County's 25-year-old jail was all but condemned in September by the state fire marshal, who found in an inspection that the fire alarm and smoke detectors were not working, that there was no sprinkler system and that the building was so crowded that inmates and guards were in danger. There have been several small fires in the jail in the last year, the marshal noted.
Sheriff Stephen L. Crabbe, who is responsible for the jail, refused to discuss the issue or let a reporter inside, citing the advice of his lawyer. But several inmates working outside the jail this week said the reports did not go far enough in describing conditions inside.
"It's a hellhole in there," said one inmate, who would not give his name. "You can't move, and you don't want to breathe."
Inmates said the mattresses that the judge saw were provided a few days before his tour. Before that, many inmates had to sleep on concrete, they said.
Judge Clemon spent several pages detailing the violations of the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment that he found, including inattention to medical needs. Finally, he accused the State Department of Corrections of being "deliberately indifferent" to conditions in the jail because it was so eager to save money.
In his opinion, the judge said the state prison system had unused beds, despite the department's insistence that it was full. The most recent statistics issued by the department showed that its prisons were operating at 97.9 percent of capacity in February, meaning 412 beds were empty. The judge also noted that no inmates in state prisons slept on the floor, and he suggested that they would be better off sleeping on floors in prisons -- or in trailers or tents in prisons -- than in jails.
Commissioner Haley would not agree to be interviewed, but his spokesman, Jack Hamm, said the prison system simply could not take as many inmates as the judge suggested.
"It's not just a matter of putting beds in," Mr. Hamm said. "People need to understand that you have to feed them; you have to launder their clothes and linens; and you have to have the wastewater facilities to handle their showers and needs. The old facilities we have just don't have the physical plants to handle everyone."
The department also has a serious shortage of corrections officers, because of the job's low pay and unattractive image, Mr. Hamm said. (The system has one officer for every 12 inmates, compared with a national average of one for four inmates, and the shortage has been blamed for the escape of six prisoners from a maximum-security prison in January.) Although the commissioner has repeatedly asked the Legislature for money for new prisons, Mr. Hamm said, none has been forthcoming. This year's budget does include an increase for more corrections officers.
Legislators said they wanted to build more prisons but lacked the money. In February, Gov. Donald Siegelman, a Democrat, cut the state education budget 6.2 percent, citing the economic downturn.
It is hard politically to vote for prisons when schools are crumbling. Education advocates have turned to the courts to force spending for schools, just as prisoner advocates have done to force spending for prisons.
"Yes, we are really in trouble in Alabama," said Senator Jack Biddle III, a Republican who is chairman of the Legislature's Joint Prison Oversight Committee. "Everyone wants all the prisoners locked up forever, but they don't want to spend the money for it or have the prisons in their neighborhood. We're just doing the best we can without any money."
Alabama has the country's lowest per capita state and local tax burden, and it relies heavily on the volatile sales tax. Church groups have repeatedly asked the state to consider changing tax laws to bring in more revenue. In February the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama said the state's property tax rates were "unconscionably low."
Governor Siegelman has often said he would not consider a tax increase, but legislators said there had been informal talks recently about increasing property taxes. One legislator said privately that if judges started releasing prisoners to ease crowding, the public could awaken to the situation.
The state has not used the alternative sentencing methods that many other states use to reduce prison populations. Mr. Tapley of the Sentencing Institute, noting that three-fourths of Alabama's prisoners had been convicted of nonviolent offenses like burglary, said the state needed to build diversion centers and halfway houses like the ones other states had used successfully. Those programs would ultimately cost much less than building prisons, he said.
"This is a solvable problem, once people decide to attack it," Mr. Tapley said. "We can't be the scourge of the nation forever."

BYLINE:  By Timothy Pritchard (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Canada's economy stalled in February, as output dropped 0.1 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in January, but the decline was only half as bad as economists had predicted. 
Manufacturing led gross domestic product down, with a 0.9 percent drop, and production of electrical and electronic equipment fell 9.1 percent, the worst reversal in 40 years. "Major customers, primarily from the United States, continued to curtail spending, sparking significant production cutbacks and layoffs by key Canadian producers," said Statistics Canada, the government's reporting agency. Gains in construction, mining and forestry partly offset the decline in manufacturing. Timothy Pritchard (NYT)

HEADLINE: London Journal; 
To Get the Underground Up to Par, Call on a Yank

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 28 

 BODY:
Even the British caricature that portrays Americans as boorish, loud, blind to nuance, deaf to irony or just plain weird usually includes a grudging good word for their native ability to go out and get the job done.
 While a number of can-do Yanks have ended up in high-profile management jobs in Britain, none have attracted quite so much attention as Robert R. Kiley, 65, the transportation expert brought in to repair London's crumbling bus and subway system. 
 Mr. Kiley is credited by many with rescuing rapid transit networks in Boston and New York, and he was invited here by the city's new mayor, Ken Livingstone, to take on the problem that tops the list of Londoners' complaints about their congested city.
"You are the most important American to come to Britain since Dwight Eisenhower," a British diplomat told Mr. Kiley in a toast at a recent gathering. 
If extravagant, the comparison with the commander in chief of Allied forces in Europe was apt. Like General Eisenhower, Mr. Kiley has also found himself at war.
He is in pitched battle with the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, which eyed him suspiciously on his arrival last fall because he was sponsored by Mr. Livingstone, public enemy No. 1 at No. 10 Downing Street. Mr. Livingstone was evicted from Labor last year after he ran against the party's official mayoral candidate and beat him 3 to 1.
Now it is Mr. Kiley himself who is being demonized, with unidentified ministers leaking quotes to the British press like "those Yanks think they can boss us around," and John Prescott, the deputy prime minister who doubles as the government's transportation chief, deriding his past accomplishments.
In New York on a visit 10 days ago, Mr. Prescott cast a disapproving look at an R train he was boarding at 60th Street and Third Avenue and told British reporters accompanying him that "Kiley should come back to New York and raise it to London standards."
Those standards do not impress Londoners, whose only frame of reference is the sorry state of their once-proud system, the world's oldest. It has suffered from decades of neglect and underfunding and is now dirty, unreliable and subject to maddeningly frequent service breakdowns.
"When I got into this business in the mid-70's the London Underground was thought to be the best transit organization in the world," Mr. Kiley said. "Now I would give top honors to the Paris Metro." 
In Britain, being called less efficient than the Americans is one thing; being called less efficient than the French is something else again.
Mr. Kiley incurred the government's wrath by exposing its London Underground improvement plan as an arrangement that had more to do with satisfying competing bureaucratic interests than running trains safely and on time. 
He called it "fatally flawed" and added, "It has no basis in reality or common sense. It is a dumb proposal, and we are trying to get it back into the land of the sane."
That proved to be a more difficult journey than he imagined. The Blair government enjoys an enormous majority in Parliament, is considered sure to win a new term in the election expected this June and is impatient with criticism. Officials pressed ahead with the disputed plan while Mr. Kiley and a team of past associates from New York and Boston devised an alternative.
The government plan would transfer tracks, signals and stations to three privately owned companies on 30-year contracts while leaving operation of the trains to the publicly run London Underground. 
Mr. Kiley was quick to point out that the fragmented arrangement was remarkably like the one resorted to in the privatization of Britain's railway system, which today is the most expensive and hazardous and least efficient of any in Europe.
When a suburban train crash killed four people last fall, Mr. Kiley suggested that similar accidents would happen under the government's subway plan. And he added that the consequences below ground would be much worse, given the tighter spaces, the larger tonnage of the cars and the smaller headways between trains.
The train crash was the fourth fatal one in the last four years on British trains, and safety on the rails has become a priority issue with the riding public. Mr. Livingstone seized on that, saying of the government plan for the London Underground, "People will die." 
Mr. Kiley commented: "Ken's more flamboyant than me. What I say is you never want to design a scheme that elevates the risk profile as substantially as this one does."
Newspapers have all editorially backed Mr. Kiley -- a rare outbreak of unanimity for the disputatious British press -- and the London public has rallied to his cause, with people on the street stopping him to tell him to keep up the fight. 
On a recent trip through Heathrow Airport, he was surprised by a woman yelling at him from the other side of the terminal. "What you're doing is so important," she shouted. "Why are you going back to the U.S.?" He assured her it was just a quick trip.
There were months of desultory talks through the winter, with Mr. Kiley and his mass transit experts seated across the negotiating table from a group of Treasury officials led by an aide whose expertise is third world debt.
Mr. Kiley argued that without unified management by London Underground, the system would be chaotic and dangerous. The Treasury officials ruled out any change in their formula of divided responsibilities.
The plan, they said, upheld the non-negotiable wish of their chief, Gordon Brown, the powerful chancellor of the Exchequer, to transfer the risk of any cost overruns away from the public purse and onto the private sector.
This month, the pace of the dispute has quickened, and another showdown looms in days. Stymied by the government's refusal to agree to unified management, Mr. Kiley appealed to the High Court, arguing that the government plan denied Mr. Livingstone the means to meet his statutory responsibility to give London a safe, efficient and economic subway. The High Court agreed to a full judicial review of the plan starting on June 12.
The government reacted by announcing that it would pre-emptively name the three operating companies next week. Mr. Prescott issued a statement last Wednesday listing the benefits of the government plan as face lifts for all stations in the near term and new trains on all lines by 2019. 
Mr. Kiley countered the next day, saying that under his plan 85 percent of the trains would be replaced or refurbished by 2009 and new signals and tracks would guarantee safety.
Looking out of his 14th-story office windows at Parliament Square and the government buildings of Whitehall, Mr. Kiley recalled his first trip on the Underground, in October. 
The train he was on stalled for 11 sweltering minutes in a tunnel, and he ended up in a glass-front control booth at the next station watching uniformed workers form a human chain to hold back crowds swarming onto the platform when no trains were arriving to lessen the load.
"I'm saying to the guy who's taking me around: 'Do these people know who we are over here? Do they ever come and start pounding on these windows? Has anyone ever tried to kill you? You know, we wouldn't last very long if this were Times Square.' "

HEADLINE: New Jersey High School Is Winner of Fed Contest 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
A team of students from Montclair High School in New Jersey won first prize and $40,000 today in the sixth annual Fed Challenge, a national competition that tests economic wits.
 The contest, sponsored by the Federal Reserve, required the students to consider economic data, analyze daily financial figures and then argue for a specific monetary policy. The four final teams of five members each were judged on their knowledge of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve and on the quality of their presentations, research and analysis. 
 The $40,000 prize, provided by Citibank, consisted of: a $5,000 scholarship for each team member; $10,000 for their school (to develop an in-school economics lab); and $5,000 for their faculty advisers: Jack Weber, Tom Clifford and Tom Manos. Each of the other three teams received $15,000. 
Although most of the students took economics courses, and some of their schools offered college credits for courses that prepared students for the competition, the Fed Challenge is mainly an extracurricular activity, said Lloyd Bromberg, director of educational programs for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
In some schools, Mr. Bromberg added, the Fed Challenge is treated like an interscholastic sport, with tryouts and weekly practices, research sessions and lectures. 
The Montclair team prepared about four hours each weekday and a few hours each weekend, said Ted Chestnut, a 16-year-old junior on the team. The students said they had relied on newspapers, 24-hour cable networks and the Internet for information and daily financial statistics.
"We got together on snow days, and we prepared through spring break," Mr. Chestnut said.
Another member of the team, Michael Rey, a 17-year-old senior, compared preparations for the Fed Challenge to those required for his baseball team. This year, 10 people competed for three open spots on the team. Mr. Chestnut and Mr. Rey were members of last year's Montclair team, which reached the finals.
Mr. Clifford, an English teacher, said the team members received academic credit for the competition. Prize money for the faculty advisers will be used to support the program at the high school, he said.
In welcoming the students, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, dryly offered some advice.
"Remember," Mr. Greenspan said, "if you are practicing to be a central banker -- you do not smile."
The Fed Challenge was created in 1995 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and became a national competition in 1996. Federal Reserve Banks conduct regional competitions, sending the district winners to the final competition. This year, more than 250 schools took part, with 6 of the 12 Federal Reserve districts represented in Washington. 
Judges for the competition were Laurence H. Meyer, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.; Donald L. Kohn, director of monetary affairs for the Federal Reserve's board of governors; and Arthur J. Rolnick, director of research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

HEADLINE: Rent Board Chief Resigns With Attack on the Mayor 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Facing ouster by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the chairman of the New York City Rent Guidelines Board quit yesterday and unleashed a scathing attack on the mayor.
 The departing chairman, Edward S. Hochman, accused Mr. Giuliani of being "a control freak" who "brow-beat" and "dictated to" the board, treating its members like "messenger boys" and "puppets," all to "advance his political career." 
 Mr. Hochman also said the mayor and his aides had "manipulated the numbers," "tried to get around the law," "bastardized" the rent-setting process and turned it into "a charade," Pausing for a breath, he added: "I hope I'm not mincing words." 
Mr. Giuliani declined to respond to the charges, but he repeated his displeasure at the board for having raised rents last year by one percentage point more than he wanted, granting 4 percent increases for one-year leases and 6 percent for two-year renewals.
"Frankly, we weren't happy," he said. "We had asked that the rent increase not be as high as it was. For some reason, the board passed a higher increase than we thought the economy or the numbers really indicated, which we think did harm to tenants. I would rather have someone that is somewhat more sensitive to all sides."
One reason Mr. Hochman is being replaced is that he expressed a desire not to do the job any longer, Mr. Giuliani said. Mr. Hochman said he had simply sent an annual year-end letter offering to stay or leave, at the mayor's will, and urging that if any replacement were made, it be done quickly. 
The rent board had gathered in Brooklyn yesterday for what was supposed to be a daylong hearing on what increases it should adopt this year for the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments.
Instead, Mr. Hochman began by announcing his resignation and denouncing Mr. Giuliani. He said that after The New York Times reported earlier in the day that the mayor planned to appoint Steven Sinacori as the new chairman, he had called City Hall but could not get a straight answer.
"It gives me no small amount of pleasure to resign," he said.
Stunned, the board adjourned, abandoning the hearing. Tenant and landlord leaders who had come to testify packed up their speeches. Mr. Hochman continued his criticisms in a chain of news interviews lasting two hours.
The events had a surreal feel.
"I can't recall anything like that before," said Kenneth Schaeffer, vice chairman of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenant group. A landlord representative on the board, Vincent Castellano, praised Mr. Hochman and said, "It's bizarre."
Although the board's initial vote on this year's rents is scheduled for next week, the process is now more clouded. Mr. Sinacori is not yet in office -- he is awaiting a background check -- and the mayor is still filling two other board vacancies.
Tenant groups, who often opposed Mr. Hochman during his seven-year tenure, were cautious.
"I'm hoping the new chairman will be less pro-landlord, but this new guy could be just as bad," said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition.
As an appointed chairman, Mr. Hochman said, he had tried to reflect the mayor's view.
"I introduced his proposal for 3 percent and 5 percent," he said. "But nobody voted for it -- so why did he replace me?"
The rent board is supposed to be independent, but Mr. Hochman said Mr. Giuliani had exerted growing pressure, especially when he was preparing to run for the Senate. 
"Last year was outrageous, unconscionable," Mr. Hochman said. "The mayor's deputy chief of staff took us into a back room and tried to browbeat us with: 'the mayor wants this,' 'the mayor wants that,' 'we don't care what your reports say, this is what we want,' blah, blah.
"For us to go through all this and have the mayor's office attempt to dictate the outcome for political purposes is outrageous. The pretense of having an objective process is out the window."
Of the new board members, Mr. Hochman said: "They don't need to come up to speed; they'll just call Robert Harding, and he'll tell them how to vote." Mr. Harding is a deputy mayor.

HEADLINE: CHENEY PROMOTES INCREASING SUPPLY AS ENERGY POLICY 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney said today that oil, coal and natural gas would remain the United States' primary energy resources for "years down the road" and that the Bush administration's energy strategy would aim mainly to increase supply of fossil fuels, rather than limit demand. 
 In his most comprehensive comments to date on the energy task force he is heading on behalf of President Bush, Mr. Cheney dismissed as 1970's-era thinking the notion that "we could simply conserve or ration our way out" of what he called an energy crisis. 
 The only solution, he said, is a government-backed push to find new domestic sources of oil and gas, including in protected areas of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and an all-out drive to build power plants -- a need that he says will require one new electricity-generating plant a week for 20 years. 
"America's reliance on energy, and fossil fuels in particular, has lately taken on an urgency not felt since the late 1970's," Mr. Cheney said. "Without a clear, coherent energy strategy, all Americans could one day go through what Californians are experiencing now, or worse."
Mr. Cheney, who ran the oil-services company Halliburton Inc. before becoming vice president, offered a supply-oriented energy philosophy that seems likely to dominate the report the cabinet-level task force is expected to issue as early as mid-May. The report is expected to recommend legislation, executive actions and incentives for the private sector.
The vice president's comments, delivered to the annual meeting of The Associated Press in Toronto, seemed partly a combative response to Democrats and environmentalists who argue that the Bush administration has used California's electricity shortages as a pretext to enact energy policies that have been favored by industry executives for many years. 
In discussing their energy plans recently, administration officials have put the most emphasis on opening protected lands to oil and gas exploration, while rolling back environmental rules that inhibit the burning of coal and the construction of pipelines and refineries. They have also strongly advocated the use of nuclear power.
Critics have faulted the administration for moving quickly to abandon a treaty on global warming and rejecting controls on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, steps Mr. Bush said were vital because of energy shortages. The administration has also come under withering criticism for delaying stricter standards on arsenic in drinking water.
Mr. Cheney said today that environmentalists had taken things too far. He said a recent television advertisement showing a child asking for more arsenic in her water was a "cheap shot."
Drastic measures to increase energy supplies are justified, he said, because the geometry of supply and demand curves are so alarming. He estimated that the country needed 38,000 miles of new pipelines to carry natural gas, covering the distance of Maine to California more than 12 times over.
Coal, Mr. Cheney said, has been neglected. It is the United States' "most plentiful source of affordable energy." He said people who sought to phase out its use, largely because they considered it a major source of air pollution, "deny reality."
He said the most environmentally friendly way to increase energy supplies was to extend the life of existing nuclear plants and grant permits to build new ones, because they had no emissions of greenhouse gases. 
"We can safeguard the environment by making greater use of the cleanest methods of power generation we know," he said, speaking of nuclear power. "If we are serious about environmental protection, then we must seriously question the wisdom of backing away from what is, as a matter of record, a safe, clean and very plentiful energy source."
Utility industry executives have applauded the administration's support of nuclear power, but questioned the economic viability of building new nuclear power plants anytime soon. Environmentalists dispute Mr. Cheney's contention that nuclear power is the cleanest source of energy because they say the mining and enriching of uranium and the storage of nuclear waste are hazards.
Mr. Cheney indicated that the administration would put some emphasis on energy efficiency. New technology -- like computer screens that use far less power and energy-efficient light bulbs -- have an important role because they can save energy without reducing living standards, he said. But he said he would oppose any measure based on the premise that Americans now "live too well" or that people should "do more with less."
"The aim here is efficiency, not austerity," he said. "Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy."
Some people who have talked with administration officials about the energy plan expect that the policy will include some tax-related measures to promote efficiency. Among those considered most likely are tax credits for people who buy fuel-efficient automobiles and for power companies that produce electricity using renewable energy sources.
But the budget Mr. Bush submitted to Congress in early April sharply reduced spending by the Department of Energy on research and development for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. 
"They give lip service to efficiency, but their whole emphasis is on supply," said Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who has introduced energy legislation that he says strikes a finer balance between increasing supply and controlling demand.
In a report to be released later this week, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that raising the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks by what it calls a modest amount could do far more to reduce reliance on imported oil than drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Fuel economy standards reached their peak in 1988, when the average passenger vehicle covered 26 miles on a gallon of gas. The average fell to 24 miles per gallon last year, because more Americans drive light trucks, which have lower mandated efficiency standards than cars.
Raising average fuel use by cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2010 would result in oil savings of 1.5 million barrels a day by that time, the report says. The United States Geological Survey estimates that the Alaskan refuge would probably produce 580,000 barrels a day later this decade.
Mr. Cheney did not discuss the merits of raising government-mandated Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards in his address today. But he strongly defended the administration's proposal to allow drilling for oil and gas in the Alaskan refuge. 
The administration has sent mixed signals recently on how hard it intends to push to open the refuge. Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said earlier this month that the energy plan would not emphasize drilling in the Alaskan wilderness, but other officials contradicted her.
Mr. Cheney left little doubt of his support. He said new oil-drilling technologies meant that exploration could take place in the 19-million-acre refuge without disturbing wildlife. The affected area totals no more than 2,000 acres, he said, "one-fifth the size of Dulles Airport."

HEADLINE: Sales and Unease Ahead, Auction Houses Seek Buyers 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
With their sleek new headquarters, glossy catalogs and aggressive advertising campaigns, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips appear to be pillars of strength and prosperity. But as their twice-yearly evening sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art begin in Manhattan next week, the mood within could best be described as jittery. 
 Among them these three auction houses are to offer more than $600 million worth of art, a considerable sum given the rocky economy and the auction business's dependence on the mood of buyers whose split-second decision -- whether to bid as high as $30 million on a Picasso portrait of his first wife, Olga, or $45 million on a Cezanne or $10 million on a self-portrait by Max Beckmann -- determines the stability of the market. 
 Heightening their unease is the knowledge that Sotheby's is for sale, and Christie's may well be, too. Sotheby's main shareholder and former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, has made a public declaration of his intent to sell his controlling interest in the company, while Francois Pinault, the French investor who bought Christie's in 1998, has been quietly approaching investors to try to unload what has become a highly expensive asset. 
Christie's is also in the process of consolidating its operations both in New York and in London. This is a sign that it may be trying to make itself more financially attractive to a potential buyer. To make matters worse for them, both companies are embroiled in a four-year antitrust investigation by the Justice Department involving collusion by the companies' former chairmen and chief executive officers. Legal fees and civil lawsuits have already cost them millions of dollars in civil lawsuits and legal fees.
Compounding this is a new threat to Christie's and Sotheby's revenues: Phillips. When LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought Phillips more than two years ago, the LVMH chairman, Bernard Arnault, began investing large sums of money, either buying works outright and putting them at auction or offering seller's guarantees (an undisclosed sum promised to a seller regardless of a sale's outcome) to compete with Sotheby's and Christie's. Every work of art that Phillips sells hits the bottom line of Sotheby's and Christie's from the most profitable part of the market: Impressionist and modern art. 
Luring sellers with cash is hardly a new idea; Sotheby's and Christie's did it regularly in the 1980's boom years. But when the market began to nose dive in the early 1990's and a few guarantees went sour, leaving both auction houses with unsold material that they suddenly found themselves owning, Sotheby's and Christie's became more cautious about the guarantees they were prepared to offer.
Besides its deep pockets, Phillips's position was greatly strengthened in January when the company merged with de Pury & Luxembourg, Geneva dealers. Its founders, Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, became chairman of Phillips, and Daniella Luxembourg, the former deputy chairman of Sotheby's Switzerland, became its president.
Having a pair of well-connected officers running the third-place auction house has made a difference in just a few months. While all three companies have some impressive works for sale as well as their share of mediocre material, it was Phillips that snagged the most coveted collection -- a group of 19th-century paintings and drawings owned by Heinz Berggruen, the Berlin dealer. It is thought that the collection will bring more than $80 million when it is offered on Monday. 
Mr. Berggruen's artworks include two van Goghs as well as five Cezannes, the star among them "Montagne Ste. Victoire," which he bought in 1982 from the Greek shipping magnate George Embiricos. It is expected to sell for $35 million to $45 million. The collection came at a price. Phillips gave Mr. Berggruen a guarantee. While no one at the auction house will say just how big its investment is, and officials there deny any figures suggested to them, experts say the guarantee is believed to be $120 million.
Complying with regulations of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, Phillips (along with Sotheby's and Christie's) has designated the property it has guaranteed. In its Impressionist and modern art evening sale, 15 of 41 works, have been guaranteed. They include a Matisse sculpture being sold by Mr. Embiricos and two Renoirs belonging to the financier and Sotheby's board member Henry Kravis.
When Sotheby's and Christie's experts began competing for artworks to sell this spring, some collectors expected them to match offers made by Phillips. In some areas of the market there is more financing than in past seasons, but less than experts said they expected considering the the competition for prized works. 
Surprisingly, some clients went straight to Sotheby's or Christie's simply out of loyalty, with no interest in financing. For instance, there's Sotheby's single-owner sale on next Tuesday and May 9 featuring 130 works by masters like Bacon, Schiele and Miro. The collection belongs to Stanley J. Seeger, the reclusive American heir to a family fortune from lumber and petroleum who lives in London. Eight years ago, during a downturn in the market, Mr. Seeger boldly sold 88 Picassos at Sotheby's in New York for an impressive $32 million. One of his secrets was that he allowed auction house experts to put reasonable estimates on all the works, heightening the excitement of eager bidders. The same may be true next week.
"There may be little silly money about, but if collectors see something that is a true opportunity, they will pursue it and pursue it aggressively," said Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art worldwide.
A rare portrait of Olga Koklova, the Russian-born ballet dancer who was Picasso's first wife, is also expected to generate excitement. Painted in 1923 during his classical period, it is one of his last great portraits of her. Olga is seated in a dignified pose taken from some of Ingres's early 19th-century portraits of society women. It is expected to sell for $30 million.
Picasso kept the portrait for himself. After his death in 1973 it went from his estate into the private collection of Daniel Wildenstein, the French dealer, who sold it a few years ago to an unidentified European collector who is selling it at Christie's on May 9. Franck Giraud, Christie's international director of 19th- and 20th-century art said, "Compared to all of the other women in Picasso's life, he painted very few portraits of Olga, all of which except this one are already in museums both here and abroad." 
Another rare portrait expected to bring a high price is Beckmann's haunting self-portrait painted in 1938 when he was in exile after the Nazis branded him a degenerate artist. The seller went straight to Sotheby's instead of playing the auction houses against one another. 
One of the last great German Expressionist paintings, it is being sold on May 10 at Sotheby's. It is estimated to sell for $7 million to $10 million. The painting is being sold by Dr. Stephan Lackner, Beckmann's lifelong patron who died last year.
A group of works by masters like Monet, Renoir, Cezanne and Picasso are being sold by Halit Cingillioglu, former chairman of Demirbank, which was seized by the Turkish government this year. It is unclear whether Mr. Cingillioglu used the bank's money or his own to buy the art. Tungay Ceylan, a spokesman for the Turkish bank regulators who seized Demirbank, said that because of the confidential nature of the interrogations of the people related to the bank by the inspectors he cannot provide any information about the paintings' ownership. Neither Sotheby's nor Christie's would say only that they do not comment on consignors. 
Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art on May 10 includes nine paintings from this collection and Christie's sale on May 9 includes three. 
In the area of contemporary art both companies have several outstanding works that have received considerable publicity recently. The Spanish artist Maurizio Cattelan is to install a version of his "Ninth Hour," a room-size work consisting of a life-size wax figure of Pope John Paul II in white robes, clutching his processional cross and felled by a meteorite that has crashed through the skylight overhead. It first caused a stir when a version of the piece was on view at the Royal Academy of Arts in London as part of "Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art." 
In December, when it was shown at the Zacheta Gallery in Warsaw, two members of Poland's Parliament tried to vandalize it because they said it was disrespectful to their beliefs, but guards stopped them before any damage was done. The work will be shown in the United States for the first time at Christie's Rockefeller Center galleries and offered there on May 17; it is expected to sell for $400,000 to $600,000. 
More lighthearted is a porcelain sculpture by the 1980's art star Jeff Koons to be sold on May 15 at Sotheby's. "Michael Jackson and Bubbles," a 1988 sculpture of Mr. Jackson and his chimpanzee, is expected to bring $3 million to $4 million. The outrageously camp image has been used for Sotheby's new advertising campaign. It features a sleeker logo and a sliver of the company's newly completed York Avenue headquarters. James Allman, executive vice president for worldwide marketing said that in these competitive times it "is a way to differentiate us from the competition."

HEADLINE: With Merger Deal Gone Sour, EMI Must Counton Its Stars 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 1 

 BODY:
When the EMI Group and BMG abandoned their talks to create a music industry giant today, Eric Nicoli, the EMI chairman, found himself once again having to talk up the company's prospects as a stand-alone entity.
 He pointed to EMI's preliminary results for the year ended March 31, also released today, showing a 6 percent rise in pretax profit, to $:260 million ($373 million), on a 12 percent jump in sales to $:2.7 billion ($3.9 billion), beating most forecasts. 
 "That is a better-than-respectable performance," Mr. Nicoli said in an interview. "EMI is doing fine. There have been inevitable distractions, but in spite of that, we've been able to maintain momentum." 
Putting an end to 15 months of uncertainty, first relating to merger talks with Warner Music, a unit of AOL Time Warner, and then to talks with BMG, a unit of Bertelsmann, briefly gave a lift to EMI's battered share price. But it closed up only slightly at 445 pence ($6.39) today. Since that is 44 percent below the peak of 799.5 pence ($11.47) in January 2000, EMI's shares might appear undervalued.
Not according to several analysts, though.
"A deal was imperative to their strategic future, and I don't see where they go from here," said Nicola Stewart, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities, who rates EMI shares a hold.
Economic sluggishness in Japan and the United States has hurt worldwide music sales, which declined 1.3 percent in 2000, according to Helen Snell, an analyst with ABN Amro. With American sales down a further 5.5 percent in the first three months of the year, Ms. Snell is not expecting business to pick up soon.
Meanwhile, with antitrust regulators steadfastly opposing mergers among any of the five major music companies, EMI can no longer look to cost savings from a merger to improve its margins.
Instead, it must compete by aggressively signing new artists, a risky and expensive business, analysts said.
That could leave EMI increasingly dependent on earnings from the recordings of a few big stars at a time when competitors are diversifying their entertainment portfolios.
Mr. Nicoli said EMI was no different from any other big music company in its efforts to sign star performers, an arena where it has competed aggressively. For example, EMI recently signed Mariah Carey in a $:17 million ($24 million) deal.
But artists are fickle -- EMI recently lost out the music publishing rights to a British pop star, Robbie Williams, to BMG -- and each lost star matters more to EMI than to its conglomerate-owned rivals.
Ms. Stewart estimated that a single best-selling act like the Spice Girls might account for as much as 15 percent of EMI's operating profit when its popularity is peaking. At Bertelsmann, which has major book publishing interests and recently bought RTL, a major European broadcaster, no one artist is likely to ever approach that figure; likewise at Warner Music, which is now a small piece of the sprawling AOL Time Warner cable-to-publishing-to-Internet empire.
In competing with such deep-pocketed giants, "EMI could be in a position where they pay too much to win big artists," Ms. Stewart said.
Another worry is that EMI has employed a me-too Internet strategy, trailing behind competitors like Vivendi Universal and Bertelsmann, which have actively explored ways to tap into online demand for downloadable digital music. (The other top recording company is Sony Music Entertainment.)
Mr. Nicoli said EMI had signed 40 new media deals since 1999 and recently joined AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann and RealNetworks to distribute music online. "What we haven't done is throw cash at the opportunity," he said. "Most informed commentators would take the view that our strategy has been smart."
EMI is also reviving a plan first broached two years ago, but frozen by the merger talks, that calls for combining its music-publishing arm with a competitor's. But analysts do not expect a big payoff from the plan, perhaps less than $50 million all told, according to Ms. Snell.
EMI has held talks on and off with a variety of partners since it was spun off from Thorn, an appliance and electronics company, in 1996. Today, Mr. Nicoli ruled out any full-scale merger in the near future. But some analysts are not convinced that EMI will remain independent.
"One possibility that cannot be ruled out," Ms. Snell wrote in a research note to clients, "is a hostile bid from another major record company, which could then attempt to secure approval from the regulator by aggressively disposing of assets." She cited Bertelsmann as a probable bidder because as a private company it need not satisfy public shareholders by sticking to deals that create shareholder value right away. 
Susanne Erdl, a Bertelsmann spokeswoman, did not rule out the option of reopening talks with EMI. "The music market is fast changing," she said. "There will be lots of other possibilities later on.'

HEADLINE: In Twist, Rebels Help Drug Effort In Colombia 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: GAITANIA, Colombia 

 BODY:
The warnings were dire as President Andres Pastrana's government, flush with American money, began an ambitious plan late last year that called on farmers to eradicate fields of coca and heroin poppies in exchange for economic aid.
 Many officials in Bogota and Washington said the rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia might resort to threats and even violence to stop farmers from cooperating. Rebel taxes on illegal crops are a major revenue source that helps finance rebel operations. 
 But late in April, here in the cloud-shrouded mountains where the rebel force, known as FARC, was born in 1964, farmers agreed in principle to replace poppy fields with legal crops in exchange for subsidies and technical assistance. Rebel leaders from this region of southern Tolima Province watched closely as a letter of intent, the first step toward an agreement, was signed with officials. 
"They said we would not let the farmers cultivate their own crops," said a rebel leader who is in the political wing and was involved in discussions.
"But we don't reject help just because it is from the state," said the leader, whose nom de guerre is Marta. "We just want to be able to see the state support the farmers."
Although the revolutionary armed forces have not used violence to halt voluntary eradication, the rebels are apparently deeply involved in talks between the government and farmers, said local officials and farmers. 
"They seem to be getting more involved, to see if something works, if it does not," said Ruben Dario Gomez, who heads a farmers' cooperative. "They say that if something is happening in an area they control, they want to be involved. Everyone knows it."
Local officials said that in meetings rebels give opinions, offer suggestions and, in some cases, shape programs. Agreements, including the one here, are forwarded to top rebel commanders for approval.
"The FARC has its positions, its own criteria, in regard to discussions about these farmers' fields," said Gerardo Montoya, a provincial official involved in the negotiations. "In the points they made, they said that the people had been cheated before and that the state has never had a presence here."
Much of the rebels' concern, said those who attended meetings, was directed at Plante, the agency that uses money from a $42 million American grant for what are called alternative development programs. The programs are intended to give farmers a year to stop their illicit crops in exchange for $900 in seeds, pesticides and technical aid to help switch crops. The government has also promised to market products and build public works.
The rebels, however, see Plante as a tool of an American policy that counts on extensive fumigation to eradicate most of the illegal crops here. In interviews here and in the coca-growing heartland of Putumayo Province, farmers also said the agency had reneged on past agreements.
The quality control coordinator for Plante, Joaquin Gomez, disagreed, saying the agency had forged bonds with farmers. He also said the rebel force had not been an impediment. "We've been able to come in," said Mr. Gomez, who was at the meetings here. "We have had access to all the zones."
Still, among some negotiators here the sense remained that the rebels could have halted the letter of intent. That is worrisome to people like Hoover Mora, a town councilman who said the rebels' forceful comments left open the possibility that they would take punitive steps.
"They say they will not stop the program," Mr. Mora said. "But they are getting involved in the oversight, and I think that is a big contradiction."
Some experts on the rebels said they were in a difficult position because they had to choose between allowing eradication and losing financing or stopping eradication programs popular with farmers and risking alienating their base of support.

HEADLINE: St. John's Works to Shake Its Commuter School Image 

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL WEISS 

 BODY:
On any weekday night, the parking lots of St. John's University in Jamaica, Queens, start emptying as the commuter students -- the Long Islanders and the residents of Brooklyn and Queens who have historically defined St. John's -- begin their journeys home. 
 But at the south end of the 110-acre main campus, in a new $150 million residential village, the lights of five dormitories burn brightly as knots of students from all parts of the United States stand outside, talking and laughing as they await deliveries from pizzerias and Chinese restaurants. 
 "Things are markedly different," said the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, the university's president, reflecting on the changes at the 131-year-old institution since it opened its first dormitories in fall 1999. "You'd walk in here a couple of years ago and the campus would be very quiet at night and on weekends. Now it's just the opposite. The campus is alive all the time. We're now a 24-7 operation." 
If campus life has changed since St. John's became a residential institution, so have the university's aspirations.
"We see ourselves as being a national university," Father Harrington said. 
Whether or not the president's goal of national prominence is attainable, it is clear that St. John's has moved with speed and determination to make itself more visible and competitive. In less than a decade, the 18,500-student university has managed not only to build its first residence halls, but also to raise faculty salaries to levels competitive with that of the nation's leading research universities.
It has also spent $40 million to upgrade technology, developed a new core curriculum to go into effect next fall, and acquired two new campus sites in Manhattan and on eastern Long Island to complement the existing campuses in Jamaica and Staten Island. Fund-raising efforts have also stepped up, notably with two gifts of $10 million each in the last couple of years.
"It's an impressive series of steps," said Frederick S. Lane, a professor at Baruch College's School of Public Affairs who has been a planning consultant to many colleges and universities. "But building the reputation of a university is a long and difficult process, and it requires a sustained vision and strategy."
Reshaping the university is not without its risks. Since its founding, St. John's has been a gateway to the business world and the professions for thousands of working-class students for whom the university's low tuition made it possible to attend college. In the fall, tuition will rise to $16,900, more than two and a half times the $6,500 it was in 1989 when Father Harrington became president. He acknowledges unease among some trustees and faculty members who worry about a loss of the school's working-class identity and whether national recruitment will someday overshadow local admissions.
Established in 1870 by the Vincentian order to serve the city's poor and working class, St. John's has been a model of the urban commuter school, for immigrants striving to become the first in their families to earn college degrees and for working students attending law school classes at night. 
The main campus, an enclosed sprinkling of low-slung buildings set among lawns, athletic fields and parking lots, is in an area of well-tended private homes adjoining Jamaica Estates. The university was once largely for the children of Irish and Italian immigrants. Its student population today is about half non-Hispanic white, with the other half divided almost equally among blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Academically, the university is best known for its law school, whose graduates have included prominent litigators, judges and politicians, including three governors: Hugh L. Carey and Mario M. Cuomo of New York and George Deukmejian of California.
Now, seeking to expand the university's reach beyond the five boroughs and Nassau County, Father Harrington envisions the day when St. John's recruits students across the board, and not just athletes, for whom it competes with Big East Conference rivals like Villanova, Boston College, Syracuse and Georgetown.
Benefiting from its location in New York City, its identity as one of the nation's largest Roman Catholic universities and the longtime prominence of its men's basketball program (less mentioned are the national championships in soccer and fencing), national recruitment is off to a promising start. The 1,400 students living in the dormitories this spring come from more than 35 states, including Alaska and Hawaii.
The driving force behind the metamorphosis has clearly been Father Harrington, who is widely credited with reinvigorating a university that appeared adrift when he took over.
"The institution has just changed tremendously and improved significantly since he came," said Neil Jespersen, the chairman of the chemistry department, who has been at St. John's since 1977. "There's just a lot more grants, a lot more research activity, a lot more academic activity in general."
Father Harrington, 55, began his academic career as a theology instructor at Niagara University near Buffalo, where he ultimately became president before coming to St. John's. But he speaks comfortably these days in the vernacular of a corporate director, a position he currently holds with the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns.
He talks expansively about the need of colleges and universities to "meet the challenges of the new economy and globalization," but like a chief executive being coy about a new product line, he declines to discuss new programs in any detail, saying, "Higher education is still a business, and I'm not about to give away secrets to the competition."
There is one indicator that tells outside experts like Dr. Lane that St. John's is an institution worth watching.
"It's one thing for St. John's to decide to build a few residence halls," he said. "It's almost a no-brainer. But it is quite another for the university to also start paying top-tier salaries for full professors." 
That, he added, "signals a much more fundamental commitment to quality" by making it clear that St. John's is searching for the kind of faculty talent needed to build first-rate programs and promote research.
As recently as five years ago, salaries at St. John's were behind those of city and Long Island institutions like Queens College, Hofstra University, Fordham University and the State University at Stony Brook. But in raising faculty pay by as much as 6 percent a year, St. John's has outstripped its competition.
According to a recent survey in The Chronicle of Higher Education showing colleges where full professors earned the most for the 2000-01 year, St. John's ranked 41st, paying $101,100, slightly less than Dartmouth College but slightly more than the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Until recently, St. John's seemed unlikely to belong in such company. Dr. Jespersen recalled that when he joined the chemistry department 24 years ago, the level of research activity generated by the members of the department was practically nil. It remained so until about three years ago, when the administration offered a universitywide buyout that induced half the members of the department to retire.
Now able to recruit younger professors with doctorates from places like the University of Pennsylvania and the State University at Buffalo, the new members of the department have brought in almost $1 million in grant money, and the number of chemistry majors has grown from 3 to 10 students.
Responding to concerns that rising tuition will erode St. John's position as a working-class school, Father Harrington and other university officials note that financial aid has risen even faster than tuition. 
The university is providing $55 million this year in scholarship money, compared with $6 million a decade ago. Further, the university has adopted a policy of making 40 percent to 45 percent of its freshman admissions among those it classifies as economically disadvantaged.
"We are committed to our mission of serving the poor of the New York area," Father Harrington said.

HEADLINE: Toward a Global AIDS Fund 

 BODY:
The public attention given in recent months to Africa's AIDS crisis has not been matched with money. Last year the world spent about $1 billion on AIDS in developing countries -- a sum that will not even buy adequate prevention campaigns, much less health infrastructure, care for AIDS orphans and necessary medicines for the sick. But in a series of international meetings over the next few weeks, world leaders will be turning their attention to financing these urgent programs. The speech last week by Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations at the African AIDS conference in Nigeria lays out a solid basis for a global attack on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. 
 Mr. Annan called for a global fund to fight these diseases -- with contributions from governments, foundations and wealthy individuals -- that would eventually add $7 billion to $10 billion a year to the current level of world spending. He recommended that the money go to preventing the spread of disease, cutting mother-to-child transmission of AIDS, caring for orphans, aiding scientific breakthroughs and buying medicine, including anti-retroviral drugs to treat AIDS. 
 The idea of a global fund has been endorsed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the group of the world's seven largest industrialized nations. On June 25 the U.N. General Assembly holds a special session on AIDS, and may formally establish the fund then. Actual pledges are expected in July, at a meeting of the world's wealthiest nations in Genoa, Italy. 
At least initially, a large part of the money will go toward building a health infrastructure in the African nations most ravaged by AIDS. African leaders from 43 nations have pledged to increase their spending on health, and especially on AIDS. The statement is a welcome sign that African leaders are taking AIDS and health issues more seriously. The few countries that have demonstrated a commitment to slowing the spread of AIDS have been able to do so. But many nations are still ignoring AIDS and spending less than $10 per capita on health each year. 
The global AIDS fund, which has gotten initial support from Italy, Britain, Canada and Sweden, is likely to be handicapped by a lack of leadership from the United States. While Bush administration officials speak about AIDS as a catastrophe, the president's 2002 budget adds less than 10 percent to this year's spending for AIDS overseas, raising it to $480 million. Former President Clinton suggested to the Nigeria AIDS conference that Washington should provide a quarter of the global AIDS fund. President Bush's budget falls more than $1 billion short of that.

Dodging the Bullet

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Things are getting worse more slowly -- let's celebrate! That seemed to be the mood in the markets yesterday, after the National Association of Production Managers released its monthly survey for April. Any score less than 50 indicates that the managers surveyed see deteriorating conditions, and the index for April was only 43.2. But the index was up slightly from March -- as I said, things are getting worse more slowly -- and as the day went by investors seem to have concluded that this was good news.
 In fact, the N.A.P.M. index was only one of a number of straws in the wind that suggest that the economic situation might not be as bad as some -- myself included -- have feared. For all we know the good news is just a statistical blip, and we are still on track for a deep economic plunge. But we can now contemplate, at least for the sake of argument, the possibility that the United States will dodge the bullet -- that we will survive the bursting of the great technology bubble without going through an all-out recession. If so, we will have learned an important economic lesson. 
 Put it this way: Many economic commentators seem to subscribe to a sort of crime-and-punishment theory of recessions. They believe that after the economy goes through a period of speculative excess, it must then pay for that excess with a slump. 
But must irrational exuberance be followed by recession? The alternative to crime-and-punishment is let-bygones-be-bygones. Of course capital is wasted in a speculative boom, and much of that capital must be written off. Moreover, the sectors of the economy in which the speculative excess was greatest may not see much new investment for a while; it might be years before the demand for servers or business software resumes rapid growth. 
But why should this stop the economy in its tracks? There are always good investments to be made, if the price is right. Millions of Americans have decided that low interest rates offer a good opportunity to refinance their homes or buy new ones, even as the headlines warn of a slumping economy; and there are plenty of profitable opportunities in those old-economy sectors that got a bit neglected during the technology bubble. 
I've always favored the let-bygones-be-bygones view over the crime-and-punishment view. That is, I've always believed that a speculative bubble need not lead to a recession, as long as interest rates are cut quickly enough to stimulate alternative investments. But I had to face the fact that speculative bubbles usually are followed by recessions. My excuse has been that this was because the policy makers moved too slowly -- that central banks were typically too slow to cut interest rates in the face of a burst bubble, giving the downturn time to build up a lot of momentum. That was why I, like many others, was frustrated at the smallish cut at the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting: I was pretty sure that Alan Greenspan had the tools to prevent a disastrous recession, but worried that he might be getting behind the curve. 
However, let's give credit where credit is due: Mr. Greenspan has cut rates since then. And while some of us may have been urging him to move even faster, the Fed's four interest-rate cuts since the slowdown became apparent represent an unusually aggressive response by historical standards. It's still not clear that Mr. Greenspan has caught up with the curve -- let's have at least one more rate cut, please -- but the interest-rate cuts do, cross your fingers, seem to be having an effect. 
If we succeed in avoiding recession, this will mark a big win for let-bygones-be-bygones, and a big loss for crime-and-punishment. And that will be very good news not just for this business cycle, but for business cycles to come. 
For the big lesson of the late 1990's was that speculative bubbles spring eternal. The signs of irrational exuberance, not to mention sheer silliness, were there for all to see; yet the bubble expanded -- and then burst -- all the same. Surely there will be other bubbles, and other burstings, in the decades ahead. The best we can hope for is that when the bubbles burst the consequences can be limited. And the faint signs of good news in the U.S. economy are reason to hope that they can.

Would-Be EntrepreneursShun Dot-Coms

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Financial markets are fickle, and business school students are nothing if not attentive to markets. Last year, the students tried to persuade investors to buy into trendy, but ultimately doomed concepts like DesignAjewel.com. This year, they are pushing more mundane ideas like the Shrimp Factory.
 John Culley, a second-year M.B.A. student who entered a competition last month for best business plan at the Stern School of Business of New York University, came up with the idea for supplying fresh shrimp to high-end New York City restaurants by building shrimp-breeding vats in either northern New Jersey or the Bronx. 
 Mr. Culley plans to use high-technology filters to eliminate the waste produced by the shrimp. Otherwise, though, his venture has an old-economy feel. It is definitely not an Internet start-up, and he did not consider calling it shrimpfactory.com. 
"I think that most of the great ideas in that area have been mined," Mr. Culley said. "I have no aversion to a dot-com or any other technology company. I would do anything, if it's something I'm passionate about."
The latest evidence of a shift at business schools away from the dot-com mania of early 2000 and back to more traditional standbys may well be found in the ideas proposed by would-be entrepreneurs in business-plan competitions.
The message on campus after campus seems to be: say goodbye to DesignAjewel .com, an ill-fated idea pitched by N.Y.U. students last year, and get ready for locally grown fresh shrimp at Manhattan restaurants.
Or for an upscale handyman's service. In essence, that is what Ari R. Meisel, an undergraduate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, decided to enter in the business-plan competition that ended Monday.
Mr. Meisel, who just turned 18, says harsh experience over the last year has taught him the wisdom of promoting a back-to-basics business. He has already founded three companies, he says, and the two that have done well -- Liontex, a Web site design firm, and Tek, an all-purpose technology consulting firm -- are both traditional enterprises. The one poor performer is Menus-To-Go.com, which offers the menus of New York City restaurants on the Internet.
"That never really went too far," he said. Mr. Meisel and his Wharton partners in the business-plan contest also toyed with the idea of a nationwide college student directory, but rejected the idea when they realized it would be hard to make money. Instead, they proposed a service company that would use independent contractors to install computers, stereo equipment or anything else in homes and businesses. "It's simpler and more fun when the ideas are not capital-intensive," Mr. Meisel said.
Other students have reached the same conclusion.
"We're steering clear of the dot-com bubble," said Jeff Freilich, a member of a team of students competing in a business-plan contest at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their not-a-dot-com proposal involves testing drugs using computer software rather than real patients, saving time and money for pharmaceutical companies. "The pharmaceutical industry is one that's always admired," Mr. Freilich said. "It's very visible right now to the investment community, looking for what to do with their money."
Not everyone has abandoned cyberspace, of course, but even those who brave it are keeping their eyes wide open. Anthony M. Tarpey, a member of a team of M.B.A. students at Wharton, almost apologizes for the team's proposal for a system that allows marketers to send video clips as e-mail messages.
"I am aware that there was a bit of a backlash against Internet advertising, but we are really e-mail advertising," said Mr. Tarpey, whose company, OrangeMarketing, is already running and profitable. "We don't service dot-coms."
Business plans are the blueprints for start-up companies, outlining what entrepreneurs hope to do, how they plan to find customers and how soon they expect to be profitable. The plans should also explain how the fledgling business will cope with potential pitfalls.
Mr. Culley, for example, readily acknowledged during the question-and-answer portion of his presentation at N.Y.U. that contamination in the shrimp breeding vats could be a catastrophic event if it occurred too early in the life of the company. The only solution would be a new round of financing to keep Shrimp Factory operating while the tanks could be cleaned, he said.
In the last five years or so, plans entered in contests have become for M.B.A. students what screenplays and novels are for struggling writers: a shot at fame, prize money to finance the proposed business and in rare cases, unimagined riches. Timbre Technologies, which developed software that assists in the design of semiconductors, was started two years ago by the winners of a contest at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, for example, and was sold in March for $138 million to a Japanese buyer.
Though enthusiasm for the contests has waned somewhat in the current economic slowdown -- the number of plans submitted slumped to 34 this year at N.Y.U. from 88 last year and to 135 from 206 at M.I.T. -- their popularity soared in the late 1990's. The N.Y.U. competition is in only its second year, while the business-plan contest at the Haas School is four years old, for example.
Jerome Engel, executive director of the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Haas School, said he supported the idea of competitions at Haas only after M.B.A. students pointed out that they provided an opportunity to collaborate with students in other parts of the university. "That got me to agree that it was a fantastic idea," he said.
Sarah Kroon, an M.B.A. student at N.Y.U., said: "There is just a tremendous demand from students. Students really want some real-world experience in writing a business plan," as well as practice chatting with potential investors. 
The interest in the plans as a way to succeed quickly mirrors changes in how entrepreneurs are viewed in society, said Elad Gil, who is running the M.I.T. competition this year and who recently received his doctorate in biology from the school. It is possible for students to start their own companies today -- something not possible 15 or 20 years ago, he said.
"There's also the 'me-too' effect," Dr. Gil added. Current M.B.A. students see millionaire entrepreneurs who are also in their 20's, and the students decide that they, too, can get rich quickly, he said.
The competitions also teach students what investors really care about. Lesson No. 1 is that market appetite is more important than technology. Potential financial backers would much rather see hard evidence that people would actually buy a product, however simple or complicated it is, than look at a technological wonder that nobody really wants.
"You're obviously trying to get into the mind of the investor, especially given the dot-com craze and crash -- how are their expectations tempered, what are they looking for," said Christina Lawler, a first-year M.B.A. student at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. She is a member of Mr. Freilich's team in the school's $50,000 business-plan contest. "Whereas people might have been able to get away with bigger ideas that were not very well grounded" in previous years, Ms. Lawler said, "they're not going to be able to get away with that now."
DesignAjewel.com, for example, would have allowed customers to design their own jewelry online. 
In contrast, Mr. Culley's idea for the Shrimp Factory depends not on the Internet, but on something much more reliable: New Yorkers' appetites for seafood. "I read an article several years ago about the shrimp farming industry and its devastating effects," Mr. Culley said. Usually, such farms use ponds or vats to breed shrimp; the shrimp produce waste, which is flushed out into the environment, he said.
The Shrimp Factory, instead of flushing out waste-filled water, would run it through what is essentially a sewage treatment system, Mr. Culley said. Shrimp waste would be chemically converted into fertilizer for algae, which the shrimp would then eat. This means the whole process should not harm the surrounding environment, he said.
Mr. Culley said he had researched his idea for years, and this year he was apparently not alone in having done his homework. Over all, the ideas proposed now are better planned and the teams themselves more determined than last year, said Stephen Nordahl, managing director of T.S.X. Ventures, a venture capital firm based in New York, and a judge both this year and last year in the N.Y.U. competition.
"Last year there were a lot of these dot-com type companies that weren't necessarily fully thought-out business models," he said. This year, he added, "there are somewhat fewer participants, but they seem to be much more serious."

HEADLINE: Still Sluggish, Manufacturing Index EdgesUp 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
A manufacturing index edged higher in April, a report showed today, but the gain was less than expected and signaled that factories are having trouble pulling out of a slump.
 "Manufacturing is the economy's weakest spot and still is struggling significantly," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at the research firm Economy.com in West Chester, Pa. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index was 43.2 last month, up from 43.1 in March. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 44 in April. 
A reading below 50 signals contraction of the manufacturing sector, and the index has been under that level since August. This year, companies have announced job cuts to pare costs as consumer spending flags. While the economy expanded 2 percent in the first quarter, that pace may have lost strength in the second, analysts say.
A separate survey by the organization found that more than a third of the purchasers for manufacturing companies -- 38 percent -- said they were "worried or pessimistic" about business over the next 12 months. That compares with 5 percent who were pessimistic in December.
"Two years ago, there was an insane euphoria that isn't going to occur for a while," Kenneth E. Guiles, purchasing director for the Eastman Chemical Company, said today at the association's semiannual outlook conference in Orlando, Fla. "But once people get back to business as usual in a modestly growing economy, then the demand will grow."
A majority of those responding to the group's survey said investment in new equipment would decline this year. Also, manufacturers are now operating at the lowest percentage of their capacity than at any time in the last decade, the survey showed.
Real estate and construction, meantime, kept buoying the economy, which is in its record 11th year of expansion. Work on office buildings, home improvements and public projects led a 1.3 percent increase in construction spending in March, the Commerce Department reported separately.
The monthly increase in spending, to a record $854.4 billion at an annual rate, was the fifth consecutive one.
The April factory survey gave some reasons for optimism. Manufacturers reduced inventories at the fastest pace since October 1996. At the same time, the indexes measuring production and new orders rose for the third consecutive month.
Inflation pressures stayed tame. An index of prices paid for raw materials fell in April, to the lowest level in two years. And purchasers said in the survey that they expected the cost of materials to stay unchanged and labor costs to decline.
The factory executives expect to hire 1.3 percent fewer workers this year, the survey showed. Purchasing managers at companies other than manufacturers said they expected to hire 0.5 percent fewer employees.

HEADLINE: Israel Arrests Ex-General as Spy for Spilling Old Secrets 

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 1 

 BODY:
Itzhak Yaakov, 75, a retired brigadier general who once oversaw weapons development for the Israeli military, is at the center of a supposed spy story that may turn out to be more Kafka than le Carre.
 For more than a month Mr. Yaakov, an Israeli-American with dual citizenship who has lived in Manhattan for the last two decades, has been in an Israeli prison on charges of "high espionage" that carry a maximum penalty of life behind bars. 
 Mr. Yaakov, known here as the father of the Israeli technology industry, was quietly taken into custody by a special security division of the Defense Ministry on March 28. That was four days after his 75th birthday was celebrated in the wealthy town of Savyon outside Tel Aviv by a who's who of Israeli political and economic leaders who regaled him as "Mr. Security." 
Mr. Yaakov was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport after he finished checking in for a flight to Istanbul. 
His case was sealed and an order was issued barring the principals from speaking to the press, so his friends thought at first that he was simply away, enjoying himself as planned on vacation in Turkey.
Then on April 22, The Sunday Times of London reported Mr. Yaakov's detention and added that he was being questioned about his "relationship with a Russian woman who may have had access to his work" from the time when he is said to have played a role in the development of Israel's nuclear industry.
With the secrecy of his arrest broken, Israeli courts partly lifted the order withholding information from the press, and state attorneys made public some of the charges.
Mr. Yaakov is accused of passing confidential information to "unauthorized individuals" with the intention of "compromising the security of the state." The indictment says that despite warnings from security officials, he divulged classified information he had obtained during his service in the Israeli military, which ended 27 years ago.
His wife, Tatiana Mendoza, is a Russian-born American, but a "relationship with a Russian woman" does not appear to be a factor in the case, despite the initial report, which set the country buzzing about an aging Mata Hari.
Despite the accusations, Maj. Gen. Amos Yaron, director general of the Defense Ministry, said on Israel Radio on Monday, "We are not talking about a spy case." He called the incident "very unfortunate" and referred to Mr. Yaakov as a "man with a history of admirable deeds."
Nonetheless, General Yaron obliquely said that the authorities had had "no choice" but to arrest Mr. Yaakov for distributing sensitive information.
Friends, who call Mr. Yaakov by his nickname, Yatza, say they believe that his only offense was speaking to an Israeli reporter during a series of recent interviews in New York. They say that he felt compelled to tell his story, making a case for his own contributions to Israeli history, after an incident that hurt him: he was disqualified, or so he believed, as a potential nominee for the state's highest honor, the Israel Prize, because he was an expatriate.
Mr. Yaakov came from Israel's pioneer generation, and his personal history is interwoven with the state's. He was born in Tel Aviv in 1926 and attended the same elementary school as Yitzhak Rabin, several years behind the future prime minister. He served in the Palmach, a paramilitary branch of the Haganah, the Jewish underground self-defense force before independence, and commanded an important company during the 1947 war. 
He graduated as an engineer from Technion in Haifa. From 1955 to 1973 he served in the Israeli military, heading a weapons development unit for a decade. During that time he is believed to have played a role in the nuclear program.
It is unclear to what extent the charges against Mr. Yaakov concern Israel's nuclear weaponry. Israel is considered by experts to have the sixth-largest nuclear arsenal in the world, but it has maintained a policy of "deliberate ambiguity" about its nuclear program for decades. Israeli military censorship, which has loosened considerably in recent years, is still almost airtight on nuclear arms.
Mr. Yaakov's information would be very dated, older than the detailed revelations of Mordechai Vanunu, a nuclear technician who blew the whistle on Israel's nuclear arsenal in 1986 and was convicted of treason in 1988.
Much is now known about Israel's nuclear capacity, and Mr. Yaakov's friends said they doubted that he had fresh or detailed inside information.
After two decades as a businessman in the United States, where nuclear arms are discussed more freely, Mr. Yaakov may have lost the keen Israeli sense of the subject as taboo, his friends said. Still, he was not supposed to talk, regardless of his motives, which the authorities acknowledge publicly do not involve sharing secrets with an enemy of Israel.
An Israeli critic of the state's opacity on nuclear policy said, "There is a state within a state" on the nuclear issue.
"The myth that this issue stands apart allows them to justify all sorts of outrageous behavior," the critic said. "It appears they are using a 75-year-old man to send a message to a generation of people that they should die with their secrets, even if they are such old secrets that they're not of much value anymore in intelligence or military terms."
Mr. Yaakov left the military a week before the Arab-Israeli war of 1973. He went to work for Israel's Trade Ministry as chief scientist, nurturing the research and development companies that blossomed into Israel's lucrative technology industry. 
He emigrated to the United States in the late 1970's, largely for personal reasons. Last year he retired as chairman of Constellation 3D, a company that develops advanced data storage products, with offices in New York, Florida and California and laboratories in Israel and Russia.
The birthday extravaganza for Mr. Yaakov was given by two technology entrepreneurs. Before the party, Mr. Yaakov gave a series of interviews to Ronen Bergman of the daily Yediot Ahronot for an article that was supposed to be published in conjunction with the gala. 
He asked Mr. Bergman to sign a written contract pledging that he would submit the article to the military censor first. Friends of Mr. Yaakov say he would not have insisted on that condition if his intent had been to harm state security as the indictment alleges.
Mr. Bergman complied, the friends said, and the censor killed the entire article, a magazine-length piece of some 7,500 words. Not long afterward, the arrest warrant for Mr. Yaakov was issued.
General Yaron suggested that Mr. Yaakov had done more than talk to Mr. Bergman. He referred to a "manifesto," which some officials believe to be memoirs that Mr. Yaakov was preparing for publication. Mr. Yaakov's lawyers say there is no manifesto; friends say he was working on a novel that might have been partly autobiographical.
An American official said Mr. Yaakov had declined assistance from the American authorities. Friends say he is too proud and embarrassed to turn to his second country for help in dealing with the authorities in the homeland in which he used to be an authority. The United States offered help twice, but he declined.
Mr. Yaakov, who recently recovered from two heart operations, is confined in a prison hospital in Ramle. In a hearing on Wednesday, his lawyers plan to request that he be moved to house arrest, although he does not have a home in Israel. His wife, who is staying at a Tel Aviv hotel, cried when a reporter located her and asked her about her husband.
"It would be very unwise for me at this point to say anything," she said. "I can't afford to talk now. I would love to shout, but I cannot do this now. He is not well."
Mr. Yaakov's lawyers and several legal commentators here have asked aloud why Israeli officials chose to file charges of aggravated espionage against him when they are saying publicly that his alleged offenses cannot be considered spying in the classic sense. The legal experts said lesser charges exist relating to unauthorized dissemination of confidential information.
They have also criticized the director of the internal Defense Ministry security agency for what they see as overzealousness, and lamented the secrecy around the case. 
"This type of secret arrest has no place in a democracy," the newspaper Haaretz said. One columnist said, "The idea that Israel, in this day and age, can have such X-files is cause for concern."
State Attorney Edna Arbel protested the contention that Mr. Yaakov had "disappeared."
"People do not disappear in Israel," she said. "This is not Russia or Latin America. He was accompanied by four lawyers and his wife when he was arraigned."
Jack Chen, one of his lawyers, said: "We see this as a very sad story of a person who dedicates his life to the security of Israel and ends up caught in a huge story that gets blown out of proportion and jeopardizes his reputation, his career, his legacy, everything. It's a huge shock for him, but he's sure that eventually the truth will come out."

HEADLINE: Growing Signs of Progress In Writers' Negotiations 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1 

 BODY:
Negotiations between Hollywood's writers and its leading movie studios and television networks stretched into this evening amid growing signs that progress was being made to avert a long-dreaded strike that would have the potential of crippling the nation's entertainment industry.
 Top negotiators from each side had met long into the evening on Monday, and were having significant success in chipping away at the list of issues separating the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, people on both sides of the talks said today. The main issues, though, including residuals and so-called creative rights, remained unresolved as the talks went into their final hours. 
 The contract deadline was 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time Wednesday, though officials from both sides said that talks could easily stretch beyond that if progress continued to be made. Indeed, some said, there was some optimism among negotiators today that an agreement might even be concluded before the midnight deadline, or very soon after.
"It's like a basketball game, where everything is decided in the last two minutes," said one studio executive who was close to the talks. "In other words, what's happened here is that the process has evolved into a fairly standard set of labor negotiations. And it looks like it's going to end up like most labor negotiations do, coming right down to the wire."
The prospect of a strike by the 11,000 members of the guild's West Coast and East Coast branches -- about a third of whom write for the movies and the rest for scripted television programs -- had been worrisome enough for Hollywood. But coming this year, before a June 30 contract deadline for the 135,000 actors represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, it promised a double punch that would have effectively caused film and television production companies to shut down, lay off thousands and perhaps deal a devastating blow to Southern California's economy.
Last year, when the Writers Guild began to talk -- persuasively -- about taking a harder line in the current round of labor talks, the Hollywood studios responded by putting dozens of films into rushed production. Television networks were able to persuade some producers to stockpile episodes of programs for the coming fall season, and vowed to make up any gaps with increased reality and news programs.
The dominant issue in the talks was residuals, the amount of money paid to writers for the reuse of their work after its initial broadcast or theatrical run. But another flash point, at least for film writers, was a demand for greater respect and authority in the filmmaking process, including curbing the use of the "film by" credit for directors.
And in the final days of the talks, the issue of how writers would be compensated for use of their work on the Internet became a central issue. Although there have been only relatively small efforts to make money by putting films on the Internet, several major studios have said in recent months that they intend to mount fledgling film-on-demand efforts on the World Wide Web.

Priceline Shares Soar on Earnings

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Shares of Priceline.com, the name-your-own-price Internet commerce company, jumped 51 percent yesterday after an analyst raised his rating and the company reported better-than-expected earnings.
 Priceline said that its first-quarter loss was narrower than estimates had been and that it expected to turn a small profit in the current quarter, helped by steep cost reductions and a heightened focus on its core travel business. 
 Priceline shares rose 36 percent during regular trading on the strength of a ratings upgrade by a Goldman, Sachs analyst, and surged further after the company released its results at 4:30 yesterday. In after-hours trading, the stock reached $7.32. It closed the regular session at $6.59, up $1.74. Priceline shares traded as high as $162.38 two years ago and as low as $1.06 last December. 
Priceline, which drastically pared the scope of its business last November, reported revenue of $269.7 million for the quarter, down a shade over 14 percent from the period a year earlier. The company had a net loss of $13.8 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of $13.6 million, or 8 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2000. 
Excluding various charges, the picture looked brighter.
Priceline, which has dismissed about 35 percent of its staff since November, said its loss narrowed to $6.25 million on that basis, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.28 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The consensus among Wall Street analysts was that excluding revamping and other charges, Priceline would post a loss of 5 cents a share. 
Based on current trends, the company said that excluding charges it expected to report a profit of 1 cent to 2 cents a share in the second quarter. 
In addition to a sharp reduction in employees, Priceline has reduced office space by almost two-thirds and postponed new business expansion indefinitely. Virtually all of its efforts are focused on its travel business. 
Last year the company, based in Norwalk, Conn., was plagued by customer complaints, criticism of its airline ticket process, the closing of affiliated grocery and gasoline-sales businesses and the departure of key executives, including Jay S. Walker, its founder.
During a conference call with analysts, Priceline executives said they expected to beat their target of cutting operating expenses by $35 million, and reaffirmed the company's expectations of 10 to 15 percent revenue growth in the second quarter from the first quarter.
Compared with the fourth quarter of 2000, first-quarter revenue was up 18 percent.
Priceline said it added more than 890,000 customers during the first quarter. The company, founded three years ago, has a customer base of nearly 10 million. Repeat and new-customer demand accelerated through the first quarter, Priceline said. 
"We are pleased with our momentum as we enter the second quarter," Daniel H. Schulman, the company's chief executive, said. 
But he added that "we are still very much in turnaround mode." 
Mr. Schulman said that while softer economic conditions presented challenges, the slowdown carried positives as well. 
"Our customers become much more cost-conscious in this sort of environment," he said. "This plays right into our brand strength." 
Before the market opened yesterday, Anthony Noto, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, raised his rating and said the worst might be over for Priceline. 
In a telephone interview after the company conference call, Mr. Noto said "sequential results comparisons suggest things likely will get better from here."
"The more Internet companies can exceed their guidance on revenues and earnings the more they will improve their credibility. The stock market's reaction is telling you it thinks the chances of Priceline's becoming profitable in the second quarter are very good."

Different Class Of Resumes In Jobless Line

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J. 

 BODY:
JULIO SALINAS has worked in business most of his adult life, so it was hardly surprising that he showed up at the office yesterday morning wearing a summer-weight suit and patterned tie. What was surprising was that the office, in this case, was the unemployment office.
 Mr. Salinas, 59, a veteran beverage marketing employee, managed a money transfer company in Morristown, N.J., for the last three years. But at the end of March, he was laid off, along with 4 of the company's 13 other employees. He has left jobs in the past, he said, but "the other times I changed to increase my salary." 
 This time, after knocking on doors in vain for a month, he has even begun visiting factories. "I don't have to work in a jacket," he said.
The bottom is not falling out of the economy, but the line at the state unemployment benefits office on North Broad Street here illustrates how the slump has begun to sideline those used to going to work in jackets, pumps or any shoes without steel toes.
A visit to the same unemployment office a year ago found the line slightly shorter, but much less varied. Last spring, it was full of the hard-core unemployed and people who had left one job, confident that another would come along soon. One woman in line then had been temporarily laid off from that very unemployment office.
Yesterday, the line harbored refugees from a different economic stratum: administrative assistants, a buyer for a recently defunct chain of clothing stores, a recently laid-off manager for a sheet metal manufacturer, a banking services employee leveled by a huge layoff.
"A year ago, could I have imagined myself standing in an unemployment office?" asked Janet Brady, 42, who lost her job when the auto leasing company she worked for shut down. "Not really."
Optimism didn't evaporate with the good times, though, and seems to be keeping the recently unemployed here from despair. But suddenly, former office workers and former warehouse workers find themselves straddling the same fault line. "I feel like a rent-a-worker," said Ed Blasz czak, a lift truck operator who reeled off a resume impressive in its length.
A middle-aged woman, laid off from her job as an administrative assistant for a Fortune 500 company where she worked for 30 years, felt the same way. "It's quite a shock," she said, holding a publication called The Employment Guide. "I never had to look for a job. I never had to write a resume."
No massive layoff rocked Union County, which includes Wall Street-fed suburbs like Summit, the working-class city of Elizabeth and much in between. Its March unemployment rate of 4.1 percent is slightly above New Jersey's 3.8 percent and just below the 4.3 percent national rate. But the cumulative effect of downsizings and company failures is evident in the job-search applications of people recently laid off that cross the desk of Donna Westbrook, who oversees the state's unemployment operation here.
IT'S a varied crop," she said, reading through last week's applications. A stock transfer company employee who had been making $33,500. A $45,000-a-year human resources officer for a business systems company. A personal computer specialist who had made $54,000.
"I've got an 85K person in front of me," she said of a consumer services director laid off from a communications company. "We weren't getting PC specialists laid off last year." 
Ms. Westbrook saw the layoffs as only the beginning of a wave of new clients. But on the unemployment line it was anyone's guess how much the tremors would ultimately disrupt their lives.
Torie Murphy, 27, was laid off last Friday from her job as an administrator at a medical supply company. She went to work there after quitting college, abandoning her first loves -- the flute, the piccolo, the clarinet and the oboe -- because "you can't feed yourself in music." But the boom gave her a nice salary, which she is now afraid she will not be able to match. 
Living in the style to which everyone became accustomed in boom times may be an unrealistic expectation. Janet Brady, the laid-off auto leasing employee, was expressing concern about paying for family vacations and for college and private school tuition for her children.
She doesn't envision devastation, but she and her husband are uneasy. Her children -- bred in the boom -- are, in her word, oblivious. "They take a lot for granted," she said.
But after all, who didn't?

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate; 
New Economy Revives Printing House's Old Look

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Sometimes, an office building tells its own story, if you know how to read it. Crowning the 11-story Romanesque structure at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 20th Street, for example, are the letters "MBC."
 They speak of a time when 150 Fifth Avenue -- a stout, red-brick presence among limestone-white neighbors -- was the Methodist Book Concern, a vital hub of Methodism, whose press room, composing room and bindery turned out thousands of books, tracts and periodicals for nearly half a century. 
 It will become a hub again, in the vision of its new owners, who have signed up the building's first large tenant in decades: Digital Island, a computer network company based in San Francisco. It has taken two floors, roughly one-fifth of the building. 
For many years, 150 Fifth Avenue was a utilitarian property filled with small tenants paying relatively low rents. What renovation occurred was unsympathetic, like the addition of a flat marble entrance arch that obscured the ruggedly rusticated pink granite original.
That great granite arch has been revealed again by the new owners. Soon, layers of beige-gray paint will have been removed from the pink stone base. The lobby is to get a new silver-leaf, barrel-vaulted ceiling and glass walls with a textured surface meant to recall the stonework outside.
"The idea was somehow to find the balance between modern use and a 19th-century building," said David W. Levinson, the chairman of L & L Acquisitions (Robert Lapidus is the other L), which bought 150 Fifth Avenue last summer for $37.5 million in a joint venture with Carlyle Realty of Washington.
They have undertaken a $6 million renovation, designed by HLW International, and are asking rents around $55 a square foot annually. The building is being leased and managed by Insignia/ESG, of which Mr. Levinson is a vice chairman and Mr. Lapidus is a senior managing director.
Taking advantage of expiring leases, the new owners have reduced the number of tenants to 50 from about 125 and have moved other tenants around the building, opening up full 20,000-square-foot floors for the likes of Digital Island.
The building has changed hands several times. It was briefly owned by the developer Harry Macklowe. He sold it to Leon H. Charney, a lawyer and real estate investor who is best known as the host of "The Leon Charney Report," a current-affairs television program.
"I thought that area was really becoming Silicon Valley," Mr. Charney recalled. But when he started talking with e-commerce tenants two years ago, he detected that "something was waning." After holding on to 150 Fifth Avenue for about a year, he sold it to L & L and Carlyle.
Clearly pleased to bring a new media company into this old media landmark, but cautious about the long-term prospects of e-tenants, the owners required Digital Island to post a letter of credit equal to two years' rent.
As the renovation proceeds, long-obscured features emerge: Ionic column capitals at the 20th Street entrance and 11 skylights on the upper floors, perhaps installed to illuminate the printers' composing tables.
"It's been a treasure hunt," Mr. Levinson said, although workers have yet to uncover the lead time capsule placed under the cornerstone on May 23, 1888, containing copies of all the religious weeklies of the day.
The Methodist Book Concern furnished reading material to church members and helped support ministers, who received liberal commissions for selling the publications. "The preachers still feel the need of the press as their most potent ally in their work," said The Methodist Review in 1889.
The Fifth Avenue headquarters, designed by Edward Hale Kendall, was completed in 1890 and was expanded in 1900 and 1909, when a penthouse was added with decorative pilasters bearing the "MBC" initials amid religious icons.
After a 1939 merger that created the Methodist Church, the Book Concern moved to Nashville, where it still operates as the United Methodist Publishing House. It kept a bookstore and wholesale office at 150 Fifth Avenue until 1962.
Seven years ago, the building reclaimed a bit of its publishing heritage with the arrival of the Harvard University Press. In a 900-square-foot office, Joyce Seltzer, a senior executive editor, acquires and edits books and meets authors, agents and out-of-town visitors whose travel plans may not include Cambridge, Mass. She has one assistant.
"Not a lot of places have space for smaller tenants," Ms. Seltzer said. "This was one of the few buildings that did, so we were very lucky."
To permit renovation, the Harvard University Press office was moved within the building into a new space that the owners "put into terrific shape," Ms. Seltzer said. Its lease was extended to October 2002.
"Now, of course, I have to wait to see what happens," she said. "Everything will depend on the economy."

HEADLINE: A Bargain Rent That May Prove Costly 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
When it comes to campaign headquarters, they don't come much better than the one Mark Green has found for his mayoral campaign. It is a rambling 4,000-square-feet warren on the third floor of the Graybar Building, a quick walk from Grand Central Terminal and smack in the middle of Midtown. He is renting it for a very attractive $32 a square foot, compared with the nearly $53 his landlord had sought for the same space just six months ago.
 And best of all, Mr. Green doesn't have to worry about any hassles from his landlord at 420 Lexington Avenue. The landlord, S. L. Green Realty, is controlled by his older brother, Stephen. 
 In a year in which all the mayoral candidates have been looking for ways to cut costs and avoid bumping against the stringent spending ceilings imposed by the city campaign finance law, economizing on campaign space is proving to be a particularly fruitful way to go. But it may well catch the attention of auditors from the city's Campaign Finance Board, who are monitoring compliance with campaign finance laws.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, is running his campaign out of a fifth-floor office on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, in space that does not even have its own bathroom. Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, has yet to rent a campaign office at all. He says he is happy working from a desk in his campaign consultant's office, spending money instead on television advertisements.
Mr. Green, who is the New York public advocate, finds himself in a particularly economical situation, in an ideally situated building that his 63-year-old brother, one of his more aggressive fund-raisers, purchased three years ago.
Mr. Green's aides and S. L. Green executives asserted that the $32-a-square-foot cost for Suite 335 was fair market value, since Mr. Green had agreed to move immediately into what otherwise would be vacant space, without demanding any improvements in the run-down offices and with the presumption that he would be out by the end of the year.
"We are paying nearly $14,000 a month in rent, well more than any other campaign," said Mr. Green's spokesman, Joe DePlasco. He noted that Mr. Hevesi was not paying a cent of rent, and added: "We pay fair-market range for the short-term use of unrenovated and otherwise vacant space. Especially since S. L. Green owns the building, we made every effort to make sure we are paying a more than adequate amount for this kind of space and that everything is fully disclosed."
But Pat Wrenn, a partner with Hinden, Sievers & Company, the accounting firm that vacated the space last September, said his firm moved to the Empire State Building after S. L. Green sought to raise his rent from about $28 to about $53 a square foot when the firm's five-year lease expired last year. Mr. Wrenn called the rent demand "exorbitant." Mr. Green's campaign moved in about three months after he left.
Other real estate agents said the asking rents for the Graybar Building ranged from $50 to $55 a square foot, even on low floors. According to CoStar Realty Information, a real estate database, there is vacant space in the building that is advertised for $51 to $55 per square foot, plus electricity. Gerry Nocera, the executive vice president at S. L. Green, said that the building was about 95 percent occupied, and that space had recently been renting for about $50 per square foot, though that figure did not reflect discounts given by the owners to tenants who were renovating their offices.
In addition to his main headquarters, Mr. Green has rented a separate fund-raising space -- 1,200 feet on the fifth floor -- in the same building since January 1999. He pays $21 a square foot for that space.
In the lease, Mr. Green agreed to a clause that allows the landlord, who is renovating the building, to make him move to another space with just 45 days' notice -- an upheaval that has happened three times, Mr. DePlasco said. By contrast, Mr. Green is assured his main campaign space on the third floor through this year, since renovation is not supposed to begin until 2002.
The question of fair rent has historically been a murky one when it comes to campaigns, and it raises a thicket of potential questions under the city's campaign finance law. If the board audits Mr. Green and concludes that he is paying below-market rent for his space, it could cause a number of complications.
For one thing, corporations are not allowed to make direct or in-kind contributions, like rent subsidies, to candidates. If the board concludes that Mr. Green is paying below the market rate, it can compute what it believes is a fair rent and apply that against Mr. Green's campaign spending limit, which is $5.23 million for the primary.
Nicole A. Gordon, the head of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, declined to comment on the specifics of Mr. Green's case, but said that auditors routinely examined campaign finances, sometimes randomly and sometimes based on complaints from newspaper articles or other candidates. In that case, she said, "you do have to evaluate what the market value is."
"There may be a lot of things that affect that," she said, "and I'm not in a position to judge that particular space. The general rule on getting space, or anything of value, is that you either have to pay the market value, or the difference between market value and what you're paying will be considered an in-kind campaign contribution."
An attorney for Mr. Green's campaign, John Siegal, said: "When the campaign was negotiating a lease, I reviewed it from the perspective as to how the campaign board would look at it. I was satisfied that it was in the fair-market range."
Mr. Hevesi pays his consultant, Hank Morris, $5,000 a month, a fee that includes the use of his office, Mr. Morris said. According to a Newsday report last month, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, pays about $1,100 a month to sublet offices on Park Avenue South from a company controlled by Dennis Mehiel, who is chairman of his campaign. Mr. Ferrer is paying $2,523 a month for his space in the Bronx.

HEADLINE: Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal 

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN 

 BODY:
Duke Energy, a power-generating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during California's year-old energy crisis, has secretly offered Gov. Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the state's chaotic electricity markets.
 The proposed settlement, outlined in documents prepared in March by Duke's lawyers, calls for an end to various state investigations, private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging. 
 In return, Duke would make an unspecified "appropriate payment" but admit no wrongdoing.
"Duke is committed to sharing pain" and "expediting high-level confidential discussions that would embrace the governor's political and public relations needs," according to the documents, which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly. 
Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday, and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon. But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because, he said, they have penalized the state with excessive prices.
"My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a 50 percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you," Mr. Davis said, so "you're going to have to have a very substantial reduction" in what the companies are owed.
Mr. Davis said Duke had walked in with "a number of demands," including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen.
"We're not about to call off the dogs," said the governor, a Democrat who will seek re-election next year.
Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., is a major investor in California's wholesale electricity market, having spent more than $1 billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in 1996.
It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging. Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund $20 million in disputed charges this year, an amount that is third-highest among federally regulated companies in the California market.
By entering secret negotiations with Mr. Davis and being the first generator to settle, Duke could gain a public-relations advantage, in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobacco-litigation wars.
"We've just simply tried to be part of the solution," Richard B. Priory, Duke's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview, adding that the company was "offering ideas" and "throwing in suggestions."
Publicly, Mr. Davis has disparaged out-of-state electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately. In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times, he called the generators "the biggest snakes on the planet Earth" for their pricing practices.
California's electricity costs have risen to about $28 billion last year from $7 billion in 1999. By some estimates, they could approach $70 billion this year -- $2,000 for every resident. The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric, which is now in bankruptcy court. 
The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power. To pay those bills, Mr. Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history, $12 billion, although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher.
The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the state's taxpayers off the hook. But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers, utilities and generators, and whether the bond issue can even succeed, remain unanswered questions. A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis, according to state officials, utility executives and economists, is the secrecy surrounding the administration's negotiations.
Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state. On Monday, the administration released a 67-page financial analysis, including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts. Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr. Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue. The bill could come up for a vote later this week.
"The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached," said Senator Joseph L. Dunn, a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes.
Mr. Davis, in the interview, said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential.
The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets, where the bonds would have to be sold. The state's credit rating, while still solid, is slipping.
Already companies that do business with California, like Duke, are citing the state's creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state, though the state has stepped in as buyer since February.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay $125 million in refunds. The companies -- including Duke, Reliant Energy, Dynegy Inc. and the Williams Company -- deny any wrongdoing and cite the state's credit situation as one reason for the high prices.
Mr. Priory, the Duke chairman, said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the so-called "credit premium" it now charges on power sales. As of March 7, Duke was owed more than $100 million by the state's power managers, documents show.
In its confidential submission to Mr. Davis and his aides, Duke said it would "forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables, or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges." 
The documents do not give an amount, but Duke's 2000 annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off $110 million for power sales to California that had not been collected. (Even with that write-off, the unit's profits before taxes doubled from 1999 to 2000, and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year.)
Duke's "preliminary global settlement template" of March 9 goes on: "Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis, without admitting legal liability, because Duke has done nothing illegal."
Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets, not the more volatile and higher-priced spot markets. But Mr. Priory also noted in his interview that at least 10 percent was sold for "whatever the market price is."
On March 23, Duke's lawyer, at the request of Mr. Davis's legal affairs secretary, forwarded to the governor's office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California. The documents show that a top Duke priority is the "prompt suspension of state investigations, lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation," as well as the withdrawal of state-related claims at the federal energy commission.
Also in March, the operators of the state's power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than $6 billion above competitive prices over the previous 10 months. Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn.
The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general, William Lockyer, and the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Barry P. Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary, says he subsequently referred Duke's lawyer to the attorney general's office. The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing. Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lockyer, said, "Our investigation is ongoing."
Loretta Lynch, the president of the utility commission, said in a telephone interview yesterday, "The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong."
The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance.
Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr. Davis.

HEADLINE: A Clinic Just as Busy As the Runways; 
40,000 J.F.K. Medical Visits a Year

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
It is remarkable, really, the number of bones, tendons and ligaments that endure a smashing each week at Kennedy International Airport.
 But there they are, in a pile of X-rays, the baggage handler whose left hand got caught in a conveyor belt, the passenger who did not believe a sign warning that rolling bags do not belong on escalators, the cabdriver whose rival for a fare thought the best method of negotiation involved an empty soda bottle and a closed fist. 
 Radiology plays a large role in the daily clinical life at the Kennedy Medical Office, just a few miles from the runways, but there is plenty else: diagnosing rare strains of H.I.V. and malaria and other diseases, treating an airplane full of flight attendants overcome by someone's awful perfume (yes, this happened), aiding family members suffering severe psychic trauma over the loss of a loved one in a plane crash. 
The Kennedy Medical Office is the largest and most complex airport health care system in the country, with a staff of 60 people -- many of them multilingual -- a 24-hour schedule and 40,000 visits a year, including physical examinations and drug testing for airline employees. 
The medical center, which is owned and operated by St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, in many ways reflects the shifting dynamics of air travel in recent years. A well-traveled public, crammed into economy class, is increasingly showing up with deep vein thrombosis, potentially life-threatening blood clots that can form in the legs from inactivity.
Fear and loathing among the traveling public over missed connections and lost baggage translates into increased head injuries from falling bags that should never have been shoved into the overhead. And manic expansion throughout the airport has taken a toll on construction workers, who now make up roughly 25 percent of the clinic's patients, up from almost none a few years ago.
Travelers often present the most complicated cases, from odd tropical diseases to a belly full of drugs that requires an X-ray, followed by an arrest. Sometimes patients cannot speak English. Often, their illnesses would befuddle even the most astute Manhattan hospital staff, which is not prepared to see what is possibly Ebola in its midst.
"Millions of people come in here who can't speak English and have very weird diseases," said Dr. Steven C. Garner, who, as St. Vincent's chief medical officer, oversees the clinic. "You need to have a high degree of suspicion. If someone from Florida comes in with gastrointestinal problems, you might think E. coli. But if they just came in from Nigeria, you need to think about what is endemic there." 
About 60 percent of the clinic's patients are people who work in and around the airport, many of them injured on the job. Roughly 20 percent are passengers. The rest are an assortment of people who live in nearby neighborhoods in Queens like Ozone Park and Howard Beach and whom the clinic has reached out to for its patient base.
It does offer a remarkably comprehensive selection of services, in a no-frills environment that finds aesthetic like-mindedness with the neighboring cargo loading area. There are doctors of primary care, ophthalmology, physical therapy and podiatry, a chiropractor and a program that provides vaccinations for people traveling overseas.
Joseph Vecchio, a former airport warehouse security guard, came in the other day to have his legs tested with a fairly unusual Doppler device that can detect clots. The clinic has been his primary care center since 1988. "I really wouldn't change doctors," he said. "I like it here."
Because the clinic has fewer Medicaid and uninsured patients than the hospital's other primary care sites, it is one of the few in the Catholic system that break even.
But Kennedy Medical Office's main business is generated by the sprawling community that makes up the airport. The center contracts with 400 airlines to give their employees physicals, random drug tests and eye exams. Many airport workers seek physical therapy or X-rays for on-the-job injuries, like those of Syed Haq, an airline agent who had a forklift land on his foot. (Bruise, pain, no break.) Ferreting out drug smugglers is a service to customs.
Pilots come to Dr. Jeffrey Hilowitz, an optometrist, who gives eye exams in a seat that simulates a cockpit and designs trifocals especially for them: the middle lens focuses on the instrument panel, the bottom is for the approach plates, those clipboards that pilots refer to on their approach, and the top lens corrects distance vision. 
Dr. Hilowitz is slightly frenetic and apparently optically obsessed, poring over his trifocals and eye charts with a passion that professional cooks reserve for rare shipments of fatty tuna.
"With pilots, you need to overcorrect nearsightedness because they look five miles out," he said. "LensCrafters? They don't know about these things. Trifocals? They never heard of them. I also do injuries, debris, that sort of thing." (Well, LensCrafters does know trifocals, but maybe not these trifocals.)
Odd airport health fact No. 1: Pilots should not fly for six hours after taking Viagra. The drug diminishes their ability to distinguish between blue and green, the main colors used in cockpits and airport lighting. 
Dr. Garner said that every day brings new cases from travelers, but by far the largest increase is in injuries that stem from too many passengers in too much of a hurry. Patients have often been conked in the head by luggage, are suffering a disease picked up abroad, or have gone into labor at customs. (Many of those are women who come to the United States to have their babies, who are automatically citizens.)
Erica Sellon, 21, was on a plane preparing to leave for London, where she is stationed in the Navy. She realized she had a urinary tract infection and was not going to make it. "I knew I would flip if I had to sit here for six hours like this," she said. 
Dr. Garner, who is trained in emergency medicine and radiology, sometimes reads X-rays in the middle of the night, between his duties at St. Vincent's 8 hospitals and 60 ambulatory sites. His interest in flight medicine has meant that the airport clinic is a pet project. "If someone comes in this place," he said, "they should get the same standard of care that they get at St. Vincent's or anywhere else."
The other day, he ripped through a dozen or so X-rays, dictating his diagnoses into a Dictaphone at an incomprehensible rate. A construction worker suffered a hand injury when a grinder fell on him. A twisted ankle. The conveyor belt incident.
"PatientNumber232nondisplacedfractureblahblahblah." A hand crushed between two packages, a sprained neck from lifting boxes. A young man who was fishing in Jamaica Bay in Queens and got a hook in his hand. A saleswoman who tried to prevent one customer from throwing a clothing rack at another and for her troubles got a broken hip. 
Odd airport health fact No. 2: A flight from New York to Los Angeles is the radiological equivalent to getting a chest X-ray. Should you care? Doubtful.
At the front desk of the medical center rests a red telephone. It rings each morning, as a test. Everyone expects that. No one wants to hear it ring later. But about three times a week a "33" comes through -- a call from the airport ordering all staff members to stand by because of the possibility of a crash. Of course, 99 percent of the time, nothing happens. Sometimes, when a plane has engine trouble or another problem that sets off the warning, a passenger who has a twisted ankle or is just panicky needs help.
In 10 years, there have been only three "34's," full plane crashes, at the airport, and no fatalities. (The clinic did provide assistance to grieving families from the Trans World Airlines Flight 800, Swissair and EgyptAir disasters.)
Each year, the clinic, with the Fire Department and other agencies, has a mock drill in preparation for a crash. A plane is set up far down the tarmac, and Boy and Girl Scouts who volunteer as passengers lie about the area "bleeding" and moaning. All are tagged to denote the severity of their injuries, and flares and smoke are provided for true effect. Clinic workers concede that this training exercise can be creepy, if effective.
Odd airport health fact No. 3: The clinic sees far more heart attack victims on Mondays than on any other day of the week. Something about people being stressed out about going back to work for the week, on a plane to boot.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL; 
The Two Major League Teams in Florida Would Not Be Missed

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Besides payroll disparity, the term heard most often in baseball these days is contraction. This has nothing to do with combining words with an apostrophe or women having babies. It has to do with jettisoning teams from the major leagues, reducing the number from 30 to whatever, in the owners' view, makes economic sense.
 Here is one view that says it will never happen. But if Commissioner Bud Selig is intent on trying to take that severe step, here is a modest proposal: lop Florida off the major league map and no one will miss it. 
 The Florida Marlins, the state's first team, had a chance to make it until their original owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, destroyed their future. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays, as they seem to be turning out, never really had a chance to make it. Vince Naimoli, the businessman who worked so hard to secure an expansion franchise on the state's west coast, is also guilty of undermining its growth. Maybe major league baseball was never meant for Florida, that is, major league baseball played from April through September. Major league baseball has always been popular in Florida in March, but that's spring training.
Both the Devil Rays and the Marlins have suffered steady attendance declines, the Devil Rays since their first season in 1998, the Marlins since 1997, their World Series championship season. Last season the Marlins drew about half the fans they attracted en route to their championship.
Three theories are often offered for the teams' problems: 1. Most baseball fans in Florida remain fans of the teams in the cities from which they migrated; 2. The state has too many elderly people whom they can't lure to games at night or in the summer heat; and 3. Fans are accustomed to paying far less for tickets to exhibition games and don't want to buy the more expensive tickets for regular-season games.
Whatever the reasons, though, Floridians just aren't interested enough to support the teams. Last season, the attendance for 14 teams, half of the other 28 teams, exceeded 2,767,378, the combined attendance of the Devil Rays in St. Petersburg and the Marlins in Miami.
Some people in baseball foresaw the disaster the Devil Rays have become. Between the time the franchise was awarded and the time the team began playing, some owners privately expressed concern that a mistake was being made. If a second team were going to play in Florida, they said, it should be in Orlando or halfway between Orlando and Tampa. They can't have a do-over, so Major League Baseball doesn't know if those owners were right, but they were right about St. Petersburg. Of course, no matter where the team had wound up, if it had been operated the same way, its troubles would very likely be no different.
It was Naimoli's way of running the team that roused the ire of his five partners and prompted them to act to remove him as managing partner. They succeeded in their effort last week after baseball officials finally understood the depth of their anger and their concerns for the franchise's future.
Naimoli is no longer in charge, although to hear him explain the development at his news conference last Friday, a listener would think the change was all his idea. "I've got to tell you," he said, "this is one of the happier days of my life."
The man was spinning so hard, he nearly spun himself into the ground. But he stopped whirling long enough to go to Detroit to join the Devil Rays for their weekend series against the Tigers. It just so happens that John McHale, whom the Devil Rays partners seek for the newly created position of chief operating officer, works for the Tigers.
Learning that Naimoli was in Detroit and talking to the news media about the search for an executive ("I'm looking for a C.O.O.," he was quoted as saying. "I'm getting a list of candidates together."), the partners, angry again, called Major League Baseball to ask to have Naimoli cease and desist.
"He's not allowed to do this on his own," said a person involved with the Devil Rays partnership.
McHale, a baseball official said yesterday, is scheduled to be in the Tampa Bay area tomorrow to talk to all of the partners and complete an agreement that will bring him there permanently. But the Devil Rays themselves might not be there permanently. Across the state, meanwhile, the Marlins are scrambling to get a new ballpark as the only way to salvage their franchise. They are not having a whole lot of success. 
The next three days are critical because the Marlins need the state Senate to approve a sales-tax rebate bill that would fund one-quarter to one-third of the estimated $385 million cost of the proposed 40,000-seat retractable-roof park. The appropriations committee has overwhelmingly approved the bill, but the senate president has refused to bring it to the floor because another committee has said the measure would have an impact on the state budget.
The time for the Marlins to win approval for funds for a new park was in the euphoric aftermath of the 1997 World Series, but Huizenga, a successful businessman but a failure at practical politics, shattered that chance by decimating the team. Selig, at the time, begged Huizenga not to do what he planned, but history shows the owner ignored the commissioner. The Marlins have paid for the decision ever since.
If the team fails to persuade the senate president to schedule a vote on the bill before midnight Friday, the chances for a new stadium will disappear.

Myers Now Predicts Drop in Ad Spending

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
A leading media forecaster has reduced his estimate for American advertising spending in 2001, predicting for the first time a decline for this year from 2000.
 Jack Myers, chief economist at Myers Reports in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters and reports, estimated that ad spending would fall 1.5 percent this year from last year. 
In December, he predicted that ad spending in 2001 would increase 4.9 percent from 2000, when spending rose a robust 9 percent from 1999. In April, he trimmed his 2001 forecast by more than half, to an increase of 2.4 percent. 
 The most recent revision is being made because the decline in the national economy "is much deeper and of longer duration than we anticipated," Mr. Myers said, adding, "We are in a genuine advertising recession, and we can expect some radical belt-tightening and shifting of business plans and strategies."
For 2002, Mr. Myers reduced forecasts he made in December and April, when he predicted ad spending would grow 2.2 percent from 2001. Now, he forecasts an increase next year of a scant 0.2 percent from this year.

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The Bank of Canada cut its projection for economic growth this year to 2 to 3 percent from a February forecast of about 3 percent and nearly 5 percent last year. 
But it saw no evidence of recession. "I think it is fair to say the general view is the risks are perceived to be lower today than four or five weeks ago," a bank governor, David Dodge, said after the release of the bank's monetary policy report. The report repeated previous forecasts that Canada's slowing economy would pick up in the second half of 2001 and revive further in 2002, provided the economy in the United States picked up.

HEADLINE: TRENDS; 
More Women and Minorities Entering Ranks of Business Ownership

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
More women, blacks and Hispanics are choosing a workplace where they call the shots, according to results from a census of businesses. The number of businesses owned by women, blacks and Hispanics grew at a faster rate than that of all businesses in the mid-1990's, continuing a trend seen in previous years. 
 Despite the gains, the diversity of business ownership still does not reflect America's ethnic mix. Blacks, who accounted for 12 percent of the population in the 2000 census, owned just 4 percent of businesses in 1997, while Hispanics, who made up 13 percent of the population, owned just 6 percent. All three groups earned a much smaller share of total business revenue than their numbers suggest, in part because so many businesses had no paid employees aside from the owner. 
 The District of Columbia had the highest share of companies owned by women and blacks, and New Mexico had the highest share of businesses owned by Hispanics, a reflection of their population makeup, said Eddie Salyers, chief of the economic census branch of the Census Bureau.
 Past surveys have shown a high proportion of businesses owned by blacks have also been owned by women, said Mr. Salyers, explaining why Washington ranked high in the overall share of women-owned busi-nesses. In 1992, he noted, 45 percent of black-owned busi-nesses were owned by women. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

BYLINE:  By Jayson Blair (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Vindigo, a wireless-technology company based in New York, said yesterday that it had laid off some employees because of its failure to meet revenue projections, which it attributed to the economic slowdown in the technology sector. Vindigo is a privately held company backed by General Atlantic Partners and Flatiron Partners. 
The company is best known for its free Vindigo software, which allows users to find restaurants, stores and entertainment in 20 major cities. Jason Devitt, the chief executive and a founder of Vindigo, said that the job reductions will not mean the elimination of any services. Mr. Devitt, who declined to reveal the number of jobs being eliminated, called the layoffs "unfortunate" but necessary because of the slowdown. "I don't know any company that has not been affected by this," he said. Jayson Blair (NYT)

Ups and Downs? A Place To Put It in Perspective

BYLINE:  By LYNNE ARANY 

 BODY:
WHILE the questions nowadays are usually more sophisticated than the old standby "How many people jumped to their deaths in the Great Crash of '29?," in these bearish times it is comforting to know that the Museum of American Financial History, just off Wall Street, has an answer: not many. (The economist John Kenneth Galbraith researched the matter and determined that there was no increase in the suicide rate that year.) 
 It was that quest for context -- and for "reassurance in times of market uncertainty," in the words of the museum's executive director, Brian Thompson -- that inspired its founding in 1988, the year after the stock market took a major tumble. 
 In a world where the ups and downs of the Dow are as inescapable as the weather, the museum, now a Smithsonian affiliate, seeks to help visitors understand the deeper economic forces that help shape their lives. 
Exhibitions like "Rockefeller Rediscovered" and "Morgan" (as in J. P.) allow visitors to trace a line from the robber barons of the industrial age to the day traders of today. The technology changes with the times, too, from interactive CNNfn consoles to an original 1867 Edison Universal Stock Ticker. And there are historic stocks and bonds, vintage photographs and personal ephemera. 
Appropriately enough, the museum is housed in the Rockefeller dynasty's old power base, the former Standard Oil Building, and is just a dime toss from the famous buttonwood tree under which the New York Stock Exchange was founded in 1792.

Inflation Creates a New Breed of Movers and Shakers

BYLINE:  By MELISSA MILGROM 

 BODY:
WITH only days before the opening of a group show, P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center had a 12-ton problem. The 25-foot swimming pool from Tuscany had arrived on schedule, but the outhouse from Rotterdam and the life-size ceramic elephant from Rome were held up at Port Elizabeth, N.J., because of a snowstorm. 
 Finally, the delayed cargo arrived, and a team of art handlers, riggers, registrars and curators hurried to unpack the containers and install the show by March 11. 
 For four frantic days, the museum, in a converted school in Long Island City, Queens, resembled a construction site. Inside, cut-glass experts pieced together a hand-blown chandelier, while a ceramist diagrammed how to uncrate Luigi Ontani's elephant. 
Outside, two barefoot Italians dug a trench in half-frozen mud for Massimo Bartolini's swimming pool. Nearby, a crane hoisted Joep van Lieshout's outhouse onto its second-story platform as if it were a rooftop air-conditioner.
"This is the fourth outhouse I've moved," said Peter Lundberg, who was operating the crane. "But as art, it's the first one."
Art has always moved the masses, but it takes a cadre of specialists to move massive art. The process is both brutal and exacting, requiring riggers and art handlers to be part forklift operator, part mechanic, part engineer, part diplomat and part conservator. With all the variables, it is not surprising that museums rely on experts, usually outside contractors, to do the work. 
"We get paid to take risks and for some know-how," said Eddie MacAveney, an owner of More Transport, which specializes in moving art. 
No two pieces of oversize art are alike, and installers must be improvising and resourceful. Thomas Ritter's gargantuan Maximog, a futuristic all-terrain vehicle, can virtually traverse any place on earth. Except the Museum of Modern Art. Bringing it into the museum for a recent show required removing its wheels, bumper and gasoline (flammable liquids are not allowed in the museum). 
Riggers then maneuvered it sideways into the freight elevator and rolled the monster truck into position on dollies.
To minimize the challenges, art handlers research a piece's history before moving or installing the work. Still, certain artworks are astoundingly complex. 
"It takes a lot of effort to make something appear effortless," said Graham Stewart, who owns Art Crating, which specializes in moving oversize and complicated art.
Chris Burden's five-ton sculpture "Medusa's Head," which just came down at the Museum of Modern Art, is a gigantic orb whose fragile surface is crisscrossed with toy locomotive tracks that wind through intricate rock-encrusted tunnels. "It's an oversized Faberge egg," Mr. Burden said.
The sculpture travels with a 50-page instruction manual, a complement of tools and Mr. Burden's assistant, Spencer Stair, who has the piece memorized. 
"There are times when the work of contemporary artists tries the imagination of those of us who have to install it," said Jerome Neuner, director of exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art. Before hanging it, technicians had to X-ray the reinforced concrete ceiling to see if it could hold the load.
The more outlandish the art, the more extraordinary the demands of installation. When installing Damien Hirst's dioramas-cum-aquariums filled with freshwater fish at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea last year, art handlers in scuba masks and snorkels had to dive into the tanks to arrange props the fish had knocked down.
Some works are so imposing the museum is altered to accommodate them. Facades are torn down, ceilings removed, garage doors concealed behind temporary walls. To install Rubens's 19-by-14-foot artwork "The Assumption of the Virgin" for a 1985 exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art had to dismantle a steel door, frame and lintel and cut a 10-inch-deep, 50-foot-long groove across the ceilings of two galleries. Only then could 12 art handlers ease the canvas through the slot, up the Grand Stairway, into position. By the opening, the groove was gone -- only to reappear three months later, when the show came down and the process was reversed.
After a show, the exhibitions are prepared for transport. Climate-controlled crates are custom-built and expertly packed. The Met, for instance, has four employees who build crates and five workers who pack them. When lending a piece to another institution, museums color-code or brand the crates for easy tracking. Mr. van Lieshout's sculptures are actually made from shipping containers and can go directly onto a container ship or flatbed tractor-trailer without modification. Routinely, an installer, a courier or both will escort a piece. Despite the vigilance, accidents can happen. Friezes chip. Vases are knocked over. Paintings are vandalized. 
Occasionally the toll is human. In 1988, a rigger taking down a 16-ton sculpture by Richard Serra at the Castelli Gallery in SoHo lost his leg when it toppled onto him. In 1971 a worker installing a Serra at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis was killed when a two-ton steel plate fell on him. Mr. Serra was devastated by the fatality and could not work for a year. 
How a piece is moved is determined by its size, shape, materials, condition and value. The most difficult pieces to move are oddly shaped solid masses with fragile surfaces. For Mr. MacAveney of More Transport, a 400-pound plaster seashell coated in wax was far more difficult to move than the five huge Calder stabiles he transported at once. The Calders were disassembled and moved; the seashell was impossible to isolate in its crate without marring its surface.
When oversize art leaves a museum, it becomes heavy cargo. And that is how it is treated when it passes from cargo plane to boom crane to flatbed truck. A cargo ship is the least reliable method of transport because turbulent seas can slow travel and moisture can cause damage. The Met has not sent anything by ship since the late 1970's. Still, certain works are too huge for even the largest cargo plane, the Russian-made Antonov, which the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum occasionally uses to transport art to its museums in Venice, Berlin and Bilbao.
Each state has its own regulations regarding extra-wide loads, so hauling large sculptures across the country requires paperwork and planning. Last year, Mr. Hirst's supersize anatomical torso, "Hymn," arrived in New Jersey on a cargo ship the size of a small city. The seven-ton bronze was too wide to fit in the Lincoln Tunnel. Before it could be driven into Manhattan, transportation authorities flagged the load, provided escort cars, designated a route and reserved a time when it could cross the George Washington Bridge. "It's usually 4 a.m.," said Mr. Stewart, who handled the move.
SOME works are so valuable that moving them defies practicality. Expense means nothing when safeguarding, say, the 15 Vermeers that now hang at the Met. "You would never take the risk of putting the work of a single painter all on one plane," said the Metropolitan's chief registrar, Herb Moskowitz.
That museums are willing to undertake so much effort and expense for a temporary exhibition is remarkable. After all, as Franz Schmidt, the Met's manager for special projects, put it: "You're dealing with objects that cannot be replaced if they are damaged, broken or lost. You have insurance, but money cannot replace a chalice from the 10th century that was made for a czar or an emperor."
Through it all, the integrity of the artwork remains paramount. "The No. 1 rule is not to change the object," Mr. MacAveney said. "It's like that Hippocratic oath: 'Do no harm.' "

HEADLINE: The Good Times (Make That Not-So-Bad Times) Still Roll 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
IT remains to be seen how long the downturn in the economy will last, but museum directors seem to be prepared for the worst. Big donors have deep pockets, major art institutions say, and tend to keep giving regardless of swings in the market. Yet a recession mentality inevitably infects charitable giving. 
 "It's something we all give serious thought to," said Emily Rafferty, the senior vice president for external affairs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. "There's no question in a downturn you definitely will feel the hit. 
 "There isn't a fund-raiser around who wouldn't be concerned about it," she added. "We all hope that it's going to be short-lived." 
Indeed, the current cycle is a shock to the system after so many years of unprecedented prosperity. What happens to all the ambitious capital campaigns under way? The planned exhibitions? The expansions? Fortunately, museums say, they got while the getting was good, starting their major capital campaigns while plenty of money was floating around so that now they are nearing those goals rather than just beginning to set them.
The Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey, for example, is three-quarters of the way through its $18 million capital campaign, which will help the museum double in size and increase its endowment. "Basically, we have not seen any slack-off," said Bill Turner, a vice president who heads the museum's capital campaign. "I think if we lived on the West Coast in the dot-com world, maybe we would be more affected."
But even there, museums say their major donors include old money as well as new, and note that large technology companies now consider arts giving an integral part of their marketing strategies. "It's not just cosmetic," said David A. Ross, the director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. "Museums are part of the marketing plan. We're perceived as a bargain."
On the whole, many museums are in a wait-and-see mode -- not canceling construction and programs that are in the works, but hesitating before taking on new costly projects.
At the Studio Museum of Harlem, the director, Lowery Stokes Sims, said the board had instituted a mandatory contribution from board members (she would not disclose the amount) and added that the museum was putting a display window in its store in hopes of attracting strollers from 125th Street.
But the museum is not panicking, she said, adding: "I have so many other things to worry about. We will prevail."
Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, sounded a similar note. "Optimism comes to me more naturally than pessimism," he said. "I don't believe in self-fulfilling prophecies, but if everyone has formulated their thinking toward a downturn -- toward recession -- by and large we'll get there." 
Mr. Lehman said the museum was proceeding with its major initiatives -- redoing the main entrance on Eastern Parkway and making major changes in its permanent collections. "I don't think we're simply going to look at the Dow every day and say, 'We're going to postpone all of this,' " he said.
The Met said that its $650 million capital campaign would continue, and there would still be a new Byzantine Gallery, new restaurants and a new Roman court. "Right now, we're not looking at compromising," Ms. Rafferty said. "It's a question of scale, rather than particulars." 
In San Francisco, Mr. Ross acknowledged that it was unseemly for companies to make large gifts to the arts when they were firing some of their employees. But he said conversations about prospective donations continued -- "discreetly."
Some museum executives say the news media runs the danger of fanning the downturn into a full-blown recession. "We've had so many years of such tremendous prosperity that the media sees six months of negative returns and says, 'Oh, my God, there must be a problem,' " said Glenn D. Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. "But I don't think that's how people see it. People have come to see cultural institutions as a centerpiece in their lives."
Museums have been through bad times before and worked hard to insulate themselves from heavy weather on Wall Street. The key seems to be building a loyal constituency. "Museums have had to be very, very adept in binding their communities in good times and in bad times to their programs," Mr. Lowry said. "That's because we live and die by our ability to relate to our public. By and large, despite economic swings, people will support institutions they believe in."
T HROUGH audience research, marketing surveys and trial and error, Mr. Lowry went on, museums like the Modern have learned how to make themselves seem essential, not a luxury. "Embedding ourselves in the fabric of life so we're not seen as a discretionary activity -- museums have gotten very good at doing that," he said. "At the end of the day, no one has to go to a museum, but millions decide they want to." 
Museums also have the advantage of being affordable, compared with other places to spend. 
The last few years of boom times have allowed museums to build a strong financial base, setting records in membership and fund-raising. "We're looking at a 10 to 12 percent increase in annual giving," Mr. Lowry said. He added that the museum's capital campaign was approaching $500 million, the endowment was up to more than $400 million and attendance was up more than 20 percent above projections for the first quarter of 2001. Six years ago, a big day for the Modern was 3,000 visitors; now the museum averages more than 5,000. At the Whitney Museum of American Art, annual attendance almost doubled in the last two and half years, to about 600,000. 
Still, museums acknowledge, it is harder to raise money for unsexy costs like infrastructure and operating expenses than for cultural programs. As a result, they are careful to diversify their income, so if one source dries up, others may continue to flow. "We have many different legs to stand on," Mr. Lowry said.
The Studio Museum in Harlem recently received a grant of $750,000 from the Ford Foundation that depends on matching funds from individuals. The Met has worked to raise money for specific endowment funds that can go to exhibitions and programs "with the goal that we would be less reliant on corporate funding, which is harder to get in a down economy," Ms. Rafferty said.
"You can't look at the institution in fund-raising only," she added. "It's thinking for the next five years." 
Museums say they are not considering raising their suggested admission prices ($10 for most), but may consider cutting back in some areas, even as they build up others. For example, because the young donors who belong to the Met's Apollo Circle have been enthusiastic about the museum's mini-courses, Ms. Rafferty said, "We might offer more of them and eliminate one large event."
Nevertheless, museums acknowledge that although prepared, they have to work doubly hard to remain secure. "One always has to be as prescient as possible about anticipating the market," Ms. Rafferty said. "There is no one who thinks there is always an up economy."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Were Down Last Month 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 1 

 BODY:
Auto sales fell in April, providing the first important indicator of the economy's condition early in the second quarter and a sign that weakening consumer confidence is beginning to affect spending on high-price products.
 The auto industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.6 million vehicles, down 10 percent from a year earlier. Sales in April were a little higher than what the auto industry considers to be the long-term demand for new automobiles but below the annual rate of 17.2 million cars and light trucks in the first quarter. 
 Sales did not drop quite as much as expected as a few foreign automakers did very well, gaining market share at the expense of their Detroit-based rivals. Some European and Japanese automakers have used the dollar's strength to export cars and car parts more cheaply to the United States and have passed on part of the savings to consumers through discounted loans and leases while booking fatter profits, too. 
General Motors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler all posted declines in sales of 15 percent to 18 percent, compared with sales in April 2000. But Toyota reported an increase of 6.7 percent, while BMW's sales soared 30.5 percent.
Auto executives emphasized that they had been expecting a slowdown in the industry because of surveys showing a decline in consumer confidence but were nonetheless disappointed.
"It's about where we had projected the industry to be, but I have to say we've undercalled the industry now for so long that calling it correctly, you kind of feel, 'Man, that was a weak month,' " Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said in a telephone interview today.
Auto sales have long been a favorite indicator of the economy's health for many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. They are often the first indicator to come out just after a month ends, and they cover a broad swath of the economy that is particularly sensitive to public confidence, something that is often difficult to measure.
Because auto sales slowed markedly late last year and then rebounded fairly strongly in the first quarter of this year, in line with gross domestic product figures that have since been reported, auto sales have become a favorite indicator of executives far from Detroit as well.
"We've paid more attention to it over the last six months, that's for sure," said Michael Capellas, the chairman and chief executive of Compaq Computer, which is based in Houston. "The auto industry has always been a pretty good indicator of consumer confidence and continues to be."
Auto manufacturing is a big part of the American economy, accounting for a quarter of the combined economic output of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. 
Ford and G.M. made very different changes today in their production plans for the second quarter, presenting a blurry picture of the extent to which the auto industry can lead the economy out of a slowdown. Automakers need to rebuild dealership inventories, which were drawn down from January through March by strong sales and the idling of factories.
Ford, which announced an aggressive production schedule a month ago after idling many factories for a week or two at a time in the first quarter, said today that it would cut its planned production for the second quarter by 40,000 vehicles, to 1.19 million.
George Pipas, Ford's market analyst, said the automaker would eliminate costly overtime in June at two factories that make large pickup trucks and would extend to two weeks from one week a planned shutdown later this month at an Ohio factory that makes full-size vans.
But G.M., which had set a modest production schedule for the second quarter, said that it would add 36,000 cars to its plans while subtracting 4,000 vehicles from its planned output of light trucks, a category that encompasses sport utilities, minivans and pickup trucks.
Diane C. Swonk, the chief economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago, said that while auto output would be down from the second quarter of last year, the current quarter would still be the first three-month period since then with higher production than the preceding quarter. "The problems are bottoming out," she said, while adding that she was generally bullish about the economy right now.
Ford's sales dropped 15 percent in April from the level a year earlier, excluding its purchase of Land Rover last summer, while G.M.'s sales fell 15.7 percent. Chrysler suffered the biggest decline, with sales that were 18 percent off of last year's levels.
Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's chief executive and president, said on Monday that shortcomings in a new compensation plan for dealers had made them reluctant to order more vehicles. The compensation plan has been redesigned, and Chrysler announced today a wide range of rebates and discounted auto loans on Chryslers, Jeeps, Dodges and Plymouths.
Nissan's sales dropped 16.3 percent and the Mercedes division of DaimlerChrysler suffered a decline in sales of 7.5 percent, while Honda's sales slipped 2.9 percent. But Mitsubishi's sales climbed 8.9 percent.
Today's somewhat slower sales figures helped to resolve a mystery that had been troubling many here: why auto sales in the first quarter did not reflect surveys that showed declining consumer confidence, even though sales and the surveys have been closely correlated since the 1960's.
In an interview three weeks ago at the beginning of the New York International Auto Show, Ronald Zarrella, G.M.'s president of North American operations, remarked: "You wonder what happened -- do you throw away 35 years of history here? We don't understand it."

HEADLINE: Former F.C.C. Chief Joins Investment Firm 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
William E. Kennard, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has decided to join the Carlyle Group, an investment company, as a managing director of its telecommunications and media practice.
 Earlier this week, Carlyle announced that Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, would join the firm as a senior adviser dealing with private equity investments. 
The company also said that Afsaneh Mashayekhi-Beschloss, the treasurer and chief investment officer of the World Bank, would join the firm as a managing director and partner. 
 Mr. Kennard, who recently announced his intention to join the board of Handspring, a maker of hand-held computers, said that he was excited about the opportunities presented by Carlyle.
"The firm has a strong commitment to invest in the telecommunications and media areas," he said. "They really want to increase their commitment to the sector. They didn't make a lot of investments in the area last year so their powder's dry."
Carlyle, which calls itself the world's largest private equity company, manages more than $12 billion through funds in the United States, Europe and Asia. Its employees and advisers include some who have held high government positions, many in Republican administrations. 
They include former President George Bush, former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and former White House budget director Richard G. Darman.

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
The corporate jetbusiness is booming, even as the airlines complain about a softening economy.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THREE weeks ago, Warren Buffett, Richard Santulli and a bunch of our senior management people, we visited seven cities in Europe in three days," Kevin Russell said yesterday afternoon, describing what for most of us would have been the Business Trip From the Black Lagoon. 
 "Every day we had lunches and conferences in each city," he continued. "Day 1, we were in London and Paris. On Day 2, one group of us went to Cologne and a second group to Geneva. Then we all came back together in Frankfurt that night. Day 3, we all went to Geneva and Milan. That night, we got on a Boeing Business Jet in Milan at 1:45 in the morning and flew to New York, where Santulli went to an 11 o'clock meeting. Buffett flew on to Omaha for a business lunch the same day." 
 Mr. Russell's voice slid up a half-octave. "You think we could have done that flying commercial?" he asked. "Impossible!"
Mr. Russell is the senior vice president of Executive Jet Inc., the largest operator of private business jets and an innovator in the rapidly growing business of providing corporate jet service to companies that purchase fractional shares of an aircraft. In 1998, 11 years after the company was bought by Mr. Santulli, a former mathematics professor and Wall Street banker, Executive Jet was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway, the company controlled by Mr. Buffett. It now has a fleet of more than 900 business aircraft. 
For those fortunate enough to be able to fly that way, having a private jet available for business travel opens up possibilities and eliminates a lot of travail. In the last five years, as has been mentioned previously in this space, corporate jets -- once derided as symbols of decadence and wretched excess -- have become practical travel alternatives for a steadily growing number of companies. Among the reasons are ever-worsening commercial airline delays (450,000 last year, a record), rising business fares and airline scheduling that makes it difficult, as business interests expand geographically, to get from Point A to Points B and C -- especially if the destinations are not near major domestic and foreign cities with airline hubs.
Recently, of course, the airlines have been wailing about sagging profits as many companies have reacted to the softening economy by cutting back on business travel, the main source of revenue for the airline industry.
It would stand to reason that the cutbacks would affect the highest end of the business travel market, the corporate jet. But that doesn't seem to be happening.
During the first quarter of this year, as the airlines suffered, $2.1 billion in shipments of new business jets set a record, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, a trade organization. 
Some of that revenue increase is attributable to shipments of top-of-the-line business aircraft like the new airliner-like Boeing Business Jet. Companies took possession of five of these during the quarter, at a cost of $40 million to $50 million apiece, not to mention 18 long-range luxury Gulfstream IV-SP's and Gulfstream V's. Gulfstream is owned by General Dynamics.
But sheer numbers of jet deliveries were up as well. During the first quarter, 146 business jets were shipped to corporate customers, up 7.4 percent from the corresponding period last year, when the economy was percolating along, according to the trade group.
That's partly because of the robust growth -- about 50 percent annually during the last three years -- in companies that sell charter flights and fractional business-aircraft shares, including Executive Jet and competitors like FlightTime.com, which was founded in 1985.
For example, Executive Jet, which says it will schedule more than 200,000 flights this year, announced yesterday that it had placed a $2 billion order for 50 luxury midsize Galaxy business jets from General Dynamics, with an option for an additional 50. In the last six weeks, Mr. Russell said, Executive Jet has committed to aircraft orders totaling about $3.5 billion. 
The boom in fractional ownership is, meanwhile, drawing attention from the commercial airlines. United Airlines said recently that it was considering starting a division that might provide corporate jet services like fractional ownership.
In recent years, the fractional ownership market remained buoyant in downturns. "When the Asian economy tanked, our business saw an uptick," Mr. Russell said. "Back in May of 1999, when the U.S. stock market had a downturn, we had an uptick. In the past six months, we've had an uptick as more companies realize that the cost of doing business is expensive, but they have to be more competitive."
Ed Bolen, president of the general aviation aircraft manufacturers' trade group, said that the overall industry was projecting steady growth for the next 10 years, though with "a few" manufacturers predicting "possibly a slight softening next year, but then a pickup," he said. So far this year, the only softening has been a 13 percent drop in sales for single-engine piston aircraft, the type usually purchased by private individual fliers, said Shelly Snyder Simi, a spokeswoman for the association. 
The European market, where national aviation authorities have long resisted business aviation, is now poised for strong growth, industry officials say. So is the Middle East.
Not to mention China, where businesses have been sending delegations to the United States to study the business aviation and general aviation market, Mr. Bolen said. Geography is a compelling factor there, he said. 
"China has figured out that they have to find a way to open the western part of the country to economic development" and link it to eastern China, he said.
"It would obviously be very expensive to connect western China to the east by building new railroads or highways. Whereas with a handful of airports, all you do is pour two miles of concrete in a few strategic locations and utilize general aviation."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. LAWMAKERS AND WHITE HOUSE AGREE ON TAX CUT 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
Republican negotiators from Congress and the White House agreed today to seek $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over the next 11 years as part of a compromise budget, less than what President Bush proposed but still by far the largest tax reduction in the last 20 years.
 The negotiators remained deadlocked today over spending, the other component of the budget plan. Senators want to permit much more to be spent on domestic programs next year than the president and leaders in the House are willing to accept. 
 Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, the leader of a group of 13 other Democrats and two Republicans that holds the balance of power on budget matters in the evenly divided Senate, said he would support the compromise if he was satisfied with the final spending figure. 
Mr. Bush, who made a large tax cut a central part of his election platform and the top item on his legislative agenda this year, appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House to proclaim victory, even though the figure agreed to today fell short of the $1.6 trillion that he had long demanded and that the House approved in March.
"We have more work to do to complete the full budget," Mr. Bush said, "but today we have accomplished significant tax relief and shown we can work together in a constructive way to get things done for the people of this country."
The compromise gave something both to the administration and to Mr. Breaux and his centrist allies. It also allowed the Democratic leadership in Congress -- which said even the $1.35 trillion figure was fiscally irresponsible -- to say it had at least forced Mr. Bush to scale back his original plan.
The plan would permit $1.25 trillion in tax reductions over the decade starting next year, just what Mr. Breaux had sought.
But the plan would permit an additional $100 billion in tax cuts this year to stimulate the economy. That brought the total to only $250 billion below the president's total of $1.6 trillion over 10 years. 
It is unclear what kind of tax cut Congress will enact to send the $100 billion back to taxpayers this year or how soon they might see any of it. If this amount is divided evenly among about 200 million taxpayers, it would mean an immediate tax cut of about $500 per person.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said $1.35 trillion would not be enough to accommodate all the tax reductions the president asked for in his long-term package, but he would not speculate on what might be shelved. Mr. Bush's plan called for reducing all income tax rates, doubling the child credit, giving a break to two-income married couples and repealing the federal tax on large estates.
The measure the negotiators are working on is called a budget resolution. It is not legislation but rather a blueprint that sets the overall levels for tax and spending laws to be enacted later this year.
With the parameters of the tax cut apparently decided, negotiators from the White House, the Senate and the House began grappling in earnest with how to resolve their differences over spending. The budget plan adopted by the Senate called for an increase in spending of more than 8 percent next year; the House version stuck to Mr. Bush's request that the spending increase be held to 4 percent.
Before breaking off their talks this evening, the negotiators were discussing a compromise of about 5 percent.
But the nonbinding spending targets included in the budget resolution have been ignored by Congress in recent years, and all indications are that both the House and the Senate will have trouble living with a target in that range.
There is strong support in both parties for substantial increases in spending for the military, for education and for agriculture. Within the next three weeks, the Pentagon is expected to settle on a long-term budget request reflecting a series of comprehensive reviews of the nation's military strategy and needs. 
While those reviews are not yet complete -- and are offering conflicting advice on which weapons to keep -- officials said the Pentagon spending request for next year almost certainly would be higher than the $310.5 billion Mr. Bush proposed as a place-holder in his budget.
The panel overseeing one of the reviews, for example, has proposed increasing spending on more than 80 different weapons programs at a cost of $30 billion to $40 billion a year, according to two officials who were briefed on the recommendations.
A senior defense official, however, said today that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was more likely to seek a more modest increase of $10 billion to $12 billion in the overall budget for next year, slightly more than what the Senate passed but less than the House's open-ended version.
It is unclear how Congress will balance the pressures for additional spending with its commitment to avoiding a return to budget deficits and the stated desire of many Republicans to seek additional tax cuts this year beyond those called for in the budget.
Some Republicans are already considering pairing an increase in the minimum wage this year with a reduction in the capital gains tax. There is also considerable bipartisan support for a measure that the House plans to take up on Wednesday that would expand the popular 401(k) and individual retirement account programs.
The standoff on spending reflects the strains on the Republican leadership from the need to compromise to get anything through the evenly divided Senate while dealing with the demands of the conservatives who hold sway in the House.
If the spending increase on domestic programs for next year turns out to be much more than 4 percent, enough conservative Republicans in the House might bolt to cause the agreement to be defeated.
"As you move that number up, you see Republicans dropping off at a faster rate than you see Democrats coming on," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.
But much of the additional spending allotted by the Senate measure would go for education. If the increase is much below 8 percent, a few Republicans and all the Democrats who voted for the plan last month can be expected to turn aainst the compromise.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Nuclear Blueprint 

 BODY:
President Bush erased any lingering doubts yesterday about his determination to develop a missile defense system and to discard the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. But in outlining his plans in a speech at the National Defense University, Mr. Bush signaled a willingness to approach these fateful steps with some caution and a recognition of the diplomatic and technological barriers that he faces in trying to overhaul longstanding principles about the management of nuclear weapons. Only by acting in that spirit can he possibly engineer the changes he favors. If his commitment to work with Washington's allies and with Russia proves evanescent, he could well start a dangerous and expensive new arms race. 
 The impulse behind Mr. Bush's plan is reasonable. In the wake of the cold war and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, there is no need for the United States and Russia to maintain thousands of nuclear weapons and to rely on the fear of mutual annihilation to keep the peace. Nor is it necessary for the two nations to negotiate new treaties to further reduce their arsenals, though accords already completed must be honored. Acting independently, Washington and Moscow can cut the number of strategic nuclear warheads that each possesses to 2,500 or even fewer from the present level of more than 6,000 apiece. We were pleased to hear Mr. Bush accept that principle yesterday in saying that he is "committed to achieving a credible deterrent with the lowest possible number of nuclear weapons consistent with our national security needs, including our obligations to our allies." 
 The potential obstacles to this enlightened approach are construction of a missile defense system and abrogation of the ABM treaty. The new strategic architecture that Mr. Bush has in mind, a world in which nations work together to reduce the threat of nuclear attack, cannot be realized if the United States rashly moves ahead on its own to build a missile shield and abrogates the ABM treaty. 
That would produce precisely the kind of destabilizing nuclear imbalance that Mr. Bush seeks to avoid. China would feel threatened because its limited nuclear forces could be thwarted by an American missile defense, and even Russia with its numerous warheads might believe its power had been blunted. Despite its economic tribulations, Moscow would have little choice but to invest in new weapons to offset the American advantage. 
Mr. Bush seems to appreciate these dangers, even as he talks about moving "beyond the constraints" of the ABM treaty. He spoke yesterday of working with the Russians, even someday developing a joint defense. The president's approach on the ABM treaty should be to negotiate revisions with Moscow, or to seek an agreement to set aside the treaty as outdated. With discussion rather than threats of unilateral cancellation of the treaty, he may find a willing partner in the Kremlin. But if Mr. Bush is merely offering diplomatic pleasantries to mask a decision to undercut the treaty, he will encounter fierce opposition in Moscow and considerable resentment among America's allies, many of which fear a renewed arms race.
After years of research and investment, the United States has yet to produce a defense that can shoot down a single warhead. The development effort should continue because nations like Iran, Iraq and North Korea are likely to perfect long-range missiles in the years ahead. But Mr. Bush must be realistic. The kind of space-based laser weapons that Ronald Reagan promoted as president remain improbable. It would be wiser, as Mr. Bush suggests, to work with more feasible technologies, including ground- or sea-based systems that can disable a missile during the initial phase of flight when it is far easier to target than a warhead streaking through space. It would be politically and financially reckless to start building an antimissile system before the technology is perfected. And the idea attributed to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld of mounting an imperfect system to sow doubt among potential adversaries would actually inhibit the needed research.
Mr. Bush has now defined his goals. The world will get a better picture of his specific intentions later this year when he fills in the details. At that point, it will not be hard to tell whether he is following the patient and deliberate course he set yesterday or instead is embarked on an irresponsible effort to dismantle the ABM treaty and erect a missile defense system before he has made the necessary diplomatic and technical preparations.

HEADLINE: Worthy Or Wobbly?; 
Complaints Challenge Fairness Of Late 1990's Boom in I.P.O.'s

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
When Simon D. Roffe graduated from the Stern School of Business at New York University in 1998, he wanted to be a professional investor. He raised a few hundred thousand dollars from family and friends and nearly tripled his money the next year by buying many of the bull market's hot new technology stocks.
 Then those stocks came crashing back to earth. 
 "I learned from my mistakes," Mr. Roffe, 25, wrote in a recent e-mail message. "I expected to get rich quickly. I went from driving a Porsche Boxster to being unemployed virtually overnight." 
But Mr. Roffe, like dozens of other investors, now wonders if there was an artificial element to the investment mania and is fighting to retrieve some of his lost gains. He has joined one of dozens of lawsuits against an alphabet soup of companies that had hot initial public offerings -- from Ariba to PlanetRx.com -- and the blue-chip securities firms like Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley that brought them public.
The suits follow a broad investigation by securities regulators and prosecutors into the I.P.O. machine of the late 90's, which had the breathtaking power to turn a business idea that was little more than a few bullet points on a napkin into a publicly traded company with freshly minted millionaires at its helm.
A central accusation of the suits, and the subject of a new inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is that underwriters extracted promises from investment firms to buy shares of new stocks at higher prices than the offering in exchange for larger allocations of I.P.O.'s.
Everyone, it seemed, wanted to get shares at the initial offering price, but securities firms carefully doled them out to their very best clients, and perhaps friends and family of the company. Individual investors usually bought after trading began, what is known as the aftermarket.
The lawsuits raise fundamental questions about whether the market for new issues was manipulated at the expense of the little investor, who was shut out of the offerings and had no way of knowing whether some of the subsequent "buy" orders might have been prearranged at escalating prices, creating artificial demand for stocks that would later erode.
"At the time, I didn't know I was throwing loaded dice in a crooked craps game," wrote Mr. Roffe, who bought new stocks like PlanetRx and Marimba, but failed to receive shares of them at the offering price. "I was taught at N.Y.U. that market prices are reached in efficient markets, and they weren't polluted by market manipulation."
Last August, the S.E.C. issued a bulletin reminding Wall Street that promises solicited from clients to buy stock in the future, known as tie-in agreements, "undermine the integrity of the market as an independent pricing mechanism for the offered security" and are illegal, whether direct or indirect.
"I don't see that it caused a boom that didn't exist," said Barry Barbash, a partner at the law firm of Shearman & Sterling and a former director of the Division of Investment Management at the S.E.C. "But problems arise in the I.P.O. market in boom times, when there is a scarcity of hot allocations."
Several mutual fund and hedge fund managers agreed to discuss the trading of new stock issues and what types of commitments were made to buy additional stocks, though many did not want to be identified.
"It's like being a big tipper at a restaurant," said one hedge fund manager. "If you give $50 to the maitre d', you'll get a good seat.
So to line up shares at the attractive offering price, the fund manager had to promise to buy more. An investment banker made the consequences of not participating clear: no generous I.P.O. allocation on the next deal.
"I can remember one conversation I had," he said, "where someone said, 'Well, if you want bigger allocations, you need to buy more in the aftermarket.' "
But several fund managers suggested the practice was often less overt, with underwriters rarely strong-arming investment firms of any size.
"It's never that you have to," said Andrew J. Kessler, who runs Velocity Capital Management, a technology hedge fund. "It's the wink and the nudge." 
In all, about a dozen fund managers described a range of relationships with stock underwriters, and none of them felt they had done anything wrong. Some said they were asked what their interest was in buying more after trading began and placed buy orders ahead of time. Some said they volunteered that they were interested in buying shares and at what price. That price was always higher than the offering price.
While underwriters are permitted to try to prevent a new stock from sinking as soon as it starts trading, an accepted practice known as stabilization, they can do so only by buying shares at the offering price or lower. And they cannot pass this responsibility on to their clients without discussing it.
Generally, the fund managers said they made commitments to buy at least two to three times the number of shares that they were allocated at the offering.
For them, there was little downside. They generally placed limit orders, which are filled at or below a set price. So if the new stock zoomed, they did not have to buy at a superinflated price. If a new issue was offered at $18, they might put in a limit order at $23 or $24, Mr. Kessler said. If the stock began trading even higher, a number of things could have happened. A fund manager might have wanted more shares anyway and bought. The underwriter also might have applied pressure to buy at the higher price, one manager said. Or the order might simply have expired.
If a fund manager did not want to be a long-term investor, he would sell the stock after a few days, sometimes trading through a different firm. The practice, another money manager said, is referred to as puking a stock back to the market.
Robert E. Turner, chief investment officer of Turner Investment Partners, which has $12 billion in assets and manages mutual funds for the Vanguard Group and Merrill Lynch, said the underwriters would ask about a manager's appetite for more shares and at what level. The underwriters, he said, would expect you to buy at those levels, and they tried to keep track.
Mr. Turner's firm was a prolific investor in new issues like Ariba and E.piphany, two Internet software companies that had moonshot offerings. For a deal like E.piphany, Mr. Turner would tell the underwriter "if Siebel is trading at 10 times revenue, we would be willing to pay, say, seven times next year's revenues for E.piphany." He was referring to Siebel Systems, a competitor.
Underwriters have an obligation to spell out all agreements that might affect how a stock is priced and how it trades, as well as all the risks faced by buyers. The firms are strictly prohibited from taking orders for follow-up purchases of the stock before the initial pricing is completed because it could give investors a false impression of demand for a stock on the open market.
But a mutual fund manager's telling an underwriter he is interested in being a long-term investor makes for a gray legal area. Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, said he thought plaintiffs had a legitimate grievance that they were misled by aftermarket deal making, but that it might be challenging to prove.
"What's going to be tough is proving that the underwriter forced people" to place additional orders, Mr. Ritter said. "Without explicit testimony or e-mails, plaintiffs have to prove it was the underwriters' forcing the buyer to do that, rather than them voluntarily doing it."
If, as the suits argue, the underwriters lined up commitments from others at various price levels, creating a strata of price supports sometimes called a ladder, it raises questions of how much of the I.P.O. boom was driven by an undisclosed force.
At least a dozen law firms have filed complaints against stock issuers including Ariba, AutoWeb, Calico Commerce, Doubleclick, Marketwatch.com, Marimba, NetZero, PlanetRx.com, Priceline.com, Red Hat, VA Linux Systems and Ventro and their underwriters. Suits have also been filed against a Merrill Lynch fund that invested in Internet stocks.
"We believe the suits have no merit, and we will vigorously defend ourselves," said Victoria Harmon, a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse First Boston.
Joseph Cohen, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, said, "We believe these are absolutely meritless claims, and we intend to vigorously defend against them."
Nearly every day a new claim is made against another one of the 90's stock rockets. Mr. Roffe's complaints are being handled by Howard Sirota, a lawyer with Sirota & Sirota, and Mr. Roffe's uncle.
"There were approximately 725 hot new issues since 1997, where the manager or co-manager was one of the major investment banks," Mr. Sirota said. "At least a couple hundred are going to prove to be manipulative."
For underwriters, the investor complaints are only part of their problems. Regulators and federal prosecutors are conducting a separate criminal investigation on whether some investment banks received kickbacks from customers in return for the profits they made on I.P.O. allocations.
Those kickbacks may have taken the form of additional or inflated commissions, usually in the trading of other stocks. None of the fund managers interviewed for this article said they funneled trading commissions to a firm, but one manager said it was common to direct more legitimate business through an underwriter after receiving a large allocation.
Some fund managers did not take part in any of this.
"We don't participate in these practices," Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund manager, said in a statement. Indeed, a giant like Fidelity would not need to play the game, several smaller competitors said, because it generates so much business that underwriters would not want to cross its fund managers.
Philip Treick, who manages a hedge fund for Aesop Capital Partners, a small San Francisco investment firm, said he was unaware of such practices.
"I've never had a broker say to me that the size of your allocation will be tied to your market order," he said. "We've never played that game." 
He added, "When the I.P.O. window was open, we'd do I.P.O.'s. It was free money. But we never figured out how to get much."

HEADLINE: President to Name Panel On Social Security Plan 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
President Bush plans to set in motion his effort to overhaul Social Security on Wednesday by naming a commission heavily stocked with members of both parties who favor his proposal to create private investment accounts for all workers.
 Administration officials and Democrats in Congress said the co-chairmen of the commission would be Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the former senator from New York, who is a Democrat, and Richard Parsons, a Republican who is a chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner. 
 The other members of the 14-person commission include economists, business executives and former government officials, split evenly between the two parties. 
Without any changes, Social Security would run short of money to pay all promised benefits within the next four decades. 
Mr. Bush made creating individual investment accounts within the system one of the main planks in his campaign platform, and commission members said there was little doubt they would recommend such an approach.
But creating private accounts would not by itself solve Social Security's problems. In some ways, diverting money from the current system into personal accounts would deepen Social Security's financial hole, while also raising questions about whether retirement benefits should be subject to the inherent uncertainties of Wall Street -- especially after the stomach-churning gyrations of the last few months. 
Any comprehensive solution is almost certain to require additional steps that could set off a political firestorm, such as raising the retirement age and reducing cost of living adjustments.
As news of the panel's composition spread on Capitol Hill today, Democrats dismissed it as fixed from the start. "This is a stacked, completely orchestrated effort to come to a desired result, and I'm very disappointed that that is the decision they've made," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate.
Mr. Bush, asked today about the makeup of the panel, would not address its leanings but said it was important to "make sure that there's an objective analysis of Social Security, how do we save it, what do we do to make sure it's viable in the future." 
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said it was possible that Congress could act on some of the commission's recommendations by the end of this year. But other members of both parties said it was far more likely that Congress would not take up the issue until next year, and that it would be difficult to pass a package that called for painful steps like benefit cuts, especially in an election year when control of the House and the Senate will be up for grabs.
Mr. Moynihan has long advocated the creation of personal investment accounts. Mr. Parsons does not have any extensive public record on the issue. Described by colleagues as a moderate Republican, he was considered by the administration for a number of top-level jobs.
Among the Democrats, Sam Beard, a former aide to Robert F. Kennedy, and Tim Penny, a former member of Congress from Minnesota, have been particularly active in promoting private accounts.
The other Democrats are Estelle James, an economist at the World Bank; Robert L. Johnson, the founder of BET, the entertainment and media company; Olivia Mitchell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and Fidel Vargas, who was a member of a Social Security advisory committee in the mid-1990's.
The other Republicans on the commission will be John F. Cogan, a Stanford economist who was an adviser to Mr. Bush's campaign; Gerald Parsky, a financier from California who was assistant Treasury secretary in the Ford administration; Carolyn L. Weaver, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute; Robert G. Deposada, the executive director of the Hispanic Business Roundtable; Gwendolyn S. King, who was Social Security commissioner under President Bush's father, and Thomas R. Saving, an economist from Texas A&M University.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Battered by the economy, Hook Media, an online agency, files for bankruptcy protection.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
THE faltering advertising economy has claimed another victim. Hook Media Inc., a leading online agency, has filed for bankruptcy protection and is preparing to sell most of its assets to a division of Havas Advertising.
 Hook was founded in May 1998 in Boston and was one of the fastest-growing interactive shops in New England. At its peak, Hook employed more than 100 people in Boston and at offices in Atlanta, opened in August, and New York, opened in October. There were even plans as recently as December to expand in the first half of 2001 to Chicago and Los Angeles. 
 But the office in Atlanta was closed in February, putting 10 employees out of work, and layoffs were made in Boston and New York that reduced the staff to about 50.
The filing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law took place in Boston on April 23, said Don Epperson, president of Hook, who confirmed a report about the filing that appeared in the online edition of the trade publication Adweek. Mr. Epperson attributed the filing to "the market downturn and to one of our larger clients having financial difficulties." He declined to identify the client.
"That put us over the edge," Mr. Epperson said, "and we had to go over to 11."
Hook becomes the latest agency to fall prey to the effects of the sharp, sudden cutbacks in ad spending both online and offline by marketers. On Monday, the Worldwide Xceed Group, a Web designer in New York, filed for federal bankruptcy protection, which allows a company to pay its creditors while it reorganizes operations. Worldwide Xceed also sold the assets of two offices, in Chandler, Ariz., and Colorado Springs.
The recession that rocked Madison Avenue when it began a decade ago contributed to the closings of well-known agencies like Ally & Gargano; Geer, DuBois; and Smith/Greenland. While conditions this time are so far nowhere near as bleak, there has been a change in the agency landscape as a result of the increased competitive pressures caused by consolidation and globalization.
Years ago, agencies in trouble could retrench, regroup and recover. But that has grown difficult more recently, as shown by the swift closings of troubled shops like Lois/USA and Wells Rich Greene BDDP.
In another sign of just how anxious the climate has become, this columnist heard yesterday from several readers who could not get through on the telephone to an agency and said they thought the agency had gone out of business. The agency's executives said they were simply having telephone trouble and were startled to hear about the conclusion to which the readers had leapt.
Mr. Epperson said that negotiations were "pretty far along" for Havas to acquire the assets of Hook and hire most, if not all, the remaining employees, adding, "We hope to take all our clients with us." They include Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the EMC Corporation and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The plans call for Hook to be acquired by and become part of Media Contacts in New York, the interactive agency of Media Planning, part of the Media Planning Group unit of Havas.
Mr. Epperson referred questions to Maria Luisa Francoli, who heads the Media Planning Group at its headquarters in Madrid. That office was closed yesterday for a holiday. Steve Farella, chief executive at Media Planning, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.

Harvard's Heroes

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
You want heroes? Take a peek inside Massachusetts Hall.
 The temperature in Cambridge hovered around 90 yesterday as the "living-wage" sit-in at Harvard passed the two-week mark. The 30 or so students who continued to occupy Massachusetts Hall, and the dozens of students who have set up a tent city in Harvard Yard, outside the hall, were understandably weary. 
 But they remained upbeat, sustained by the intense belief that their school should not be contributing to the erosion of pay and benefits that has plagued low-wage workers in the U.S. for the past couple of decades. 
"It's a classic nonviolent protest," said Prof. Marshall Ganz of Harvard, who spent many years as an organizer for the civil rights movement and the farm workers' union. He praised the students for the tenacity and discipline they've shown in rallying support for their living-wage campaign. 
"Economic justice as a real core issue has been a long time coming," he said.
The bottom line for the students is that all workers should be paid a wage that covers the basic needs of food, shelter and clothing for themselves and their families. And they have vowed to continue protesting until Harvard meets that minimum threshold.
"I don't feel right going home at night knowing that the people cleaning up after us and preparing our food aren't getting paid enough to take care of their families," said Jenny Foster, a divinity student who is active in the living-wage campaign but is not one of those sitting in.
The students want Harvard to establish a living wage of $10.25 an hour as the minimum that could be paid to employees, whether they work directly for the university or for contractors hired by Harvard.
One of the many encouraging elements of the campaign is its cross-cultural aspect. The students, some from very privileged backgrounds, have gone to the mat on behalf of janitors, dining hall employees and others who grew up poor and are still struggling. Many of the workers are immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America.
"I grew up in the coal fields of northern Appalachia," said Danny Meagher, a part-time campus museum guard who is 44 years old, married and has three children. Mr. Meagher's wife works, so his family is not poverty-stricken. But he makes only $9.48 an hour and some of his colleagues make less than that. He appreciates the sustained effort of the protesters.
"These students have chosen to stand up and take what I consider to be an incredible moral stand on behalf of people whose backgrounds are different from theirs," he said. "I think that's a fine thing. To me, they're a true reflection of what the university claims to be about. Harvard should be proud of them."
We have become accustomed in the era of globalization and the triumph of the markets to ignore such concepts as economic justice and fairness. Harvard officials do not argue that their lowest-paid workers are being paid what they're worth. They say they have an obligation, when considering the pay of these workers, to remain in step with the surrounding market. Why that should be so is not at all clear. If some company down the street pays its security guards less than a subsistence wage, why is Harvard, the wealthiest university in the nation, obligated to follow suit?
"They can use all kinds of market justifications, but that doesn't make it right," said Amy Offner, a member of the living-wage campaign. "The market doesn't have a lot to do with morality. It doesn't have a lot to do with justice. All it does is crank out numbers, and that doesn't tell us how we should treat each other, or how we ought to live."
However this plays out, the protesters have provided a great service by insisting that we no longer avert our eyes to the continuing assault on the living standards of working men and women, even at a great institution like Harvard.
John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., was correct when he said yesterday that the issues of low-wage workers are "everybody's issues." The sit-in at Harvard, he said, highlights "the principle that workers who give their all every day should not be rewarded with poverty wages."

HEADLINE: Fed's Regional Survey Finds a Slowdown 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
The economy slowed in the last two months as retail sales were weak in March and manufacturers reported falling orders and production, the Federal Reserve said today in its latest regional economic report card.
 Rising energy costs have replaced wage pressures as a new inflation threat, the Fed said in the report, known as the beige book for the color of its cover. 
 Most of the 12 regional districts of the Fed report that labor market pressures have eased. 
"Almost all districts report a slow pace of economic activity," the Fed said in summarizing the overall performance of the economy in March and early April.
The beige book compiles anecdotal reports on economic developments in the regional Fed bank districts. It is used by members of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee in its interest rate deliberations. The next meeting of the committee is on May 15.
The economy, now in its 11th year of expansion, grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, after a 1 percent growth rate in the final three months last year. The report issued today suggested a more pessimistic view of the economy's prospects.
"Retail sales were weak in March but strengthened in April. Still, retailers in most districts are expecting only small gains, at best, in coming months," the beige book said.
Business travel is down, and manufacturing "continues to weaken across districts, with demand having fallen in most industries," the report said. "The high-tech and telecommunications industries are experiencing a pronounced slowdown."
More recent developments suggest the economy, while still not expanding rapidly, nevertheless may have bottomed out from its slowdown. Manufacturing, though still weak, is no longer worsening. The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index rose in April for the third month in a row. New orders placed with factories for goods other than transportation equipment fell in March for a fourth consecutive month. Over all, they rose 1.8 percent.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Economic Activity Remains Slow in Most Areas"A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday. Minneapolis -- Mining, manufacturing and agriculture remained sluggish. Prices were mixed. Chicago -- Economic activity was slow. Manufacturing was still weak. High demand for refinancing of mortgages. Cleveland -- Economic growth continued to be weak. Home building was strong. Businesses cut jobs, and wage growth slowed. Boston -- Economic growth continued to slow. Retail sales were flat; manufacturing weak. Housing market remained healthy. New York -- Economic growth continued at a moderate pace. Inflation was stable. Commercial real estate has cooled. Philadelphia -- Manufacturers reported shipments were steady although orders fell. Companies have cut spending on equipment. Richmond, Va. -- Manufacturing continued to struggle. Retail sales improved. Housing market benefited from low mortgage rates. Atlanta -- Economic activity remained subdued. Retail sales were sluggish. The demand for workers has slowed. St. Louis -- Retailers and service providers reported improved conditions. Low mortgage rates helped the housing market. Kansas City, Mo. -- The energy sector was healthy while retailing and manufacturing were sluggish. Home building activity improved. Dallas -- Manufacturing declined, and the demand for business services was weak. The livestock industry remained "in good shape." San Francisco -- Businesses expressed concern over rising energy prices. Retailers reported weak-than-expected sales. (Source: Bloomberg News)

HEADLINE: Writers and Studios Take Negotiations to Next Level 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2 

 BODY:
Talks between Hollywood writers and production executives quietly slipped past Tuesday's midnight deadline until, about 3 a.m. today, weary negotiators decided it was time to take a break, get some sleep, consider the offers that had just been placed on the table and then resume talks at noon, which they did.
 By late this afternoon, the talks appeared to be moving into what could be called their final phase. 
 For the first time since negotiations with the writers resumed two weeks ago, the chief executives of all of the major studios and networks involved in resolving the so-called creative rights issues with the writers -- issues of respect and status, including what writers believe is an overuse of the "film by" credit for directors -- came to the negotiations in an effort to resolve those issues.
If the creative rights issues could be resolved, the negotiators hoped that the remaining crucial issues involving payment of residuals could rapidly be addressed. 
"They spent a lot of time earlier today clearing brush, getting some of the other issues out of the way," said an executive involved in the talks. "What this says, all of the C.E.O.'s showing up, is that they are serious about making an agreement. It says: 'Ready, set, go. Let's wrap this up.' "
Among the executives who arrived for the creative rights meeting at 4 p.m. were Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks SKG, Alan Horn of Warner Brothers, Stacey Snider of Universal Pictures, Tom Rothman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, Leslie Moonves of CBS and Ken Lemberger of Sony Pictures.
"If we can resolve the creative rights, then it's a run for the roses," one executive said late this afternoon.
Negotiators for the Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,000 movie and television writers, have been seeking increases in several types of residuals, the fees paid for subsequent use of a writer's work after its initial broadcast or theatrical run, as well as concessions aimed at improving the status and power of film writers. Representatives for the major studios and television networks said that profit margins on movies and television programs were shrinking and too small to justify huge increases in residuals. 
The talks had begun their final day before the deadline on Tuesday with optimism running high. A late-night bargaining session on Monday had cleared away many issues, and there were growing hopes that a settlement might even be reached before the deadline. But as midnight approached, it became clear that there were too many issues unresolved, including many of the major ones involving residuals and creative rights.
Still, reluctant to let the momentum slip away, the negotiators kept talking past midnight. But before long, it became clear that there were too many outstanding issues for one night's work, and the positions of some in the negotiations seemed to be hardening rather than softening as the dawn approached.
So the talks resumed at noon today, with many still expressing hope that a settlement could be reached soon.
There was much speculation last week that the companies would place a final offer on the table in the closing hours of the talks. This was not done, largely because progress in the talks seemed to indicate that a settlement was possible without it. But if the talks continue to move slowly, or bog down, the companies might yet place a take-it-or-leave-it offer on the table, officials said.
Hollywood had been in a state of frazzled anticipation for six months as the contract deadline approached. Partly, this is because of the potential effect of a writers strike, which could have major repercussions on the coming fall TV season. But more than that, the contract covering the 135,000 actors represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists expires on June 30, and those unions are also seeking increases in residuals and other concessions.
One concern that production executives have in the current talks with writers is that the guild will try to delay a resolution until closer to the actors' strike deadline, to give the two unions even bigger bargaining muscle. Guild officials deny this.
A dual strike by the actors and writers would effectively shut down film and television production in Southern California, perhaps dealing a devastating blow to the region's economy and causing studios and networks to lay off thousands.
"Every studio in town has a list," said one movie executive who is not directly involved in the negotiations. "The list says that, O.K., X number of days after a strike begins, this group of people are laid off, and X more days after that, this group, and so on. It would all start happening very quickly after a strike begins."

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS; 
Playing the Arena Game in Newark Is Getting More Expensive

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
When he was discussing less-than-robust regular-season attendance at Devils home games recently, Lou Lamoriello, the team's president and general manager, said, "Things will be better in the new place."
 Newark is the promised land for the Devils and the Nets, a future urban refuge from shared tenancy in the Meadowlands. A deal to have a new arena by 2004 is idling, if not stalled. 
 The $215 million package of state and local subsidies approved by Gov. Christie Whitman evaporated when she left to work in the Bush administration, and it is anyone's guess whether her replacement, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, a lame duck, has the juice to equal or exceed his predecessor's generosity. 
With time ticking on the Newark plan and the patience of YankeeNets, which owns the Nets and a stake in the Devils, the proposed price tag of the arena is leaping past $300 million, toward $350 million and higher. And as the building cost rises, so will YankeeNets' belief that the subsidy should increase.
Figure, then, that to create this higher-priced arena-cum-urban renewal project, YankeeNets wants state, city and county aid worth 75 to 80 percent of the total cost. That's astonishing considering that two-team arenas stage enough basketball and hockey games and other events like wrestling shows, concerts and circuses to have traditionally made private financing relatively easy.
What YankeeNets wants "is definitely on the high end of the spectrum," said John Mansell, an analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a media and sports analysis firm.
Chicago's United Center and Washington's MCI Center were built entirely with private funds, but they received city contributions for infrastructure improvements. For the newer MCI Center, Washington contributed $60 million, making the public cost 23 percent of the $260 million project. At the $400 million Staples Center, home to the Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers and Kings, a small amount of city money paid for land.
Every project is different, of course, and Newark is an interesting case. Saddled for decades with a reputation as declining and downtrodden, the city has had a gradual recovery symbolized in part by the success of the three-and-a-half-year-old New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which drew 560,854 people to its events last year. For Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz, who bought the Nets in 1998 and merged with the Yankees a year later, the arena is a major element of their charitable endeavors.
"The real question is, do you allow cities to fail or give them a chance to win, whether it's Indianapolis or Newark?" said Harvey Schiller, the chairman of YankeeNets. He said that government help to build the Newark arena would relieve the state of some of its annual subsidies to the Meadowlands complex.
Mark Rosentraub, dean of the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, said substantial public aid to a Newark arena could be rationalized if the negatives about the city were as considerable as they used to be. But the success of the Performing Arts Center suggests, to some extent, he said, the willingness of people to go to Newark for entertainment pursuits in numbers that did not exist in years past.
"There will be excess profits for the teams if you go to 80 percent public funding and the negatives aren't so great," Rosentraub said.
YankeeNets may look at sweetheart deals like one being offered by Memphis to lure the Vancouver Grizzlies as a model in its negotiations, but remember: cities luring teams from elsewhere tend to be financial toadies.
Whether seeking as much as 80 percent of the cost of the arena from the public is excessive depends upon whom you talk to."We're in a competitive situation," Schiller said. "We have rising costs of running the teams. This does not result in being greedy owners."
Last week, a settlement with the MSG Network opened the door for the Yankees to start a regional cable television network in 2002, which would eventually show Nets and Devils games. A network would have huge profit potential that could help pay more to build the arena.
Sam Katz, a sports finance expert who advised the Whitman administration, said that such a large public commitment to pay infrastructure costs, and use taxes to pay off bonds, "gets close to unconscionable."
"There's no doubt that the land and building will cost more as time goes by," he said, "but that doesn't mean governmental entities should bear that much of the cost."
In markets "inferior to northern New Jersey and New York," Sam Katz said, the public investment in two-team arenas has been in a range of 33 percent to 50 percent.
"This project has a particular problem in the prices paid for the Nets and Devils," he said, referring to the $150 million for the Nets and $176 million for the Devils. "They paid high levels for teams with significant operating losses."
It was easier for Abe Pollin to finance the MCI Center privately in part because he paid so little for the Washington Capitals ($6 million) and the Wizards ($1.1 million). Eighteen months after the arena opened in 1997, Pollin sold the Capitals and a stake in the Wizards for $200 million.
Sam Katz said the alternatives to Newark for the teams were limited. "I would take seriously the threat of putting the Nets in Madison Square Garden," he said. "But the Devils may just have to go, to Houston or maybe Orlando."

Ex-Heads at Auction Houses Indicted in Antitrust Case
A. Alfred Taubman, the powerful real estate developer and former chairman of Sotheby's, and Sir Anthony Tennant, his onetime counterpart at Christie's, were indicted on federal antitrust charges stemming from a conspiracy in which the two giant auction houses fixed commission fees charged to more than 130,000 customers over six years.
 The indictments contend that the two men masterminded a scheme that involved fixing fees to sellers of fine art, jewelry, and furniture and trading information that virtually nullified the bargaining power of customers in the $4 billion auction market. Page A1.

HEADLINE: In California, Solar's Time to Shine 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., May 2 

 BODY:
Strangers are flocking to Eric and Nicole Jorgensen's boxy 50-year-old tract house.
 At first, passersby noticed the two windmills on the roof. Now, with energy on nearly everyone's mind, the Jorgensens' place -- with solar panels on the back roof, a sun oven in the backyard and a meter that runs backward -- is a full-scale attraction. It draws fifth-grade classes, international news crews and fellow homeowners. 
 "California has so much sun that it's silly everyone isn't doing this," said Mr. Jorgensen, 34, a physicist at Stanford University. He hitched his house to the sun and wind last October, and it now produces more energy than it uses. 
While the Jorgensens may have been early converts to California's latest conservation movement, they are a lot less lonely than they were six months ago. Rolling blackouts, record-high utility bills, bankrupt and nearly bankrupt power companies -- as well as a state campaign that combines pleas with financial incentives to use less energy -- are all creating a populace focused on saving energy.
Not since the oil crisis of the 1970's have the words "solar power" been so popular. Not since the "small is beautiful" movement spawned the same decade has bragging about living simply been so in vogue.
Energy-saving fluorescent bulbs, once eschewed as too expensive and unattractive, are hard for stores to keep in stock. Businesses and government agencies are dimming lights and many consumers are buying energy-efficient appliances and adjusting thermostats.
Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday dismissed the notion that conservation alone would solve the nation's energy ills, but state officials here say it is having a decided impact. In February, for example, California businesses and consumers cut their energy use by 8 percent, with no financial incentives other than reducing their bills.
Last month, pleas for conservation from the state's power managers produced a 3 percent drop in use -- enough to end mandatory blackouts by 2 p.m., well before the 6 p.m. peak in the state's power demand. 
Last week, underscoring the conservation theme, Gov. Gray Davis said that state government offices had averaged consumption cuts of 20 percent in January and February.
Whether conservation will stick remains a big question. After consumers responded to the state's conservation alert during the blackouts last month, officials said, once the crisis passed, power users went back to their old plugged-in ways.
The state's Independent System Operator, which manages the power grid, warns that blackouts could be far more frequent and last longer if conservation does not become embedded in the public's behavior. "Conservation has to become a way of life," said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the power agency.
Consumer and environmental groups had been critical of Governor Davis for not acting sooner to advocate conservation legislation, and concerned that he was relying too heavily on an $850 million conservation program for businesses and residents. But the groups now say they have been encouraged by the response to the call to conserve. 
Incentives including rebates and free energy-saving products are proving more popular than anticipated. San Diego Gas & Electric distributed what it thought was a three-month supply of energy-efficient light bulbs in just two months, and predicted it would soon exhaust nearly $20 million in residential conservation incentives -- rebates on energy-saving appliances, for example -- that were supposed to last all year.
Southern California Edison, like other California utilities, had been criticized for not promoting conservation efforts harder. It recently began publicizing its rebates with bill inserts and door hangers; in two weeks, it received more than 3,500 inquiries from customers.
Such signs buoy the governor's hopes of cutting energy use in California by 5,000 megawatts -- enough to power about five million homes -- by the summer, when energy use usually jumps by 50 percent.
Trend-watchers go further, saying that if California, the nation's most populous state, can demonstrate how simple conservation measures can save energy and money in uncertain economic times, the rest of the country will follow.
"It's not just an electricity crisis," said Gerald Celeste of the Trend Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. "It's also gas and jobs being lost and surely very few people believe that things are going to bounce back to pre-Internet-bubble-burst levels." Such a sobering economic downturn, "is what grows the consciousness," Mr. Celeste said. "And if you are lucky to learn from it, you change your way of thinking."
Anecdotal evidence that the collective mindset is changing in California abounds. In the last three months, sales have doubled at Real Goods, a company in the Northern California town of Hopland specializing in solar and energy-saving products, a spokeswoman, Rose Bell, said.
The company is selling out of fluorescent bulbs and radiant barriers, foil insulation that reduces the energy cost of air-conditioning, Ms. Bell said. 
It is also selling more of what are called utility intertie systems -- devices that use solar energy when the sun is shining, and use energy from the power grid at other times. And attendance at the company's workshops in solar power has tripled since the crisis began.
Cheryl Long, editor of the Mother Earth News, the journal based in Topeka, Kan., that is the bible for the alternative energy self-help set, sees a similar trend. She said that people have been seeking out the publication's Web site for information about "alternative energy, how to build a wind generator at home, how to get off the grid, et cetera."
Solar-energy system installers say the crisis has proven a big boon. Anoosh Mizany, who owns the Solar Depot in Marin City, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, said that his business was up 30 percent over last year.
"The more Stage 2 and Stage 3 alerts and so on, the more calls we got," Mr. Mizany said. 
Appliance retailers gush about how quickly their big-ticket items -- top-of-the-line refrigerators, dishwashers, washers and dryers -- are leaving their warehouses; new appliances are vastly more energy efficient than models of 10 years ago.
When Gus Martinez, an appliance salesman at a Sears, Roebuck store in San Bruno, approaches a customer, "the first thing that comes out of their mouth is 'energy efficient,' " he said. "Not even size, or what features they're looking for. They say, 'I've got to get my PG&E bill down.' "
Advertisements for solar-panel suppliers are plastered all over the state's Sunday newspapers. While far less complicated and expensive than they were 30 years ago, though, solar energy systems can be pricey.
The Jorgensens paid $13,000 for their solar intertie system, though with rebates, they said, the cost was less than $6,000. They said their system was more complicated and costly than many people would buy because they added a backup battery.
The Jorgensens also said that many systems would pay for themselves faster than they estimated theirs would because they had always been stingy about using energy. "The more power you've spent, the faster the systems pay for themselves," Mr. Jorgensen said.
Lance Drill, a freelance photographer who lives in a tiny studio apartment on the top floor of an aging five-story building in San Francisco, made his system simple. Mr. Drill bought a portable generator and a solar panel over the Internet for $400.
Showing off his system, Mr. Drill hooked the solar panel on the roof to the generator with a power cord that runs from the roof down the front of the building and through his window.
He said he expected to receive rebates on the generator and solar panel worth almost half his cost.
Mr. Drill said he expected his bills, about $80 a month, to drop considerably. A new state program is to reward customers who cut their summer energy use by 20 percent from the comparable period last year with a 20 percent rebate on their electric bills for the summer.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Some big decisions on the Treasury market are in the wings.

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
THOMAS JUTERBOCK, head of global government bond trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, says there have been few disruptions in fixed-income markets as a result of the shrinking Treasury market and the decline in new issues of notes and bonds. 
 But, he said: "I don't think this is sustainable. Over time, we are going to get more distortions." 
 This is why the Treasury Department under the Bush administration will have to make some important decisions about the future of the Treasury market by November. In that period -- which includes the three quarterly Treasury auctions in May, August and November -- the Treasury is going to have to give a clear indication of what it wants to do with the government bond market. It can let this market fade away in the most organized and least disruptive way possible. Or it can do its best to keep the market alive. 
Because of large budget surpluses, the government is expected to have no real need to borrow in a few years. And if the government ceases to issue bonds and notes, the Treasury market would lose its role as a benchmark for interest rates, a haven for worried investors and a tool in many of Wall Street's regular financial transactions.
Until recently, the betting was that the Treasury market would fade away as long as surpluses remained robust and the economy did not fall into a steep decline. This view held sway because Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has opposed any plan to keep the Treasury market alive by continuing to issue unneeded notes and bonds. This, Mr. Greenspan argued, would leave the government with surpluses that it could invest in stocks or bonds, and he is opposed to that because he says those decisions would be politicized.
Mr. Greenspan has also argued that allowing the Treasury market to die would present no problems because reviving it would be easy. Budget deficits are expected to return in the late 2020's, when the baby-boom retirees begin to strain the Social Security and Medicare systems. But the market could be at its crossroads in just a few years, and preparations for what happens then have to be made in advance.
The Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, changed the debate when he said the Treasury was actively considering keeping the Treasury market open. In a speech last month, he said the government could keep the Treasury market alive by issuing new debt even when it was no longer necessary and giving the proceeds back to the public as tax cuts.
"All things being equal, it is not a bad idea to try to figure out if there is a way to prolong the life of the Treasury bond market," said Lewis A. Sachs, an assistant treasury secretary in the Clinton administration responsible for debt management.
And many people on Wall Street agree. The Bond Market Association is pressing for the continued sales of the 30-year bond. As Mr. Greenspan noted in a speech to the association last Friday, "The Treasury market serves a number of useful purposes -- in addition to providing many of you with profitable employment."
Mr. Sachs said, however, that "it is not clear that the benefits of prolonging the life of the Treasury market would outweigh the substantial costs" -- namely, the interest that the government would have to pay on the notes and bonds it sells.
Mr. O'Neill has yet to give any details of such a proposal and said he had made no decision yet on the Treasury market's future.
The Treasury announced yesterday morning, when it released the details for this month's auction of 5- and 10-year Treasury notes, that it would introduce a four-week bill before the end of September. The new bill is part of an effort to better manage cash flow now that the Treasury has reduced the amount of debt it is issuing. The Treasury also said it expected to retire a total of $252 billion in debt during the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, up from $213 billion in the previous fiscal year and $100 billion in fiscal year 1999.
But the Treasury gave no indication of its thinking on the future of the Treasury market. Peter Fisher has been nominated as the new under secretary for domestic finance and will be the top adviser on whether to maintain the Treasury market. But he has not been confirmed.
So the first significant insight into what the new Treasury will do may not come until the announcement of its auctions for August. And what happens then to the 30-year bond, whose issuance has already been whittled down sharply, could confirm the Treasury's intentions.

HEADLINE: Cigna Warns on Profits, and H.M.O. Stocks Take a Tumble 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The Cigna Corporation, one of the strongest managed care companies, said yesterday that profits would be lower than expected this year, blaming weaker earnings from pension and retirement accounts that it manages for large employers. Analysts, however, were particularly concerned by an unexpected increase in Cigna's medical costs. 
 Cigna's announcement touched off a selling wave that drove down Cigna shares and other H.M.O. stocks. And it followed a warning three weeks ago by Aetna Inc., the largest health insurer, which said on April 10 that its first-quarter earnings would be lower than expected because of sharply rising medical costs. Analysts had discounted the Aetna warning somewhat, believing it was a special case tied to Aetna's problems with overly rapid expansion and friction with doctors. 
 "Almost every health care company expects cost increases of 10 to 13 percent," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, managing director of the Carlyle Fund, an investor in privately held health care companies. "But when well-managed Cigna announces that they were behind the curve in setting prices to cover rising costs, that's a surprise."
Shares of Cigna, the nation's third-largest health insurer, fell $15.85, or almost 15 percent, to $92.85 yesterday. Wellpoint Health Networks, also a favorite with investors in managed care, lost $5.24, or 5 percent, to $94.55. The United Health Group was down $2.96, to $63.20, and Oxford Health Plans dropped $1.57, to $29.93.
Cigna, based in Philadelphia, said medical costs charged by hospitals and doctors rose 11 percent in the first quarter, topping the estimate it had made 90 days ago of an 8 percent to 9 percent increase. Cigna expects these costs to rise 10 percent to 11 percent over the entire year.
Some analysts were skeptical that insurance companies would be able to keep raising prices to cover growing medical costs if employers were cutting costs as the economy slows. "There is no way that corporate America is going to accept 12 percent health care increases," said Larry Feinberg, a managing partner of Oracle Partners, a health care hedge fund. 
But Lori M. Price, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, said insurers could trim premium increases by offering more restrictive benefits, for example cutting back on covering workers' families, and by increasing employees' out-of-pocket payments for drugs and doctor visits.
Edward Hanway, chief executive of Cigna, said health care membership growth this year was short of the company's expectations. Cigna covered 14.3 million people on March 31, up 1.9 percent from March 2000 but 11,000 fewer than on Dec. 31.
The company said in a conference call with investors that earnings for 2001 would be $7.25 to $7.45 a share, 10 cents below its earlier guidance. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/ First Call had been $7.56. Cigna earned $6.85 a share in 2000.
Roberta Goodman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said she had expected growth in health care income, which is about three-quarters of Cigna's operating income, to offset the drop from retirement. That did not happen.
Cigna did meet the expectations of analysts for first-quarter earnings. Operating income rose 3 percent, to $272 million, in the quarter, excluding a one-time gain on the sale of a Japanese life insurance unit. Operating income was $265 million in the 2000 first quarter, or $1.57 a share. Earnings per share increased 12 percent because the company repurchased 15.5 million shares over the last year. 
The company said lower stock market prices cut into its management fees as the value of retirement accounts last March 31 dropped $5.2 billion, or 9 percent, to $52.2 billion, compared with $57.4 billion on March 31, 2000. 
Cigna has a reputation for keeping investor expectations down by making conservative earnings estimates. Continuing that practice, the company assumed that the overall stock market would stay flat for the rest of the year, said James A. Lane, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
The company's main customers are large employers with workers spread across the country. As a result, Mr. Lane said, Cigna has less ability than local insurers to keep costs down by leaning on hospitals and doctors for lower charges in some geographical areas.

HEADLINE: Ford's 70-Year Itch Could Be Relieved; 
As G.M. Stumbles, Its Perch at the Top Is Within Reach

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 2 

 BODY:
The last time Ford Motor was the world's biggest automaker was 1930, when Henry Ford, the founder, was still in charge, the Model A had finally replaced the Model T and Margaret Mitchell was still writing "Gone With the Wind."
 General Motors -- led by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who organized a half-dozen separate car lines under one corporate umbrella and introduced the concept of the annual model change -- surpassed Ford the following year. It remained the nation's largest company, and at times, the world's largest, through most of the rest of the 20th century. 
 But now, to the amazement of many in Motor City, Ford seems increasingly likely to take from G.M. the top spot in the auto industry. Ford came within half a day's sales of passing G.M. in total revenue in the first quarter. And Ford actually surpassed G.M. in automotive revenue, although this was partly because G.M. cut production more deeply than Ford in response to the slowing economy. Many people in the industry expect Ford to edge ahead of G.M. in total revenue and automotive revenue within two or three years. 
The short-term reasons G.M.'s lead is likely to evaporate are simple. G.M. is phasing out its Oldsmobile division and is trying to sell its Hughes Electronics subsidiary or spin it off to shareholders as a separate company.And Ford will pick up additional sales from its acquisition of Land Rover.
But G.M.'s lost mastery has much deeper roots: an inability to respond to market trends quickly. G.M. missed the growth of the small-car market in the late 1970's and early 1980's, the move to more aerodynamic midsize cars in the late 1980's and the rise of sport utility vehicles based on pickup truck designs in the 1990's. And now it is stumbling in its response to the popularity of sport utilities based on car designs.
For most people in the auto industry, the question is no longer if Ford will overtake G.M., but when. "Their market share is going to continue to decline," said Chris Cedergren, the managing director of Nextrend Inc., an automotive consulting company. "The new generation can't relate to G.M. brands."
G.M. executives say that although their share of the United States market has been falling for 22 years, the trend is about to reverse itself. They are pinning their hopes on expanded production of full-size pickup trucks and sport utilities based on pickup designs, and on sport utilities based on car designs that Saturn, Buick and Pontiac will introduce this year and next.
The executives are nonetheless surprised to find Ford so close behind and gaining fast. "Most of us didn't anticipate we'd see this, but we have to be careful -- we don't expect these trends will continue," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s executive director of market analysis, whose grandfather was making factory tools in a Chrysler plant here the last time Ford was ahead.
The most recent setback for G.M. has been in its initial effort to tap into the market for sport utilities based on car designs, like Honda Motor's Honda CR-V and Toyota Motor's Lexus RX 300 and Toyota Highlander. The car-based models offer a smoother ride and better fuel economy than traditional sport utilities. They are also less likely than pickup-based models to inflict major damage on cars during collisions, and they typically emit less of the gases linked to smog and global warming.
Sales of sport utilities based on car designs have tripled in the last year even as sales of sport utilities based on pickups have dropped 8.5 percent and the overall auto market has fallen 5.7 percent, according to Ward's Auto Info Bank, a market data service in Southfield, Mich.
G.M. and Ford jumped into the market for car-based sport utilities at almost the same time late last summer, with the Pontiac Aztek and the Ford Escape.
But the Aztek has been dubbed one of the ugliest automobiles in years by many auto reviewers, and has sold so poorly that G.M. has ordered hundreds of its engineers to start borrowing them from the company fleet so that at least some Aztek would be seen on Detroit roads.
The Escape is now the best-selling vehicle in the segment by a wide margin, and outsold the Aztek in April by 14,025 to 2,394. 
G.M. also missed the boom in pickup-based sport utilities in the 1990's, particularly full-size models, even though it had been making them longer than any other company, beginning in April 1935 with the Chevrolet Carryall Suburban. When Ford introduced the Expedition in 1996, it swiftly raised production to meet soaring demand. Its Expedition factory in Wayne, Mich., quickly generated more in overall profits than any factory in any industry, reaching an estimated $3.7 billion in pretax profits by 1998.
Only in the last year, as high gasoline prices, foreign competition and declining consumer interest have begun eroding the profitability of the market segment, has G.M. finally stepped up production significantly.
Ford led the move to aerodynamic styling in midsize cars in 1986 with the Taurus, which has been one of the nation's best-selling cars ever since. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, Ford paid more attention to attractive designs than G.M., which became so distracted with meeting new safety, emissions and fuel-economy regulations that it produced too many look-alike cars.
During the two recessions of the early 1980's, some questioned whether Ford could even survive. But because Ford came much closer to the brink of financial collapse then than G.M., the United Automobile Workers union let it lay off or push into retirement tens of thousands of workers, and allowed some restrictive work rules to be rewritten. G.M. was not as aggressive then in cutting its work force, and is only now coming close to matching Ford in factory productivity.
The decline of G.M. is the fading not just of an automotive giant but of a national institution that once wielded enormous influence. In 1928, when G.M.'s profits and market share were already soaring, there was a huge controversy when John Raskob, the chairman of the finance committee of G.M. board, was elected chairman of the National Democratic Committee and promptly moved its offices into the General Motors Building in New York. In the 1930's, G.M. bought up much of the nation's aircraft manufacturing and airline industries, as well as a big bank, although it has long since sold those investments.
G.M.'s vast corporate reach gave rise to the myth that one of its presidents, Charles E. Wilson, said in 1953 that "what's good for General Motors is good for the country." Mr. Wilson's actual words to a Senate committee, after he was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to become defense secretary, were somewhat different.
Asked by a senator if he could make a decision adverse to G.M.'s interests, Mr. Wilson replied, "I cannot conceive of one because for years I thought that what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa."
"Our company is too big, it goes with the welfare of the country," he added.
That dominance has gone the way of poodle skirts and outdoor waitresses on roller skates. Because of G.M.'s poor sense of the market, its share of auto sales in the United States has slumped to just 28 percent from 48 percent in 1978.
Ford has stayed remarkably steady at 23 percent, although partly by investing its profits over the last decade in the outright purchase of Jaguar, Aston Martin, Volvo and Land Rover. This has also raised the average price of Ford's vehicles, increasing total revenue. G.M. has instead purchased minority stakes in Fiat Auto and Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subarus, and has increased its minority stakes in Isuzu Motors and Suzuki Motor, but these companies remain independent and G.M. does not count them in its own sales.
Ford has surpassed G.M. on other criteria, like operating earnings and market capitalization. But in terms of revenue, Ford finished last year with $170.1 billion to G.M.'s $184.6 billion. That gap is closing and Ford will take the lead within the next several years unless G.M. makes a big acquisition or finally stabilizes its market share.
Last summer, Ford bought Land Rover, which has about $6 billion in annual sales, but only Land Rover's sales from July through December were included in last year's results. At the same time, G.M. plans to phase out its unprofitable Oldsmobile division, with $8 billion in sales, over the next several years. G.M. hopes to hold on to all of these revenues, said Darwin Clark, G.M.'s vice president for dealer relations.
But auto consultants say that G.M. will lose at least half of Oldsmobile's customers to rivals, so the loss of Oldsmobile could shave perhaps $4 billion from G.M.'s lead. Finally, G.M.'s board approved further talks with the News Corporation to dispose of Hughes Electronics, which had $8.7 billion in revenue last year. Add up these changes and it equals more than enough to wipe out the sales gap with Ford, even without further market-share deterioration by G.M.
Ford will not catch G.M. in overall sales this year, acknowledged Henry D. G. Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer. Like G.M. executives, Mr. Wallace contended that his priority was profits, not sales.
"With virtually the same revenues, our profitability was four times what theirs was," in the first quarter, Mr. Wallace said, keeping up the old Detroit tradition of chiding rival manufacturers.
Many in Detroit attribute G.M.'s persistent slowness in coming up with attractive car designs to a corporate culture in which executives are rotated from job to job without ever being punished for failure. By contrast, Ford has had a long history of pushing out unsuccessful managers as part of an often ruthless corporate culture.
G.M. executives acknowledge the criticism and say that changing the company's bureaucratic mind-set has been a top priority in recent years. "I don't think we can get done what we have to get done at this company without continued cultural change," said John Devine, G.M.'s vice chairman and chief financial officer and a former chief financial officer of Ford. 
But few doubt that G.M. has a long way to go. "I don't think the G.M. people consider themselves to be a business," said Gerald Meyers, a former chairman of American Motors who remains active in the auto industry as a consultant. "Every G.M. executive I've met has considered himself as part of an institution."

CHEMICAL COMPANY TO LAY OFF UP TO 1,260 PEOPLE

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Rohm & Haas Company said yesterday that it would lay off as many as 1,260 employees to cut costs and make the company, which produces specialty chemicals, more competitive. 
Rohm & Haas, which makes additives for paints and owns Morton Salt, said the job cuts would save at least $200 million by the end of 2002. Some of the job reductions will be tied to plant closings in California and Mississippi, said a spokeswoman, Laura Hadden. The company, based in Philadelphia, which also makes chemicals used in electronics, has been hurt by declining sales as the economy has slowed.

HEADLINE: Poetry and Lyrics From One Deep Well; 
Paul McCartney Publishes His First Book of Verse

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL 

 BODY:
Some years ago, Paul McCartney, famous musician and fledgling poet, took a deep breath and showed a selection of his poetic works in progress to his old friend Allen Ginsberg.
 Ginsberg, who was visiting Mr. McCartney at his house in Sussex, England, had some thoughts. "He was all for economy," Sir Paul, as he has been known the last few years, said recently in his friendly Liverpudlian lilt, recalling his frisson of fear when Ginsberg took out his pencil and began cutting and tweaking. "He said to me: 'Never use the word "the." And also try to avoid "ing" -- don't use "singing," but use "sing" instead.' " 
 When Ginsberg suggested he change a poem beginning "Two doors open on the 18th of June" to "Two doors open. June 18," the lyricist put his foot down. "I said it's great, but you're making me into a New York Beat poet," said Sir Paul, who kept a copy of the scribbled-over "Ginsberg Variations," as he calls them, for posterity, though he took none of Ginsberg's suggestions. 
Sir Paul is so used to having critical control that he submits to editing only reluctantly. "Sometimes I've made small suggestions for cuts or changes, and sometimes Paul's accepted them," writes his editor in Britain, the poet Adrian Mitchell, in the preface to Sir Paul's first book of poetry, "Blackbird Singing," which has just been published in the United States by W. W. Norton. And so the poems in the book are very much his own, expressing his familiar obsessions with love and loss and life's vicissitudes in language that is generally simple and direct. 
In the flesh for an interview at his office in New York, he could not help appearing startlingly familiar, as if he were a cousin who just happened to be really famous. While the other surviving Beatles seem to have grown sharper and craggier, Sir Paul, 58, has softened. His face is still boyish and open, albeit creased with minor wrinkles. Discussing his poems while sitting on an immaculate black couch across from a de Kooning painting, he was dressed in a T-shirt, plaid pants and the sort of clogs that a hipster surgeon might wear on hospital rounds.
He is a canny manager of his empire and career, whose net worth, according to The Sunday Times of London, stands at more than $1 billion. In 1997 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, which made him officially Sir Paul. But it is as strange to think of him that way as it is to think of the rock star Bob Geldof -- a knight as well, and far scruffier than the always clean and shiny Paul McCartney -- as Sir Bob.
One of the striking things about "Blackbird Singing" is the bold inclusion of some 50 of the former Beatle's lyrics among more than 40 poems, a decision that cannot help but raise the old question about whether lyrics stand as poetry in their own right. Sir Paul is not so sure, though he was cheered when Ginsberg told him, long ago, that " 'Eleanor Rigby' is one hell of a poem." (Its lyrics appear in the book, along with those of "Hey Jude" and "Maxwell's Silver Hammer," among others.) 
Though they emanate from the same impulse, poems and songs come to him in very different ways, Sir Paul explained, mostly having to do with whether he has a musical instrument on hand. 
With songs he generally works through the lyrics and melody simultaneously, he said, illustrating his point by re-enacting on an imaginary piano how he hashed out the beginning of "Eleanor Rigby." 
"I was sitting at the piano vamping on the E minor chord," he said. He sang some of the notes, then began: "Da da da da da -- Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice . . . And in actual fact, it wasn't Eleanor Rigby, it was something else, because I got the name Eleanor Rigby later. Sometimes the real words arrive, and sometimes I have to kind of go back and fix it." 
"It's like 'Yesterday,' " he continued, starting to sing again. "At first it was 'Scrambled eggs/ Oh my baby how I love your legs,' which I thought, 'That's gotta be fixed. Can't go with that one.' " Similarly, he said, "Hey Jude," written for John Lennon's son Julian when his parents split up, was originally called "Hey Jules" until he decided that Jude was crisper. 
In poems, he said, the language tends to come and stay put. He wrote "Jerk of All Jerks," for instance, after being immersed, along with the rest of the world, in the news coverage of Lennon's murder in 1980. "The one phrase that came to my mind was that the guy who did it was the jerk of all jerks," Sir Paul said. 
The only other explicit reference to Lennon in the book comes in the lyrics to "Here Today," from 1982. It is an affectionate song, alluding to his and Lennon's mismatched temperaments and to Lennon's spikiness, but also to their underlying love. The two put aside their differences before Lennon died. "We had been arguing about stupid stuff -- money and things, things that weren't really important in our relationship but were the kind of things people argue about," Sir Paul said. But then they began to talk again. "We talked about him baking bread, him putting the cats out, him padding around the apartment in his robe and slippers, him bringing up his baby, Sean," he recalled. "It was really intimate and mature, good real talk between friends." 
In a way, Lennon's ghost -- the ghost of what might have been -- haunts the book, as does the spirit of Sir Paul's wife, Linda, who died of breast cancer in 1998 and who inspired some of his sweetest love poems and songs.
In 29 years of marriage, Mr. McCartney never spent a night apart from his wife except when he was in a Tokyo jail on drug charges in 1980, and he spent the year after her death in nearly constant grief, he said. He now has a girlfriend, Heather Mills, 33, a feisty former model whose leg was severed in an accident and who campaigns for land mine reform.
As he discussed his wife's death and his new life, his volubility fled for a moment, and he jumped up to adjust a chair on the other side of the room that was not sitting perfectly in line with the carpet. "It was perhaps unlikely in my life that I would have two strong women who I felt so strongly about," he said carefully. "Even though it's early days in my new relationship, I do feel lucky to have met someone strong and interesting and beautiful."
"Blackbird Singing" has been a best seller in Britain, but the critical reaction has been mixed, as always happens when Sir Paul embarks on a new venture. Some critics were delighted: "Unlike more rarefied poets, who communicate mostly with each other in obscure crannies of our culture, McCartney writes as freely (and often as beautifully) as a blackbird sings," Stephen Logan wrote in The Sunday Times of London.
But others have made it clear that they think his talents are strictly musical. "They're not bad so much as unfinished and inconsequential," Mark Hertsgaard wrote of the poems in The Los Angeles Times. 
The new poet tries not to care. "It's not as if I'm not used to it," he said. " 'She Loves You' was called banal when it came out -- it was the first time I had ever heard the word." And a review in The New York Times, he said, judged "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" "a very bad album," in Sir Paul's words. "But," he said, "I just get on with it." 
And, judging from Mr. McCartney's two poetry readings, one in Liverpool and the other at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, he is in no danger of losing his extraordinary appeal. Charming the onlookers out of their seats with engaging anecdotes, he ended both readings with rousing audience-participation recitations of "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?," included partly as a retort to critics who said some of his lyrics would not stand up to the rigors of being read aloud. 
In Liverpool he kept his cool even amid the most frenzied of fans. Swept up in a crowd of more than 1,000, he was greeted by a teenage girl who wore a vintage Beatlemania button that said "I slept with Paul McCartney."
"Oh, really," said Mr. McCartney, flashing a huge grin, "When was that?"

Next Mayor Will Inherit Hard Times

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
MYSTIFYING. A crowd of at least a half-dozen is fighting it out to be the next mayor of New York, a job that, objectively speaking, nobody should want. It's abundantly clear that Rudolph W. Giuliani's reputation as dragon-slayer will torment his successor. No way out of that one. But beyond that, the next few years are shaping up as dauntingly rocky for the city's 108th mayor.
 For one thing, Mr. Giuliani, indulging in a bit of apres moi-ism, is poised to leave the next guy with some heavy lifting. For another, there are growing indications of troubled times ahead because of factors no mayor can control. In fact, those factors control mayors, starting with the economy. 
 It is slowing. "The city's economy is going from being boomlike to moderately expanding to flat, all in the course of little more than a year," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "I think we are going to see much more significant layoffs and lost incomes in coming months, and that's going to take down the city's economy another notch."
In the last year, revenue from real estate transaction taxes and from estimates on the personal income tax have slowed, data from the comptroller's office show. Businesses from advertising to tourism are cooling off, and investment banking and brokerage companies on Wall Street are expected to follow suit soon.
Mr. Giuliani's new budget plan projects a large budget gap, and fiscal experts expect that the budget surplus, which the city traditionally uses to help close the gap, will be smaller than in recent years.
So it seems more than likely that to pay the bills, the next mayor will have to make some unpopular decisions, especially since Mr. Giuliani wants over $500 million in tax cuts, which will probably win approval in some form from the City Council, since Speaker Peter F. Vallone is running for mayor.
The mayor contends that lower taxes have stimulated and will continue to stimulate the economy. "At the same time, he's making it harder for the next administration and the next Council to balance the budget if the economy doesn't strengthen soon," said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office.
To complicate matters, a good hunk of next year's costs are unknown. Most municipal employees are working under expired contracts, and some, including the police and teachers' unions, may not settle until Mr. Giuliani leaves office. That means the next mayor gets the chore of handling negotiations, saddled with limited resources in this mayor's budget.
The same for two other big-ticket items: maintaining an expanded police force and dealing with impending changes in federal financing of welfare. Key to the crime reduction has been a very large police force, which has grown to 40,710 uniformed officers from 32,000 in 1989, before Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Council began an expansion that Mr. Giuliani continued.
When the economy was booming, the city could afford the large force, including the 4,000 police officers hired since 1996 under federal crime legislation and partly financed by Washington.
By next year all but 500 of those officers will have to be paid with city funds at a cost of $200 million, not counting wage increases. 
THE next mayor clearly cannot afford, politically, to shrink the force; he'll have to find a way to compensate for the missing federal money. The same could be true of federal welfare dollars.
The city and state stand to lose a bundle -- and not just for welfare -- unless Washington reauthorizes the welfare overhaul act of 1996 by September 2002. The state welfare population is about half what it was five years ago, but Washington sends the same amount of money to New York State now as it did then, which translates into a $1.7 billion annual surplus.
The city uses about $470 million of that money for child care, employment training and other services for welfare recipients. Albany spends its share of the surplus on costs both related to and unrelated to welfare, ranging from mass transit and education to covering the cost of tax cuts. If Congress reduces the welfare authorization, the city and state will be scrambling to pay for those programs.
These headaches and more will greet the next mayor. He will have a chance to preside over what could be the lean years after all those fat ones, and probably to dead-end his career, because we all know mayors of New York City never get anywhere beyond the five boroughs.
Now we really know why.

HEADLINE: DEAL IS REACHED ON U.S. SPENDING 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
A day after agreeing to cut taxes by $1.35 trillion over the next 11 years, the White House and Congressional negotiators settled today on a spending increase for next year greater than what President Bush had sought but less than what most Democrats said was needed to pay for domestic programs and the military.
 The deal was criticized by Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill but won the support of a handful of moderate Democrats whose votes the administration needs to get the measure through the evenly divided Senate. 
 The agreement, the final major piece of the first budget of Mr. Bush's presidency, called for an increase in spending of slightly less than 5 percent on programs whose budgets are set by Congress each year, including the Pentagon and most domestic initiatives outside of Social Security and Medicare. 
Mr. Bush had sought to limit the increase in these programs to 4 percent next year after an increase of 8.5 percent in the current fiscal year and amid a growing sense, especially among conservatives, that budget discipline was breaking down in an era of expanding budget surpluses. The initial plan passed by the Senate last month would have increased spending by more than 8 percent.
The increases would bring spending on the programs next year to $666.6 billion, up from $635.4 billion this year. Of that amount, $324.8 billion would go to the military and $341.8 billion to domestic programs. The total budget for the year, including Medicare, Social Security and interest payments on the national debt, would come to slightly less than $2 trillion.
Congressional aides were still working on the details late today as they rushed to have the measure ready for a vote in the House and probably the Senate on Thursday. But it appeared that the compromise stripped from the budget outline much of the increase in education spending that the Senate had originally supported. It retained plans for long-term increases in spending on agriculture, and provided up to $300 billion over the next decade for adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
"It's an agreement that makes a lot of sense," Mr. Bush said as he began a meeting at the White House with Republican leaders and several Democrats who supported the deal, including Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Ben Nelson of Nebraska.
The deal on spending for next year came a day after negotiators had agreed that the budget plan would call for a tax cut of $1.25 trillion over the next decade, plus $100 billion in immediate tax cuts in this calendar year to give a boost to the flagging economy. Mr. Bush had sought a tax cut of $1.6 trillion.
In a sign that Republicans are likely to push for tax cuts beyond those included in the spending plan, the House today passed legislation that would expand the 401(k) and individual retirement account programs. By exempting higher levels of retirement savings from taxation, the bill would reduce federal revenues by $52 billion over the next 10 years.
The bill would gradually raise the maximum contribution by employees to 401(k) accounts to $15,000 in 2006, from the current level of $10,500. It would also gradually raise the maximum contribution to individual retirement accounts to $5,000 in 2004, from $2,000 currently. It would also make it easier for employees to keep their pensions when they change jobs.
The broad bipartisan support for the bill -- it passed 407 to 24 -- led some Republicans to predict that it could also pass the Senate even if it was not in the $1.25 trillion tax-cut package that the Senate Finance Committee plans to draw up next week.
The president held up the budget agreement today as evidence that he can build bipartisan coalitions to back his agenda, saying the deal was the result of hard work by members of Congress "who realized that what we're talking about is not partisan politics, but good budget politics, good budget policy."
But the deal had much to do with the complicated politics of Congress, especially the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans each hold 50 seats and shifting alliances are shaping legislation case by case. 
In this instance, the negotiators had to patch together an agreement that would keep at least a few moderate Democrats on board in the Senate without alienating conservative Republicans in the House.
In addition to Mr. Breaux and Mr. Nelson, two other Democratic senators, Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and Zell Miller of Georgia, signaled their support for the compromise by attending today's meeting at the White House. Two Democrats from the House, Representatives Gary A. Condit of California and Ken Lucas of Kentucky, also attended, along with the Republican leaders of both chambers.
But Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said that the spending level was unrealistic. 
Mr. Daschle said there would not be room for increases in spending that have bipartisan support, like for education, much less for expensive initiatives that are sure to be fought over in Congress, including Mr. Bush's call for a national missile defense, whose price tag remains unknown. The $300 billion budgeted for prescription drug coverage for retirees is widely considered to be less than what the program will ultimately cost.
After completing a review of the nation's military posture in the next few weeks, the Pentagon is expected to seek hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade in spending beyond what the current budget contemplates. 
The dispute over spending is not entirely partisan. Republicans on the appropriations committees, which set the spending levels for each program, have already signaled that the overall increase of less than 5 percent is not enough to pass the spending bills this year.
In any case, the spending levels set in the budget plan that Congress is working on are nonbinding, and have been routinely breached in recent years by the time the appropriators have finished their work. Republicans said they would try to avoid doing so again this year, noting that Mr. Bush could veto appropriations bills that get too big, but even they did not sound totally convinced.
"There will be much more pressure this year to stay within the numbers, and there's a chance that will happen," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

HEADLINE: Top Democrats Warn of Battle On Missile Plan 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats put forward some of their most influential voices on national security policy today and made clear that President Bush's plans for an expansive missile defense system could well become a defining point of contention between the two parties.
 Just a day after Mr. Bush outlined a sweeping new security strategy, the Democrats raised sharp questions about his plan, bringing up issues of arms control, diplomacy, military strategy and the budgetary implications of an interwoven antimissile shield based on land, at sea, in the air and in space. 
 They said they would consider it a grave mistake for President Bush to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which its defenders say has been the cornerstone of nuclear deterrence, and warned that unilateral deployment of a robust missile defense system could leave the nation less secure by sparking a new arms race. 
Standing alongside the ranking Democrats on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said Mr. Bush had begun "one of the most important and consequential debates we will see in our lifetime."
Mr. Daschle questioned whether a missile defense was technologically feasible and said, "A missile defense system that undermines our nation politically, economically and strategically -- without providing any real security -- is no defense at all."
Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, charged that the president's speech amounted to a unilateral decision "wrapped in conciliatory rhetoric." 
Raising the possibility that Russia might stop dismantling its nuclear arsenal, he said, "I have great concerns about a unilateral decision, because I believe that it could risk a second cold war -- Cold War II, I call it."
Mr. Bush has described only his vision for missile defense and has proposed no specific weapons systems or budget figure, and so "the devil is in the details," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
If the United States deployed a system that could strike down most missiles from North Korea, but which caused Russia and China to start a new arms race, "would America be more protected or less protected?" he asked.
The Democrats conceded that while the Senate approves treaties, it does not have the power to stop the president from withdrawing the United States from the ABM treaty. But they could try to exert leverage through the annual bills providing money for Pentagon programs.
Mr. Levin said Democrats in the Senate would "try in some way to stop the expenditure of funds for a system that would abrogate the ABM treaty." But in a Senate split 50-50 with Vice President Dick Cheney holding the deciding vote, that could prove difficult.
The statements marked a new aggressiveness by Democrats on missile defense, a favorite issue of conservatives, and one that Democrats sought to blunt under the lead of President Bill Clinton.
One Democratic strategist on Capitol Hill said the party now felt freed from having to follow policies adopted under Mr. Clinton, and he called the brewing dispute over missile defense both a matter of policy and politics. 
He said that just as missile defense energized the Republicans' conservative base, Democratic loyalists and primary voters were strongly opposed to an expensive and unproven missile defense system. Several Senate Democrats are eyeing a presidential run in 2004.
Just two years ago, after Mr. Clinton dropped his longstanding veto threat, the Senate, by a vote of 97 to 3, overwhelmingly approved legislation to field a system to defend the country against limited attack from long-range missiles. 
All but three Democrats agreed to the measure after working out a compromise that they said ensured that any antimissile system would not interfere with arms control negotiations with Russia and that Congress would still have to authorize missile defense funds annually.
That turnaround was driven both new policy considerations in a post-cold-war world and by domestic politics. It came after a bipartisan commission headed by Donald H. Rumsfeld -- now Mr. Bush's defense secretary -- warned that within five years North Korea and Iran could have the potential to hit the United States with a ballistic missile. Democrats were also aware that going into the presidential election, Republicans were accusing them of a failed foreign policy and a weak military program.
Mr. Biden acknowledged that when he voted to make it United States policy to field a system against ballistic missile threats from so-called rogue nations in 1999, he did not think there was "any immediacy to it." 
Mr. Levin also said that in that vote, Democrats had agreed to field such a system only "when technically feasible" and only after reasserting their commitment to negotiate further arms reductions with Russia.
The Democrats conceded that they did not yet know many of the fundamentals of what Mr. Bush was proposing. In his speech on Tuesday he all but declared the ABM treaty dead and vowed to replace it with a new "framework." But he never said what that framework would be.
Some of the same themes were struck by other Democrats throughout the day. Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said that "it would be folly to abandon the ABM treaty" before the Pentagon was close to developing a missile defense system that could work.
On the Senate floor, Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said that "missile defense is only a response of last resort, when diplomacy and deterrence have failed." He added, "And given that no missile defense system will be 100 percent effective, we must not set aside the logic of deterrence that has kept us safe for 40 years."
Mr. Kerry called Mr. Bush's proposal to reduce American nuclear stockpiles unilaterally "an important and overdue first step toward reducing the nuclear danger." But he said Mr. Bush would have to persuade his fellow Republicans to go ahead with the cuts.

HEADLINE: Where Roads Can Do Harm 

BYLINE:  By Jim Lyons; Jim Lyons, a professor at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, was under secretary of agriculture for natural resources and environment under Bill Clinton.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Tomorrow the Bush administration is expected to announce its plans for the fate of President Clinton's initiative to keep nearly 60 million acres of our national forests free of new roads. This so-called roadless rule, issued Jan. 5, is one of the most important environmental efforts of the Clinton administration.
 While President Bush might argue the need for additional scientific review as a basis for some of his recent environmental decisions -- postponing stricter limits for arsenic in water, for example -- it is difficult to make a case for a further review or delay of the roadless rule. The facts, which were debated and reviewed over three years, are indisputable. 
 Roadless areas are important sources of clean water for many Western cities. As habitats for threatened and endangered species, they are vital to our efforts to preserve and restore biological diversity. Under the Clinton rule, more than half of the 192 million acres of national forest would remain available for logging, mining or other activity. The rule would have limited economic impact, since the roadless areas would have provided less than half of 1 percent of the nation's timber. Existing oil and gas leases (which provide less than 1 percent of domestic production) would stay in place.
Those who argue that access to our national forests will be limited without new roads ignore the 386,000 miles of roads that already exist, most in disrepair. If there is to be additional expenditure on forest roads, priority ought to be given to better maintaining existing roads and bridges.
Playing on public fears, opponents also argue that banning new roads will put communities at greater risk from wildfire. But the roadless rule permits road building when there is imminent threat of fire and allows the harvesting of small trees to reduce that risk.
Unfortunately, a federal judge in Boise, Idaho, ruled last month that the three-year process under which the roadless rule was developed was inadequate, even though it drew 1.6 million public comments and involved 600 public meetings. The public overwhelmingly supported the strongest possible protections for roadless lands. The judge stopped short of issuing a final order against implementation of the rule, saying he would wait for the Bush administration to report on its vision for roadless areas. To date, the administration has offered no defense of the roadless rule and every indication that it will seek significant change in the policy.
A move away from protecting roadless lands could imperil the Forest Service's entire road program. In 1997 Congress, concerned with both environmental damage and the cost of roads, came close to eliminating the entire forest road budget. Only the Clinton administration's commitment to consider protections for roadless areas saved the program. Should road building into protected areas begin again, money for maintaining and improving the existing roads would likely come under renewed attack.
Any attempt by President Bush to eliminate or modify roadless protections is almost certain to reignite the wars between timber interests and environmentalists in his father's administration. Those conflicts, sparked by court injunctions against national forest timber sales, eventually led to the creation of President Clinton's Northwest Forest Plan. Limited resources would be better spent managing forests than on more litigation.
Protecting the nation's remaining roadless lands is a scientifically sound, popular and politically pragmatic policy. It should not be sacrificed to ideology when the benefits are so clear.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
* denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ABCD: A COLLECTION OF ART BRUT," Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 977-7170 (through July). Memorably vivid and widely abused, the phrase Art Brut (literally meaning raw or rough art) was coined in the 1940's by the French artist Jean Dubuffet. This exhibition, drawn from the holdings of a Paris-based foundation, tries to reinstate his original meaning, revisiting the amazing pantheon of artists who inspired it and proposing some additions. Its many highlights include works by acknowledged greats like Adolf Wolfli, Aloise Corbaz, Henry Darger and Augustin Lesage, but the show also introduces many equally riveting artists unfamiliar to American audiences. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).

* "AFRICAN FORMS," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; and spoons, weapons and musical instruments. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+ (Smith).

* "BITSTREAMS" AND "DATA DYNAMICS," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through June 10). Companion digital shows with a well-mannered, slightly dull air of decorous efficiency and cheerful modernity that encapsulates what you may regard as an ethos at large. Both affairs survey the new technological age in art, and there is no denying the inevitability of the big message here, which we discount at the risk of sheer stupidity: technology is changing how artists, especially young ones, make all types of art and, in turn, how we experience it. Still, the work produced needs to answer the old question: Does it move us? And there's the rub. A few artists, like Paul Pfeiffer and Jeremy Blake, stand out in "BitStreams." In "Data Dynamics," works like "Apartment" and "Netomat," metaphors for the Web as global unconscious, suggest that Internet art is at least becoming more like traditional media, whereby most but no longer all of what you see is unremarkable. Don't skip the sound section in "BitStreams," 25 audio artists working squarely in the tradition of musique concrete, a half-century-old movement but with new digital means replacing tape recorders. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays; Saturdays, Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "WILLIAM BLAKE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 24). A touching and beautiful show if you have a taste for Blake's art, which strives for ecstatic revelation on the level of his famous visions and rises to the heights of his verse, sometimes. From the Age of Aquarius to New Age, he has come to serve as the patron saint of flower children, Jungians, Freudians, occultists, spiritualists, nudists, unpublished authors, animal lovers, socialists and teenagers of the sort who read Hermann Hesse. By turning our attention to his laborious illustrations and watercolors, the exhibition compels us to think about him as a serious and original visual artist, which is to say as a more idiosyncratic and substantial figure than the cliches suggest. He truly believed that the world was ending and that he had been sent to set things right at the last minute. Whatever else he may or may not have been, Blake was the most genuine and uncompromising artist you can think of. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* LEANDRO ERLICH, "Neighbors," El Museo del Barrio, Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through May 20). The first solo museum show by this young artist is a single, stagelike self-enclosed environment. The scene is a drab apartment building hallway lined with closed doors fitted with peepholes. An elevator opens at the push of a button, but leaves you peering down into an empty shaft. The results feel like a blend of Magritte, Hopper and Hitchcock: reality turns surreal; the everyday world is a forlorn, walk-in still life charged with voyeuristic tension. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

* "ANDREAS GURSKY," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 15). The giant pictures in this midcareer retrospective of Mr. Gursky, the 46-year-old German photographer, are so eye-poppingly, drop-dead gorgeous that in this world, where no good turn goes unpunished, you may feel compelled to react with suspicion and reserve. But knee-jerk resistance at the sight of the nondescript global emblems of new capitalist sprawl that he photographs is short-circuited by sheer awe at the incredible, sublimely weird, almost erotic glamour he imparts to them. The work is instantly attractive to the point of alarm, which is the feeling of falling in love. You might as well give yourself over to it and worry about the consequences later. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8:15 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

"HEADING WEST: MAPPING THE TERRITORY" AND "TOURING WEST: 19TH-CENTURY PERFORMING ARTISTS ON THE OREGON TRAIL," New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. These exceptional and deftly dovetailed shows provide sobering insights into our corporate-driven, celebrity-crazed, racially tense times by revisiting the relentless westward push that formed the United States. "Heading West" (through May 19) deploys a cache of often extraordinary maps to trace the progress of explorers, mapmakers, settlers, railroad builders, gold diggers and the repeatedly deceived and displaced American Indians. "Touring West" (through July 7) uses all manner of theatrical emphemera, among much else, to show that where the new Americans went, intrepid entertainers of every ilk and several nationalities were never far behind. Hours: Mondays, and Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Smith).

* PAUL McCARTHY, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through May 13). From his far-out position where the psychic security of Hollywood's packaging of sex and violence doesn't exist, Mr. McCarthy taps veins deep in the collective subconscious, well beyond where most shock artists have the audacity or intelligence to operate. He has been a cultish presence in Los Angeles for years, and his moment has finally come in New York. We see an artist of wild highs and lows, of black comedy, cheap jokes, unspeakable actions, dry formalism and some real fiascoes -- the mark of an artist risking failure, a good sign. There is something beyond mere Pop parody or social provocation in the work, something to do with deep private needs and desires, which we perceive secondhand as comic pathos. It is art as tough therapy, disturbingly honest. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, artists, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but a beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and 60+ (Smith).

* "SULTAN ALI OF MASHHAD, MASTER OF NASTALIQ," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 27). Sultan Ali (1442-1520), one of the titans of Islamic calligraphy, was born in the northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad and spent most of his long working life at the Timurid capital of Herat, where he perfected the elegant cursive style known as nastaliq and produced extravagant manuscripts for the court. Several examples of his work are included in this smoldering little show of books and album pages. And anyone wanting to get a sense of the exalted status that writing had in the Islamic world and of just how luminous illuminated manuscripts can be will be able to do so here. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "THE TREASURY OF BASEL CATHEDRAL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 27). The jewel-embellished gold and silver liturgical objects and reliquaries in this show exist on some exotic outer fringe of beauty where the crass and the ineffable meet. Together they have a cliffhanger of a tale to tell, as frustrating as it is uplifting. (They were preserved as an ensemble until Basel city politics intervened in the 19th century.) There's the rarity factor: almost none of the 75 works have visited the United States before. And it's hard to remember the last time anything quite like their single-minded incandescence radiated from a local museum. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "VAN GOGH'S POSTMAN: THE PORTRAITS OF JOSEPH ROULIN," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 15). This revelatory micro-exhibition reunites five portraits of the postal worker Joseph Roulin, whom van Gogh met in Arles. The show affords an excellent opportunity to study the painter's craft as he processes a single motif through a series of approaches from painterly naturalism to richly patterned symbolism. It is fascinating as well to see the portraits in light of the biographical background. Roulin cared for van Gogh after the famous ear-cutting incident, and he grew in the artist's imagination from an amusing local character to a figure of Christ-like benevolence. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).

* "VERMEER AND THE DELFT SCHOOL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through May 27). Genius does not flourish in a vacuum. That's the simple lesson vividly conveyed by this alternately tousled and crystalline exhibition. With 15 Vermeers -- nearly half his known paintings -- serving as ballast, this exhibition almost giddily spotlights a succession of artists, tracking the emergence of an increasingly effortless illusionism in Delft in the 1650's and 60's. Flower still lifes, whitewashed church interiors, townscapes and genre scenes by Pieter de Hooch, Carel Fabritius and Gerard Houckgeest are part of the mix, along with drawings and a breathtaking selection of small landscapes by artists you've never heard of. All this contextualizing sharpens one's sense of Vermeer's achievement, but it also spells out the milieu without which he would not have been Vermeer. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

"FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND THE ART OF JAPAN: THE ARCHITECT'S OTHER PASSION," Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through July 15). Some shows are like a vigorous read; you have to concentrate and try to follow the plot. Wright, an architectural colossus and a wily diva of a man, is the main character. The story of his infatuation with Japanese art, and of how he turned that love to lucrative ends by moonlighting as a top-dollar dealer in woodblock prints -- at least until disaster struck -- is a rich one. It's told through dozens of architectural drawings, documentary photographs, woodblock prints and a superb accompanying book by the curator, Julia Meech, which wraps wide-ranging art historical research in a nimble, personable style. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 students and 65+ (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

BERND AND HILLA BECHER, "Photographs From the 1960's and 70's," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677. (through May 25). This exhibition samples the early efforts of the German team that helped establish the camera's art-world credentials with rigorous black-and-white photographs of lime kilns, blast furnaces and water towers that capture the body industrial (Smith).

* LOUISE BOURGEOIS, "The Personages," C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020 (through June 9). Bone-skinny, striking and each an individual, Ms. Bourgeois's 19 bronze "Personages" are enigmatic, people-size totems that stand in amiable camaraderie, like well-behaved guests at a cultural soiree. But their presence is insistent. Made from 1947 to 1953, and Surrealistic in origin, they greet the viewer at eye level, dispensing with the built-up bases that afflicted most earlier sculpture. Revisiting this powerful body of work strengthens awareness of the inspired personal vision with which Ms. Bourgeoise has enriched the universe of sculpture (Grace Glueck).

JIM PETERS, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through May 19). Carnal desire animates deliberately grungy assemblages and collages, in a show by an artist with a master's degree in nuclear engineering. The contrast between roughly built, crustily painted structural elements and the photographs of attractive naked women that they frame suggests a tension between raw actuality and idealizing fantasy. One senses an underlying anxiety, which might be worth making more visible (Johnson).

HOUGHTON CRANFORD SMITH, "The Purist Landscapes," Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through May 12). In Paris in the early 1930's this American painter learned Purism, a variation on Cubism, from Amedee Ozenfant. Returning to New York, Smith combined idealizing simplification and finely textured paint in pastoral landscapes, producing images of New England hills or harbors or South American mountains that call to mind Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent and Charles Sheeler. But they also have their own slightly comical, slightly melancholy serenity (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

CHARLES HARBUTT, "Dreams and Memories . . . ," Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930 (through May 19). This small retrospective looks back on an admirable 40-year career in photojournalism. With affectionate warmth and great framing instincts, Mr. Harbutt captures moments of riveting narrative pregnancy. In a shot in Milan in 1970, for example, five businessmen gather on an astonishingly long modern stairway against a high wall splashed by sunlight; you feel an almost divine immanence (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

ANTONIO FRASCONI, Sragow, 73 Spring Street, (212) 219-1793 (through May 19) and El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through May 20). This eminent, socially engaged printmaker is showing rough expressionistic, politically charged woodcuts from the 1940's at Sragow. At El Museo del Barrio is a recent series of richly colored, textured and abstracted prints that illustrate Langston Hughes's poem "Let America Be America Again" (Johnson).

ROBERT RYMAN AND IAN WILSON, Peter Blum Gallery, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through June 2). Bringing together examples of Mr. Ryman's stripped-down paintings and evidence from Mr. Wilson's various Conceptual Art activities, this exhibition tellingly contrasts different kinds of aesthetic purism (Smith).

VALTON TYLER, Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212) 925-1200 (through May 31). The paintings by this self-taught Texan verge on a kind of surrealistic kitsch, but they are persuasively strange. At his best, in large, weirdly stylized landscapes, Mr. Tyler accumulates simplified tubular and spiky forms into dense jungle scenes, which have the Cubist palpability and otherworldly dreaminess of Henri Rousseau (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

* "ANOTHER, ONCE AGAIN, MANY TIMES MORE," Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772 (through May 12). This show of serial work has something for everybody, and possibly a little too much for some viewers. John Torreano covers the wall with bejewelled half-spheres, Lisa Beck with painted tondos, Nancy Shaver with stacked architectural outtakes and David Morreno with a suave pattern-painting titled "Door Knob Head: The Movie Sequence." Michael St. John edges into fraught terrain with a sculptural lineup of serial killers from horror films. Daniel Hesidence follows up with alarming paintings of bullet-strafed heads, all women. Howard Johnson is an island unto himself with thick collages made of ink drawings, reflective stickers, floor plans and G-strings, forming a grimy looking insider-Outsider Art melange with lots of promise (Cotter).

* ROBERT BARRY, "Early Works, 1966-73," Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-9494 (through May 19). This beautifully installed exhibition presents classic works by a pioneer of dematerialized art. Mr. Barry's visually minimal, verbally paradoxical works operate like Zen koans to heighten awareness of the mystery of consciousness. One, penciled in fine block letters on the wall, reads, "All the things I know but of which I am not at the moment thinking -- 1:36 PM; June 15, 1969" (Johnson).

FARIBA HAJAMADI, Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212) 462-2668 (through May 12). This brainy, Iranian-born conceptualist uses photography to explore unspoken ideologies that drive Western museum practices. In six large, handsome, digitally manipulated views of museum exhibition spaces, Ms. Hajamadi gives her project an obliquely autobiographical spin by including obscure reflections of her own image and composing her own fictive installations of art and artifacts (Johnson).

"HOME AND THE WORLD: AN EXPLORATION OF IDENTITY AT CROSSROADS," India Center of Art and Culture, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 462-4221 (through May 31). The center is a recently opened nonprofit space devoted equally to art, literature, music and film, and most of those media play some role in this group exhibition of contemporary artists of Indian descent (Cotter).

MELISSA MEYER; ALEX STOLYAROV, Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666 (through May 19). Ms. Meyer's loosely gridded, confidently improvised paintings exude a fine summery light. With wide brushes she layers loopy squiggles of color over radiant patchwork fields; the effect is rigorously economical yet hedonistically sumptuous. Mr. Stolyarov's compact, extremely thick, lusciously colored monochrome abstractions are like giant Chiclets (Johnson).

RUTH ROOT, Andrew Kreps, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849 (through May 12). A mischievous subversive, Ms. Root likes to paint little smoking cigarettes into the cracks between blocks of color in her grid-based abstractions. Now, for her second solo show, she adds instead a pair of little eyes to each picture, so that the paintings seem imbued with watchful consciousness. The artist also continues to create small, shaped and painted collages with no comic gimmicks, just a spirit of a lighthearted yet formally rigorous play (Johnson).

Other Galleries

* SIMON LEE AND CLAIRE LESTEVEN, Smack Mellon Studios, 56 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761 (through May 13). In Mr. Lee's cinematic installation, a screen stretching across the darkened gallery is filled with luminous drifting images of animals, trees, houses and figures, which appear to be under a microscope lens. They are all "live" projections of tiny plastic forms floating in a tank of eddying water. The results are a metaphor for the random flow of history, and a low-tech formal tour de force. In a separate solo show, Ms. Lesteven shows photographs and videos made with multi-aperture cyclindrical versions of a pinpoint camera, producing eerily distorted pictures of public spaces. Here, too, the means are straightforward, the ends evocative (Cotter).

QIU ZHIJIE, Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250 (through May 19). This young Beijing-based artist makes his New York debut with a show that plays with and extends classical forms. Calligraphic scrolls carry outtakes from the dictionary. On other scrolls, elements of ink-and-brush landscapes -- trees, figures, pavilions -- are cut loose from their original contexts. In a video the artist writes out Tang dynasty poems, but the tape is played backward so that he seems to be erasing them. He's moving in several directions at this point, but certain themes (cultural fragmentation, transience) and attitudes (brash Zen-style wit, nostalgia) are constants (Cotter).

Last Chance

GEORGES ADEAGBO, "Abraham: L'Ami de Dieu," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Sunday). Mr. Adeagbo, born in Benin in 1942, is making his United States debut with a rich, deceptively low-key installation that resembles an African outdoor market, a New York City sidewalk sale and a personal archive in the process of being sorted. Hundreds of objects are neatly arranged on the floor and walls: paintings, secondhand books, record albums, African sculptures and magazines, many of which the artist gathered in New York, sent to Africa, then brought back for the show, reversing the global itinerary of African art centuries ago. It's a myth-laden history of the world, of art and of African and American culture circa 1960. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2, students and 60+ (Cotter).

DALE CHIHULY, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900 (through tomorrow). The master glass blower from Seattle is back, with spectacular chandeliers resembling tropical submarine flora and giant vases holding fantastic glass flowers. The material, color and luminosity of Mr. Chilhuly's work is undeniably seductive; the grandiose theatricality is a little annoying and the line between art and high-priced kitsch very fine (Johnson).

* "CORREGGIO AND PARMIGIANINO: MASTER DRAFTSMEN OF THE RENAISSANCE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Sunday). This copious and beautiful exhibition has nearly 130 drawings by two artists who were aligned in time, geography and, briefly, style in the third decade of the 16th century. Correggio, who blew the roof off Renaissance illusionism with the ecstatic ceiling paintings that he made in Parma in the 1520's, is represented by a room of exquisite mostly red-chalk studies that reflect a penchant for brazen foreshortening, glowing light and atmospheric sfumato. The two galleries of Parmigianino's drawings seem true to his Mannerist sensibility. A searching restlessness is evident in the constant shifts in medium, style and subject. So is a relatively new notion for his time: drawing for the sake of drawing. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

LISA CORINNE DAVIS, Lehman College Art Gallery, Bedford Park Boulevard West, the Bronx, (718) 960-8731 (through Tuesday). Lisa Davis's collage-style paintings are made up of hundreds of variable elements: fingerprints, headshots cut from magazines, pages torn from novels and history books in various languages, and a wide range of colors approximating skin tones. In the big, unframed quilt- or chart-like pieces that result, written narratives are hand altered, faces missing from history are inserted, and distinctions of race and ethnicity are subtly confused. Ms. Davis demonstrates how pointed information and good-looking painting can coexist (Cotter).

* "GEROME AND GOUPIL: ART AND ENTERPRISE," Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, (212) 759-0606 (through tomorrow). This informative, well-produced exhibition studies the relationship between the 19th-century French academician Jean-Leon Gerome and his gallery, the House of Goupil, which by marketing reproductions of his works worldwide made him one of the most famous and successful artists of his day. Among about 20 paintings and 40 reproductions is the strikingly cinematic painting of a victorious Roman gladiator, the image that inspired Ridley Scott to make his Oscar-winning movie. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Johnson).

CADENCE GIERSBACH, "Tropicalia," Roebling Hall, 390 Wythe Street, at South Fourth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5352 (through Monday). Imagine white vinyl cushions for lawn furniture, covered with faux-Impressionist landsape paintings, and you have a sense of Ms. Giersbach's new work. The scenes are taken from photographs of a Disneyesque theme park near Madras, India, though for many Westerners a visit to the city is a fantastic, head-spinning experience in itself. To complete this witty exercise in cross-cultural exoticisms, the gallery walls are painted with palm trees in feverish tropical green (Cotter).

SALLY GUTIERREZ, Parker's Box, 193 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-2882 (through Sunday). The work of this young conceptual artist from Spain gets at some of the distracted strangeness of urban life by combining art and documentary. In still-life photographs of city windows, objects are scratched out, leaving static-like shadows behind. In video interviews, two women -- one from Mexico, the other from South Asia -- talk with emotion about being immigrants in the United States, but only their hands, not their faces are visible (Cotter).

* DONALD JUDD, Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105 (through tomorrow). The leading Minimalist sculptor's roots in painting, his penchant for visual drama and his reverence for the landscape are stunningly evoked in a plywood installation piece that hasn't been shown since 1976 and may look as good here as it ever will (Smith).

"JEAN POYET: ARTIST TO THE COURT OF RENAISSANCE FRANCE," Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Sunday). His reputation as one of the great manuscript illuminators of the Renaissance has declined over the centuries, with much of his work ascribed to others, but the French artist Jean Poyet (ca. 1445-1503) is re-established in this beautiful show as the true author of some well-known Books of Hours and other religious treasures. His use of perspective, color, light and shadow and his convincing representations of the human figure took his work well beyond the limitations of his Late Gothic predecessors, as seen in such powerful manuscripts as the "Missal of Guillaume Lallemant" and "The Hours of Henry VIII." The judicious use of lightbox transparencies, blown-up color photographs and a CD-ROM room where viewers can turn the pages of virtual manuscripts all add to the show's accessibility. It is one of the season's most impressive presentations. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and 65+ (Glueck).

GRAPHIC: Photos: Dematerialized art: "Inert Gas Series: Xenon" (1969), by Robert Barry, from an exhibition of his early works at Gasser & Grunert in Chelsea. (Gasser & Grunert); A Gerome drawing in his show at the Dahesh, through tomorrow. (Musee Goupil, Boudeaux)

HEADLINE: CAR-FREE; 
Mystic, Harpooned for Posterity

BYLINE:  By DIANE COLE; Diane Cole is the author of a memoir, "After Great Pain: A New Life Emerges."

 BODY:
Give me a watery place, where the horizon fills not just with present-day ships but with the ghosts of seafaring vessels from the past as well. 
 That place is Mystic, Conn. 
 Just gaze in any direction from the old-fashioned bascule drawbridge that overlooks the Mystic River in the center of town, and you'll see the lure -- and the lore -- of whaling and sailing all around you, perhaps most notably in the masts and sails of the historic ships preserved, and on display, at the Mystic Seaport museum, just walking distance away. 
Venture a bit farther north and you'll arrive at the newly expanded Mystic Aquarium and the Institute for Exploration. Or just return to where you started, pause a few moments more by the bridge, and imagine the long, lonely view commanded by the women the sailors left behind as they gazed from the trim white widow's walks perched atop the stately, columned captain's homes that line the streets along the river's banks. 
Alternately, in search of more recent history, stroll a few blocks west across the bridge on Main Street, and roam around the real-life location for the 1988 Julia Roberts movie, "Mystic Pizza." Don't be shy about trying the pizza, either; my son, Edward, and I both give it two thumbs up. 
Perhaps fittingly, for a town whose glory days date to the 19th century, we have relied on old-fashioned rail technology to transport us here. Amtrak drops us in downtown Mystic, where the small train depot is a brief walk (or, if you're laden with luggage, an inexpensive cab ride) to the Whaler's Inn, centrally located on Main Street. (Another picturesque downtown choice is the Steamboat Inn, a small bed and breakfast on the river wharf.) 
Staying in town, at the cozy white clapboard Whaler's Inn (whose main building was erected in 1865), rather than the larger, modern Mystic Hilton, near other attractions but farther removed from the downtown commercial hub and historic center, allows the pleasures of a weekend's worth of small-town living.
Since we're hoofing it, staying where the local action is (including several stellar ice cream parlors) also gives us more varied options for an evening. Best warm weather night-life bet: Take a twilight stroll by the water, and watch the Mystic River drawbridge open, once an hour, to let sailboats pass beneath. Or amble through the town, glimpsing the many surviving 19th-century white trim wooden Greek Revival cottages that whaleboat captains, ship's carpenters and shipyard owners once called home.
Guides are available, but you don't really need one; the closer you get to the river, the harder it is to find a block without at least several structures bearing proud placards announcing their original owners and dates of construction. Combine either ramble with dinner at any one of several reasonably priced local establishments, top it all off with a sundae, and you've got low-key living at its best.
During the day, a shuttle bus will run on Memorial Day weekend and then from July through Labor Day from one popular area attraction to another, including Mystic Seaport and the Mystic Aquarium. So you have the further option of resting your feet in preparation for another ramble later on.
Now comes the confession. Yes, we did spring for a taxi or two (or three). And in doing so on the way to the Nautilus and Submarine Force Museum in nearby Groton, we ended up befriending the driver, who turned out to be the deputy mayor of New London, just the other side of the Mystic River. ("This is how I meet the voters," she said.) 
But even with these motor-driven detours, we found that staying in town and using mostly shoe leather to get around helped dramatize the maritime panorama of this once-thriving seaport, which now chiefly prospers as a tourist town.

A Living From the Water
As early as the 17th century, Mystic's inland river shoreline began attracting boat-builders and fishermen. During the Revolution, the town's mariners fitted out as privateers to run the British Navy blockades, capturing and scavenging enemy cannon, munitions and supplies.
Certainly, for most of the 19th century, the seafaring savvy of Mystic's sailors helped account for their lively trade in fishing, whaling, sealing, shipbuilding, steam transport and shipping. In the years from the California Gold Rush to the outbreak of the Civil War, trim clipper ships built in the town's boat yards made speedy record runs around Cape Horn to San Francisco and back. And when steam power gained ascendancy over sail and wind, the town's boatyards adapted, turning to wooden steamships (and gunboats), 56 of which were built for the Union Navy. 
In the post-Civil War era, the local timber supply began running short. More changes spelled other economic troubles for the town. Steel-hulled vessels, too large and bulky for the relatively shallow Mystic River to accommodate, were replacing the wooden ships for which the town was known. Petroleum and plastics were proving to be more economical substitutes for whale oil and whalebone, forcing a complete shutdown of the whaling industry in the early 20th century. With business and trade declining rapidly, Mystic found itself harboring fewer seaworthy ships than ghosts of glories past. 
It's remarkable how vital those visions of the past remain at the living history museum at Mystic Seaport, which recreates -- in its architecture, exhibitions, original clipper ships and restored historic vessels -- the misty and mystical atmosphere of a 19th-century coastal New England village.
Throughout the outdoor museum's 17 acres, every building (and each is original, dating from the 17th to the late 19th century, many from Mystic but others transported from as far away as Maine) is linked to the necessities of lives bound up with the sea.

Inside and Outside
In our ramble by the houses ringing the village green, we stepped inside buildings fitted out, among other things, as a 19th-century cooperage (to build the barrels in which to store whale oil, along with other shipped goods), shipsmith (or blacksmith, at the ready to sharpen your harpoon), bank (with shipping office upstairs), general store (get that extra hardtack for the voyage), boat shop (for repairing old and building new vessels) and newspaper office (all the latest shipping news).
Depending on the day's schedule, you can catch would-be citizens in period costumes demonstrating how to carpenter a plank, repair a torn sail or cook the grub in a ship's galley.
As for a glimpse of how the town's upper crust lived, we dawdled before the handsome 1842 mansion, replete with gingerbread scrollwork, ornamental posts, tall bay windows and Bohemian etched glass, that belonged to Thomas Greenman, one of three brothers who owned the shipyard originally found on the seaport's grounds. 
Catering to our daydreams of life at sea was the elegant mahogany and red velvet captain's cabin rescued from the abandoned 1883 ship called the Benjamin F. Packard. It is now housed in a small brick building originally designed as the power plant for the Greenman family textile mill, which was also in Mystic. 
Exploring this replicated universe, we poked our heads inside a small planetarium that teaches would-be sailors how to navigate by the stars, then paused for a "mug up" at the Spouter Tavern, which offers coffee and snacks year-round and a warm fire and hot cider in the cold months. And we gained an even broader maritime perspective through a more traditional exhibition, "Voyages: Stories of America and the Sea," which chronicles every aspect of the country's history through the prism of its waterways. 
Engaging as all this is, the highlight is surely the vessels themselves. You can begin with the 1841 wooden square-rigged whaling bark, the Charles W. Morgan, the last surviving ship of its kind. As you walk along either side of the main deck, notice the six-man whaleboats that hang from davits, seemingly at the ready to be lowered and launched as a crew of harpooners eye the horizon in search of whales. Behold the heavy metal blubber hooks with which the dead whales were hoisted aboard.
On deck, too, is where sailors boiled down the whale blubber to extract its precious oil and, in assembly-line style, stored the oil in barrels below deck, precious cargo to be brought home and sold for profit. Just the way Melville described it in "Moby-Dick."

A Slave's Journey
Next, step aboard the newest, and in some ways most striking, addition to the Seaport's fleet, the recently reconstructed slave ship Amistad, which was built in the Seaport's shipyard and which took its maiden voyage as part of Operation Sail 2000. More precisely, I should say, step below deck, to the dark, dank quarters reserved for the "cargo" of kidnapped Africans to be sold as slaves upon their arrival in the New World. And this recreated Amistad, a guide told us, is somewhat larger than the original.
After coming up -- literally -- for air, we moved on to the full-rigged Danish 1882 merchant marine training ship renamed in 1934 for another literary seaman, Joseph Conrad. Don't miss the handsome figurehead of Conrad that decorates the front of this hybrid sailing and steamship.
Relatively young by comparison is a sleek-sailed 1921 fishing schooner, the L. A. Dunton, whose original home base was Boston and whose crew trawled the Grand and Georges Banks for haddock and cod. While all the boats are permanently docked, in warm weather you can take a brief cruise on the Mystic River aboard the Sabino, a coal-fired, wood-hulled passenger steamboat from 1908.
So much for man (and woman) and the sea. What about the creatures that lie beneath the deceptively calm currents of the Mystic River and beyond? That is the focus of the town's other well-known attraction, the newly renovated and expanded Mystic Aquarium and the Institute for Exploration.
Outdoors in huge underground pools set against a stunning landscape that mixes greenery with volcanic rock, beluga whales and harbor seals can be seen floating, frolicking and sometimes spitting huge bursts of water at visitors. A winding pathway leads to a more cavelike sea environment inhabited by sleek, white-whiskered Steller sea lions and then a rocky indoor-outdoor pool that is home to waddling black-footed penguins. In summer it makes an ideal spot to linger and await the cooling splash of an energetic flipper.
Indoors, among hundreds of other species, we found bony plated sea horses; leopard-spotted sharks; a grasping Giant Pacific octopus, whose reddish tentacles can span 12 feet; gorgeous technicolor coral reefs; a variety of neon purple fish that would look great in my living room; and, everyone's playful favorites, bottlenose dolphins. 
Finally we entered the newest addition to the aquarium: the atmospheric "Challenge of the Deep" put together by Dr. Robert D. Ballard, the oceanographer and underwater explorer best known for pinpointing the remains of the Titanic. Call me old-fashioned, but I wanted more narrative and fewer high-tech special effects.

Village Treats
From the aquarium it's a quick walk across the parking lot to the Colonial-style shopping mall next door, Olde Mistick Village. If you're hungry and still have an appetite for fish, try the stylish seafood restaurant Go Fish. (They have a nonfishy children's menu, too.) If you have time to shop, you might try our favorite among the 60-some stores, Scrimshanders, which specializes in scrimshaw: the ivory and whalebone carvings and engravings on which 18th- and 19th-century sailors whittled away the hours at sea. 
Still, for roaming and browsing, our favorite haunts were in town: before the weekend was over, the friendly waitresses at Mystic Pizza knew us as regulars. For a more formal dinner, try the Captain Daniel Packer Inne, in a restored 1756 building with original fireplaces and beams, which nonetheless retains a relaxed atmosphere, especially in its lively downstairs pub.
The shops on Main Street provide an eclectic mix. Among our top choices were Mystic Army and Navy (a very cool selection of contemporary camouflage, my son assured me); Radio Waves, a nostalgia store specializing in retro "I Love Lucy" souvenirs; the Company of Craftsmen, displaying ceramics and jewelry by local artists; and a funky stationery store, Everything but the Stamp.
On our last afternoon, having reached our shopping limit, we cabbed it to nearby Groton to tour the Submarine Force Library and Museum, site of the Nautilus. For submarine movie fans like us, this self-guided tour from fore to aft through the nation's first nuclear-powered submarine (launched in 1954) was a must. How advanced the now-obsolete torpedo, sonar and radio rooms seemed in comparison with the navigational equipment available to Mystic's 19th-century whalers! 
Well, there's nothing like a stroll through history to lend some perspective. Which is why we paused for one last view from the Mystic River Bridge before returning home to New York City on the Hudson River, where the bridges are definitely grander but none more scenic than the one from which we briefly glimpsed a slice of 19th-century small-town life.

HEADLINE: Hyundai Attributes Income Rise To Demand for Its Big Vehicles 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 3 

 BODY:
The Hyundai Motor Company said today that first-quarter income surged to $213 million, a 28 percent increase from the comparable quarter last year.
 The company attributed the rise to the weaker Korean won and to increased demand in the United States for its larger cars and its new sport-utility vehicle. 
The success of the large vehicles is a result of a reversal in strategy by Hyundai, which entered the American market in February 1986 with a small economy model called the Excel and the slogan "cars that make sense."
The falling won has enabled Hyundai to offer foreign customers large models with a significant price advantage over those of competitors. Since last year, Hyundai has been exporting its XG300 luxury sedan and Santa Fe sport utility vehicle to the United States along with the compact and midsize models that have been finding growing acceptance in America.
The company's exports to North America and Europe more than compensated for disappointing domestic sales, as South Korea experienced a resurgence of the kind of economic difficulties that precipitated the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998.
Hyundai said it sold 211,000 vehicles overseas in the first quarter, up 10.7 percent from the first quarter of 2000, while the number of vehicles sold in Korea declined 6.7 percent, to 162,000.
Over all, revenue at the company rose 18 percent.
Hyundai Motor also predicted a strong first-quarter report for Kia Motor, which it acquired at auction in late 1998. Kia, whose failure to pay its bills in mid-1997 was one of the first overt signs of the economic crisis that hit the entire country several months later, was expected to announce a first-quarter net profit of about $90 million.

Here Comes the Sun

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana 

 BODY:
The good news from Ghana, the West African state from which so many black Americans trace their roots, is that after decades of political mismanagement it is finally following the first rule of holes. The first rule of holes states: "When you're in a hole, stop digging."
 Having had its first-ever peaceful, democratic transition from one elected government to another last December, Ghana's new president, J. A. Kufuor, has a clear mandate to stop digging. Mr. Kufuor was elected by a solid majority by calling for improved governance, an end to official corruption and a renewed effort to expand trade and attract foreign investment. That's the good news. The bad news is: The hole Ghana has dug itself into is really, really deep. Half of Ghana's government budget goes to pay just the interest on its domestic and foreign debts, accumulated over years of idiotic African Socialism, plunder by leaders and weak governance, compounded by poor oversight by the I.M.F. and World Bank. 
 "The problem for us," President Kufuor said in an interview at his home, "is that you feel like you're in a hole, and you want to get out, and you hear all these noises and all this activity coming from the top of the hole. It leaves you feeling that everyone up there is busy and active and you feel very much alone. I want to feel that there is someone out there with some humanism to stretch back to me and help me out."
What is encouraging about Ghana is that the impulse for reform here was driven by the people below, not just the pols above. What worries Ghanaians, though, is that after so many years in the third world they may not be able to compete in the Fast World. 
I gave a talk at the University of Ghana, and afterward one student asked me: "Will the world have empathy for us?" -- as Ghana tries to go down this new path. "No," I said, "the world will have no empathy for you, but that's not what you want anyway! You want to appeal to greed. You want to create a sense of opportunity here that will attract wealthy Ghanaians to bring their money back home and create jobs. You want investment, not pity." The dependency culture here is so deep, though, this logic is very new.
Then another student asked: If it's true that in the age of globalization the big don't eat the small but the fast will eat the slow, what is Ghana to do? "We're naturally slow here," he said. "We eat slow. We talk slow. We sing slow. We like things slow. How will we compete in this world?" 
Direction is more important than speed, I argued. Ghana has been on the wrong road for so long its per-capita income is now $1 a day. It needs to get on the right road and go at any pace it can.
Ghana is rich in human and natural resources. What it has lacked are good fundamentals: institutions, decent schools and legal frameworks to get the most out of those resources. The secret for success in globalization is all about building good fundamentals -- not modems or bandwidth. "The lack of good governance is the bane of Africa," said Papa Owusu-Ankomah, deputy majority leader of the Ghanaian Parliament. "Without strong institutions we can't check abuses of power, and that has been the source of all our problems."
But generating institutions is not easy. Historically there are two ways: One is the way America got them -- through evolution: 200 years of slowly evolving the habits and laws to govern a modern society. The other way is how India or postwar Germany and Japan got them -- through imperialism: someone comes from abroad and imposes democratic structures until they take root. The problem for Ghana, and the rest of Africa, is that it is too early for evolution -- that takes decades -- and it is too late for imperialism. 
It will have to find the energy from within. Mr. Kufuor's election signals that Ghanaians want to try. Mr. Kufuor says he intends to try. The Bush team should go out of its way to help Ghana -- now -- with conditional aid. That is, aid, and debt relief, tied to the building of real institutions. 
The dawns are always spectacular on the vast African continent, but false dawns abound here as well. Just look at Nigeria and South Africa, whose democratically elected leaders are slowly sinking away. Ghana now offers the best chance to establish an African model for free-market democracy. Here comes the sun. Let's hope it's really rising, and if it is, let's do our part to keep it up there.

HEADLINE: Wages at Harvard 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 According to Bob Herbert (column, April 30), student protesters have the upper hand in the debate over the "living wage" for Harvard's lowest-paid workers. But a high minimum wage hurts some of those it is intended to help. 
If Harvard has to pay higher wages, it will hire fewer workers and seek those with more skills. 
 Harvard is a charitable institution, but its mission is education, not income redistribution. Protesters would divert benefactors' funds to serve their own social goals. Also, many people are far poorer than these workers. Programs for developing countries -- a longtime Harvard priority -- would be a better use of resources.
Moreover, the school should not condone the takeover of the provost's office. A community like Harvard can function only when each group respects the right of others to disagree.

HEADLINE: Letting the River Run 

BYLINE:  By Christopher Hallowell; Christopher Hallowell is the author of the forthcoming "Holding Back the Sea: The Struggle for America's Natural Legacy on the Gulf Coast."

 BODY:
The Bush administration has scolded the city of Davenport, Iowa, for its failure to build a permanent flood wall to protect itself from the swollen Mississippi River. But as the administration, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, appears to advocate lining the river with levees and flood walls, it should look downstream to Louisiana, which has come to its own solution, for better or worse, about how to handle its end of the Mississippi.
 After a disastrous flood in 1927 killed hundreds of people, most in New Orleans, Louisiana built several gated spillways north of the city that allow the river to overflow its banks and dissipate over natural flood plains or swamps. 
 These spillways require that large swaths of land remain open and undeveloped (all are popular fishing, hunting and recreational havens during low-water periods), but they have saved the city and the petrochemical complexes between New Orleans and Baton Rouge from severe flooding any number of times. And where there are no spillways, the river is lined with levees and flood walls that protect the sprawl of housing subdivisions, malls and industrial buildings that continue to accumulate in ever thicker density.
The combination of spillways, levees and flood walls has worked. But there is still a problem south of New Orleans, where there are no spillways. Here, the river is permanently enclosed behind levees or flood walls almost all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of some 80 miles. 
Before these levees were built, floods would send tons of sediment and nutrients over the wetlands year after year, building and supporting a bonanza of natural wealth. These three million acres -- a quarter of the country's coastal wetlands -- are a nursery for much of the marine life in the Gulf of Mexico. They also protect low-lying coastal communities -- and New Orleans, too -- from hurricanes by acting as buffers against storm surges and by absorbing high water.
The leveed river can no longer provide sediment and nutrients. As a result, the wetlands that spread from its banks are dying; some 16,000 acres a year vanish as the coast sinks and erosion chews away at the weakened roots of plants. Livelihoods are threatened because the wetlands no longer nurture fish, shrimp and oysters. As the fishing economy wobbles, a culture of bayou life, with large families living off the land, begins to die. 
Louisiana is trying to stop the land from disappearing, recognizing that the only way to save the coast is to allow the Mississippi River into the wetlands. It uses what the Army Corps of Engineers calls "freshwater diversions." Downstream from New Orleans, huge pipes arching over the levees pump water into the devastated marsh. In Caernarvon, 15 miles south of New Orleans, a levee has been cut to provide room for an elaborate gate that permits the Mississippi's water to pass in limited quantities into the dying marsh. Hundreds of acres of wetlands have been restored through these means -- which are really no more than meager imitations of nature's inclinations. These freshwater diversions are also expensive and controversial, because they destroy oyster beds, upsetting the powerful seafood industry.
Before it pushes for continuous levees along the Mississippi, the Bush administration should consider the lessons of Louisiana. Flood plains serve a crucial purpose, and when a river as prodigious as the Mississippi is denied a place to send its excesses, the land itself, and the people who depend on it, suffer in the long run.

HEADLINE: Internet Used-Car Seller Closes Down 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
IMotors.com, the online seller of used cars that in January hired the former Maytag chief executive Lloyd D. Ward to head its operations, has gone out of business.
 The company, based in San Francisco, made the announcement last Wednesday on its Web site, saying it was closing because of "lack of sufficient capital." The company had raised about $137 million in financing over the last two years. It operated three reconditioning plants for used cars and had about 700 employees. 
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Ward, the chief executive, said that iMotors had been making tremendous progress and that the company had been on track for revenue of about $100 million this year. But he said investors were looking for more immediate profits and that one major investor decided to pull out. The others followed, he said.
"It wasn't because of the business," he said of the investors' decisions to pull out. "We were driving business growth. We were getting a lot of traction. But we weren't yet profitable."
Among the major investors in the privately held company was Vulcan Ventures, the venture capital fund of Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft. A spokesman for Vulcan Ventures did not return telephone calls.
IMotors was supposed to succeed by buying used cars, refurbishing them and then reselling them online. The company wanted to create a nationwide system with a recognized brand name. To do that, it had also hired Kiran Patel, the former chief financial officer at Cummins Engine. 
Mr. Ward, who gained a reputation as a supermarketer at blue-chip companies and became only the second black to head a Fortune 500 company, resigned from Maytag last November after a stormy 15-month tenure. He then shunned opportunities at several big corporations to join iMotors and try to bridge the old- economy/new-economy gap, he said.
Shortly after he joined iMotors he hoped it might turn into a Fortune 500 company. Now, the climate was too hard, he said. "What is driving many investors right now is fear," he said. "There wasn't a lot of discipline when things were going up and there's not a lot of discipline now."
Asked about his own future, Mr. Ward, 52, said he might return to a major corporation. "I'm clearly an N.B.A. player and this was a pickup game," he said. "I'm going to look around, but I don't know what I'm going to do next."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Weak Economic Data Take a Toll on Nasdaq and Dow

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
The question nagging at stock and bond investors recently has been whether the economic slowdown is continuing or whether the worst is over and a recession has been avoided.
 In April, investors answered positively, after a very negative March, and pushed stocks higher, with the Nasdaq composite index climbing 15 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average rising 8.7 percent. 
 Prices in the bond market slipped and yields moved higher as some investors concluded that the Federal Reserve might not cut short-term interest rates as much as expected. Then last week, the government said that the economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, twice the pace expected by analysts and twice the rate in the fourth quarter of last year. 
But economic data released yesterday, combined with reports from earlier in the week, suggested that the slowdown might be continuing. And today, the government is set to release employment data for April, which many analysts think will show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent in March, with few jobs created.
Yesterday's news -- and the expectations for today's jobs report -- was enough to push stocks lower while bond prices rose. But it is not clear whether sentiment has truly changed. Stocks may have fallen just because they had risen so sharply that any negative news could trip them up. Bonds, on the other hand, had been selling off for several weeks and were ready for a rally.
The Dow fell 80.03 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,796.65. The Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, dropped 74.4 points, or 3.4 percent, to 2,146.20. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 18.85 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,248.58.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.20 percent from 5.28 percent Wednesday while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 20/32, to 98 16/32. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 30/32, to 96 9/32. Its yield fell to 5.63 percent from 5.70 percent on Wednesday.
Among the negative data released yesterday were weekly claims for unemployment benefits, which rose to 428,000 in the week ended April 28, their highest level since March 1996. The four-week moving average of claims is now at the highest level since the fall of 1992. 
William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said the claims data "definitely shows you that the labor market is deteriorating, and that makes you more worried about consumer spending." He is predicting that the unemployment rate in April rose to 4.5 percent while there was a decline of 100,000 payroll jobs.
While Goldman is not predicting a recession, it is expecting the economy to be softer for longer than some other forecasters. And Mr. Dudley said it would not take much to change his forecast to a recession.
Although growth in the first part of the year has been stronger than analysts thought, some still think that a recession is possible because of the effect of layoffs. If they continue to increase, these analysts argue, consumer confidence will decline as more workers lose their jobs and other realize that they have a friend or a relative who has been laid off. That would lead to a reduction in consumer spending large enough to start a recession.
Fed policy makers made a surprise cut of half a percentage point in short-term interest rates on March 18 and are expected to cut again when they meet on May 15. Mr. Dudley said he thought that Fed policy makers were worried "that things could break," which means they might make another half-point cut, which would bring the short-term interest rate target to 4 percent. A weak jobs report today would improve odds for a half-point reduction. Until this week's new economic data, many investors had reduced their expectation for the Fed's next move to a quarter-point.
At the same time, Mr. Dudley said there were some positive signs, including how far along the adjustment of inventories has gone.
In another negative report yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index for the nonmanufacturing part of the economy fell to 47.1 in April from 50.3 percent in March. This decline indicates that the slowdown that has already pushed the country's manufacturing sector into a recession is spreading.
On Tuesday, the association reported that its factory index rose to 43.2 in April from 43.1 in March, but that was less than analysts had expected.
Adding to the negative news in the economic data are the almost daily reports of layoffs. Yesterday, Newell Rubbermaid, the maker of Calphalon cookware and Levolor blinds, said it would cut 3,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its work force, over the next three years. Vitesse Semiconductor said it would cut 12 percent of its work force and reduce executive salaries. Newell Rubbermaid fell $1.49, to $25.85, while Vitesse dropped $3.38, to $34.39. The Nasdaq was led down by Intel, which fell $1.52, to $30.40, and Cisco Systems, which dropped $1.33, to $18.66. The Dow was led lower by I.B.M., which declined $1.70, to $113.70, and Microsoft, which fell $1.23, to $68.53.

HEADLINE: Elite French College Tackles Affirmative Action 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: ST.-OUEN, France 

 BODY:
In this town, where blocks of public housing and laundry lines dominate the landscape, few high school students even dream of going to France's most prestigious colleges. In fact, no senior has ever passed the entrance exam for the Institut d'Etudes Politiques just a few miles away in the Seventh Arrondissement of Paris. 
 But all that may be changing. The institute, known as Sciences Po, has for decades shaped France's ruling elite, from President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to the heads of most major companies. Now Sciences Po has announced an affirmative action program, the first such effort in France. 
 "The most interesting thing is that it lifts the psychological barrier," said Gerard Stassinet, principal of the Lycee Auguste Blanqui, a high school in St.-Ouen, whose students stand to benefit. "Immediately after the program was announced there was a new feeling in this school. Already the younger ones were beginning to think about the future, which just wasn't happening before." 
While Mr. Stassinet is enthusiastic, not everyone is applauding Sciences Po's decision to forgo admission strictly by test results, a concept long embraced in France as the best way to level the playing field between rich and poor. 
The decision to create just 20 slots for students from disadvantaged areas -- where many of the residents are immigrants from North Africa -- has caused an uproar in newspapers across the country. 
Some have applauded the program as a small step toward addressing a growing disadvantaged population in France, and the often unspoken racial issue it entails. But others see it as an attack on a tradition that has produced scholars of high quality as well as a slide into an American-style system. In the daily newspaper Liberation, one former professor at Sciences Po contended that from now on when a nonwhite graduate presents a diploma, it will automatically be suspect. "What hypocrisy," wrote Zair Kedadouche, adding that the program was reminiscent of the colonial days in Algeria when most Muslims were kept in their place, but for a few "good ones" who were allowed to mingle with the French. 
Another commentator, in Le Figaro, called the program an act of "political correctness" that embraced the American approach just when the United States was coming to realize the "perverse effects" of such methods. On the bulletin boards at Sciences Po, hand-written posters are chronicling a fierce battle by a conservative student group that is challenging the new admissions policy in court.
"This is really a publicity stunt," said Arnaud Legros, one of the leaders of the group. "The director of the school is giving himself a little pleasure -- soothing his social conscience. He has never even been to these neighborhoods. A test is the best because everyone is equal before a test." 
Increasingly, however, the French are beginning to question that tenet. 
Mr. Stassinet, the principal in St.-Ouen, has no doubts that the tests are now a barrier for the poor. "You create an exam and right away the rich get whatever it takes to prepare for the exam," he said. "They get the best schools and they can afford special help or tutoring to get there. But there are intellectual abilities here and other ways of measuring them. These are not children who have had violin lessons from the age of 4, but there are good minds here." 
Like many others, he points to the statistics on the student body at Sciences Po. In 1987, 77 percent of the students came from more privileged groups, with parents who were teachers, professionals, managers or owners of their own companies. By 1997, the figure had increased to nearly 82 percent. Fewer than 2 percent of the students came from working-class backgrounds. 
The director of Sciences Po, Richard Descoings, said it was obvious to him that coming up with a way of diversifying the student body had to be a priority. "Here at Sciences Po is where we form our elite for both business and government," he said. "When you have that responsibility, it is impossible not to ask yourself who is coming here. We thought about our social responsibility and we decided we had to do something."
But even Mr. Descoings says he has been amazed at the anger over his small effort, announced two months ago, which is being criticized both in principle and in substance.
Under Mr. Descoings's plan, up to 20 students from just seven high schools from poor areas around Paris will be accepted for the next school year (the three-year school has 2,500 students). The admission process for these 20 students will resemble that of American universities, with consideration given to test results, high school references, grades and an interview. 
Some critics find the selection of the seven high schools arbitrary and unfair and the selection process open to all sorts of prejudices. Mr. Descoings shrugs off that criticism, saying that Sciences Po could not deal with all the country's problems and wanted to get a plan in place fast. "We needed to stop making speeches and get to the action so this is what we were able to do," he said.
So far, Mr. Descoings has had the support of the Socialist government's minister of education, Jack Lang (another of the school's graduates), who has applauded the program for focusing attention on "the recruitment by caste and class" and the "need for a democratic country to diversify the social origin of its elite." 
Whether the school's initiative will survive the court challenge remains a question. Mr. Descoings said he was encouraged when the court recently turned down a request by the conservative student group for an immediate hearing. "It is impossible to predict what will happen," he said, "since there really has never been any other program like this."
Much of the program has been put in place hastily with a sense of experimentation. Facing the prospect of choosing students to recommend to Sciences Po, the high school principals decided to ask students who were interested to prepare a special report. The students had to collect articles from the press on a subject that interested them and then write two papers, one a synthesis of the articles, the other an analysis.
Mr. Stassinet said he was completely surprised by what he was able to see from this exercise. Students at his school whom he would never have recommended emerged as the most interesting thinkers, he said. Those who have applied from St.-Ouen include the children of domestic workers, immigrants and the unemployed, and the applicants and their families have been interviewed by dozens of newspapers and television stations in the last few weeks. 
In March, some of them toured Sciences Po, where many of the students wear expensive leather jackets and the latest styles as they stroll from class to class through the halls of several 18th-century mansions cobbled together to make a campus. 
According to one newspaper account, there were some awkward moments. One professor told the applicants that he wanted to extend his welcome "even though he did not think they should be there." 
"A diploma," the professor reportedly said, "should be earned."
But few students from the disadvantaged schools seemed deterred. "The more they don't want us here, the more I want to come," said one young man from St.-Ouen who dreams of returning to Senegal to help his country. "They need to realize that we are not all idiots."

HEADLINE: Net Income Drops 12% at Adidas-Solomon 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, May 3 

 BODY:
Adidas-Salomon A.G., a leading maker of sporting goods, said today that its first-quarter net income dropped 12 percent, hurt by declining demand for its shoes in the United States and by higher financial expenses. 
 The company said profit fell to 46 million euros ($41 million), or 1.02 euros a share, from 53 million euros, or 1.16 euros, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 2.7 percent, to 1.6 billion euros, held back by a 6 percent drop in North America, to 445 million euros. 
 Its chief executive, Herbert Hainer, has said that he aims to make the brand "cool" in the United States, where a fashion for urban streetwear has hurt Adidas. It also faces price-cutting by Nike Inc., which is clearing inventory after its third-quarter profit fell 33 percent. 
Shares in Adidas fell as much as 0.72 euro, or 1.1 percent, to 67.23 euros. They have gained 2.3 percent so far this year, compared with a 4.9 percent decline in the benchmark DAX index. 
Financial expenses rose to 33 million euros from 13 million euros in the quarter as net debt rose along with interest rates, while the dollar gained 7.5 percent against the euro. Much of Adidas's production is paid for in dollars in Asia, while the company's biggest sales market uses euros, analysts said. 
The company, whose products include Salomon skis and inline skates and TaylorMade golf equipment, said it would stick to its forecast of a 15 percent increase in full-year earnings. Sales are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent, with gains in all regions except North America.

HEADLINE: Mining Deep Underground Stirs Protest Above 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WEST FINLEY, Pa. 

 BODY:
People in these pristine hills speak of "the longwall" digging endlessly 500 feet and more beneath them, a prodigious coal mining machine that has been extracting the lucrative Pittsburgh seam for 30 years in a continuation of this state's long history of reliance on King Coal.
 The whirling blades of the longwall, which does not leave behind the support pillars of earlier, more labor-intensive mining methods, have produced years of mile-long caverns 7 feet high and 1,000 feet wide that remain invisible to the life above until the inevitable subsidence occurs. Then the topography drops 3 or 4 feet as the longwall's wake becomes clear, often as cracked houses, altered streams and disappearing water wells, effects long accepted as the cost of underpinning the state economy. 
 But lately, residents here in Greene and Washington Counties have been organizing through litigation and newsletters against the longwall in a feat as earth-defying in its way as the high-speed mechanism tirelessly crisscrossing below. 
"If people in the rest of the state knew about these houses and streams, they wouldn't tolerate it," said Ed Perry, assistant supervisor of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in State College, Pa., who complains that the longwall has been wreaking an environmental disaster as it chews its way toward West Virginia. 
The ground-level complaints, focused lately on some tilted and cracked houses, extend as well into the deep woods, where only a few critics like Mr. Perry have been marking the longwall's progress. But the state is beginning to pay attention, having ordered a private study to measure what has been happening to streams, springs and wetlands as the longwall burrows below.
"There's no debating that subsidence does occur," said Ted Kopas, spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, which licenses the mining. "But we want to be able to document with scientific information longwall's effects on water resources, on the streams, wetlands and buffer areas. There's considerable debate about that."
Environmentalists and other critics who are trying to rally the public say the damage has been devastating to water resources as well as hillside houses that can be severely tilted, cracked and wrenched as they subside. 
But coal company officials insist the damage from ground-level subsidence has been repairable and within legal bounds. The companies maintain that they have complied with state laws requiring them to compensate homeowners and protect the environment. Critics, however, say that state watchdogs give the industry free rein.
For weeks now, the immediate ground-level symptoms of longwall mining -- housing cracks and water supply losses -- have been the talk of Laurel Run hollow in Waynesburg, 10 miles to the east where the extractors have been burrowing round the clock beneath a pastoral setting. Homeowners, who are presented with a range of damage-control compensation and buyout options by the company, question why they must tolerate any change at all, particularly without public hearings. But the company emphasizes that mining rights, usually sold by earlier owners at the turn of the century, always stipulated the owner's obligation to acknowledge the company's undermining rights.
"There's nothing like spring water," lamented Dick Patterson, a 64-year-old cattle farmer at the top of the hollow who has been told he will lose all seven of his prime springs when the longwall soon goes through. He will have to buy water that he now gets free, he noted, whenever a municipal hookup is built. Meantime, water will be trucked in at the mining company's expense, small comfort to Mr. Patterson and his neighbors.
"I already had a nervous medical condition before this thing came underneath and now I'm overwhelmed," said Jerry Jewell, disturbed to see his house subsiding six inches more at the front than at the rear. "I took a company offer," he said of an undisclosed lump sum for repairs by which he chose to stay in the house and admittedly gamble, like other owners, that the cost of finally resetting his house right would not be extravagant.
"It's a-cracking again," warned Mr. Patterson, studying the excavation wounds around Mr. Jewell's house. "You'll never see the end of it."
To the contrary, the mining company, Consol Energy Inc., insists that 30 years' experience shows few scars will remain soon after the machines move on. 
"I understand the emotional aspect of the debate if I'm a homeowner," said Thomas F. Hoffman, Consol vice president, who insisted the effect was "sort of like having your bathroom and kitchen done at the same time." Mr. Hoffman maintained, however, that most damaged houses were either well repaired or bought at a fair price unless homeowners resist through lawsuits so that unsightly standoffs dot the countryside. Otherwise, "There are just no long-term effects visible."
A state study in 1999 concluded that 59 percent of undermined structures were damaged and 70 percent of the damage claims were resolved, with the fate of the others not known, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. 
"The longwall's been pretty disastrous," Mr. Perry said. "The sediment from longwall mining is a major pollutant of streams," said Mr. Perry, who is conducting a federal study of more than 100 local streams. 
Chief among them lately is Enlow Fork, a principal feeder creek here, where Mr. Perry, an aquatic biologist, has done wildlife research for years. As miles of longwall mining crisscrossed beneath, he said he had found serious disruption of the life of the creek bed, which dropped 3 feet as the surrounding land subsided. Thick sediment now covers cobble and gravel breeding grounds for various species, he said, while wide, stagnant pools have appeared, ballooning far beyond a healthy stream course of riffles, glides and runs. The creek's food chain is being stifled by sediment and reduced oxygen levels, Mr. Perry has concluded.
Consol Energy insists any damage is temporary and may even be a boon. "Change is not necessarily bad," Mr. Hoffman maintains.
"One can have changes that are in fact an enhancement," Mr. Hoffman said in an interview, contending the pool effect might prove a benefit during droughts. And while fracture lines from undermining can detour a stream underground, Mr. Hoffman maintained that roiled sediment reseals the cracks so that "the stream will in effect heal itself."
Environmentalists are apoplectic at such pronouncements as the longwall wends its way through the Pittsburgh seam, one of the richest in the nation, which yields 23 tons of coal per minute and is estimated to have 50 years worth of coal yet to be mined. 
"This just keeps going on and on," said Joe Turner, director of the Raymond Profitt Foundation, a private, nonprofit environmental group in Langhorne, Pa., that is suing the federal government for what it says is failure to enforce basic environment laws. "In West Virginia, at least you can see the strip mining damage to the mountain tops from the air, but here the damage is happening from underground. Where and when does it end?"
But coal extraction and the risk of subsidence are almost as old as Pennsylvania, Mr. Hoffman noted. Most residents have long accepted its economic benefits, he maintained, except for "a small group of people" now trying to mount a modern fight against an economic fact of life that, he said, was two centuries old.

HEADLINE: Dear New Employee: Welcome, and Goodbye 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Some M.B.A. candidates and college students who thought they had lucrative consulting, banking or high-technology jobs nailed down after graduation are getting unwelcome calls and letters from their would-be employers, telling them to start work later or, in some cases, not at all.
 Many students went through job interviews last fall, receiving -- and often accepting -- offers for jobs starting later this year. But in the intervening months, the slowing economy has led a number of companies to reduce or even undo hiring, leaving students out in the cold. 
 In an effort to cut costs without having to rescind job offers, which are usually nonbinding, consulting firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Mercer Management Consulting have informed future employees that they should seriously consider waiting, even until next year, to come to work. Technology companies like Cisco Systems and Intel have sometimes gone even further, paying new hires not to come to work at all. 
Credit Suisse First Boston is giving some of this spring's college hires the option of deferring their start date for one year. Those students will be paid $20,000 -- though they will have to return the money if they do not eventually go to work at the investment bank. 
"It's not necessarily just technology companies, but companies doing business with or catering to the technology industry," said Bill Coleman, vice president for compensation at Salary.com, which tracks compensation paid by various industries. 
The employers' moves, an abrupt reversal of the head-over-heels hiring of recent years, are leaving students in limbo. "I figured companies would just come here and grab all the students," said Sandra F. Capel, a senior at Columbia University. Like many of her classmates, Ms. Capel had a job lined up last fall, but in March her prospective employer sent her a certified letter rescinding the offer.
"I have been calling back companies with whom I was going to interview, or that I was interested in interviewing with in the fall," to see if they are still hiring, said Ms. Capel, who plans to stay in New York to look for work this summer. "I'm getting less and less optimistic as graduation nears, and I'll have to start paying bills.
"You do all the right things, go to the right school, just to -- at the last moment -- lose out on what you had been working for," she added. "It's just bad timing."
One M.B.A. student, who did not want his name or the name of his business school used because he feared it might jeopardize his job search, thought he had a consulting job waiting, until he got a call in March telling him the firm could no longer guarantee its offer. 
"They said, 'If things pick up, maybe we'll be able to honor' " the offer, the student said. "Right now I'm still looking."
Some students sound remarkably calm about their prospects. Jason Barker, a graduating M.B.A. student at Georgetown University, has not found a job, but seems unconcerned.
"I don't think it's a crisis situation," said Mr. Barker, 31, adding that while he has loan payments to make, they are deferred until the fall. "There are plenty of jobs out there." 
The steps being taken to defer and deter hires are evident at a number of high-profile companies. And career counselors at a range of colleges and business schools nationwide report that they are rushing to help students who have received bad news from expected employers.
With the economy slowing, not only is there less for current employees to do, but fewer older workers are quitting and more new ones are knocking at the door, employers say.
"A number of clients in a softening economy are going to delay certain projects," especially consulting projects and especially those that involve spending on costly technology, because such costs are often viewed as discretionary, said Bob Chrismer, director of global recruitment at A. T. Kearney, which is pushing the starting dates for some new employees back as far as January. 
Like other consulting firms, he said, "we are all faced with this knotty little problem of balancing our resource capacity with client work."
At PricewaterhouseCoopers, the later a prospective employee accepts an offer, the later that person will be allowed to begin work. 
Mercer Management Consulting told prospective employees who were slow to accept their offers that they would not be starting until January.
Employers find themselves in a situation the mirror image of last year, when students had so many options that it was often difficult for firms to draw them in. This year, 56 percent of M.B.A.'s who got offers from A. T. Kearney accepted them, compared with 42 percent last year. At Bain & Company, 70 percent of M.B.A.'s who got offers accepted them, up from 55 percent. At Boston Consulting, the acceptance rate rose by 15 percent even though the firm reduced the number of offers made this year, though the firm would not disclose its actual acceptance rates.
"We probably hit a record in acceptances," said Ken Keverian, a vice president at the Boston Consulting Group who is responsible for M.B.A. recruiting in North America. This year, Boston Consulting will let starting consultants elect to take an immersion language class, paid for by the firm, before they start work.
That should smooth the flow of new consultants into the company, Mr. Keverian said. Normally, "we get a large inflow of our talent within relatively few weeks" in September, he said, and that drives up costs all at once, though business may pick up more slowly. 
Intel is not rescinding offers outright, but is offering payments to prospective employees who decide not to go to work for the company.
Intel would not specify the amount of the payment, but said it would vary with the job and the salary offered. If new graduates come to Intel anyway, they may not end up in the position they were initially promised, a company spokesman said.
Cisco has rescinded offers to about 25 percent of the college students who received job offers, but has tried to soften the impact by offering a consolation package consisting of 12 weeks' salary and assistance finding a job elsewhere. A Cisco spokesman attributed the move to overall softness in the economy.
Some companies are pretty much sticking with their original hiring plans. McKinsey & Company, a strategy consulting firm, has not changed its hiring or summer programs, a spokesman said, and a spokeswoman for Accenture, formerly known as Andersen Consulting, said the company was making only marginal changes to its summer program. 
Similarly, Hewlett-Packard, which is in the midst of a restructuring involving the elimination of 3,000 jobs, reduced the number of people it is hiring but said it had not rescinded any offers.
Companies have also shortened the length of their summer internship programs, which are an important way to recruit future employees, business school career advisers say. Mercer, like the investment firm Charles Schwab, canceled its summer program outright this year.
Gregory J. Hutchings, associate dean for career resources at the Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis, said summer internships had been "reduced from the normal 10 or 12 weeks to just 7."
The ultimate effect of these developments, which career advisers say have led recent and soon-to-be graduates to accept whatever offers they receive very quickly, may be a rash of job-hopping a few years down the road, said Lawrence S. Abeln, director of the M.B.A. program at the Georgetown University School of Business.
"If students are only receiving one offer and accepting one offer, it may very well result in a higher turnover rate in the first two years" after graduation, he said. "With only one offer, you're inclined, in this economy, to take it, and it may not be the right position for you."

HEADLINE: Washington Angry Over Losing Rights Seat 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
American officials, lawmakers and independent human rights groups voiced dismay and indignation today that the United States had lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
 The critics of the decision offered several factors that contributed to the American defeat, including a campaign by rights-abusing nations to avoid scrutiny, resentment toward the Bush administration for unilateral stances on issues like global warming and missile defense, the growing independence of the European Union and a failure by United States diplomats to do the proper legwork before the vote. 
 The State Department issued a statement saying it was "greatly disappointed in the outcome of the vote." The Human Rights Commission remains an important forum but would be diminished by the absence of the United States, the statement said. "Our commitment and resolve to address human rights problems around the world is a matter of U.S. policy; it will not be affected by this vote." 
In Congress, leaders from both parties expressed outrage that nations whose records have long been criticized by the United States apparently banded together with European nations to quell Washington's voice.
A spokesman for the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, said today's action might force lawmakers to reconsider a carefully wrought agreement worked out between the Senate and the Clinton administration to pay outstanding American dues to the United Nations. The House is expected to take up the issue for the first time next week as part of the State Department authorization bill.
"This really hurts the credibility of the U.N. in the Congress," said Mr. Hastert's spokesman, John P. Feehery. 
Although the vote of the Economic and Social Council, which has authority over the human rights commission, was carried out by secret ballot, lawmakers speculated that nations like Cuba and China -- both annual targets of American criticism -- had conducted behind-the-scenes lobbying against Washington. Others pointed to the unraveling of an understanding with Europe that the United States would retain one of the three seats reserved for Western nations.
"This is a deliberate attempt to punish the United States for its insistence that the commission tell the truth about human rights abuses wherever they occur," said Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois and the chairman of the House International Relations Committee. "This commission includes some of the world's premier human rights violators." 
Representative Tom Lantos, a California Democrat who is the co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, said, "It is absurd that rogue states and chronic human rights abusers such as Libya, Sudan and Cuba remain on the commission and sit in judgment on the human rights practices of others while the United States now stands on the sidelines."
Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who, as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was a major architect of the agreement to end the United States' arrears, said it came as "no surprise that a few European countries maneuvered -- in a secret vote -- to eliminate the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission."
But the defeat did catch some administration officials by surprise. American diplomats had received more than 40 written assurances from nations that they would support a seat for the United States, a Republican Congressional official said.
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, said the administration's failure so far to place a diplomat in her old post, had left the United States vulnerable to diplomatic ambushes. "Somebody wasn't watching the store," Dr. Kirkpatrick said. Without the leadership of an ambassador, she said, there is an atmosphere in which "no one is responsible."
Some analysts viewed the vote as a response to the administration's positions on a number of issues -- from a treaty on land mines to the International Criminal Court -- that have drawn criticism, especially in Europe. The fact that three European nations -- France, Sweden and Austria -- secured the Western seats signaled a snub of Washington by the European Union, officials said. 
But others said the Economic and Social Council was heavily weighted toward developing nations that resent the United States' annual criticism against other nations or fear such scrutiny themselves.

HEADLINE: For First Time, U.S. Is Excluded From U.N. Human Rights Panel 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 3 

 BODY:
In a move that reflected a growing frustration with America's attitude toward international organizations and treaties, the United States was voted off the United Nations Human Rights Commission today for the first time since the panel's founding under American leadership in 1947.
 The ouster of the United States from the commission while nations like Sudan and Pakistan were chosen for membership was certain to generate further hostility to the United Nations among conservatives in Washington. 
 The unexpected move, which came in a secret vote, was apparently supported even by some friends of the United States. The vote also served notice that a bloc of developing nations opposed to American policies is becoming much stronger and more effective, and that Washington can no longer expect to be elected automatically to important panels.
Four nations competed today to fill three Western vacancies for three-year terms on the 53-member commission. The secret vote is conducted among the members of the Economic and Social Council, which oversees the Geneva-based commission and is made up of different members than the commission, although there can be some overlap, as there is now.France had 52 votes out of a possible 54 today, Austria got 41 and Sweden 32. The United States trailed with 29 and was eliminated. 
"It's an unequivocally devastating blow," said William H. Luers, president of the United Nations Association of the United States, the largest American support group for the organization. He said he feared the effect on a Congress with many critics of the organization. 
"It couldn't be worse," he said. "All the conservatives in the administration will see this as proof that we are in an organization full of enemies."
Also elected to the commission today were Bahrain, Korea, Pakistan, Croatia, Armenia, Chile, Mexico, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo and Uganda. One-third of the seats on the commission -- which meets annually to survey human rights practices, pass resolutions critical of abusers and assign monitors -- are open to election every year.
President Bush, addressing the American Jewish Committee tonight, made one of his strongest statements yet of the country's defense of human rights and religious freedoms, dwelling on Sudan and China, but did not address the decision on the Human Rights Committee.
Amnesty International USA called the removal of the United States from the commission "part of an effort by nations that routinely violate human rights to escape scrutiny." Amnesty accused members of commission of failing to do their job, succumbing instead to political and economic pressures.
"The U.S. was among the few nations willing to actively push for condemnation at the U.N.H.R.C. of the brutal human rights violations committed by nations like China," it said.
At Human Rights Watch, Joanna Weschler, the group's representative at the United Nations, said the commission was becoming "a rogues' gallery of human rights abusers." But she added: "It wasn't just enemies. It was friends as well who voted the U.S. out of the commission."
Friends of the United States in Europe and elsewhere have grown increasingly impatient, disappointed and annoyed with actions by Washington.
And in recent years, critics of the United Nations in Congress have played down American involvement in world organizations generally, rejected a host of treaties and agreements and built up a huge debt in overdue payments to the United Nations budget. More than $580 million of that debt is still tied up in the House of Representatives despite an agreement worked out in December to lower American dues. 
Then came the Bush administration's rejection of the Kyoto pact to reduce global warming and a decision to develop a missile shield that many other nations saw as a threat to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and to arms control in general.
Madeleine K. Albright, who was the United States ambassador to the United Nations before becoming secretary of state, said in an interview that it was "beyond belief" that at the end of the day Sudan was a member of the commission and the United States was not. Sudan has been accused of a broad array of human rights abuses during its civil war, including slavery.
"It's really a bad decision, and it is not only going to harm the ability of the United Nations to function on human rights issues because the United States was the one who was depended upon to introduce some of the resolutions, but I also believe that it will harm the United Nations," Dr. Albright said. "It's one of those things where decisions are made out of some kind of short-term pique or something like that, and it hurts very much at a time when the United Nations needs very much to have American support."
Today, Singapore's ambassador to the United Nations, Kishore Mahbubani, who is currently a member of the Security Council, said it was not American human rights policies that led to this vote, but the overall perception of American inattention to the organization.
He said the United States would have to be better at the active campaigning and political horse-trading that other nations employ to gain places on important committees and other bodies. The administration has not yet sent an ambassador to New York. Although John Negroponte, a career diplomat, has been named to the job of United Nations ambassador, his name has not yet been sent to the Senate for confirmation. 
Representative Nita M. Lowey, the New York Democrat who is co-chairman of the bipartisan United Nations working group and ranking Democrat on the House foreign operations subcommittee, said in a statement today that what happened was an embarrassment to the United States.
"President Bush has dragged his feet in getting key foreign policy officials confirmed," she said. "It is unacceptable that we still have no U.N. ambassador, and this vote is a painful blow to to our global leadership on human rights and democracy. The U.S. commitment to human rights has fallen victim to the administration's laissez-faire attitude toward diplomacy and foreign policy."
The acting United States ambassador to the United Nations, James B. Cunningham, said today that the outcome "won't, of course, affect our commitment to human rights issues, in and outside the United Nations."
Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador, attributed the overwhelming vote for France to its policy of approaching human rights issues with cooperation and dialogue rather than confrontation, a system he said worked well with China. France and other European nations did not back an American resolution at the just-concluded six-week annual session of the Human Rights Commission that would have held China up to public criticism. 
But, Mr. Levitte said, that did not mean that France was prepared to go soft on human rights issues in the commission, where the French often back American moves on other issues. "We need the U.S. engagement in the U.N., and we need the U.S. in the Human Rights Commission," he said. "My hope is that what happened will not trigger bitter feelings in the U.S. Congress and a new fever against the U.N."
In Washington, Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey and vice chairman of the House International Relations Committee, who took part in the recent annual commission meeting in Geneva as part of the Bush administration's delegation, said he was "disappointed but not surprised" by today's action.
"In Geneva, there was a great deal of animosity about the United States bringing the resolution on China," he said. "This seems to me to be a retaliation in part for standing side by side with Israel and standing out on China. This to me is payback for our principled positions."
Mr. Smith backs a Congressional call for American action in voting countries that abuse rights off the commission if the panel's credibility is to survive. 
Felice Gaer, director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights in New York and a member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture, said the American delegation at this year's Human Rights Commission meeting, did a lot of good in pressing for criticism of countries like China, Iran and Cuba. But when it came to issues like children's rights and the outlawing of "disappearances," the United States took an aggressively negative stand.
William vanden Heuvel, a former merican deputy representative at the United Nations who is now chairman of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y., said today's vote would have "serious repercussions" on the Human Rights Commission, which Mrs. Roosevelt helped to create. He said, moreover, that to have all three new Western seats filled by members of the European Union was questionable. But he also said the United States had to face a new reality.
"There are so many people in so many countries who are so angry at the United States for not living up to its word," he said, after a briefing for ambassadors here before the vote in the Economic and Social Council. "We're advised too by our representatives how various members of the United Nations are increasingly finding the United States an untrustworthy partner."

HEADLINE: Art Can Take Heat in the Kitchen; 
Gritty Tales Leave Food Insiders Feeling Well Served

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Only yesterday, it seems, New York's diners wanted nothing more from hot restaurants than glammy fantasy. Think: theatrical display kitchens. Gazillion-dollar decor by Richard Lewis, David Rockwell or Adam Tihany. Sycophantic maitres d'hotel. Worshiped chefs. And food, glorious food. 
 But now that isn't enough. "The public can't have its heroes last forever, and now people want to be knowing," said Michael Batterberry, co-founder of Food Arts Magazine. "They want to go behind the curtain to see the dark side of things." 
 And -- wouldn't you know -- the city's creative community has been only too willing to oblige. "Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly," by the chef Anthony Bourdain, is a gonzo-Proustian memoir of the nasty, brutish and short realities of big-league restaurant life that occupied the New York Times best-seller list for 14 weeks. 
Concurrently, "Fully Committed," Becky Mode's Off Broadway satire, has been running for two years serving up a four-star restaurant Walpurgisnacht by skewering megalomaniacal Manhattan chefs, coked-up maitres d'hotel, bullying V.I.P.'s and exploited reservationists. 
On television, happy-face "bam!" on the Food Network has been joined by the battle-zone pressure-cooker of "Iron Chef," a game-showish cook-off where even the star-chef Bobby Flay was depicted incurring a painful burn while cooking up a competitive meal. 
On HBO, viewers of "The Sopranos" have followed a simmering subplot involving Vesuvio, a star-crossed Italian restaurant beset by front-of-house passions and back-of-house yearnings, spiced with the prospect of mob money.
Filmmakers, too, are heeding the dramatic urgency of the new restaurant netherworld. Mr. Bourdain's book has been optioned by Hollywood; he confirms that he will be the technical adviser for the movie, rumored to be titled "Seared," that could again bring together David Fincher, the director of "Fight Club," and the actor Brad Pitt.
Moreover, well before its scheduled release date on Sept. 14, a new independent film directed by Bob Giraldi, "Dinner Rush," has created so much buzz among city foodies that another screening had to be added during the recent New Directors/New Films series of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the department of film of the Museum of Modern Art. 
When Mr. Batterberry saw "Dinner Rush" recently at the Modern, "there were short gasps of recognition from the food people in the audience," he said, explaining that it was the reaction to "the presentation of war stories that not everyone could understand, unless they've been in the fray." 
Such as: the disaster when a food critic has arrived and the restaurant's electrical power has suddenly failed. Or the adrenaline-fueled back-alley mating of a sous-chef and a hostess. In his review of "Dinner Rush," at New Directors/New Films, Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote that there were "more intrigues here than in the court of the Medicis."
Early opinions from the toque crowd are that it is the most realistic "Upstairs, Downstairs" kitchen film that they have ever seen. But an abundance of other films had headed in the direction of restaurant verite. 
In 1984, "The Pope of Greenwich Village," starring Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts, offered some tantalizing introductory scenes featuring waiter thievery and kitchen-help frictions in a Greenwich Village establishment. In "The Freshman" (1990), Matthew Broderick and Marlon Brando starred in a send-up of food fetishism, aimed at those obsessives who seek to dine on endangered species. Food cultists also cherish "Combination Platter," the director Tony Chan's 1993 film about life in a Chinese restaurant near Shea Stadium.
A favorite of Mario Batali, chef and an owner of Babbo, Lupa and Esca, is Ang Lee's 1994 "Eat Drink Man Woman" (about a widowed master chef in Taiwan), because "the food scenes were so legitimate, partly due to the excellent sound editing," Mr. Batali said. And last year, the director Eric Bross's "Restaurant" portrayed the interaction of a group of friends who work at a swank Hoboken bar and grill.
But none of these films portrayed the complex world of the multi-star Manhattan kitchen. "We haven't seen real life in the high-end, status-conscious New York restaurant," said Ms. Mode of "Fully Committed."
"There has been a pretty big disconnect," she said, "between working in these restaurants and the way they've been depicted in film and television." She added that "Fully Committed" was a reaction to a new phenomenon, "the development of the hierarchical high-end restaurant," she said, "where the rich backers, rich diners and star chefs have created a whole new celebrity culture." 
According to Mr. Bourdain, "Big Night," the timballo-cherishing 1996 film about two restaurateur brothers in an Italian dinner spot on the verge of insolvency, "came as close as any American film has come" to showing what he calls the underbelly. "But you didn't really see the choreography of the busy restaurant, nor the intimate subculture of cooking."
Perhaps this is why food insiders quickly said that "Dinner Rush" was a must-see. "It takes restaurant films to another level," said Mr. Batterberry. The film shows the kitchen "as wartime, a combat scene. It's like 'E.R.,' when the patients come through the door." 
"Dinner Rush" is a dark comedy about a real TriBeCa restaurant, Gigino Trattoria, at 323 Greenwich Street, where much of the movie was shot. Gigino is portrayed in the film as a traditional neighborhood Italian mom-and-pop that has been transformed by the owners' Tuscany-trained son, Udo, into a sought-after star-chef fusion restaurant. The upstairs world of the restaurant showplace is contrasted with life in the downstairs galley of the basement kitchen and its breathlessly profane, multilingual hubbub.
Over the course of a frantically busy night in "Dinner Rush," gangsters try to take over the restaurant even as annoying customers make impossible demands and a food critic played by Sandra Bernhard insists on being cosseted.
A refrain of the film is that the widowed owner, played by Danny Aiello, laments the fact that he can't get a decent plate of sausage and peppers in his own restaurant, now known for trendoid concoctions like an over-the-top signature lobster dish, spooned with caviar and piled upon angel-hair pasta.
"The backstage life is paramount in the film," said Mr. Giraldi, the film's 62-year-old director, on a recent afternoon at Gigino's. "The engine of the story is the life downstairs in the kitchen." As a director, Mr. Giraldi has filmed more than 2,500 television commercials and 30 music videos, including Michael Jackson's "Beat It." He shot "Dinner Rush" in a short-order 21 days. 
"Dinner Rush" is the work of an insider, since Mr. Giraldi, with his advertising-business partner Phil Suarez, has a stake not only in Gigino Trattoria and Gigino at Wagner Park, its sister restaurant at the southern tip of Manhattan, but also in Patria, Jean Georges and the Vongs in New York, Chicago, London and Hong Kong. 
"Food has overwhelmed us," Mr. Giraldi said. "In New York now, we do everything over meals. The restaurant is a board room, and these days you could do without an office but you can't do without a restaurant." 
Even as the economy sours, New Yorkers are still spurning their Viking stoves to eat out. "It's all about theater," Mr. Giraldi said, "but most customers don't have a real sense of the drama and tension and trauma involved in creating food at that speed. The knives and flames and heat. But now they want to know."
The film's kitchen choreography is hardly the product of Hollywood sound-stage legerdemain. Mr. Giraldi and his director of photography, Tim Ives, shot "Dinner Rush" in the cramped, 840-square-foot, fluorescent-lit Gigino's kitchen. "I wanted to show the rhythm of ordered chaos when the kitchen gets slammed," Mr. Giraldi said. 
According to Mr. Batterberry, "Dinner Rush" is "the first film, to my knowledge, that examines the underworld connections that one has always heard whispers about," he said. "Now the gangster movie has moved into the kitchen." 
In the end, will films like "Dinner Rush" diminish diners' appetite? "Ultimately I think it glamorizes the kitchen by deglamorizing it," Mr. Batterberry said, adding, "it makes the kitchen so anxious and dangerous and heroic." 
Dangerous? Heroic? Sorry, said Mr. Batali -- but in his experience, kitchens have more in common with busy offices than battlefields. Many diners, he said, "would be disappointed if they saw what really goes on." 
"It's not as sexy and dirty and clandestine as people like to think," he added. "The reality is that the kitchen can be a professional workplace. Our motto is that we are calm, cool professionals who like what we do and don't need to yell about it."

HEADLINE: Hollywood Contract Talks Are Inching Along 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 3 

 BODY:
Negotiators for Hollywood's writers and the major movie studios and television networks continued to inch toward a settlement today in negotiations that have stretched two days beyond the expiration of the writers' previous three-year contract.
 Late this afternoon, spokesmen for the two sides in the talks said that negotiations would continue into the evening but that a further session was already scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday and that no settlement would be announced before then. 
 Several people close to the proceedings, which are being held under a press blackout, said the talks had followed a frustrating pattern in recent days, with rapid bursts of progress causing periods of optimism that are then dashed when an unforeseen bump appears to slow things down, intensifying emotions. 
"In other words, it's like most labor negotiations toward the end," said one studio executive.
Still, the two sides appeared to be continuing to chip away at their differences, and hopes for a settlement on Friday remained quite high.
The two sides talked until 3 a.m. on Wednesday, then retired for the night, returning at midday for nearly 14 more hours of talks that recessed at 1:45 a.m. today. Talks resumed at 10 a.m.
Any prospect of a settlement has been welcomed with weary enthusiasm by an entertainment industry that has snarled itself in knots for more than six months over the prospect of potentially devastating dual strikes this summer by writers and actors. 
The contract between the Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,000 film and television writers, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, networks and other production companies, expired at midnight Tuesday.
The contract covering the 135,000 performers represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists will expire at midnight June 30. Those negotiations are tentatively set to begin next week.
In both instances, the central issue is money -- largely in terms of the fees paid for subsequent use of an artist's work after the initial theatrical run of a film or the first broadcast of a television program. 
All of the unions say they have made concessions over the fees, known as residuals, in previous negotiations as a way of helping the studios and networks come to terms with then-emerging technologies like cable television and videocassettes. Now, they say, those areas are flourishing, and they want to be rewarded for those earlier concessions. 
The producers, however, say that the entertainment business has become riskier in the intervening years, with shrinking profit margins, so that large increases in residuals, especially when they are extended to other unions, could prove to be financially cataclysmic. 
Writers were seeking increases in residuals for sales of films and programs to foreign markets, for sales of videocassettes and DVD's and for reruns on broadcast and cable channels, among other contract improvements. The actors have not yet detailed their contract demands, but they are expected to include significant improvements in residuals and in the basic minimums paid to actors.
In addition, film writers are concerned about a roster of so-called creative rights issues, like the "film by" credit given to many directors.
A strike by the writers would have little initial effect on Hollywood but could play havoc with the networks' fall television schedules if a strike lasted into August. 
A subsequent strike by actors would, however, effectively shut down the entertainment industry in Hollywood and have widespread economic repercussions throughout Southern California.

HEADLINE: THE CENSUS/Pennsylvania; 
As Diversity Sweeps Nation, A Placid Town Is Unchanged

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: SELINSGROVE, Pa. 

 BODY:
On a temperate Sunday evening this small town is in comfortable repose. People linger at restaurant tables along the neat sidewalk of Market Street. Rabbits hop across the well-kept lawns of well-kept houses. Even the junk piled on the curbside for cleanup week seems tidy somehow.
 Down the road a mile or two, the hoods of parked pickups glisten in a Dairy Queen's red-and-white glow. The young truck owners and their dates wait patiently as twirls of ice cream are caught in cups and cones. From the ice cream to the people, everything seems vanilla-white. 
 This is America. And this is not. 
According to data released in the 2000 census, the United States changed substantially in the last decade, with its population expanding by 32.7 million, to more than 281 million. There are millions more Hispanic and Asian people, transforming towns and cities from top to bottom. 
But this national sea change barely splashed certain communities. There is Vinton, Iowa, for example, and Fredonia, Kan., and Cuthbert, Ga. And there is the Pennsylvania borough that bills itself as "America's Hometown," Selinsgrove.
The 1990 census said Selinsgrove had 5,384 residents; today, 10 years later, it has 5,383. It remains about 93 percent white -- a percentage that soars to nearly 100 percent when one factors out its two minimally diverse pockets, the idyllic campus of small Susquehanna University, and Pine Meadow, a neat subsidized housing complex that some locals refer to as "Pine Ghetto."
"Everybody gets along; everybody knows each other," said Brian Ferry, peering from under a red cap that signifies his status as a Selinsgrove high school baseball player. A 16-year-old sophomore, he says he will probably attend a college in Pennsylvania, one not too far away. He says he is happy with his world: The community rallies around the high school teams, and the shopping district just outside the borough offers various culinary options.
"We've got an Applebee's, a Bob Evans, a Friendly's, a Rita's Italian Ice," he said. "And we're getting a Ruby Tuesday's."
George Kinney, 61, the curmudgeonly borough manager, is among those who prefer to keep Selinsgrove the way it is, and has been. He mutters about the "Ph.D.'s" on the borough council who are nudging him from his job, and wonders aloud why black and Hispanic people would want to move from New York and Philadelphia to his hometown.
"That's the only reason we have those minorities, is Pine Meadows," he said. "They're coming in from all over the country. I don't know why they come here."
Others, though, thirst for difference as long as it does not jeopardize the town's family-friendly feel. Karen Hackman, a lawyer, says she and her husband, Leo Mendonca, share monthly "international" dinners with friends and soak up the experiences of out-of-town guests who stay at their inn, the Potteiger House.
"This is not an isolated community with no connection to the outside world," she said.
Still, Ms. Hackman, who grew up in the area, acknowledges that her community is a little closed, in its mindset as well as in its geography. "The resistance to newcomers, I'm convinced, is cultural; it's not malicious," she said. "But it does put people off."
Among those who feel put off is her husband. Mr. Mendonca, who is Brazilian, has lived in Selinsgrove for a decade, but says he still does not feel entirely welcome. He tries to fight his sense of alienation by walking the streets of Selinsgrove early in the morning, wearing a headset and singing along to Brazilian music.
"If it wasn't for my wife, I would never stay here," he said. "Never."
Selinsgrove is the nerve center of Snyder County, a pretty patchwork of farms and small towns that comes to a stop at the western banks of the Susquehanna River. For decades the borough was the county's marketplace, the place where farmers came to buy and sell. Most were Lutheran and reformed Protestants with German surnames, although some were Amish and Mennonite; those two groups still occasionally roll into town in their horse-driven buggies.
Most of the substantial changes in daily life have resulted from commerce. First there was a canal, then a railroad and, finally, the Susquehanna Mall, just north of the borough. The mall forced Market Street here to redefine itself, with boutiques selling antiques, gifts, rare books and high-end clothing.
Throughout, the makeup of the people remained essentially the same: white and Protestant.
Local leaders give several reasons for why Selinsgrove looks and feels much the way it did a generation ago. 
The boundaries of the 1.9-square-mile borough are tightly defined; much of the county's growth is occurring in the affluent subdivisions cropping up in the Penn and Monroe Townships that surround it. Within its borders, there is little room for more development, and many houses are so desirable that local people buy them as soon as they come on the market. And, they say, there is the obvious: Selinsgrove is in rural, central Pennsylvania, where the Susquehanna separates it from even the slight diversity of the old coal-mining communities to the east.
Officials at Susquehanna University say that while they have succeeded in raising the number of minority students who enroll each year, from 58 of 1435 students in 1990 to 137 of 1682 in 2000, they struggle to keep those students through graduation.
"Our biggest stumbling block is the community itself," says Don Aungst, the university's treasurer and vice president for finance. "The most diversity they find is here on campus."
Also, ground was not broken for Selinsgrove's first Roman Catholic church, St. Pius X, until 1959.
"They used to say there was one Catholic family in town, but putting that church in probably brought more into town," recalled George Rishell, 84, a borough councilman. 
"That was a change, though."
It may have taken 40 years, but that Roman Catholic church has become an integral part of community life, its congregation growing so much that a new church is planned. The success of St. Pius X also reflects what Dr. Donald Housley, a history professor at Susquehanna University, says is the tendency for change in Selinsgrove to come slowly, and often from outside forces.
"It's almost like a laboratory," marveled Dr. Housley, who has lived in the area for 34 years. 
But he and others say statistics and anecdotes do not necessarily get to the heart and soul of a community. Selinsgrove is more than just a place that has not had a homicide in a decade, or where a local automotive store sports a portable sign that reads, "Rise Up Men of God." However slowly, it continues to evolve.
Now that Routes 11 and 15 have been widened, some residents travel 40 miles south to work or shop in Harrisburg, the state capital. The sale and use of heroin have prompted a few arrests recently. And there is a recognition of the nascent diversity occurring within the borough.
The local newspaper, The Daily Item, has adopted "a diverse community is our greatest asset" as one of its mottoes. Harvey Edwards, the only black teacher in a school district of 203 teachers, directs performances of a group of students called the "Tolerance Troupe." And the five-member police department is taking Spanish lessons, its chief, Tom Garlock, says, because of "communications problems that 10 years ago we didn't have."
Today, the census indicates, Selinsgrove has 72 more Hispanics than it did in 1990, for a total of 157; 119 more black people, for a total of 147; and 24 more Asians, for a total of 54. But most of those members of minorities are university students, with many of the rest living at Pine Meadow.
Barbara Demshock, its manager for nearly two decades, arrives each day in a white Cadillac Eldorado, a teacup poodle named Brandi strapped into a car seat by her side. She says that traces of community resentment regarding Pine Meadow linger -- although, she says, "We're making some progress."
Rosa Santana agrees. She moved to Selinsgrove from Brooklyn in 1996 for the most basic of reasons, she says. "I wanted to better my daughter's life, and I wanted to better my own life." At first she was jarred by her transition from big-city anonymity to standing out because of her culture and skin color, she says, and by the muttering down at the public-assistance office, something along the lines of: "You're not going to come here and sit on your derriere."
She recalls her classic urban response, "I'm asking you for your help; I'm not asking you for your opinion."
Today, Ms. Santana, 39, works full-time at a child-care center and has joined a Pentecostal church in Sunbury, just across the river. Her 7-year-old daughter, Maegan, enjoys attending elementary school. And while the local supermarket does nothave a full complement of Goya products, she says, it does have enough for her to cook some of the Spanish food she loves. Someday, she says, she plans to move out of Pine Meadow and into a house of her own.
Not far away, on the sprawling campus of the school district, a young white woman and a young black man nuzzle on a swing. She is Irene Seely, 17, who has lived in the area for years, most recently in Pine Meadow. He is Lamiek Maxwell, 21, who just moved into Pine Meadow.
Ms. Seely says she enjoys attending the local high school because it is better than other area schools, but she worries about its growing numbers. "I think there's enough people here," she said.
To which Mr. Maxwell, formerly of Brooklyn, replied, "You need people like me."

Pitino Says Racing Is For Laughs

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
BASKETBALL gave Rick Pitino the new wrinkles that go with the first acknowledged failure in his career.
 Until it all went bad with the Celtics last winter, he still looked like the former summer-camp player once hired as an assistant by intense Hubie Brown of the Knicks. 
 When Pitino later took Providence College to the Final Four, Brown rasped, "Hey, I don't hire no idiots," or words to that effect. 
Pitino, now 48, says the same about Nick Zito, who trained two Kentucky Derby champions, Strike the Gold in 1991 and Go for Gin in 1994. Pitino has one championship with the University of Kentucky Wildcats. 
At the moment, Pitino and Ol Memorial Stable own part of A P Valentine, which will run in tomorrow's Derby. The stable was formerly known as Celtic Pride until March. "It just didn't go well for us," Pitino said, employing the imperial "us" reserved for potentates. 
The way Pitino tells it, he was as rootless as a hot-walker looking for a cot and some loose change. Then he took the job at the University of Louisville, a move still a very big deal in this commonwealth. 
Normally, horse people give their interviews casually outside the barn, punctuated by a brief "Watch the horse!" Yesterday morning, Pitino was worth a conference room for the television crews and the reporters. 
"Racing is a social event, a beautiful sport," Pitino said. "It's a whole culture. You've got the Damon Runyon characters. It's not just Derby day."
When he got into horses, he turned them over to Zito, a fellow New Yorker by birth and diction.
"It's Nick's job to worry, to get nauseous each night, to not get sleep," Pitino said. "My admiration for trainers is off the charts. They work 360 days a year. They get up at 4-5 in the morning. They don't have a social life." 
In 1998, he and Zito entered Halory Hunter in the Derby, and the horse finished fourth, but he said A P Valentine has more going. The horse last ran in the Blue Grass on April 14, finishing fifth.
"Any time there's bad news, the trainer has to make the excuses," Pitino said. "The horse didn't like the shoes, it didn't take to the track, it didn't eat its oats, whatever. Our trainer has a unique gift for that."
Zito was standing there, with a big smile on his face, hearing the story yet again.
"I didn't hear from Nick, and I was panicking," Pitino continued. "There's a guy we use as a go-between named Jersey Red. I called Jersey and I said, 'Nick's cell phone is on the message. Please find out what happened.' "
Jersey Red reported back. The bad news was that the horse hated the track and just couldn't grab hold, but the good news was that A P Valentine was "mad, furious, upset" at his bad race.
"Now I've never butted in, but I said as an owner that we are not going to the Derby," Pitino insisted. "Instead, we are going to Hollywood. If Nick is really talking to the horses, we should do a remake of 'Mister Ed.'
"Baffert's out there and he's a very talented trainer with talented horses," Pitino said. "But he doesn't have the gift our trainer has. Our trainer is communicating with our horse one-on-one."
Instead of going to Hollywood, they rested A P Valentine for the Derby, where there are sports connections all over the track. Denny Crum, whom Pitino replaced at Louisville, has a piece of Nasty Story. And Bobby Hurley, the gritty point guard for Duke in the 104-103 thriller over Kentucky in the 1992 East Regional final, is a part owner of Songandaprayer. 
"As long as Christian Laettner didn't buy that horse, I'm all for it," Pitino said of the man who made the winning shot. 
"He's not allowed to set foot in this state," Pitino added, referring to Laettner's stepping on the chest of Aminu Timberlake earlier in that game.
Come to think of it, Pitino has heard it suggested that he not return. "It's not like I went from U.K. to U. of L.," Pitino said. "For the first time in 30 years there was an opening at the school, and it came up while I was unemployed."
He said there has been less commotion than predicted, although he was stung by a few comments from Kentucky officials. 
He wants people to know he is home, in a state he has come to love. He will laugh tomorrow no matter what. The game at Rupp Arena next season? That could be worth a few more wrinkles.

PHELPS DODGE CUTS DIVIDEND AND CANCELS SALE PLANS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Phelps Dodge Corporation, the world's No. 2 copper producer, said yesterday that it would cut its quarterly dividend by 37.5 cents and canceled plans to sell its specialty chemicals and wire and cable businesses. The company, which is based in Phoenix, said it would cut its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents a share from 50 cents, resulting in annual savings of $120 million for the company. 
The decision was based on a number of factors, including the slowing economy, Phelps Dodge said. It also said it had decided to drop plans to sell its Columbian Chemicals and PD Wire and Cable units because it would not be able to get the price it wants in the current economic environment.

MCLEODUSA EXPECTS LOWER REVENUE AND CASH FLOW

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 McLeodUSA Inc. cut its revenue and cash flow forecasts for 2001 because of the slowing economy, pricing pressures and delayed customer purchases, sending its stock down 31 percent. 
McLeodUSA, which is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and provides telecommunications services in Midwestern and Western states, said it expected 2001 revenue of $1.95 billion to $2 billion, lower than the $2.09 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. Shares of McLeodUSA fell $3.04, to $6.77 a share, on Nasdaq, where it was among the top percentage losers. Late on Wednesday, McLeodUSA posted a first-quarter net loss of $173.2 million, compared with a loss of $58.5 million a year ago. Revenue rose 50 percent, to $433 million.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Philippines: Exports Fall 

BYLINE:  By Wayne Arnold (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Philippine exports fell 0.5 percent in the first three months of this year to $8.5 billion, led by declines in electronics to the United States, the National Statistics Office said. Economists said the export slowdown was sure to hit the country's economic growth rate; the government has set a growth target of 3.8 percent this year. Exports of electronics, which account for more than half of Philippine exports over all, dropped 11.2 percent in March, contributing to an overall monthly export decline of 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Royal Dutch/Shell Profit Is Up 23% 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 3 

 BODY:
Enjoying the good times in oil refining and natural gas while they last, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group reported first-quarter profits today that increased 23 percent, outstripping analysts' forecasts.
 Royal Dutch/Shell, the second largest publicly traded oil company after Exxon Mobil, said its net income, excluding one-time charges and fluctuations in inventory valuation, rose to $3.86 billion in the quarter ended March 31, compared with $3.13 billion in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 6 percent, to $47.8 billion. 
 "They showed strong trading performance across the board," said Steve Turner, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities. The only exception, he noted, was in the chemicals division, where profits declined 83 percent, to $53 million. Natural gas is the principal raw material for many kinds of chemicals, so the same high gas prices that increased Shell's overall profits hurt its margins in chemicals.
Mr. Turner, who has a "reduce" rating on the company's stock, says the high prices for oil and gas producers may almost be over. For Royal Dutch/Shell in the near future, he said, "we expect them to generate meager earnings growth."
Reports released Wednesday by the American Petroleum Institute and the United States Department of Energy that showed that inventories of oil, gasoline and heating fuels were growing faster than expected indicate that the short supplies of recent months are easing and prices may soon fall, analysts said.
Those reports hit oil futures and the stocks of most major oil companies hard, pushing share prices down for two days. Of the two components of Royal Dutch/Shell, the London-traded stock, Shell Transport and Trading, fell 23 pence (33 cents), to 560 pence ($8.02), while the Amsterdam-traded stock, Royal Dutch Petroleum, fell 1.8 euros ($1.61), to 64.45 euros ($57.55). (The Dutch company represents three-fifths of the group and the British company two-fifths.)
The group has embarked on a two-year revamping program that is intended to yield $5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2001. Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, who is scheduled to retire as chairman of the group in June, has said the program will ensure that Royal Dutch/Shell will be profitable even if benchmark crude oil prices fall by nearly half, to $14 a barrel.
Five consecutive quarters of bountiful profits have left Royal Dutch/Shell flush with cash. It has been aggressive in using the cash to make acquisitions, most recently Fletcher Challenge Energy of New Zealand for $1.67 billion.
The group has made a hostile bid of $2.4 billion for Barrett Resources, which would give it a presence in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. And it offered $3.2 billion for Woodside Petroleum of Australia, though regulators there blocked the deal.
Analysts tend to scowl at acquisitions at times like this, when oil prices are near a peak, because they worry about inflated valuations. 
"It's hard to justify the economics of these acquisitions on the prices being paid," said Peter Nicol, an analyst with ABN Amro, who nonetheless rates Shell Transport a buy. "There is a fear they're spending this money unwisely."
In a statement, Sir Mark said today, "What we will not do is pursue targets purely in the interests of making a deal, nor will we lose sight of the underlying economics of our business."

Camelot's Once and Future Glamour

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
THE Metropolitan Museum of Art has expanded its armor collection to include the Costume Institute. "Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years -- Selections From the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum" presents the wardrobe of a woman who became embattled by the very forces she helped set in motion. Like Joan of Arc, in fact. 
 In Mrs. Kennedy's case, martyrdom arrived in the form of iconography: the world of images, celebrities, logos and sound bites. In the conflict between privacy and publicity, the line between them was battered, we now know, beyond repair. But the clothes held up beautifully. 
 Organized with intelligence and flair by Hamish Bowles, an editor at Vogue, the show represents a triumph of substance over style. With surprisingly little variety in the clothes themselves, Mr. Bowles has drawn upon news photos and other materials that set the clothes in historical context. 
With magazine covers, film and video clips, music and other mixed-media ephemera, the installation weaves together an astonishingly vivid tapestry of the cultural forces that coursed through the Kennedy years. I would go so far as to call this a first-rate show of political art, perhaps the most startling example of the genre since the Met presented the exhibition "Harlem on My Mind" in 1968. It is also the strongest show I've seen on the role played by the media in the transformation of modern American life.
When her husband introduced himself as "the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris," he was prophetic. There probably won't be a better occasion than this show to examine why this first lady feared that her glamour might outshine her husband's political achievements. 
This woman wrote her own script. President Kennedy needed his family, and battalions of advisers, courtiers, historians, medical experts and other technicians to put his identity together. Jackie created herself. Oh, yes, there was Sister Parish to help with chintzes, and Oleg Cassini to sketch the frocks. But these were just props. The author of the play was the lady herself.
The show, presented by the Costume Institute on the museum's second floor, starts off chronologically, with clothes Mrs. Kennedy wore during the 1960 presidential campaign, and continues thematically, with sections devoted to travel clothes, riding outfits, formal regalia for state dinners and everyday wear.
The campaign clothes are remarkably self-effacing. Except for some red and blue uniforms -- their intensity recalls the early days of color television -- the nearly monochromatic shades tend toward the (gasp) mousy. Mrs. Kennedy appears to be saying that her outfits can be as modest as Pat Nixon's Good Republican Cloth Coats. 
This has the outrageous effect of magnifying Mrs. Kennedy's youth, beauty and personal style. And when you zoom in closer, the shapes are unmistakably Givenchy 1959: wide cut, with wide-welt borders (like the orange model Audrey Hepburn wore when shoplifting a Halloween mask at the 5-and-10-cent store). Photographed from the back as a campaign limousine heads up Fifth Avenue, she waves her gloved hand, unfurling the broad sleeve of her coat like the wing of some gorgeous descendant of a prehistoric bird of prey.
There was a Darwinian aspect to the 1960 election: the survival of the most attractive. Since Mrs. Kennedy outranked her husband on that evolutionary scale, her contribution to the Democratic victory should not be minimized. We were now well into the cold war. And we had learned that this war would be fought not with weapons but with images. The missile gap was more a matter of perceptions than facts. Nuclear deterrence was propaganda. If a Soviet leader was crass enough to bang his shoe on the table at the United Nations, what other savagery might he be capable of? If Nikita S. Khrushchev could threaten, "We will bury you," what could prevent the escalation of psychological warfare into mutually assured destruction?
And who is to say that the psychological damage wasn't as real, in its way, as physical injury? Or that it didn't require a healing power, too? Mrs. Kennedy projected the counterperception of the ancient civilizing impulse. The handsome face was antique, Greek, classical; the clothes were classic modern French. They adhered in all essentials to the design philosophy enunciated in the 1920's by Gabrielle Chanel. "With these scissors I cut away all that was inessential in the creations of others": that was Chanel's basic message. Or, as her fellow modernist, Mies van der Rohe, expressed it, "Less is more."
Mrs. Kennedy's riding clothes were British. But British riding gear, sportswear and sailing attire were a major influence on Chanel in the 1920's, acquired during the designer's liaison with the Duke of Westminster. Jazz Age flappers, an American import, inspired the garconne look Chanel introduced in 1923.
The appeal of reductive modernism was international, never more so than in the 1950's and early 60's, when the Miesian aesthetic was embraced in architecture as the public face of the so-called Affluent Society. Simple shapes, sumptuous materials: the same rules applied to the Seagram Building and Mrs. Kennedy's image. Also, both had good posture. And vigor. Different typologies allowed minimal variations. A German cut worked for a building, a British cut for a horse. For a dress, the cut must be French.
The iconic shape is the beige wool crepe dress Mrs. Kennedy wore for the Inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, 1961. Designed by Oleg Cassini, the overblouse dress featured three-quarter-length sleeves, a scoop neck and a hem at the knee. The cut was a form-fitting, crisp silhouette; two deep folds at the waist allowed the skirt to fall from the hips like a column. Mrs. Kennedy added a fur collar, a ruby-and-diamond clip from Tiffany and one of Halston's famous pillbox hats. You don't expect variety in uniforms, and there is little here. But in other variations the sleeves were longer or shorter; fabrics and colors changed; the waist could be fitted or gathered, the severity softened by a bow, a flower, a ruffle, a cockade. The skirt usually flairs.
Givenchy, Cassini, Bergdorf Goodman, Herbert Sondheim, Chez Ninon: others could do Chanel better than Chanel herself now, and back then it might have made a difference whose name was on the label. Cassini has been reported to be dissatisfied that the show gives him insufficient credit as major author of Mrs. Kennedy's image. Anyone who designed the shimmering apricot silk dress she wore on a boat ride during her trip to India in 1962 should indeed have his name in lights. 
But Cassini was born in France, fashion was French, and the entire image, orchestrated by Mrs. Kennedy herself, was intended to project the aura of France as a cultural beacon enlightening the world. The diplomatic language. Les beaux-arts. La vie de boheme. Le paradis artificiel: gardens, fountains, coiffeur, cuisine, son et lumiere. Cassini, who designed for Hollywood, knew how to sustain that aura under lights.
If the campaign costumes are autumnally drab, in the first lady's wardrobe it is perennially spring. The day dresses tend toward pastel: green, blue, yellow, pink. Easter, in fact, the ascension after sacrifice: a subliminal association in the house of the nation's first Roman Catholic president. Then, for stark theatrical contrast, there is the black-on-black outfit designed by Cassini for Mrs. Kennedy's meeting with Pope John XXIII. His Holiness wears white. 
At the White House the first lady does, for she considers white the most suitable for grand occasions. The seating charts resemble large, radiant stars, with names, in formal script, for rays. Music from "Camelot," the Broadway musical, plays in the background. Eliza Doolittle, Cinderella, Black Jack Bouvier's daughter come to the ball.
Each head of state lights up in Mrs. Kennedy's presence. No head of state lights up in Nina Khrushchev's presence. This is not the reason the 1961 Vienna summit meeting was such a flop. But looking at pictures of the first lady and the Soviet leader sharing a joke, you can easily imagine that the two of them could have ended the cold war in a few minutes. Perhaps she comments on that shoe. At least he made a fashion statement. So much more stylish than that irate finger jabbing of Jack's.
Near the beginning of the show there is the famous portrait of Jacqueline Bouvier, the inquiring photographer, holding her camera up to face the viewer. (She is wearing a uniform even then: garconne at large.) It is hard not to see the exhibition that follows as the projection of her mind's eye. Her camera establishes a relationship to the world while the unseen photographer's camera reverses it. She could have taken the picture herself while gazing into a mirror. And then walked through the mirror. Into the show itself. Into the life of an icon.
And into a life of black and white. The show's installation dramatizes the extent to which the public in those days saw its public figures in black, white and gray, like a page of newsprint. They were personified headlines. Arrangements in Benday dots. The pastel day dresses recall the colors of tinted postcards. The video monitors emphasize that the clothes were content for the media that were becoming the new form of public space, altering its relationship to private life in the process.
Mrs. Kennedy was a major agent of this change. Part of the show's fascination comes from speculating on the question of nature and nurture. How much of her persona was the product of family breeding? How much was due to iron will, the ambition to act on a global stage? Certainly the patrician image was both true and stylized, a cross between the real Anastasia and the fake one. The affinity for art, even in its wilder forms, was real, and only partly sublimated into the conventions of "good taste." The diction was deliberately pitched at a level below her awareness. A notch or two lower, and Mrs. Kennedy might have let loose with Jayne Mansfield squeals.
There's a Brothers Grimm story called "The Boy Who Went Out to Learn Fear." The final image in the show brought that title to mind. A black-and-white photograph, greatly enlarged, depicts the president and Mrs. Kennedy sitting in the back of a limousine. The two are smiling at each other. It freezes a classic public-private moment: a scene of intimacy between two people at the center of a nation that had yet to discover that everyone wants to be a star.
The scene is not Dallas, the year not 1963, though I think we're meant to be jolted by the possibility that these two stunning creatures are headed for an appointment in Samara. We're relieved to discover that the picture was taken the year before, but the discovery precipitates an even worse letdown because the picture was made in an America that had yet to be blown apart, first by one assassin, then by an army of them, until we had exhausted faith in our destiny and the entire world's supply of good will that the Kennedys had helped to inspire.
Wallowing in our poison now seems to be the national pastime. Art may not be the highest form of redemption from toxicity, but it's a good one. In the show's last gallery we see fashion transformed into something more enduring: the preservation of architectural landmarks, a field that continued to hold Mrs. Kennedy's interest beyond the White House years. But throughout the show we see glimpses of her contributions to the arts: gala performances at the White House, speeches she gave on visits overseas.
It was possible, back in the early 1960's, to discount this work as the purely ornamental pastime of a young first lady. It seemed of a piece with seating a dinner, arranging flowers, redecorating the premises. It is not possible to make that mistake today, when culture has assumed such a major role politically and economically in the conduct of world affairs. It does not seem a small thing now to have made art a matter of national policy. In an age still racked by fear -- missile shield, anyone? -- it is vivifying to be reminded that the desire for beauty can survive the rage to destroy.

HEADLINE: Blair Says Cattle Disease Is Near End; Elections Due 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair said today that Britain was in the home stretch of its race to contain a ruinous epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease, prompting widespread forecasts that early next week he would call a June general election. 
 Last month, as Britain's worst recorded outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease ravaged herds, damaged tourism and threatened a plague of political troubles, Mr. Blair was forced to postpone elections planned for today rather than face taunts that he was placing his New Labor Party's electoral interests ahead of the travails of a nation in crisis. 
 The prime minister has been under pressure to pronounce victory over the disease, not only for electoral reasons but also to try to lure back the foreign tourists, many of them Americans, who have been avoiding Britain because of the outbreak. 
With the number of animals slaughtered approaching 2.5 million and the daily incidence of new cases of foot-and-mouth falling, Mr. Blair said the disease, which affects cloven-hoofed animals like sheep, cattle and pigs, was retreating. "The battle is not over yet," Mr. Blair said,adding that he believed the country was in the home stretch. "We are getting the disease under control," he said. 
Political analysts took his remarks to mean that the last obstacle to a June 7 election had been removed. That is the date Mr. Blair has set for the local elections he postponed from today. In Britain's political code, the date of the local vote is regarded as the date for general elections. 
Asked if an election was in the offing, Mr. Blair told a news conference: "I'm not going to breach the golden rule: don't start talking about general elections unless and until an election is called." 
But, he said, "We are in a new phase of the disease now." 
By noon today, the authorities said 2.4 million animals had been slaughtered and destroyed, and, for the first time in weeks, there was no longer a backlog of animals to be culled. Eight new cases today raised the total of farms infected since the disease was diagnosed on Feb. 19 to 1,537, predominantly in Cumbria in the northwest, Devon in the southwest and parts of Wales. The level of new cases has fallen from 40 a day just a few weeks ago, but has not been fully eradicated, Mr. Blair said. "We will not slacken our guard against foot-and-mouth," he said. 
Such has been the scale of Britain's all-consuming battle against the disease, deploying thousands of government veterinarians and even the army, that Mr. Blair called it "probably been the biggest peacetime logistical challenge the army has faced." 
"The scale of combating foot-and-mouth disease," he added, "has far exceeded, for example, even the logistical demands of the gulf war."
The onslaught has left parts of the British countryside scarred with pyres and mass burial sites for dead animals.
While Mr. Blair cautioned against complacency in the effort to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease, his announcement today shifted the nation's attention firmly to an election. 
"The waiting is almost over," said William Hague, leader of the opposition Conservatives. "If Tony Blair decides to go to the country next week, and all the signs are that he will, we will be ready for him." 
Under electoral rules, Mr. Blair has until Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to make an announcement four weeks before a June 7 poll. He is not obliged to call an election until May 2002, but has long favored an earlier vote to realize Labor's elusive dream of governing for two consecutive terms. 
The timing of the original vote reflected a calculation that a May election would permit New Labor to benefit from Britain's economic upswing, low unemployment and promises of benefits to help poor families.
The argument for an early vote has become all the more compelling with the risk that the slowdown in the American economy will have repercussions in Britain, which is especially vulnerable because of high United States investment levels. If Mr. Blair can go into a campaign casting himself not only as a guardian of prosperity, but also as the conqueror of the foot-and-mouth epidemic, his ratings are likely to be even higher than now. 
Opinion surveys show Labor maintaining a persistent double-digit lead over the Conservatives, contradicting Mr. Hague's assertion today that a vote in June would be "one of the hardest-fought election campaigns in modern history." 
A MORI opinion survey, published yesterday in the pro-government Sun tabloid, predicted a June election would expand Mr. Blair's parliamentary majority to a whopping 227 from 170. Other opinion surveys have placed Labor ahead by 18 per cent, despite criticism among farmers -- and from the Conservatives -- of the government's handling of the foot-and-mouth crisis.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Potent Tool To Tip Race For Mayor: New Budget

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Of the many ways that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani may choose to influence the race to succeed him at City Hall, there is one that already stands apart for its potential effectiveness -- and it comes in the form of a thick, two-volume document released by the outgoing mayor at City Hall last week.
 That document is the executive budget for 2002. And by design or not -- at least one of the candidates believes it is certainly by design -- Mr. Giuliani's $39.5 billion budget has been driving the conduct of the mayoral race to a measurable degree ever since. 
 It is influencing what the candidates are already talking about, and it is likely, in the months ahead, to curtail their ability to ladle out expensive campaign promises. It could even, if Mr. Giuliani's warnings about tough fiscal times ahead take hold, influence the way voters measure the qualifications of his successor, putting a premium on fiscal management and experience.
There has been much discussion in political circles about the obvious ways Mr. Giuliani has kept a hand in the contest to succeed him -- from hammering Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, one day, to ostensibly promoting the candidacy of Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, the next.
But it is at least as noteworthy that Democrats in the last few days have been talking about tax cuts -- Mr. Giuliani proposed a $525 million cut for next year -- and public subsidies to build new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets, which Mr. Giuliani is advocating once again. In both instances, their responses to Mr. Giuliani's eighth budget suggest the extent to which fiscal life in New York might be different in a Democratic City Hall, where tax cuts and city-financed stadiums are unlikely to be high on anyone's priority list.
The mayor's spare budget proposal, filled with cuts, has helped to rob from these candidates the luxury of being able to make the kind of freewheeling campaign spending promises that were so routine in last year's political campaigns, which took place in flusher times. All four major candidates say they will not be able to propose new spending programs -- whether it is Mark Green's pledge to subsidize college tuition to police officers or Fernando Ferrer's call for a 30 percent raise for teachers -- without offering an account of how they pay for it.
"It should be a definite, definite consideration for anybody who is running for mayor whether they are promising more than they deliver -- and what it's going to cost," Mr. Vallone said yesterday.
In this context, it is hardly a surprise that some of the Democratic candidates seem a bit annoyed at what they see as an attempt by an outgoing mayor to set the table for their election contest. 
"It's clear to me that the mayor's budget is less economic-based than it is politically based -- with the obvious goal of trying to create mischief in the campaign and handcuff his successor," Mr. Green said in an interview. He said it would not work. "The prevailing view is that he is now the straw stirring the drink and that his comments play an important role in the mayor's race," Mr. Green said. "I don't buy that. People know he's history."
History or not, all four are trying to accommodate the situation that Mr. Giuliani's budget has helped to create, if in different ways.
Mr. Hevesi called a news conference on Monday to attack the budget as fiscally irresponsible, warning that it would leave the next mayor with larger deficits because of the proposed tax cut and underestimated costs. Mr. Hevesi said his remarks were motivated by a professional concern about the fiscal health of the city -- but they served, not incidentally, to reinforce his efforts to present himself as the fiscal conservative in the field.
"Maybe the way we respond to the budget could indicate a distinction between us," Mr. Hevesi said of he and his opponents. "But I have a charter mandate. Ultimately, I have to certify that the budget is balanced and that we are able to market our debt. My response is not going to be calculated to, will this win votes or will this not win me votes."
Mr. Ferrer has seized on Mr. Giuliani's budget as evidence for his central campaign theme, what he describes as the mayor's history of neglecting a large part of New York. The Bronx borough president has attacked the budget, noting its minimal increase in education financing and the tax cut.
"The tax cut is a symbolic tip of the hat to his legacy, and his real legacy will be wreaking havoc on public education," Mr. Ferrer said.
Mr. Vallone has taken an entirely different approach. He has, by virtue of directly negotiating with Mr. Giuliani over the shape of the final spending and tax plan, a direct political interest in its outcome and is moving to try to claim some credit for a budget that he said would be "the crowning achievement for the mayor and the City Council."
Finally, supporters of Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican businessman who is considering a race for mayor, said that the perception that the city was moving into bad times -- which is implicit in Mr. Giuliani's budget -- would enhance his appeal, given his business credentials and Mr. Giuliani's attempt to argue that Democrats could bring the city back into profligate fiscal times.

HEADLINE: BUSH WILL MODIFY BAN ON NEW ROADS FOR U.S. FORESTS 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
The White House will put in place Clinton administration regulations intended to protect national forests from development but will allow those rules to be amended case by case, senior administration officials said today. 
 The rules were issued within the last 15 days of the Clinton administration and never went into effect. 
 The White House decision, which is to be announced on Friday, in effectgives local officials the power to modify a plan that would have banned new road building and most logging on some 60 million acres of federal land, or about one-third of the national forests. 
One Bush administration official who outlined the decision tonight said that while the administration supported the broad intentions of the Clinton policy, the planned changes would address preliminary concerns raised by a federal judge. 
"The goal of protecting millions of acres of land throughout our country is an important goal," the official said, outlining an argument that Secretary Ann M. Veneman of the Agriculture Department is to make publicly on Friday. "And through local forest-management procedures we can address the judge's concerns."
The timber industry and many Western states strongly opposed the Clinton plan, which had been developed over three years, and had challenged the plan in federal court as being unwarranted and misguided.
Supporters of the approach taken by former President Bill Clinton said tonight that the administration's decision was intended to undermine the plan while allowing the White House to claim that its hands had been tied by the courts.
"It's essentially a gutting of the rules with words and phrases saying that they're keeping it in place," said Doug Honnold, managing lawyer of the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund's office in Bozeman, Mont.
In Idaho, a spokesman for Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, a Republican, said the exact details of the administration's decision would determine how and whether his state and others would go forward with their legal challenge. 
"There are a number of issues raised by Western governors that the Clinton administration ignored in promulgating this rule, and we are looking forward to seeing how they will be addressed by the new administration," said the spokesman, H. D. Palmer.
Michael Klein, a spokesman for the timber industry's American Forest and Paper Association, said tonight that the industry would not comment on the administration's decision until it had been made public on Friday. 
Conservation groups and Democrats have criticized the Bush administration for many of its early decisions on the environment. In recent weeks, administration officials said, top aides to Mr. Bush, led by John Bridgeland, a domestic policy adviser, have tried to come up with an approach to the forest plan that might prove politically and legally palatable.
Opponents of the Clinton plan called it a top-down federal initiative that ignored local concerns by putting vast areas of public land off limits to logging, energy development, off-road vehicle use and other activity. 
In a preliminary opinion last month, Judge Edward J. Lodge of Federal District Court in Boise, Idaho, seemed inclined to uphold those concerns, saying that the process used to develop the rules represented "an obvious violation" of the federal law that spells out requirements for public participation in federal rule making. Judge Lodge deferred until this month a decision on whether to block the Clinton plan, as requested by the State of Idaho and Boise Cascade, the giant timber company. 
For decades, decisions about how national forest land should be managed have been delegated in nearly all instances to local Forest Service planners, who have historically taken into account the priorities of state and local officials and regional industries. The Clinton rule was an effort to lay out broad rules for some forest lands that could not be changed at the local level.
As outlined by administration officials today, the Bush approach would return much of that power to local Forest Service planners. 
With the announcement, the administration will make good on a promise to Judge Lodge to inform him by May 4 of its decision on how to proceed with the rule. 
Environmentalists and other supporters of the Clinton rules have noted that they were not made final until the end of a process that included scores of public meetings and prompted comments from more than a million people. 
Niel Lawrence, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Fund who is based in Olympia, Wash., said of the White House decision, "This is a stealthy way to undo the rules without really owning up to what they're doing, while spinning it as fundamentally pro-environmental." 
The Clinton rules, announced on Jan. 5, were initially to have taken effect on Feb. 12. Implementation was postponed twice by the Bush administration, most recently until May 12, as part of a comprehensive review in which the new administration had declined until now even to defend the broad outlines of the rule in response to the court challenge.
The officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the crux of the decision was that the forest-protection rules would now take effect, as scheduled, on May 12, barring any ruling to the contrary by Judge Lodge. But as its guidelines are put in place, they said, broad discretion will be permitted for challenges by state and local authorities.
"We're going forward with the protections under the rule, but we're going to address the concerns," an administration official said.
Among the concerns he cited was the effective bypassing of state and local officials on decisions about road building, logging and other activities, which the officials have said undermined their economic interests. 
The plan would affect dozens of national forests in 39 states, including the Tongass forest in Alaska, the largest of the forests and the one where the most permits for logging are still under consideration.

HEADLINE: Florida Leaders Sign Agreement For Overhaul of Election System 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., May 3 

 BODY:
Six months after a chaotic election in Florida decided the protracted presidential race, state lawmakers have reached agreement on a bill that would do away with hanging chads, butterfly ballots and questions about determining voter intent.
 It would also require that ballots in extremely close elections be recounted by hand -- the very practice that Florida election officials and the Bush campaign had opposed so fiercely last year in their battle with Democrats who were insisting that manual recounts would tip the election to Al Gore. 
 After weeks of partisan debate and negotiations, House and Senate leaders signed an agreement this evening to ban punch-card ballot machines, give counties money for equipment and set guidelines for recounts.
The Florida House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, are expected to approve the bill in largely ceremonial votes before the legislative session adjourns on Friday.
The changes would be in place for the state's next general election, in 2002, and the National Association of Secretaries of State said they would move Florida ahead of many other states in overhauling voting systems. 
"This would be one of the most comprehensive election reform packages that have been passed," Kay Albowicz, communications director for the association, said. "Ironically, the state of Florida, where the bomb went off, is one of the first states to rebuild."
Gov. Jeb Bush, who created an elections task force to recommend improvements the day after his brother won Florida's 25 decisive electoral votes, and thus the presidency, said he was eager to sign the bill into law.
"Election reform has been a top priority of mine as well as the leadership in both chambers of the Legislature this session," Governor Bush said. "I look forward to signing this much-needed legislation that will ensure every Floridian's vote counts as well as serve as a model for the rest of the nation."
His language echoed the mantra of the Democrats last year, when Mr. Gore pleaded with state officials and the courts to "count every vote." 
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, praised the bill, saying: "I commend the Florida Legislature for taking the leadership on this. I wish Jeb Bush would call his brother George to get the same type of action up here in the Congress."
Commenting on Florida Republicans' accepting such changes now that the election was over, Mr. McAuliffe said: "All the things we were attacked on before, like manual recounts, all of a sudden they're the biggest supporters. If we had had manual recounts a year ago, Al Gore would be in the White House."
When the Bush team sued to block recounts last November, James A. Baker III, leading the charge for the Republican candidate, said that with hand counts, "there would be countless opportunities for the ballots to be subject to a whole host of risks."
"The potential for mischief would exist to a far greater degree than in the automated count," Mr. Baker said. He could not be reached for comment tonight.
Representative Johnnie B. Byrd Jr., the No. 2 Republican in the Florida House, said tonight that manual recounts were being retained because the law had been "clarified" to set standards and conditions for conducting them.
The measure has not been without controversy. A provision that would have been a step toward automatically restoring the voting rights of felons was dropped in negotiations between the Senate, which favored it, and the House, which opposed it. Another concession that would eliminate state matching funds for out-of-state campaign contributions was denounced by the Democrats, who are counting on the money in part to help wage a campaign to unseat Governor Bush next year.
Republicans and Democrats alike agreed that Florida residents had demanded a deal on election changes in the current legislative session to avoid ever again becoming a national embarrassment.
"I think we have done what the citizens of Florida wanted us to do,and that is avoid what happened during the election of 2000," said Senator Lisa Carlton, a Republican on the conference committee that hashed out the election bill.
The legislation provides counties with $24 million over the next two years to replace outdated equipment. Counties with 75,000 residents or fewer will get $7,500 per precinct to pay for optical scanners; more populous counties will get $3,500 per precinct for the equipment. Counties that can afford more expensive touch-screen technology can opt for that system.
Counties would divide $6 million for better education of voters and poll workers and $2 million to create a central voter database.
The new law would require a hand review of all ballots in which more than one choice was marked or in which no choice was marked in an election with a margin of victory of a quarter of 1 percent or less. The secretary of state's office would establish rules for the manual review, including how ambiguous ballots would be counted. 
"There are a lot of good things we can be proud of," said Representative Lois J. Frankel, the House Democratic leader If the changes been in place last November, Ms. Frankel said, "Al Gore would be president."
That, of course, is where Republicans and Democrats differ on the changes. Nonetheless, they agree that the overhaul will put Florida in the forefront of election reform.
"I think the best thing they've done is aggressively tackled the problem and taken pretty substantial action," said Tim Storey, an elections analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures. "This will essentially guarantee that the scenario that played out last year will never happen again in Florida."
Many of the provisions address the most severe problems in the last election. For instance, the new law would create provisional ballots to prevent disenfranchising citizens who were wrongly eliminated from the voter rolls, as many in heavily black precincts were in November because they had been mistakenly purged along with ex-convicts. The provision would enable people whose registration was in question to vote and later have the issue resolved and the ballot certified.
In addition, the statewide standard for recounts would eliminate confusion over counting questionable ballots, which became a point of contention and prompted several lawsuits when canvassing boards like those in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties used different criteria than when canvassers counted them by hand.
Since the November election, more than 1,500 bills related to election changes have been introduced in all 50 states combined, the National Conference of State Legislators said. More than 130 have been signed into law, and more than 1,000 are pending in 35 states.
In Georgia, Gov. Roy Barnes has signed legislation to place touch-screen voting systems in all precincts. In Maryland, the Legislature passed a bill requiring the state and counties to split the costs of a new system.
Still, elections officials at a hearing on Capitol Hill last week were not optimistic about achieving meaningful nationwide improvements by the midterm elections next year. The economic downturn will make paying for the changes on many states' wish lists difficult and some are moving slowly, the officials said.
"Florida has proven a state can put the money there even with a lean state budget," said Ms. Albowicz, of the secretaries of state association. "It should restore voter confidence. People will ask critical questions."
One reason, she said, is that "everybody got a huge civic lesson last November."

HEADLINE: Ford Tries to Burnish Image By Looking to Cut Emissions 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 3 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company reaffirmed its concerns about global warming today, but said that it did not support stiffer federal fuel-economy standards or the international Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions as ways to address the problem.
 In its second "corporate citizenship report," Ford said that it had formed a committee of executives to examine ways to reduce the company's contribution to global warming. 
 The report estimated that Ford factories and vehicles around the world emitted about 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases a year, or about 2 percent of all emissions caused by people. 
"On the issue of climate change, there's no doubt that sufficient evidence exists to move from argument to action," Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said in a preamble to the report.
Environmental advocates, with whom Ford's leaders have held extensive discussions, said today that they were willing to overlook the automaker's continued reservations about tougher fuel standards and the Kyoto agreement. 
Instead, they praised Ford for being willing to address the issue of global warming, particularly in light of President Bush's recent disavowal of the Kyoto agreement.
"Ford's efforts to be a responsible corporate citizen," the Sierra Club said in a statement, "are in stark contrast with the Bush administration's irresponsible remarks trivializing energy efficiency and President Bush's broken promise on curbing global warming."
The burning of gasoline by automobiles is the second-largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, after power plants. Many scientists say that the emissions may be causing the earth's atmosphere to become warmer.
For its part, Ford is trying to establish an environmentally friendly image in an effort to sell more cars. Today's report highlighted voluntary commitments that it made last summer. The company said that it would increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005. It also said that it would start selling a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the Ford Escape sport utility in 2003.
General Motors and DaimlerChrysler have since said that they would match Ford by improving the gas mileage of their light trucks, a category that includes pickups and minivans as well as sport utility vehicles.
Martin B. Zimmerman, Ford's vice president for governmental affairs, told reporters today that continued research into ways to improve fuel efficiency, like fuel cells, would be more valuable than new government mandates that automakers increase the fuel economy of light trucks.
"The way to solve this issue," Mr. Zimmerman said, "is not with small, incremental change." 
G.M. and DaimlerChrysler echoed Ford's comments. Dennis Minano, G.M.'s chief environmental officer, said that, in particular, the automaker opposed increases in the fuel-economy standards for light trucks, which are allowed to burn 33 percent more gasoline per mile than cars.
William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of Ford, was among the first corporate executives to raise the global warming issue, mentioning it in speeches since 1996.
Mr. Ford and a few of his aides drafted last year's corporate citizenship report, which attracted national attention with its candid discussion of the safety and environmental drawbacks of sport utilities.

HEADLINE: Utility Plans To Put Limits On Its Plants 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Citing a growing concern about global warming, the Entergy Corporation, one of the nation's largest electric power generators, announced yesterday that it planned to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide over the next five years. 
 Entergy's decision comes weeks after President Bush reversed a campaign pledge to regulate the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants -- a reaction, many analysts said, to pressure from the utility industry. 
 Opponents of emission controls argued that the cost would damage the industry and the economy. 
But industry experts and some environmental advocates said yesterday that Entergy's shift showed that the industry's views on climate change were not monolithic. 
"It is incumbent upon every individual and business to take voluntary initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the risks we face today," said J. Wayne Leonard, the company's chief executive. "Entergy's program will demonstrate that companies can do the right thing while remaining competitive and profitable."
Entergy, which is based in New Orleans and operates plants in six states, took pains to note that its decision was not meant as a slap at the Bush administration. 
The company's plan would cap its carbon dioxide emissions at last year's levels over the next five years, despite plans to significantly increase its power generation. About 17,500 megawatts of the electricity that Entergy generates in the United States is from fossil fuels, and it expects to increase that capacity by 5,000 megawatts over the next five years, mainly by building natural- gas-fired plants. 
The company estimated that it released about 50 million tons of carbon dioxide last year. Without the cap, new plants would add 5.5 million tons to its emissions. The pledge does not affect Entergy's nuclear plants, including the Indian Point 3 plant in New York, or its foreign holdings.
Entergy shares rose 20 cents yesterday, to $40.45, on a day when power company stocks generally were lower.
The company plans to work with Environmental Defense, an advocacy group based in New York, to develop its emissions reduction program. It will also be the first American power company to join the Partnership for Climate Action, a group including DuPont, BP Amoco and Royal Dutch/Shell, that has pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80 million metric tons annually by 2010. 
Entergy is still trying to figure out how it will cut emissions. The company said that 80 percent of the reductions would come from its operations and the remainder from trading emissions credits -- essentially paying others not to pollute. 
Utilities in the Energy Department's Climate Challenge program sought to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 47.6 million metric tons by last year. Industry experts say Entergy's plans up the ante and may prompt other power companies to take similar steps.
A spokesman for Entergy said Mr. Leonard had been studying arguments about climate change for some time but decided to cap the company's emissions after listening to scientists at a conference on global warming that Entergy sponsored in New Orleans last September.
Environmental advocates offered cautious praise for Entergy's decision, with one activist noting that global warming is a crucial issue in Louisiana. 
"We're so low in the water here in Louisiana that we will be among the first and worst affected as seas rise," said Gary Groesch, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy in New Orleans.

HEADLINE: In Argentina, More Room To Breathe 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, May 4 

 BODY:
At just about every public ceremony, the Argentine economy minister, Domingo F. Cavallo, reminds his audiences that his mother nicknamed him "Lightning" as a child.
 Since his appointment six weeks ago, Mr. Cavallo has kept up a prodigious pace, with new tax, tariff, currency and budget plans announced almost daily, and sleep reduced to catnaps on red-eye flights as he crisscrosses the globe shoring up confidence about his country among foreign investors and bankers. 
 There has hardly been a day when Mr. Cavallo has not chased down and denied another rumor that Argentina was about to default on its $150 billion in foreign debt, or devalue the peso, or both, moves that could bring emerging stock and bond markets from Brazil to Hong Kong crashing down along with Argentina's markets. 
This week, he staved off the wolf at the country's door by putting the final touches on a new loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The deal gives the country a bit of slack on budget deficit targets for the second and third quarters, and opens the way for him to reduce debt payments by arranging a swap of as much as $20 billion in bonds. 
And he successfully lobbied the lower house of Congress to pass a bill that would change the basis for the peso's value from a strict peg to the United States dollar to an equal mix of dollars and euros, should those two currencies ever reach parity.
In keeping with his heterodox approach, mixing supply-side economics with protectionism, Mr. Cavallo, a 54-year-old Harvard graduate, granted the slumping beef industry subsidized lines of credit and offered tax cuts to struggling manufacturers. And ever the cheerleader, Mr. Cavallo began predicting this week that the Argentine economy, the second largest in South America after Brazil, would achieve a 5 percent growth rate by the fourth quarter, while almost every other economist has been forecasting gloom and doom. 
"I'm forced to move on different fronts at the same time, because it's a serious situation," Mr. Cavallo told foreign correspondents at a breakfast this week. "But I'm very optimistic." 
Despite his stellar reputation as the man who, in an earlier stint in the job, defeated hyperinflation in the early 1990's by pegging the peso to the dollar, Mr. Cavallo has yet to persuade Wall Street that his plans this time around are anything more than smoke and mirrors. A recent Bear, Stearns report gave his program only a 25 percent chance of succeeding.
Many Wall Street economists have called Mr. Cavallo's proposed tinkering with the currency peg a distraction that might actually undermine the competitiveness of Argentine goods on world markets if the euro rises in value. And they say his loosening of bank reserve requirements risks destabilizing the banking system. 
"Domingo Cavallo is like a death-row inmate, desperately seeking a stay of execution to stay alive for one more day," Walter Molano, head of economic and financial research for BCP Securities, wrote to his clients this week. "The capital markets will remain closed until Argentina restructures its debt." 
Mr. Cavallo's go-go style and upbeat talk have clearly succeeded on one front: dispelling perceptions that the government of President Fernando de la Rua was paralyzed, uncreative and incapable of rousing the country out of a three-year recession. But even if Mr. Cavallo has halted the downward spiral of Argentine consumer confidence, there is little evidence yet that the economy is responding.
"There are no signs in sight of an improvement in consumption," Roberto Alemann, a former economy minister, said this week. 
The government reported this week that tax revenue fell more than 9 percent in April from April last year, suggesting that the economy was continuing its slide and that a growing number of companies were suspending tax payments rather than borrow more money from banks as interest rates rise. The decline in tax revenue came despite a new tax on financial transactions, intended by Mr. Cavallo to stem tax evasion and help push the budget deficit below $6.5 billion, as the I.M.F. requires.
Argentina had to postpone a $750 million bond sale last week because of soaring interest rates, raising doubts internationally about whether the country can make an estimated $23 billion in interest payments this year.
Bank deposits in April declined by $2 billion, after a $3 billion drop in March, suggesting that a growing number of Argentines are moving their savings abroad. 
Mr. Cavallo is basing his hopes for a recovery on making it cheaper for companies to step up production, employment and exports, while cutting government spending by $1 billion this year and addressing the debt-service problem by fighting tax evasion. He, meanwhile, hopes to use his considerable persuasive powers to keep raising consumer confidence.
After being granted many of the extraordinary powers he sought from Congress, he has raised tariffs on consumer goods and put a tax on check-writing to raise revenue quickly. But over the longer term, Mr. Cavallo still promises a more supply-side approach to invigorating the economy, with cuts in payroll taxes and business income taxes. Eventually, he promises a complete retooling of the tax system, moving to reliance on simple value-added and income taxes.
So far, though, no matter what he has tried, prices of Argentine bonds and stocks have kept tumbling, and interest rates have kept rising.
"You see lots of investor advice saying 'underweight Argentina,' " Mr. Cavallo said. "We're trying to convince investors, but obviously we haven't convinced them yet. But I am optimistic that as soon as consumer optimism recuperates, growth will revive and economic prospects will improve."
Mr. Cavallo's ratings in opinion polls remain high, far better than those of President De la Rua and other political leaders. But his image in the media is beginning to falter. And if the political cartoons on the covers of weekly magazines here are any guide, he may already be running out of time. In his opening weeks, he was portrayed as the puppeteer who held Mr. De la Rua by the strings on his lap. Lately, he has been depicted as the emperor with no clothes.

HEADLINE: What, Us Worry?; 
Layoff: A Spring Break For Some In the Dot-Com Generation

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 4 

 BODY:
Until he was laid off in February, Andrew H. Way oversaw customer service and some sales operations at an Internet company, an $85,000-a-year job that demanded 12-hour days. But lately, since moving to Seattle, he has centered his life around snowboarding in the nearby Cascade Mountains, where he plans to spend the summer hiking and fishing.
 Mr. Way is desperately trying to recapture his youth -- at 28. 
 He had intended to take it easy after college and work part time, he said, but was instead caught in an economic whirlwind. "I'd say, 'Whoa, what just happened?' " Mr. Way recalled of his corporate odyssey. "Two years of my life just went by, and I've got shirts with buttons and pants that are ironed and I'm working like an adult." He added, "I just sort of stepped away from myself for three and a half years." 
Mr. Way was part of the wave of young, educated immigrants to the Bay Area who were courted and loved, seemingly unconditionally, by employers during the dot-com boom. With that courtship now abruptly ended, workers who were laid off by the tens of thousands are dealing with being jilted in different ways -- some looking for work, others exploring how to pay debt they accrued.
But despite an economy that continues to deteriorate -- with layoffs and job losses spreading -- many here express little panic. Indeed, a number of them, like Mr. Way, are instead seeking to hit rewind, or at least pause, on their fast-forward careers. Living on savings they built up during the boom and still unburdened by mortgages or children, they are taking time off, planning extended summer travels and catching their breaths after a dot-com twister that picked them up after college and, just as suddenly, set them back down.
That attitude provokes concern from parents and even some experts who say some young people are being cavalier. Elders who sound the alarm assert that jobs may not be so plentiful or high paying -- or there might even be a full-fledged recession -- by the time those taking extended breaks decide to jump back in.
"They had this extraordinary opportunity to have their fantasy workplace in real life," said John A. Challenger, chief executive at Challenger Gray & Christmas, a Chicago job placement firm that tracks layoffs. Now, Mr. Challenger added, "it's like they're going to go back to the beginning of the tape and start the way most people start when they leave university."
Mr. Challenger's firm reports that dot-com companies announced in April that they would cut about 17,500 jobs, bringing the year's total to 51,500 and already eclipsing last year's total of more than 41,000. The ax will hit the San Francisco Bay Area the hardest. But Mr. Challenger said anecdotal evidence suggested that many younger people who had been laid off were approaching the news "very blithely," an attitude he attributed to the fact they have never experienced a downturn before.
Indeed, he and others who are more cautious are preaching to a generation whose opinions are informed by a life of tip-top economic times. For those in their 20's, their occupational lives have been characterized by uninterrupted demand. During the last downturn, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, their big worries involved acne and curfew, and many cannot fathom the thought of a prolonged economic slide.
"My dad's definitely got a different outlook," said Jeff S. Merrick, 25, who was laid off April 12 and recently left on a monthlong vacation to Costa Rica, stretching a 10-day trip he had planned. "When I said I was extending the trip, his first words were: 'A month? Don't you have to look for a job?' "
The younger Mr. Merrick, who was Mr. Way's roommate in San Francisco, might be forgiven for disagreeing with his father given his rapid career ascent. He graduated from the University of Montana in 1998 with a business degree, but got his first job offer six months before graduation; he was hired by Andersen Consulting to work in the Bay Area.
He spent 22 months at Andersen, now named Accenture, in a $35,000-a-year job, before he decided he wanted to expand his "roles and responsibilities." There was no dearth of places willing to let him do so. He said he could have his pick of "probably 10 different jobs." Ultimately, he took a position as a consultant at Electron Economy, a software consulting company in Cupertino that paid $65,000 a year. The job also required him to commute 40 minutes each way. 
He is now in Central America with his girlfriend, Kelly S. Lack, who was laid off on March 30 from a company called ZipReality.com, an online real estate broker where she earned around $65,000 as a marketing-communications manager. Ms. Lack, 25, said the timing of their respective layoffs "couldn't have been better."
Ms. Lack asserted that the layoffs were forcing her and her peers to relax. "My generation is so regimented -- we went through school, got jobs," said Ms. Lack, who had a job waiting upon graduation from the University of California at Berkeley in 1997. "These layoffs are good because they're teaching us to let go."
Echoing sentiments of others of her generation, Ms. Lack said her layoff was "kind of a relief." Indeed, some of those people laid off said they knew the hammer was coming down, leaving them with two overriding questions: exactly when would they be laid off, and how much severance would they get? Ms. Lack got two weeks of vacation, on the stingy side as dot-com severance goes, and is using some of the $5,000 to $10,000 of savings she set aside to carry her to a new job.
Mr. Merrick, who got 10 weeks of severance pay, said the time was ripe for a break. "At this stage in life, with a lack of responsibility, with no family or kids to worry about, if you're smart and saved up," he said, "you should definitely take advantage of this opportunity." Not that he was turning a blind eye to fun while he worked: last year, he managed to go on vacation in New Zealand and Australia, fish in Alaska and helicopter ski in Canada.
Mr. Merrick plans to take a bit more time off when he returns, then start looking for a new job. "I'm definitely not looking for a 30 percent increase -- I'm looking at realistically making $70,000 to $75,000," he said of his job requirements. "There are definitely jobs out there that offer that."
Mr. Challenger, the job placement executive, while saying such aspirations may be unrealistic, conceded that economic conditions could sparkle again. The Bay Area and California economies are still surprisingly strong. In March, the first month that the number of jobs fell nationwide, California added 57,000 jobs, 2,000 of them in Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley. Though the county's unemployment rate rose slightly, to 2.2 percent, it remains at nearly full employment.
"It looks more and more like it was a bubble, but we don't know that for sure," Mr. Challenger said, adding that a lot of people of the older generation are saying that younger people "are going to get their comeuppance, but who knows?"
Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, said evidence suggested that well-educated, skilled workers were still in demand. "There is not really a recession for highly skilled people," he said. "The market for college graduates, even with dot-com volatility, is enormously strong."
This is just as it was when Mr. Way graduated from the University of Montana in 1997 and dove into the job market, in spite of himself. After he graduated, he traveled around the country for a year, then returned home to the Seattle area, where he intended to fish, hike and water ski. To support his outdoor habits and free his afternoons for play, he took a $10-an-hour job at Amazon.com, working from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. (He could leave at 1 p.m., he said, if he didn't take lunch).
But Amazon had other plans for him. Within 14 months, the company had given him four promotions, and he wound up in a $33,000-a-year position, working 12-hour days. Not only did his leisure time wane, he said he got caught up in the "addictive" pace of work, and eventually decided to leave Amazon because he did not feel there was sufficient room for advancement.
Mr. Way then moved to Missoula to take a position at a dot-com operated by friends, who soon relocated Mr. Way to San Francisco. In March of last year, living in San Francisco and frustrated in his work for the Montana-based company, which provided local entertainment information and news for Web sites, he again went job hunting and found opportunities bountiful.
"I was offered a job at 11 or 12 places," he said, noting that a standard part of the courtship ritual was for the companies to "push their A-list of V.C. firms" at him. He took a position at Buylink, an Internet company aimed at marrying makers of wholesale goods with retail stores, whose venture capitalist backers included the marquee firm Hummer Winblad.
Mr. Merrick, and a third roommate in their three-bedroom house five minutes' drive from the ocean, fared equally well. "You should have seen our house when we were living there during our prime," Mr. Way recalled. "The house was chock full of surfboards, five pairs of skis, snowboards, surfboards, windsurfing gear. We had three nice, nice cars parked outside."
But it came crashing down just as quickly. Mr. Way said Buylink was burning through its funds -- the company had acquired $5 million in venture-capital-backed financing in April last year. In February, Mr. Way became one of the company's layoff casualties.
"I definitely had some strong emotional ties there," he said, adding of the company: "It's devastating to think it's not going to work."
Mr. Way's misery had company, as the layoff bug hit the household hard. All three residents lost their jobs this year because of cost cuts. They jokingly refer to being laid off as getting a visit from "the can man."
These days, Mr. Way is working part time at a camping store, earning $7 an hour, so he can spend his free time playing in the mountains and reading. He said he was enjoying his downtime but he did have some trepidation about the future. He fears that when he and his peers decide to work again, the opportunities will be a lot less lucrative than they were during the boom.
"I was way ahead of myself in terms of actual salary," he said. "I realize I won't make that until I'm 40 or 45 -- you know what I mean? There aren't that many $75,000-a-year marketing manager jobs available."
It's amazing, he said, "what people in their mid- to late 20's expect now out of a job."
Mr. Way, despite his concerns that he may face a salary cut, is not willing to test the premise just yet. He plans to spend the summer fishing and hiking -- just as he had hoped to three years ago, before the boom came along. "I'm doing all the things," he said, "I was doing before."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
More Bad News, and the Stock Markets Are Happy to Hear It

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
As investors struggled to interpret a surprisingly negative report on unemployment, stocks dropped sharply early yesterday morning but quickly completed a somersault and posted fresh gains.
 Investors this week learned to love, or at least to live with, bad news, and the major gauges posted modest gains for the week as analysts began to anticipate somewhat more aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. 
 The reversal in the market, which was completed by 11 a.m., reflected deep divisions in perceptions of the economy's state and what, if anything, the Fed could do about it.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 154.59 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,951.24, near its high for the year of 10,983.63, reached on Feb. 1. The Nasdaq composite index rose 45.33 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,191.53, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 18.03 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,266.61. 
"We're at this seemingly anomalous situation where stocks rise on bad news," said David G. Dietze, president of Point View Financial Services, a money management firm in Summit, N.J.
The bad news came at 8:30 a.m., when the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate climbed to 4.5 percent last month after the elimination of 223,000 more jobs from American business payrolls. The reported loss was the largest one-month decline since February 1991.
While regular trading had not yet begun, S.& P. 500 futures contracts, which are traded throughout the night, almost exclusively by professional money managers, fell 1.4 percent immediately, moving below 1,240 from 1,255. The contracts stayed below 1,240 until about 9:30 a.m.
Soon after, when the stock market opened, the S.& P. 500-stock index started just below 1,240 as well. But stock prices climbed quickly, and the prices of futures contracts followed.
Though analysts offered various explanations for the quick turnabout, perhaps none seemed as telling as a series of notes issued by Merrill Lynch, which did a quick turnaround of its own. In a note issued to clients just before 9:30 a.m., the firm's economists wrote that the economy was "beginning to look recessionary." 
Less than an hour later, the same firm wrote that "after further consideration, we are not, at this point, moving to a recession forecast."
Bruce Steinberg, Merrill's chief economist, said the apparent reversal was a result of an error by a person who tried to summarize his oral remarks, but that the whole incident "was a good reminder of what happened to the market this morning."
Treasury bond prices fell on the jobs data. The 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, to 98 15/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.20 percent. The 30-year bond fell 15/32, to 95 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.67 percent from 5.63 percent.
After viewing the jobs data, several analysts said they expected the Fed to lower interest rates by an additional half-point when it meets on May 15. They had previously expected a quarter-point cut.
If that perception drove stock prices higher, investors reacted oddly because a cut of a quarter-point more than previously expected "shouldn't have nearly as much of a difference on the economy as it made in one day," said Owen B. Fitzpatrick, who oversees $8 billion in stocks for the private banking group at Deutsche Bank's Bankers Trust unit.
Several analysts said the market's movement reflected a split between investors who thought interest rate cuts would soon revive corporate earnings and those who thought a recession in earnings would seep increasingly further into the economy's underpinnings.
Many money managers who have increased the cash levels of their portfolios now fear that the market has reached a bottom and that they will miss out on rising prices, some analysts said.
As optimism about the economy won the day, stocks that are sensitive to economic trends rose. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing gained $2.24, or 1.9 percent, to $119.99. J. P. Morgan Chase gained $1.60, or 3.27 percent, to $50.60. 
Microsoft rose $2.22, or 3.24 percent, to $70.75, and I.B.M. rose $2.16, or 1.9 percent, to $115.86. 
While some investors may have panicked the moment the jobs report was issued, a different sort of panic set in as the day wore on, the kind that has become increasingly common as investors have begun flinching less at bad news.
David Henwood, chief investment officer for Raymond James & Associates, described that kind of panic: "I didn't buy tech when it was cheap. People are telling me the lows are in place, and you've got to use weakness to establish positions, and you can't sit on money when the market is moving."

HEADLINE: Pivotal Senators Find Flaws In Fine Print of Budget Plan 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4 

 BODY:
When Republican lawmakers return to the Capitol next week, they may find that the budget agreement they worked out with the White House this week is not the done deal they thought it was when they left for the weekend.
 Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, the leader of a group of 13 other Democrats and 2 Republicans who hold the balance of power on the budget in the Senate, told associates today that he had just read the fine print of the measure adopted by Senate and House conferees and that he was dissatisfied with the way one section on tax cuts was written. 
 "There is a great deal of concern that the conference report does not meet the terms and conditions he had agreed to," Mr. Breaux's spokeswoman, Bette Phelan, said. 
One of the Republicans in Mr. Breaux's group, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, was said to be unhappy that the negotiators had dropped from the final agreement $225 billion in additional allotments for education. "He has deep concerns," said Mr. Jeffords's spokesman, Erik Smulson. "Right now, you'd have to put him in the leaning-against category."
Without the support of Mr. Breaux and Mr. Jeffords, the agreement would probably be defeated in the evenly divided Senate.
The Senate and House had planned to vote on the agreement on Thursday. But the measure became snagged over technicalities before a final version could be printed. 
About 8 p.m. Thursday, the Senate decided to postpone its final vote until next week. And the House did likewise at about 1:30 this morning when two of the printed pages in the measure turned out to be missing because of a clerical error.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Breaux met with Republican leaders and was persuaded that the final version, still unprinted at this point, was precisely what he had agreed to -- $1.25 trillion in tax cuts in the 2002 fiscal year through the 2011 fiscal year, and an additional $100 billion in immediate tax reductions in the 2001 fiscal year (which ends Sept. 30) and in the 2002 fiscal year.
The understanding was that the $100 billion would be designed to stimulate the economy and that it would affect what taxpayers owed on the income they earned in this calendar year.
After the meeting, Mr. Breaux said he was "on board" with the Republican leaders.
But this morning, Mr. Breaux told associates, he read the printed version and learned that the $100 billion could be spread out over 11 years, although the measure stated that it was the sense of the Congress that it should be used in the 2001 and 2002 fiscal years. Mr. Breaux said he would insist on more precise language before votes were cast next week.
The section Mr. Breaux objects to was written by House negotiators, said Robert G. Stevenson, communications director for the Senate Budget Committee. "We have been talking with Mr. Breaux, and we'll continue to have conversations with him," Mr. Stevenson said.
Mr. Breaux's concern involved the tax aspects of the agreement, but other senators like Mr. Jeffords are concerned that the spending level for the next fiscal year is too low.
Initially, the House approved a 4 percent increase in spending -- what President Bush requested -- for the one-third of the budget outside interest on the debt and automatic benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. This money would go for everything from schools to battleships. The Senate raised the figure to more than 8 percent, and the Republican negotiators compromised at 5 percent.
But on Thursday night, to resolve a jurisdictional dispute in the House, lawmakers decided to exclude nearly $6 billion allocated for emergencies like natural disasters.
There is little practical effect. Money for emergencies has never been part of the budget before and has always been spent as needed.
But the political effect was to bring the spending level down to a 4 percent increase over this year, making it appear that the president got exactly what he wanted.

HEADLINE: New Protests In Old Conflict With Vietnam; 
The Montagnards Bring Their Fight to New York

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
There was an anti-Vietnam protest in New York yesterday.
 Even before the conflict the Vietnamese call "the American War" sucked in a generation of young soldiers from the United States -- a war brought back to attention in recent days by Bob Kerrey and his memories of a 1969 raid on a village in the Mekong Delta -- a group of independent people in the Central Highlands of Vietnam made the fateful decision to side with the Americans against Hanoi and communism. 
 "It wasn't a mistake; it was the right thing to do," said Rong Nay, 55, who took part yesterday in a round of demonstrations against what he described as Hanoi's unending persecution and discrimination against the Montagnards -- a minority of 700,000 isolated people from at least five ethnic tribes in a country of more than 77 million, mostly ethnic Vietnamese. "During the war we fought alongside each other like brothers," he said of the American soldiers, who called their tribal buddies 'yards. 
The Montagnards (pronounced mohn-tahn-YARDS), or "mountain people" in the language of colonial France, were always scrappy. They didn't like the Americans' allies, the South Vietnamese, either, but that side seemed the lesser of two evils. All the Montagnards wanted was to be left alone in the chilly, dense green hills. When Hanoi's army took over the South in 1975, that hope disappeared. Mr. Nay went underground -- or, more accurately, into the forest -- and became deputy commander of a long, fruitless rebellion against Hanoi before fleeing Vietnam for the United States in the 1980's.
But why should the Montagnard rebellion resurface on the streets of New York this week?
Blame globalization.
Vietnam is a big coffee exporter and plantations are spreading into the highlands, flattening forests and taking over land that the Montagnards consider ancestral territory. In February, more than 20,000 people from tribal groups around Buon Ma Thuot staged the largest antigovernment demonstrations in Vietnam since the country's unification, prompting a military crackdown. More Montagnards fled Vietnam into neighboring Cambodia. Some of them arrived in this country only weeks ago after being hustled out of Cambodia by the United Nations high commissioner for refugees.
For the Montagnards who came to America, the adjustments have been difficult. But because they know that Hanoi is seeking American investment, about 300 Montagnard exiles boarded buses in North Carolina, where many of them live, and headed for the American Stock Exchange.
They want Americans to boycott the robusta coffee of Vietnam, which is generally known for its coarse flavor and often used for instant blends, and withhold investments that ultimately could endanger more minority livelihoods. They held up handmade signs in Chinese, Vietnamese, French and English -- a catalog of their past -- and played flutes and sang songs in their Rade language.
"I have nothing against coffee," said Y-Bin Enuol, 37. "I just want my land back so the plantations will belong to us."
H'Go Eban, 45, was marveling that in a few short weeks she had found her way to the heart of capitalism from the hills of Vietnam to keep the fight alive. "I am at peace here," she said, to the din of traffic on Trinity Place.
Next, on a day with weather a little like Saigon's in the summer, the Montagnards moved on to the United Nations to demand recognition as an endangered people -- they are thought to be the hill region's earliest settlers, of Mon-Khmer and Malay-Polynesian descent -- and finally to Vietnam's diplomatic mission to demonstrate for equal rights to land, education and, if necessary, emigration.
The Montagnards have other grievances that predate the encroachment of plantations, the demonstrators said. After the army of North Vietnam overran the South in 1975, Hanoi began to set up new economic zones to resettle people from overpopulated regions of a country with little land to spare. The Montagnards, who also call themselves the Dega people, began to be pushed higher into less hospitable land. Most of them were Christians: Roman Catholics converted by the French or Protestants won over by American missionaries, among them evangelicals who have been singled out by the government.
"After '75, we didn't have the right to live," said Nem, 42, who fled Vietnam last month and did not want to identify himself fully because some of his family members are also planning an escape.
"Our churches were closed and we had to worship at home," he said through a translator. "They brought in a million people to occupy our land. The security is very tight. The Vietnamese do not trust the Montagnards. But we do not plan to overthrow the government. We only want our rights."
Hanoi has its own set of problems with them. From the early 1960's, some of the Montagnards were being recruited and trained by the United States Central Intelligence Agency. Although the American government abandoned them to their fate after the fall of Saigon and began to admit them as refugees only after 1986, they are still supported by American veterans and civilian-aid officials who worked with them more than 25 years ago, making them suspect in Hanoi's eyes. In fact, veterans of the Special Forces have helped the Montagnards plan the New York demonstrations. There were some Green Berets on gray heads in the crowd yesterday.
After the protests around Buon Ma Thuot in February, Vietnam warned other organizations and pro-democracy dissidents, including intellectuals in the hill country city of Dalat, not to sympathize with the Montagnards. Protests stopped.
Kay Reibold, who runs the Vietnam Highlands Assistance Project at Lutheran Family Services in Raleigh, N.C. -- which has resettled hundreds of Montagnards in the United States -- said that the Vietnamese government has made it difficult to assist them in the highlands.
On Thursday, the Vietnamese government sharply criticized an American panel's recommendation that Congress not ratify a trade pact with Vietnam until the rights of all religious groups were recognized. The panel, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, said earlier this week that Hanoi should be asked to free dissidents and restore religious sites to the churches. 
Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper, Nan Dhan, countered by saying that it was the United States, not Vietnam, that was guilty of "mistakes and crimes," as proved by the case of Mr. Kerrey, the former United States Senator from Nebraska, now the president of New School University, who acknowledged recently that civilians were killed in a raid he led on the village of Thanh Phong in South Vietnam in 1969.
But Vietnam, trying to become part of the world economy, may no longer be able to escape the international human rights scrutiny that often accompanies globalization. 
The demonstrations yesterday came a week after another group of Vietnamese exiles living in several countries and young Vietnamese-Americans met with a United Nations human rights official, Goro Onogima, to talk about the plight of religious leaders and democracy advocates in Vietnam, and to ask for the appointment of a special envoy to monitor human rights there.
Vanessa Bui, of the Vietnamese Culture and Sciences Association, went to last week's meeting to plead for attention to the problems of intellectuals. She said that more than a quarter-century after the fall of Saigon, writers and thinkers were still "in and out of hard-labor camps."
The Rev. Le Huu Nguyen, a Roman Catholic priest who is executive director of the International Committee for Religious Freedom in Vietnam, said his goal was "to raise concern about the oppression and persecution of all religions in our country."
He was joined in the delegation last week by the Venerable Dr. Trich An Hue of the Vietnamese American Unified Buddhist Congress, Chau Nguyen of the Hoa Hao Buddhist sect and the Rev. Liem Thanh Nguyen of the Cao Dai movement.
And Pham Dinh De, president of the National Vietnamese-American Voters League, brought documentation on arbitrary arrest and detention from the State Department's annual human rights report to argue his case. "All the Vietnamese people need help," he said.
After their protest at the United Nations yesterday, some of the Montagnards, whose budget did not allow for a New York City hotel stay, bought hot dogs from a nearby street vendor. Others ate food that they had brought from North Carolina. Then they boarded the bus and settled in for the long ride home.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the Montagnards, a group of ethnic minorities formerly allied with the United States and now protesting their treatment by the Vietnamese government, misstated the name of a Buddhist leader who recently met with a United Nations official to discuss religious persecution in Vietnam. He was Dr. Thich An Hue of the Vietnamese American Unified Buddhist Congress, not Trich An Hue.
An article on Saturday about the Montagnards, former allies of the United States who are protesting their treatment by the Vietnamese government, misspelled the name of the Communist Party newspaper that responded to their charges. It is Nhan Dan, not Nan Dhan.

HEADLINE: In Racketeering Trial, Well-Dressed Strip Club Takes the Stage 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 4 

 BODY:
For 14 years, the Gold Club has been the destination of choice for a restless segment of the city's huge convention business, clusters of boisterous men footloose in the city and eager to spend those precious evenings away from home in the company of nude dancers and expensive cigars. Shuttle buses to the club leave regularly from the city's best hotels.
 Starting next week, however, the city's more adventurous tourists may just as well ask their concierge to direct them to the federal courthouse downtown, where arguments in the Gold Club racketeering trial will begin after 18 months of legal preparation. 
 For pure salaciousness and dark intrigue, the trial is likely to rival anything that goes on in the private back rooms of the club itself. 
Over most of the summer, federal prosecutors will try to prove that the club was a cash conduit to the Gambino organized-crime family of New York, which they say provided protection in exchange. The club and its owner, Steven E. Kaplan, overcharged and double-billed the credit cards of unsuspecting customers, according to a federal grand-jury indictment issued in November 1999, adding to the unreported income of Mr. Kaplan and the Gambino family.
And most provocatively, the government charged that the club's dancers were ordered by their employers to provide sexual services to a long list of professional athletes and other celebrities whose presence at the club helped raise its profile. In one example of what the grand jury called organized prostitution, the indictment said the club flew several of its dancers to Charleston, S.C., in the spring of 1997 to perform a "lesbian sex show" and have sex with members of a professional basketball team. 
Lawyers involved in the case say the government's witness list is likely to include professional athletes like Patrick Ewing, Dennis Rodman, Terrell Davis and Jamal Anderson, among many others. None of the athletes are charged with a crime -- no money is alleged to have changed hands in the sexual transactions -- but last month Judge Willis E. Hunt Jr. of United States District Court ruled that testimony regarding sexual activity at the club was admissible whether or not it constituted prostitution. The ruling all but guaranteed that the witness list would resemble a box score or a gossip column, supplemented by dancers who may identify their private clientele.
Another possible witness is John A. Gotti, who federal investigators say was the acting head of the Gambino family after his father, John J. Gotti, was imprisoned for life, and before he himself was imprisoned in 1999 for racketeering and extortion. The younger Mr. Gotti, who prosecutors said was a friend of Mr. Kaplan's, was transferred from upstate New York to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta on April 25, but prosecutors will not confirm that they intend to call him as a witness.
The seven defendants in this initial trial from the indictment -- who include Mr. Kaplan, several colleagues and an Atlanta police officer -- have pleaded not guilty and hired some of the city's best-known and most ferocious defense lawyers. The defense team said the government had built its case on untrustworthy criminals and denied any ties to organized crime. On Monday, the lawyers began asking potential jurors their opinions about prostitution and the HBO show "The Sopranos," and Judge Hunt has already suggested that testimony could continue through Labor Day.
A Mafia-themed trial like this one, commonplace in the Northeast, is a novelty in Atlanta, never an underworld hotbed. It has generated enormous local interest, with newspaper and television accounts of every legal move. (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Web site offers to e-mail readers regular trial updates.) A doorman at the club said the publicity had significantly increased business, and the seven lawyers involved do not seem to mind the attention.
"In 20 years of practicing here, I can't think of any case in Atlanta that's ever involved New York Mafia allegations," said Donald F. Samuel, a prominent local defense lawyer who is representing Larry Gleit of Dix Hills, N.Y., the club's financial officer. "It's not a typical Georgia case. Of course, my client and Kaplan are just nice Jewish boys from Long Island."
The case has also shed light on Atlanta's growing distinction as a capital of the nude-dancing industry. The city's 22 "gentlemen's clubs" rival in number only those of Miami and Houston, thriving on Atlanta's convention business and its political tolerance. While Northeastern cities have struggled to restrict sex businesses, the industry has grown unfettered in many Bible Belt areas, and Atlanta is by far the largest city that allows alcohol to be served in bars where full nudity takes place.
"Yes, God bless them for that," said Don Waitt, publisher of Exotic Dancer magazine, an industry publication. "And it's got good weather. A lot of dancers don't want to live in places like Milwaukee."
With few other major attractions to entertain them, conventioneers in the city descend on the clubs each evening in taxicabs and shuttle vans, dropping tens of millions of dollars a year into the city's economy. At the Gold Club, a hulking black structure in Midtown with two gold lions by the door alongside a somewhat more menacing security staff, limousines and expensive cars pull up to the valet parking entrance in an unending stream. While other clubs have developed a more blue-collar clientele, the Gold Club has worked to attract celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment, hoping that lesser-known dance enthusiasts would follow. Much of the trial will be devoted to describing just how important such business was.
"It's sort of like the Studio 54 effect," a former employee of Mr. Kaplan's told the grand jury, according to a transcript obtained by The Journal-Constitution. "The more the word went out on the street, the more people wanted to come to your club."

HEADLINE: In Rockland Suburb, Deep Racial Change Melts Into the Everyday 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: HILLCREST, N.Y., May 4 

 BODY:
In the 1960s, this unassuming bedroom community in Rockland County attracted secular Jews from Brooklyn and the Bronx. They liked the affordable starter homes, the suburban hush and the bearable commute. In the 1990s, Hillcrest attracted immigrants from Asia and the Caribbean, often by way of Brooklyn or the Bronx. They liked the affordable starter homes, the suburban hush and the bearable commute.
 The changes in Hillcrest and in the composition of the Rockland County communities nearby reflect the increasing heterogeneity of suburban areas once assumed to be overwhelmingly white. But the shifts also show how racial change, particularly in sprawling suburbs, can occur not just relatively amicably but sometimes without attracting much notice. 
 Hillcrest lost a greater percentage of whites in the 1990s than any other place in New York, and since 1980 it has gone from almost all white to only one-fifth white. Hillcrest now has Rockland's highest percentage of African-Americans and Asians, plus a growing number of Hispanic residents, making it one of the state's most diverse communities. 
The change is news to many of the people living here, though.
"No -- no, the census is lying, the census is lying," insisted Winston Dyke, 68, a Jamaican immigrant and retired businessman who moved to the area 33 years ago. "I thought Hillcrest was predominantly white."
To be sure, some of the whites who left Hillcrest were fleeing nonwhites, some residents say. But other residents say those who left were a hard-working group of pioneers who either died, retired to Florida or sought roomier expanses. And residents credit local institutions with embracing, not resisting, diversity in a place that lost 52 percent of its white population in the 1990s.
"I think it happened nonchalantly," said Ryan S. Karben, the Democratic majority leader of the Rockland County Legislature who grew up in Hillcrest and now lives in nearby New Hempstead. "I don't know that there's a way to identify some specific explanation other than the people who were moving into the community shared the same fundamental values of the people already living there."
Perhaps one of the reasons Hillcrest has managed to evolve so significantly yet anonymously is that it is not a city, or a town, or even a village. Instead, it is an unincorporated hamlet of 1.3 square miles and 7,106 people in the Town of Ramapo, almost entirely lacking an institutional structure of its own.
Even within Ramapo, Hillcrest is often overlooked. To the south is Spring Valley, a diverse hub grappling with overcrowded housing, drugs and economic redevelopment, while to the southwest and northeast, respectively, are the Orthodox and Hasidic enclaves of Monsey and New Square.
The Hillcrest Fire Company on Route 45, the main drag here, is one of the area's most notable institutions. Across the highway, the businesses in the Hillcrest Plaza shopping center have labels instead of names, with signs like "Nail Salon" and "Bagels." Most of the mail bound for Hillcrest, N.Y., 10977, is addressed to Spring Valley, one of five places with the same zip code.
Hillcrest first attracted attention in the early 1900s as a summer retreat accessible by train for working-class families from New York City, about 30 miles away. The Tappan Zee Bridge was built in 1955, increasing traffic and easing access to New York City. Hillcrest added hundreds of single-family houses, mostly inexpensive Cape Cods or split-levels on small lots. Many secular Jews were among that wave of settlers, said Craig H. Long, Ramapo's official historian.
In 1980, 84 percent of Hillcrest's population was white, while blacks accounted for only 7 percent. Since then, the proportion of whites has dropped to 21 percent, while the number of black residents jumped ninefold, to 49 percent of the total. The number of Asians, meanwhile, has grown by more than 260 percent and Hispanics by 366 percent.
According to real estate agents and residents, no single factor or event contributed to this demographic change. Many people moved because their children grew up and left, or because they wanted to pay lower taxes for more land. But some also did not like the racial diversity, said Simone Desvarieux, a broker with All Century Realty.
"They didn't say it, but you could feel it," said Ms. Desvarieux, a Haitian immigrant.
Fifteen years ago, about 15 percent of Ms. Desvarieux's clients were immigrants; now, about 80 percent are immigrants, mostly from Haiti, Jamaica, India, the Philippines or Latin America.
Many newcomers have moved from New York City, lured by $225,000 houses that would probably sell for $300,000 elsewhere in the county. Many are first-time homeowners eager to keep their neighborhoods tidy and who hold jobs as teachers, taxi drivers, subway conductors and store managers in New York City, New Jersey, Westchester or Rockland.
Ramon Gonzalez, 48, is Puerto Rican, works as a mechanic and lives on a block of East Hickory Street that epitomizes Hillcrest's transformation. In 1990, he left the Bronx so that he could buy his first house. Back then, most of his neighbors were longtime homesteaders or Jews who had moved in after the 1960s; now, they are mostly Haitians, Filipinos and Indians.
"Everybody, we get along," Mr. Gonzalez said. "We all do our spring cleaning. It's like a chain reaction."
Thelma DeGuzman, 39, immigrated directly from the Philippines 10 years ago, joining relatives already in the area. She saw immediately that Hillcrest differed from her expectations of an American suburb.
"I thought there were only tall white people, because of what I see in the movies," said Ms. DeGuzman, a nursing aide. "But then I said, 'Oh, my God! This is like the Philippines! So many Filipinos!' " 
Some Roman Catholics, including Mr. Gonzalez and Ms. DeGuzman, belong to the ever-expanding St. Joseph's Church in Spring Valley, which now offers 13 masses in five languages, said the Rev. Rudolph Gonzalez, the church's pastor.
Local businesses sell Haitian, Chinese and Filipino newspapers. Two Indian-owned groceries on Eckerson Road rent out hundreds of videotapes from India. At Soun Sun Nhem's Asian Food Market, customers can buy phone cards for the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Haiti, Mexico and Guatemala. The kosher deli is gone now, but Hillcrest still has more than the usual suburban fare of pizza and Chinese takeout -- residents can also eat at Vietnamese, Salvadoran or Colombian restaurants.
The town government has celebrated its diversity, which is something that cannot be said for many suburbs, said John Brunson, an African-American businessman who moved here from the Bronx in 1995 and is now president of the new Hillcrest Neighborhood Preservation Association.
Three years ago, Ramapo began organizing a series of celebrations, called Heritage Nights, to honor its residents' native cultures. For 10 years, the town has supported student exchange programs with towns in Ireland, Italy, Israel, the Philippines, India and Ghana and has printed brochures in different languages.
"If you put a mirror up in Town Hall, it'll reflect our community," said Christopher St. Lawrence, the Ramapo town supervisor.
Yet, the diversity has presented its share of challenges, too. In the East Ramapo Central School District, ethnic minorities make up 82 percent of the student body. More than 50 nationalities are represented in the schools. As a result, it is a constant challenge to educate new immigrants and minimize cultural clashes, said the superintendent, Jason P. Friedman.
At a youth counseling center here, most teenagers seeking help in the 1980s were white and battling drugs or alcohol problems. Now many are immigrants torn by cultural differences over issues such as parental supervision and corporal punishment, said the Rev. George R. Doering Jr., the center's director.
Still, most residents seem genuinely surprised and grateful that Hillcrest has changed so much with so little fuss -- so far.
"Isn't that something? I thought there were more whites," said Julius Graifman, 74, who is white and who moved to Hillcrest 38 years ago from the Bronx. "But that's O.K., we celebrate our diversity here. And besides, the people who moved in wound up being better neighbors than the ones who left."

 BODY:
Jobless Rate Continued Its Ascent in April, to 4.5%
The unemployment rate, which has been inching up since a low of 3.9 percent in October, rose again in April to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent in March.
 The work force fell last month by an estimated 223,000 jobs on top of a loss of 53,000 jobs the previous month, the Labor Department reported. The back-to-back job losses indicated to some analysts that the already sluggish economy has become even weaker and may be nearing, or even in, a recession. Page A1. 

Writers and Studios Reach a Pact
Negotiators for Hollywood's film and television writers reached a tentative agreement on a new three-year contract with the major studios and networks that will, if approved by the union's members, avert what was once thought to be an all-but-inevitable strike with the potential to cripple the nation's entertainment industry. A1.

Computer Associates Fixes Error
Computer Associates said a typographical error caused it to overstate its annual profit by more than $130 million last month. The company said that it earned 16 cents a share, or about $90 million, for the year ended March 31, excluding certain charges. On April 16, the company said it earned 40 cents a share, or about $230 million. C2.

A Not-Guilty Plea in Auction Case
A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's, pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court in Manhattan to charges that he and Sir Anthony Tennant, his onetime counterpart at Christie's, colluded to fix the commission fees charged to auction house customers over a six-year period in the 1990's. B12.

$2 Billion Real Estate Combination
Archstone Communities Trust agreed to buy another property manager, Charles E. Smith Residential Realty, for $2.2 billion in stock and $1.4 billion in assumed debt. C3.

'Survivor' Overwhelms Competitors
The finale of "Survivor: The Australian Outback," which revealed Tina Wesson of Tennessee as the winner, overwhelmed its competition Thursday night, averaging more than 36 million viewers. But it did not approach the huge number of viewers the original "Survivor" scored last summer when 51 million tuned in to its final episode. C15.

Malnutrition, second-degree burns, a slaughtered boar, hair falling out in clumps -- all that and still the thrill was gone from the second season of "Survivor." B9.

Brill's to Cut Publishing Schedule
Reversing plans announced a month ago, Brill's Content, the magazine about the media, will not change its name to Inside Content. It will keep its name, said Steven Brill, the magazine's founder. But the magazine, which has been published 10 times a year, will emerge in the fall, after a summer hiatus, as a quarterly magazine. C15.

Shareholders Take Smurfit to Task
At Jefferson Smurfit's annual meeting in Dublin, management came under heavy verbal assault from a new force on the Irish corporate scene: a crowd of shareholders impatient with the company's recent performance. C3.

San Miguel Chairman Avoids Ouster
Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr., chairman of San Miguel, the largest brewer in the Philippines, held off a government bid to oust him at the company's annual shareholders meeting. Mr. Cojuangco, a close friend of both ousted presidents Joseph E. Estrada and Ferdinand E. Marcos, said he was eager to talk with the administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo about how to end a 15-year dispute over who controls 47 percent of San Miguel. C3.

PERSON: John Scanlon 

HEADLINE: John Scanlon, Tenacious Public Relations Consultant for High-Profile Clients, Dies at 66 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
John Scanlon, a public relations man who brought cunning, bare-knuckle tenacity and the nimbleness of a leprechaun to promoting the interests of high-profile clients, including Bob Kerrey in the current controversy over his actions in Vietnam, died yesterday at his Manhattan apartment. He was 66.
 Deborah Hayes, a spokeswoman for Mr. Scanlon's firm, Westhill Partners, said he had had heart attacks in the past and had most likely suffered another. 
 His battles, including defending the CBS program "60 minutes" against libel charges by Gen. William Westmoreland and casting what turned out to be seriously questionable aspersions on the character of a scientist for a tobacco company that he was representing, gave sharply personalized definition to a pervasive phrase: "spin doctor." 
Increasingly, Mr. Scanlon came to define a new, often harsher, certainly more immediate brand of public relations, often termed crisis management. His hardball tactics in trying to beat down a man who blew the whistle against a tobacco company led to an unsympathetic character based on him in the 1999 movie "The Insider." 
Mr. Scanlon kept turning up at the center of media storms. When news broke in February that Jesse Jackson had fathered a child by an unmarried associate and had secretly supported the child, there he was. This week, when not busy with Mr. Kerrey, he has been vigorously polishing the image of A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's auction house, who was indicted on Wednesday on federal price-fixing charges.
He represented Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank accused of keeping, after World War II, hundreds of millions of dollars deposited by Jews. 
"Sometimes you sup with long spoons," he said in an interview with New York magazine in 1997. "This was never an attempt to defend Swiss actions during the war, because they are, in fact, indefensible. But you can walk away from the issue and help nobody, or you can become part of the process of solving things."
He strongly denied that he was a paid liar. "That's not what we do," he told New York magazine. "I mean, we're strategic counselors."
Other public relations consultants, even some who opposed him, admired his skill. Howard J. Rubenstein, who represented Donald J. Trump in his divorce from Mr. Scanlon's client Ivana Trump, said he used his sense of humor to exceptional advantage.
"He once said I had more conflicts of interest than existed in Beirut," he said with a laugh. "But each time he would say something like that, he would say it with a twinkle."
Dan Klores, another public relations executive, said: "He didn't do dog-and-pony shows. He understood the news and how to embrace the media -- and also how to manage difficult clients."
He would often suggest ideas to journalists that were totally unrelated to any paying client, in the belief that the favor might be remembered. 
"He didn't just sell you stories," said John Leo, a columnist for U.S. News & World Report. "He paid attention to what you wrote and what you thought and what your interests were."
At a time when many, perhaps most, journalists are deeply skeptical of paid purveyors of story ideas, the big man with the Hemingway-style beard still managed to be friendly with many. Much of his success stemmed from his larger-than-life personality. He prodigiously entertained, drank, cooked and recited Irish poetry. His musical rendition of a Yeats poem, "The Golden Apples of the Sun," could moisten eyes.
"He consumed 16,000 calories of life a day," said Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair.
One friend, Peter Jennings, the ABC anchor, said he and others learned to separate Mr. Scanlon's fine company from some of his harsher campaigns. "All of his close friends totally disapproved of his tactics," he said.
John Patrick Scanlon was born in Manhattan on Feb. 27, 1935. He grew up in the Bronx, just north of Yankee Stadium. His father worked for the Transit Authority, inspecting the electricity on the third rail. His mother cleaned houses.
He graduated from Catholic University in Washington and spent six years teaching in Roman Catholic schools. He thought about becoming a monk, but balked. "I couldn't take the chaste thing," he told New York.
He then taught at a public high school on Long Island. Wanting more income, he began selling textbooks. He hung out at the Lion's Head bar in Greenwich Village, where he fell in with writers from Commonweal magazine and other publications. He became a full-time activist against the Vietnam War and worked in Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign in 1968.
He then worked as a press spokesman for the city's economic development arm in the Lindsay administration. Next, he worked for Phoenix House, a drug treatment program, as a spokesman. In 1973, he went to work at the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was wrestling with the city's deepening fiscal crisis.
He then began working as public relations consultant, gradually ranging beyond the clients chosen for purely idealistic reasons. When the Rev. Bruce Ritter at Covenant House became embroiled in a sex scandal, Mr. Scanlon was by his side. He fought heated battles against unions for Eastern Airlines and Tavern on the Green restaurant. He was on the side of the Tribune Company in its labor battle with employees of The New York Daily News.
"The thrill of handling the risky client seemed to overtake the thrill of handing the righteous client," the writer Alex Williams suggested in the New York magazine article.
Perhaps his most controversial client was Brown & Williamson, the maker of Kool and Viceroy cigarettes. At the time a grand jury was looking into allegations that the company had conspired to make cigarettes more addictive, Mr. Scanlon passed on to The Wall Street Journal a 500-page dossier on the employee who had blown the whistle, Jeffrey S. Wigand, a chemist.
It backfired. The Journal reported that many allegations were "backed by scanty or contradictory evidence," while others were "demonstrably untrue."
Mr. Scanlon's private life was pleasant. He had a Manhattan apartment; a house in Sag Harbor, N.Y.; and a house in County Westmeath, Ireland. Friends said he had been trying to arrange his life so that he could spend more time in Ireland. 
For years, he served as announcer and chief heckler at the Artists and Writers softball game in East Hampton.
His most treasured possession was a first-edition copy of James Joyce's "Ulysses," and he was a friend of the Irish poet Seamus Heaney. He was a patron of Concern Worldwide, an international relief organization with many Irish-American backers, and, at the time of his death, was writing a book on Ireland with Ed Tivnan.
He is survived by his wife, Julienne; his daughters, Caitlin Scanlon, of Los Angeles; Elizabeth Scanlon Hyman, of San Francisco; and Rebecca Scanlon of Manhattan; his brother, Michael, of Brooklyn; his sister, Mary Pat McDermott, of Manhattan, and one granddaughter.
Mr. Carter suggested Mr. Scanlon's greatest accomplishment was the ancient Irish art of making the language dance. "What he was brilliant at was rhetoric," he said. "He could take a white tennis ball, and, at the end of an hour, make you think it was black."

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the public relations consultant John Scanlon on Saturday misidentified the CBS News unit that he advised in the 1980's on its defense in a libel suit by Gen. William C. Westmoreland. It was "CBS Reports," which made the documentary "The Uncounted Enemy," not "60 Minutes."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK STATE IS SLOW TO SPEND WELFARE WINDFALL 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
Over the last four years, state lawmakers have set aside millions of dollars in unused federal welfare funds for a battery of programs intended to help poor New Yorkers leave the welfare rolls.
 The problem is, just months before Congress is set to debate the next round of state-by-state welfare allocations, more than half of the $1.19 billion that has been accumulating in Albany and was earmarked by the state for specific anti-poverty programs has not left the bank. 
 For example, of more than $53 million earmarked for transportation -- one of the most unyielding barriers to self-sufficiency -- roughly $2 million was spent as of last summer, state figures show. Of the $66 million set aside to provide drug screening and treatment for addicts, roughly $12.5 million was spent. And of the nearly $220 million offered to city and county governments to use for job training programs, just $837,000 was taken. 
State budget officials say the pace of spending has picked up since last summer, when they had used $258 million, or 22 percent, of the $1.19 billion that had piled up since the 1997-98 fiscal year began. A more recent breakdown is not available, but they say they have spent about $270 million more since last summer.
In total dollars, New York and California, with sizable populations of former welfare recipients and sizable leftover funds to draw from, rank highest among states having trouble spending their welfare windfalls. Smaller states, like Vermont, Rhode Island and Delaware, spend their allocations readily. 
But it is not entirely about size: Idaho, a state with a relatively small population, has a large sum of unspent welfare dollars, while Illinois, one of the nation's most populous states, has spent all its federal welfare surplus, the biggest chunk of it on child care.
As a share of its total federal welfare allocation, New York's unspent dollars rank roughly in the middle of all 50 states.
"It's a question of whether states have a strategy for how the money should be spent," said Rich Stolz of the Center for Community Change, a liberal Washington-based research group that published a study on the issue earlier this year.
In New York, state officials say the money has been slow going out the door because it takes time for private groups and government agencies -- at the state, county and local levels -- to create new programs to aid those trying to get off public assistance. Besides, they say, federal officials did not issue regulations spelling out how welfare dollars should be spent until two years ago.
Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the Division of Budget, said getting the programs going, starting with selecting private agencies to provide the services, was very time-consuming. "Service providers needed time to start up their new programs -- programs that had never been undertaken on this magnitude," he said. "It was a total reform of a very complex system."
The radical overhaul of the nation's welfare policies in 1996 handed states lump-sum block grants. It gave them great flexibility on how to spend that money. Since then, New York has spent the bulk of its $9.3 billion grant -- more than $5.4 billion -- on direct cash assistance. But falling welfare rolls have yielded the state a bounty of federal welfare funds. The state turned over the largest chunk of that money -- nearly $1.5 billion -- to the child welfare agency. Millions more went for child care and the Earned Income Tax Credit, a tax break for the working poor. Another $662 million has been set aside as a rainy day reserve fund for anti-poverty programs. 
Pataki administration officials are eager to point out those expenditures, saying that the vast majority of federal welfare monies has been spent. "It's important to look at the whole picture," Mr. Quinn said. 
The money left unspent is earmarked for dozens of transitional programs, from English classes to wage subsidies for hiring welfare recipients to money for car loans, all intended to help New Yorkers get off and stay off welfare.
Critics, many of them Democrats in the State Legislature, argue that spending could be accelerated, if state and local agencies committed to doing that. "It seems to be a real reluctance to spend this money for transitional services for people leaving welfare," said Roger L. Green, a Democratic assemblyman from Brooklyn and the chairman of the Assembly committee on children and families. 
Mr. Green and other critics note that while welfare rolls have plummeted, poverty remains high. Statewide, 24 percent of all children lived below the poverty line in 1998, the most recent statistic available. And advocates for the poor contend that while many local welfare agencies have been eager to trim their rolls, sometimes removing people for failing to meet technicalities in program requirements, they have not been as eager to start programs to lift former welfare families out of poverty.
"There has to be a political will at the local level to spend the money," said Trudi Renwick, a senior economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, an Albany-based research group that tracks state spending. "It's not an entitlement. There are no sanctions for local government."
Lawmakers and advocacy groups worry, too, about how Congress might view the unspent millions when it debates in a few months how much of the welfare block grant -- Temporary Assistance to Needy Families -- will go to New York. 
"If I'm seeing several states that have a lot of TANF money and are not spending that, I'm going to scrutinize that, particularly if other states are clamoring," said Russell Sykes, vice president of the Schuyler Center for Analysis and Advocacy, a private nonprofit group in Albany.
For its part, the Pataki administration points to the state's achievement in cutting the welfare rolls by nearly half in four years, and for devoting its share of federal welfare dollars to anti-poverty programs, like the Earned Income Tax Credit.
Gov. George E. Pataki has already called on Washington to maintain the same level of financing as in 1996 and to raise it slightly to account for inflation. The National Governors Association has also called on Congress not to slash the overall welfare funding levels. The current welfare law gives states great flexibility on what they can spend that money.
There is a dizzying array of programs -- some of them initiated by the Pataki administration, others by members of the Legislature -- on which the money would be spent. There are, for instance, four separate pots of money earmarked for transportation. 
A $57 million initiative called the Wage Subsidy Program was established to help nonprofit groups train welfare recipients and find them jobs. The first contracts for much of that money were awarded two months ago. 
Spending the money has been no easy feat, state officials say. For instance, a $220 million block grant that local municipalities can use for job training has remained practically untouched. The state set aside $70 million of that money for New York City last year. Several months later, the city applied for only about $61 million. It took another six months, state officials said, for the city to submit revisions that satisfied the state. City officials said this week they still have not received the funds. 
For some, the profusion of so many programs, large and small, is part of the problem. "TANF is funding such an array of programs and services," said Mr. Sykes of the Schuyler Center for Analysis and Advocacy. "That's a good thing. But perhaps it's time for a late course correction, particularly as reauthorization is coming up."

HEADLINE: WRITERS IN ACCORD WITH THE STUDIOS 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 4 

 BODY:
Negotiators for Hollywood's film and television writers reached a tentative agreement today on a three-year contract with the major studios and networks that will, if approved by the union's members, avert a strike. Only a few months ago, Hollywood thought that a strike was all but inevitable and that it would have the potential to cripple the entertainment industry.
 Top negotiators for the Writers Guild of America, representing 11,000 film and television writers, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, representing the studios and networks, stood side by side in the guild's offices just south of Hollywood at 3:50 p.m. today to announce the tentative pact -- three days after the previous contract had expired. 
 "This was one of the most difficult negotiations we've had in years because of the complexities facing this industry," said Nicholas Counter, chief negotiator for the alliance.
The Writers Guild had sought what it called groundbreaking changes in the way writers are treated in Hollywood and in the way they are paid, said Michael Mahern, secretary-treasurer of the guild's West Coast branch and co-chairman of the union negotiating team. 
Still, it was difficult to assess immediately how closely the writers came to reaching the goals they had set at the start of the talks, since the announcement of the tentative settlement today included details of only some areas of the proposed contract, those in which the union achieved what it considered important improvements for its members.
At the same time, the producers were reluctant to brag about their achievements in the talks, for fear of making it harder for the union to win an approval vote from its membership.
It was clear, however, even with the sketchy details released today, that the writers had won at least some improvements in most of the economic issues and had made measurable, if somewhat less-striking gains on issues relating to creative rights.
Whether these will be enough to satisfy union members who had been clamoring for even more aggressive gains remains to be seen in the voting.
Mr. Mahern said: "People told us it couldn't be done even if we went on strike for a year. Today we are announcing that we have done it, including groundbreaking improvements, and it was accomplished without a strike."
The economic improvements agreed to in the tentative pact would mean $41 million more to the union's writers over the three years of the deal, Mr. Mahern said, including improvements in residuals for foreign sales, basic cable, pay cable and videocassettes.
In addition, for the first time, provisions were reached to cover the use of films and television programs on the Internet, and the basic minimums for writers will rise 3.5 percent a year.
Mr. Counter and the studio chiefs arrayed around him said they would not describe any of the details of the tentative agreement, leaving it up to guild officials to do so. Mr. Counter said, however, that the pact had been approved by all of the alliance's members, so all that remained was for the union to get the approval of its members.
Guild negotiators will take the tentative agreement to the union's governing East Coast and West Coast councils in the next few days. Since those councils are made up of many of the same people who sat on the negotiating committee, which approved the tentative pact unanimously, acceptance is all but certain. After that, however, the agreement will still have to be submitted to a vote of the union's membership, and although approval is expected there, as well, it is not a sure thing.
Among the provisions of the tentative agreement was increasing the residuals paid by the Fox Television Network, which had a 50 percent discount on the residuals paid by major networks. Under this new pact, its residual payments would increase over the next two years until they are at the same level as those of the other networks. 
Another issue that drew much attention during the negotiations were so-called creative rights, concerning the way writers are treated and the amount of power and status they have concerning the feature films they write. For example, the writers sought guarantees that they be allowed to visit the sets of films based on their scripts and to be invited to premieres, press junkets and all cast and crew events for the film.
The tentative agreement, however, does not offer a guarantee regarding the set visits and some other issues, saying instead that they will become a nonbinding "preferred practice." Writers did receive guarantees to be invited to the premieres and other events. 
In addition, a joint committee of the Writers Guild and the Directors Guild of America will be formed to work on these and other creative rights issues. 
On the issue that drew the most attention -- the use of the "film by" credit for many directors -- the two sides said they could not come to an agreement. Instead, Mr. Mahern said, union negotiators decided to pull it off the table and continue discussions later.
"We sought to begin a process that will, with time, change the culture of this business," Mr. Mahern said.
Martha Coolidge, the film director who was part of her union's committee looking into the creative-rights issue, said the Directors Guild was generally pleased with today's tentative pact and felt it would, in the end, foster a better atmosphere between Hollywood's writers and directors. In particular, she said, directors were pleased that "preferred practices" would govern many creative-rights issues, rather than strict guarantees.
"These kind of relationships cannot be mandated," Ms. Coolidge said. "Our members have always felt that way."
Most immediately, today's settlement lifts the threat that Hollywood will be hit by two major strikes this summer and shifts attention toward coming negotiations for a new contract covering the 135,000 performers represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
Hollywood has been nearly frantic for more than six months amid threats that the entertainment industry would be hobbled by the dual strikes. Movies were rushed into production so they would be finished in time to beat the strike deadlines.
Talent agencies and other companies instituted emergency plans, prepared layoff lists and warned employees and clients to save their money and not make expensive purchases. 
Much of the reason for this anxiety was the militant talk from union leaders, especially those in charge of the writers guild, who had vowed to take a hard line in this year's negotiations. The current union leadership, elected just over a year ago, came into office with a promise to be especially aggressive at the bargaining table, making up for what many union members felt were weak agreements in recent rounds of negotiations.
So it remained to be seen whether the agreement reached today -- which falls somewhat short of the goals that officials had set in the recent union elections and in public statements before the negotiations began -- will be acceptable to the union membership. 
Many say that the worsening economic climate will make even the most militant writers more reluctant to force a strike, and recent statements by many prominent screen and television writers have hinted at a greater willingness to take whatever concessions are offered and save the larger fight for next time.
The actors' contract expires on June 30 and those talks are set to begin next week.
While the actors unions have not made public their demands, they are expected to seek the same sorts of increases in residuals that the writers sought, as well as hefty increases in the basic minimums paid to actors, usually supporting actors, in films and television series. 
Officials of the Screen Actors Guild said in a statement that they would analyze the details of the writers pact "to see if it will be helpful in finding a way to address the specific needs of actors in our upcoming negotiations." But beyond that, they would not comment on today's agreement.
Mr. Mahern declined to say which of the issues had proved the thorniest during the talks. "I can tell you that they were all very difficult," he said. "There were no pins that fell on their own. We had to bowl them all over."
He offered only some highlights of the agreement, and said further specifics would be made public in coming days. 
The changes in the way residuals are computed for sales of films and programs to foreign markets will mean $1.3 million more for writers over the next three years, he said, largely by removing a cap on the maximum amount of residuals for a particular program.
Improvements in residual rates for pay cable programs, like "The Sopranos," will raise the amount writers receive to about $4 million under the new agreement from a total of $300,000 under the previous contract. Residuals for basic cable programs will increase by 20 percent, Mr. Mahern said.
And an agreement to pay writers a one-time $5,000 script fee for DVD and videocassette sales would raise those residuals by more than $1 million a year, he said.
Several people who had been involved in the proceedings, which were being held under a press blackout, said the talks had followed a frustrating pattern in recent days of rapid bursts of progress engendering periods of optimism that were then dashed when an unforeseen bump appeared to slow everything down and intensify emotions.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home; 
A Regime Of Thugs

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The title of worst government on earth the most brutal, destructive, lawless -- can probably be claimed today by Robert Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe. Mr. Mugabe has turned a prosperous country into a land of chaos and desperation.
 Example: Last week a gang of the thugs whom Mr. Mugabe calls "war veterans" invaded a grain storage depot holding grain donated by the European Union to the people of Zimbabwe. Over two days, with policemen watching, they stole 14 tons. 
 These so-called war veterans are Mr. Mugabe's instrument of terror. They began by invading white-owned farms, and they still remain on many -- camping on the land, obstructing farm operations, demanding food by threat. Now they have begun extorting money from businesses. In recent days they have invaded leading hotels, department stores and even a private hospital, demanding payments to leave.
Mr. Mugabe's purpose is to hold on to political power. He has ruled Zimbabwe since it became independent in 1980. There must be a presidential election by next March, and he is using violence to be sure he wins. Leaders of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, have been kidnapped and killed.
Two of the opposition members of Parliament, Paul Nyathi and David Coltart, were in Washington this week, and I spoke to them by telephone. I asked Mr. Nyathi if he was afraid.
"No more than the average Zimbabwean," he said, "who faces beating on a daily basis. The whole of the country is under threat."
Before the parliamentary election last year, Mr. Coltart's polling agent was abducted; he has not been seen since. During the 1990 election there was an assassination attempt on an opposition leader. It failed, and the attackers were prosecuted and convicted. Mr. Mugabe pardoned them. 
What then, I asked, can the United States and the international community do? Mr. Coltart replied: "End the culture of impunity."
"Mugabe and his people have used violence for political objectives again and again in the last 20 years," Mr. Coltart continued. "The international community objected last year, but there were no sanctions. So they think that if they bludgeon their way to winning again now, the international community will forgive them and life will go on."
The two M.P.'s said they were not in favor of general trade sanctions, which would further hurt impoverished Zimbabweans. Instead they called for personal sanctions targeting Mr. Mugabe and his top aides: their travel banned, financial assets identified and so on.
"Robert Mugabe and his henchmen have not been personally affected by what they have done to the country," Mr. Coltart said. "Targeted personal sanctions would break their culture of impunity."
Why should U.S. policy makers care about Zimbabwe, a medium-sized country in the middle of south-central Africa? The answer, I believe, is that what happens in Zimbabwe is a key to stability in the whole region.
Zambia, next door, has been in turmoil over President Frederick Chiluba's attempt, just abandoned, to change the Constitution to stay in office. In Mozambique there are dangerous tensions. In Angola the civil war continues. And South Africa, the giant of the region, is in a time of political strain. By making clear that there can be no impunity for violence and a stolen election in Zimbabwe, the United States and others can raise hope of making it a model for southern Africa.
The role of South Africa in the Zimbabwe situation has been a puzzle. President Thabo Mbeki said nothing as Mr. Mugabe's depredations mounted. His justice minister, Penuell Maduna, went to Zimbabwe and announced that, despite physical threats to judges, talk of intimidation was "pure fabrication."
South Africa has a self-interested reason to worry about Mr. Mugabe's campaign of terror. To outsiders, investors and tourists, chaos in Zimbabwe is a reason to stay away from the whole area.
Last week the South African government did condemn violence by the "war veterans." Mr. Nyathi said South Africa had "taken rather long, but they are getting the message now. If they had taken a robust attitude from the beginning, it might have reduced the destruction. But better late than never."

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE HIT 4.5% IN APRIL; 223,000 JOBS LOST 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The American job creation machine went into reverse in April as companies shed employees across much of the weak economy.
 The work force fell last month by an estimated 223,000 jobs on top of a loss of 53,000 jobs the previous month, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The unemployment rate, which has been inching up from a low of 3.9 percent in October, rose again, to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent in March. 
 After several years of expanding opportunity and rising income for millions of households, the back-to-back months of big job losses indicated to some analysts that the already sluggish economy had become even weaker lately and might be nearing, or even in, a recession. 
"These numbers mean that the economy is right now at about zero growth," said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist for Deutsche Bank North America. "I don't see much of anything positive in this report."
The April job loss was the largest one-month decline since February 1991, when the nation was in the last recession. The once-robust labor market has been weakening since last spring, but most of the weakness had been focused on manufacturing employees and on temporary workers, many of them also employed in manufacturing. Now there is clear evidence that job-cutting has spread through the vast service sector as well.
"The weakness in the economy is no longer a manufacturing story or a high-tech story," said William Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman, Sachs. "It is much more broadly based."
The stock market, however, treated the bad news as pointing to better times ahead. Prices rose on the major exchanges as investors seemed to conclude that corporate America, in cutting labor costs, was acting quickly to revive profits. Page C1. 
The employment report also seemed to practically guarantee another half-point cut in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet on May 15. Falling rates usually encourage people to invest in stocks by reducing the return on alternative investments.
"Business is biting the bullet, quickly cutting labor costs, and the markets see this as good news for stock prices," said James Glassman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan.
Not everyone shares that optimism. Rising unemployment is particularly hard on consumer confidence, and the unemployment rate is now the highest since October 1998. The concern is that rising unemployment will make consumers pull back, weakening the economy even more and raising the unemployment rate yet another notch or two.
"The risk is that we are going to get caught in a vicious circle, with rising unemployment leading to cutbacks in spending which lead to further job losses," Mr. Dudley said. Most of the economic weakness so far has come from companies spending much less for machinery, computers and software.
Just a week ago, many experts believed the economy was beginning to recover. The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product had grown at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter -- twice the rate in the fourth quarter. The Fed's aggressive rate cuts -- two percentage points since early January -- and still respectable consumer spending might be reviving the economy, some Wall Street economists said. The employment report threw cold water on that reasoning.
"The job numbers tell us that the second quarter is going to be weaker than the first quarter, although we might still be able to avoid a recession," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis.
Under pressure from shrinking profits, corporate America appears to be shifting its strategy for cutting labor costs. Until now, managers had preferred to eliminate overtime, cut back hours and use fewer temporary workers. The April report offered the first clear evidence that employers were resorting more frequently now to layoffs and hiring freezes. Hours worked last month fell sharply, but from the job losses rather than shorter workweeks, the Labor Department reported.
Conditioned by labor shortages in the late 1990's, "businesses had become reluctant to shed workers," Mr. Sohn said. "Now they are losing that reluctance and layoffs are becoming fashionable." 
The shift is reflected in the unemployment data. Nearly 3 million of the 6.4 million people who were unemployed in April had lost their jobs within the previous five weeks. That was 46 percent of all the unemployed, up from 43 percent in March.
"The flow of new people into unemployment is clearly rising," said Thomas Nardone, chief of the division that compiles the job figures at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Bush Administration viewed the latest jobs report as a justification for the $1.3 billion tax cut that Congress seems on the verge of adopting. "We need to give the economy room to breath and the first essential step is the president's tax cut," Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said.
The job cuts last month were widespread -- in transportation, hotels, recreation, general merchandise, apparel, wholesale trade, publishing, data processing. The handful of industries that gained ground included retailing, health services, child care and financial services, despite layoffs at some brokerage houses. Local governments also added jobs, especially public schools.
The biggest job losses came in manufacturing, which shed 104,000 jobs; the temporary-help industry, which eliminated 108,000 jobs; and construction, which shrank by 64,000 jobs.
All of the Labor Department's numbers are seasonally adjusted to offset employment trends that might otherwise distort the figures. That is, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates how many jobs should have been created in April in a normal year -- 895,000, in fact, and since only 672,000 showed up in the surveys of business payrolls, that counted as a job loss of 223,000.
What validates this process, Mr. Nardone says, are the trends, and the trend has been downward -- from an average of 256,000 new jobs created each month in the first four months of last year to a monthly decline, on average, of 14,000 in the same period this year.
As the labor market has weakened, wage pressures have subsided. Average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers, who held about 75 percent of the 132 million jobs in April, rose by a modest 5 cents, to $14.22.
The jump in unemployment last month came mostly at the expense of teenagers, whose unemployment rate rose to 14.2 percent from 13.8 percent in March, and whites, whose jobless rate increased to 4 percent from 3.7 percent in March. That is half the black rate of 8.2 percent, which fell slightly.
College graduates are also being hit, in part because of the devastation in the dot-com world. Their unemployment rate rose in March and April and, at 2.3 percent, is now six-tenths of a percentage point above its level a year ago.
"The slowdown," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, "is bringing layoffs across the board."

HEADLINE: Richardson Pratt Jr., 78; Led Pratt Institute 

 BODY:
Richardson Pratt Jr., a former president of the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and chairman of Charles Pratt & Company, which was established in 1891 to oversee the Pratt family interests, died Tuesday at his home in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. He was 78.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Mary. 
 Mr. Pratt, known as Jerry, was a great-grandson of the Pratt Institute's founder, Charles Pratt, who was a partner of John D. Rockefeller in the Standard Oil Company. Mr. Pratt was president of the institute from 1972 to 1990.
Born on March 25, 1923, Mr. Pratt grew up in Brooklyn and Glen Cove, N.Y. He graduated from the Choate School and received a bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1946 and a master's degree from the Harvard Business School in 1948.
During World War II, Mr. Pratt served on a Navy minesweeper. In 1948 he joined Standard Oil (now Exxon Mobil), where he held various positions in marketing, planning and economics until 1971, when he joined Charles Pratt & Company. He retired in 2000.
In addition to his wife, Mary Offutt Pratt, Mr. Pratt is survived by their three children, Laura P. Gregg of Bryn Mawr, Pa., Thomas R. Pratt of Coconut Grove, Fla., and David O. Pratt of Chestnut Hill, Pa.; eight grandchildren; and one great-grandson.

 Newt Gingrich (Op-Ed, April 29) makes a good point about transformational politics and the environment. But environmental progress requires not only a transformation of political style. 
It will also require a transformation in economies here and elsewhere to structures that assure reductions in environmental impact per unit of economic growth. 
 Technologies that reduce environmental impact while increasing economic productivity exist. But to realize their full potential, public policy must shift from its overriding concern with regulating negative outputs to encouraging greater efficiency and productivity of energy and materials inputs.
Just look at the most advanced economies, and you'll find the greenest countries.

HEADLINE: For DiFrancesco, Fighting Words In Deodorant Ad 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 4 

 BODY:
It is not often that the chief executive of a big state demands an apology for a deodorant ad. But Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco appears to have caught Devils fever. 
 The Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils are tied, 2-2, in the National Hockey League playoffs, with Game 5 of their four-of-seven series set for Saturday night at Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. 
 At least one corporate citizen of both Canada and New Jersey -- the Colgate-Palmolive Company -- appears to have taken sides in the series. On Thursday, an ad for the company's Mennen Speed Stick ran in both The Toronto Star and The Toronto Sun, showing a map of New Jersey and a picture of the deodorant. "Unfortunately, there are some smells even we can't do anything about," the ad reads. "Go Leafs Go."
The ad provoked Mr. DiFrancesco to make an outburst of indignation today, punctuated with clunky hockey references. "What stinks is a company trying to further their economic interests at the expense of New Jersey's reputation," he said. "I can understand trying to score with Maple Leafs fans who must be sweating right now, but this slap shot at the Garden State has put Colgate in the penalty box with me."
The, er, power play did not last long, however. Mr. DiFrancesco fired off a semi-serious letter of protest to Reuben Mark, the chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive, noting that it employs nearly 2,000 people in New Jersey and that the Mennen Company was a leading New Jersey manufacturer until Colgate bought it in 1992.
Mr. Mark put up no resistance, saying in a statement and in letters to a few dozen people who complained today, that Colgate was sorry "for the disrespectful and disparaging advertisement."
Asked if Mr. DiFrancesco would have dropped the gloves to battle Mr. Mark had he not apologized, the acting governor's spokeswoman, Rae Hutton, said Mr. DiFrancesco "believed that our hockey team would have taken care of things anyway."

HEADLINE: Old Fuels And Poor Policy 

BYLINE:  By Bill Richardson; Bill Richardson, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, was secretary of energy from 1998 to 2001.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's energy policy, centered primarily on increasing the supply of oil, coal and nuclear power, is shortsighted and misaimed, focusing too much on the wrong fuels and too firmly on supply.
 There is no question that we need to reduce our dependency on foreign oil. Energy companies now enjoying record profits should use their newly minted resources to pursue additional exploration and to build desperately needed refining capacity. But drilling for oil need not be conducted in environmentally sensitive areas. And since oil is not a major fuel for power plants, finding more of it will do little to address an issue that demands immediate attention: providing for our growing needs for electricity. 
 Coal is an abundant energy source. But it should not be the fuel of choice for power plants, either, as President Bush signaled it would be when he rescinded a campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Vice President Dick Cheney said last week that coal would be a primary source of power generation for years to come.
We are likely to need 1,000 new power plants by 2020. It is preferable that they be clean, efficient, gas-fired plants that emit few pollutants. Technological investment and changes in plants to increase energy efficiency will be curtailed if we continue on an exclusively pro-coal path.
Despite current capacity and price problems, clean-burning natural gas should be recognized as America's best source of energy for supplying electricity in the future. Meeting the nation's generation demands will require that we not only find and produce 60 percent more natural gas, but deliver it to markets. We need to be aggressive in the construction of 30,000 miles of new gas transmission lines and 275,000 miles of new distribution lines. All Americans should support construction of the proposed transcontinental natural gas pipeline, following the most economical route from Alaska's North Slope to the lower 48 states.
As for nuclear power, we have not yet resolved the intractable problem of where to store the thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste scattered across the country. False expectations should not be raised. We cannot build new power plants before we decide whether Yucca Mountain in Nevada is scientifically and environmentally suitable as a long-term depository. The contentious debate on its suitability should be made on the basis of science and not politics.
But no matter what the fuels, supply is only one element of energy policy. And because it takes a long time to develop new sources or build new infrastructure, the supply side is necessarily the longer-term part of our planning. Energy efficiency -- investments in developing and deploying technology to increase the efficient use of our scarce energy resources -- is our best bet for meeting the nation's shorter-term energy needs.
Last week's speech by Vice President Cheney cleverly showered energy efficiency and conservation solutions with faint praise. With the federal government the biggest energy consumer, the administration is right to cut its own energy consumption, if only by repeating the guidelines given last year. But much more can and must be done.
Increasing the efficiency of our vehicle fleet by just three miles a gallon would save us one million barrels of oil per day, out of the roughly 10 million barrels we import. Regrettably, Mr. Bush reduced the Energy Department's budget for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by 30 percent. A partnership with automakers to increase mileage in vehicles to 80 miles a gallon was also significantly cut. The Bush Energy Department also caved in to the air conditioning industry to block a rule requiring residential central air conditioners to be more efficient.
It is important to the nation's future that we take a bipartisan and balanced approach to energy policy. Everyone needs to recognize that energy and environmental policy are two sides of the same coin. Perhaps most important, we need to emphasize supply and demand in equal measure. In the end, this balance will be the true recipe for success.

HEADLINE: Revolt at the U.N. 

 BODY:
Thanks in part to the inattention of the Bush administration, the United States lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Commission this week for the first time since the panel was established in 1947. But the administration's failure to detect and defeat the brewing rebellion among other nations was only one element of an embarrassing defeat. Even more important was the rising resentment abroad about America's often patronizing treatment of the U.N. and Washington's disdain for international compacts on issues ranging from the environment to the use of land mines.
 Critics of the U.N. in the administration and Congress will doubtless blame the world organization for the loss of the seat and cite it as another reason to withhold Washington's financial support and to take other punitive actions. Such a response would ignore the underlying issues that precipitated the revolt and only worsen American relations with the U.N., an institution with the potential to be a major asset to American diplomacy. 
 The Human Rights Commission itself is an example of the positive role the U.N. can play. The commission, which meets in Geneva, is often frustratingly bureaucratic, and counts among its members some of the world's most egregious violators of human rights, including Sudan, Pakistan and Togo. But this year the commission condemned human rights abuses in Cuba and Iran, and censured Russia for its actions in Chechnya. It sends special rapporteurs to investigate violations, a spotlight that is profoundly embarrassing to dictators. International human rights groups have correctly warned that the commission may be inactive without American leadership and that Washington's voice on human rights issues will be weakened. 
The United States was dropped from the commission when the three seats reserved for Western nations in this year's balloting went to France, Austria and Sweden in a vote of the 54 members of the Economic and Social Council, the U.N. body that oversees the commission. American diplomats apparently complacently assumed the American seat was safe after 43 nations assured Washington of their support and did not realize a revolt was developing, encouraged by human rights abusers, including Cuba and China. Washington also failed to persuade Austria or Sweden to pull out of the race. The breakdown may be partly due to the absence of a new American ambassador to the U.N. The White House has selected John Negroponte, an experienced diplomat, but has yet to submit his nomination to the Senate. 
President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell must be mindful of the erosion of international respect for the United States, even among some of its European allies. Not all the foreign complaints are justified. Washington has long been the commission's fiercest defender of Israel and the author of the most aggressive resolutions condemning nations such as China and Cuba. Those policies are entirely appropriate.
But other American behavior, including a tendency to treat the U.N. as a benighted and irritating stepchild, has needlessly provoked opposition. Washington's failure to pay U.N. dues is the most conspicuous example. But member states are also angry about the Pentagon's insistence that Americans not be covered by an international criminal court, the Bush administration's withdrawal from talks about global warning and even Washington's policies of pushing poor countries not to make copies of AIDS drugs. President Bush's open contempt for the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty has alarmed not only Russia, the other signatory to the accord, but NATO allies as well. 
Until a new election next year when Washington can try to reclaim membership on the Human Rights Commission, the organization is likely to take a softer line on most nations, and a more aggressive one toward Israel. But the more important fallout from this week's vote will probably come in Washington. The Bush administration and responsible members of Congress must move quickly to prevent a backlash against the U.N. 
Payment of Washington's back dues is vital to maintaining American influence at the U.N. The payment plan that was carefully negotiated by Richard Holbrooke in the last days of the Clinton administration remains a reasonable deal for the United States and should be approved by the House, where it has been stalled. The lesson of the commission vote is not that the U.N. is inherently inimical to American interests, but rather that Washington has to do a better job of working with other nations if it wants to retain its authority at the U.N.

HEADLINE: Cuomo and McCall Make Pitches to Party 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: COLONIE, N.Y., May 4 

 BODY:
A gathering of state Democrats here provided a preview of next year's gubernatorial campaign, as H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo both dipped into national politics to make cases for themselves and against Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Mr. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary who has worked in Washington for the last eight years, laid claim to Clinton-style centrism and economic growth. He also noted the governor's repeated appearances in state-financed advertising, calling on him to return at least $20 million spent on such ads to the state. 
 Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, likened Mr. Pataki to President Bush and attacked the governor's record on school financing, health care, energy and toxic waste cleanup. He also fired the only intra-party barb of the day, an indirect swipe at Mr. Cuomo's father, the former governor Mario M. Cuomo.
The meeting of the Democratic State Committee, at a hotel in this Albany suburb, was widely viewed as a showcase for the rivals, who have been jockeying for position for more than a year. While Mr. McCall remains the favorite of the party's leaders and elected officials, Mr. Cuomo -- who leads the comptroller in early primary polls -- got an enthusiastic reception.
Mr. Cuomo and his aides were determined to avoid a repeat of last year's state party convention, when a crowd that knew the comptroller better cheered him loudly but sat largely silent during Mr. Cuomo's speech. Today, Mr. Cuomo's camp made sure their allies, buttons and signs were out in force, slipped fliers under each state committee member's hotel door, and held a lunch for the committee before the meeting.
"I think the contrast was clear," Mr. Cuomo said after the event.
The gathering of more than 200 party officials demonstrated the early interest the race for governor is generating, even with the primary 16 months away. The two men sought to tap into New York's overwhelmingly Democratic leanings in national politics, and both roused the crowd with pointed attacks on the governor.
Mr. McCall linked Governor Pataki to "the am-Bush administration, turning the clock back" on issues like environmental protection. "It's hard now to be proud to be a United States citizen when you consider what they are trying to do," he said.
Governor Pataki, he said, is "trying to act like a Democrat and invade our Democratic base," by wooing Puerto Rican voters and women.
When his turn came, Mr. Cuomo referred several times to his association with President Clinton and the economic boom of the last decade. His remarks also were a subtle reminder of the generational gap between Mr. Cuomo, 43, and Mr. McCall, 65.
"There's a formula for the new Democratic Party," he said, one of promoting economic growth and smaller government. "I know it works; I was in the laboratory when they developed it."
He said that as housing secretary, he had focused on poor areas, like "Indian reservations in South Dakota, and upstate New York."
Governor Pataki's surrogates who attended painted both Democrats as holdovers from a worse time, when the elder Mr. Cuomo was governor.
"Andrew Cuomo and Carl McCall would like New Yorkers to forget what happened," said Patrick McCarthy, executive director of the state Republican Party. "Jobs were fleeing New York, taxes were at an all-time high, 1 in 11 New Yorkers was on welfare. And that all changed when George Pataki was elected governor."
At his lunch, Mr. Cuomo accused the governor of using public funds to promote himself by appearing in ads for state programs.
"You just have to turn on your TV set, you'll see George Pataki," he said. "Now, it may be the only place you'll see George Pataki is doing state advertisements. But you will see him there, and you pay to see him there. It's almost like pay-per-view. You pay your taxes and then you view Pataki on television."
Mr. McCarthy called the charge "the height of hypocrisy," saying that as cabinet secretary Mr. Cuomo had used public funds for self-promotion and politically motivated travel.
Mr. McCall dwelled on the particulars of Mr. Pataki's record more than Mr. Cuomo did, saying the governor had ignored a crisis in urban schools and a need to revamp the state's school aid formula, and had tried to weaken toxic cleanup standards. "If you've got no vision and you've got no commitment," he said, "you've got no business being the governor of the state of New York." 
The comptroller also indirectly disparaged Mario M. Cuomo, who, after 12 years as governor, lost to Governor Pataki in 1994. Looking back to that time, Mr. McCall said: "The party was in chaos, local organizations had been ignored. Leadership was distant and disconnected. We ended up demoralized, in debt, in disarray."
Andrew Cuomo would not respond directly to those comments, saying he preferred to remain positive.

BYLINE:  By Charles Taylor; Charles Taylor is a contributing writer for Salon.com.

 BODY:
 Outcast
By Jose Latour.
295 pp. New York:
William Morrow. $24.
 IT takes the Cuban writer Jose Latour only a few paragraphs to nail the milieu of 90's Havana in his new novel. Here his schoolteacher hero, Elliot Steil, recounts his day:
"Trying day, Steil reflected. His coffee and sugar reserves had simultaneously given out two days before, and breakfast had consisted of 40 grams of stale white bread washed down with a glass of cold water. A few minutes later he found his bike's rear tire punctured. He spent 75 minutes waiting for a bus, and at 10:02 a.m. punched his card at the Polytechnic Institute where he taught English, two hours and two minutes late.
"Lunch was a meager, poorly seasoned mixture of rice and insufficiently cooked red beans escorted by overripe tomatoes. The teacher had left the building at 5 p.m. pondering if he should walk home or waste some more of his free time on the almost nonexistent Havana public transportation system. The scheduled 8 to 11 p.m. blackout and pending household chores led him to cover the eight kilometers on foot."
That accumulation of annoyances is so vivid that by the time you reach the end you feel worn out and you still have hours to go until Steil's bedtime. Who wouldn't be ready to bolt for the United States? 
Steil gets his chance in the person of a man named Dan Gastler, who introduces himself as a friend of Steil's late father. Gastler explains that the dying, elder Steil has paid him to effect the younger Steil's escape from Cuba. Steil, fed up with the humiliations and intrusions that a Cuban not sufficiently enamored of Castro's revolution is prone to, agrees to Gastler's plan to swim to where his yacht will be anchored. 
All goes according to plan -- except the part where Gastler tries to kill Steil by pushing him overboard. Steil survives, encountering some other Cubans making their way to Miami on a homemade raft; once settled in the States, he sets about discovering why Gastler wanted him dead.
The hard-boiled sleuthing that follows is economical, smooth and entirely perfunctory. At its best, "Outcast" is too good a novel to fit into the narrow genre in which Latour wants to jam it. The increasingly hard-boiled attitude serves the novel in one way: it allows no room for a judgmental attitude toward the life of crime in which Steil casually indulges (stealing cars) to bring him closer to his dreams of revenge. 
The most interesting thing about "Outcast," after Latour's portrait of Cuba as a barely functioning dictatorship, is his take on the predicament of Cubans who come here. Steil's girlfriend, Fidelia (she was part of the rafting group that saved him), writes in her diary, "I walk into a drugstore and find a shelf stocked with 10 different brands of toothbrushes, each brand offering 10 different models; each model, 10 colors; each color, 10 toothbrushes dangling from a peg." It's mind-boggling to her. But for the refugees, it's a new kind of trap. Fidelia writes, "You recall the pitiful Cuban stores and feel, actually feel, the across-the-board failure of a materialism devoid of substance." 
THAT'S believable coming from someone unable to relate to a country where, for most, the affordability of something like a toothbrush is never in question. It's also a crock. I have a feeling that most Cuban refugees would tell you that when you don't have to worry about basic necessities, the soul takes care of itself. Fidelia's observation is that old canard about how suffering enriches the soul presented as a critique of materialism. 
Latour, who lives in Havana and who is the author of six previous novels ("Outcast" is his first book written in English), is on much stronger ground when Fidelia compares the safety of her son's school in Cuba with the dangers of American public schools. Here Latour implies the conclusion that his character can't bring herself to formulate: that perfect safety is achievable, but only in a dictatorship. It's in moments like this, and in the tenuous pleasures of Steil's new existence, that Latour suggests a potent and thorny theme: freedom as an anticlimax.

 The Diamond In The Bronx
Yankee Stadium and the Politics
of New York.
By Neil J. Sullivan.
Oxford University, $30.
 Neil J. Sullivan uses the history of Yankee Stadium to reflect the currents of change that have swept through New York in the past century, particularly in the Bronx. He is very good on the social and political background that led to the baseball boom of the 1920's. Yankee Stadium was not simply the House That Ruth Built; it resulted from the increasing wealth of the rising multiethnic fan base that attached itself to Babe Ruth. Sullivan, who teaches public affairs at Baruch College, is also good on sizing up the new stadium game as it is currently played by baseball owners around the country. "The first point that can be held with near certainty," he writes, "is that an economic investment in a stadium will not be returned"; "wealth is not being created by the stadium so much as it is being diverted from one place to another." However, when it comes time to bring together the different strands of his ambitious book, Sullivan is tenuous and relies too much on secondhand material. And he repeats some of baseball's most cherished misinformation: Arnold Rothstein did not fix the 1919 World Series. "The Diamond in the Bronx" has many insights into the politics of the new stadium business and has some original observations about the rise of baseball in New York, but it reads like parts of two or even three books whose theses are not fully developed.

HEADLINE: 6. CASE STUDY: VANITY; LOCATION: BANGKOK; 
Nip, Tuck and Frequent-Flier Miles

BYLINE:  By Margaret Talbot; Margaret Talbot is a fellow at the New America Foundation and a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In 1999, Thai Airways International, the government airline of Thailand, began offering travelers an unusual new package-tour option. Most tourists might still prefer the old add-ons: the river cruise, the round of golf, the Thai cooking course. But others, those who were part of a new market that government officials were calling "medical tourists," could now combine their Asian holiday with a comprehensive physical, including abdominal ultrasound, chest and barium stomach X-rays and a complete laboratory analysis of blood, urine and stool samples. They could get a written report sent to their hotel within three days. And they could get it all done at Bumrungrad Hospital, a modern medical complex in Bangkok that had all sorts of inviting, foreigner-friendly amenities, starting with a Starbucks and a McDonald's in the lobby. 
 This might not seem like a plausible promotion at all except for the fact that thousands of tourists were already coming to Thailand to avail themselves of its best-known medical attraction, discount plastic surgery. In Thailand, you can get a $2,400 face lift or a $1,200 nose job. You can get tumescent liposuction, body contouring, extra-large silicone breast implants, a buttock lift, a brow shave, a laser resurfacing of the face -- and pay a fraction of what you would pay back home. At the luxurious Bumrungrad, which offers high-speed Internet access and cable TV in every room, you can choose among precisely delineated packages: liposuction, "the thighs and love handles" package; liposuction, "the love handles only" package; liposuction, "the under chin only" package; and on and on. You can find Thai plastic surgeons who market these operations directly to you on English-language Web sites, where you can book an appointment online if you like what you see. 
 How a developing country with a floundering economy and a significant H.I.V. problem managed to market itself as a center for medical tourism makes an odd, roundabout story. It depends in part on the Asian economic crisis of 1997 and in part on Thailand's thriving cabaret culture. Most of all, perhaps, it depends on the one plastic surgery procedure that Thai doctors have come closest to perfecting -- namely, the sex change operation. Without the international transsexual grapevine, which since the late 90's has been spreading the word about the affordable talents of Thai plastic surgeons, the new campaign to bring hard currency into the country by touting its medical bargains would never have gained momentum. And so it makes a strange kind of sense to begin this story with somebody like Michelle Moore -- somebody who, it is fair to say, had never given Thailand a moment's thought before she flew there and changed her life forever. 
Moore lives in Philadelphia, not far from where she grew up in the blue-collar town of Glenside. Back then, she was known as Michael Maier. She is now 36 and for the last 18 years has operated a moving company called Maier's Relocation Service, which runs trucks between Florida and Pennsylvania. For vacations, she likes Daytona Beach, Fla.; in her spare time, she collects and repairs old televisions and radios. Her boyfriend is the cook at a nearby nursing home. In Moore's previous life, the subject of what might or might not be happening in a developing country in Asia just didn't come up. 
Then last spring Moore heard from a friend about a doctor in Bangkok named Preecha Tiewtranon. Preecha is a talented plastic surgeon with an unusual niche: he and two other Thai surgeons perform the cheapest sex-change operations in the world. Even before the Thai government started actively promoting the country's medical care, the work of Preecha and his students had made Thailand a pilgrimage destination for American and European men who could not afford sexual-reassignment surgery in their home countries, where it can easily cost upward of $20,000. Moore was one of those customers. Twenty thousand dollars was more than she could afford, but $5,000 -- Preecha's going rate, plus air fare to Bangkok -- was a sum she could manage. She would even have cash left over for breasts and, as Moore put it, "fake cheekbones."
The good thing, besides the price, was that Thai surgeons didn't set so much store by the extensive psychological evaluations that Western surgeons demand before they will undertake a sex change. In the United States, doctors commonly adhere to a protocol known as the Harry Benjamin standards, which require sex-change candidates to have seen a psychiatrist for at least six months. In Thailand, they don't. As long as their foreign patients have passed the "real life" test of living as a woman for six months, they seldom throw up roadblocks. Moore, who isn't big on roadblocks of any kind, liked this a lot. As she put it, "I don't want to pay some psychiatrist money I don't have to tell me something I already know." The convenient thing was that Thai immigration officials were by now so accustomed to their country's brisk business in sex changes that they hardly blinked when a foreigner in a dress offered up a passport with a name like Chuck on it. 
Of course, it was a long way to fly -- especially with some very sore nethers and probably some bleeding and, depending on how long you decided to convalesce in Thailand, maybe an inability to urinate normally or some sort of brewing infection. But then the whole operation itself was so extreme that, in some ways, the distance and the arduousness of the journey and the strangeness of the destination seemed fitting.
Once Moore had settled on a trip to Bangkok, her biggest difficulty was choosing between the three Thai surgeons who performed sex changes on foreigners at a rate of two or three a week. Suporn Watanyusakul in Chonburi was kind of new at it, but he had studied with Preecha and his prices were great. (Besides, effused one satisfied customer in a Web site posting, Suporn was willing to provide the giant-sized breast implants that other doctors discouraged.) Sanguan Kunaporn, whose practice was on the swinging resort island of Phuket, was known for laboring hard to make a sensitive "clitoris" from a small chunk of penis he preserved during surgery. His procedure, however, took 11 hours over two days.
Then there was Preecha -- who at 57 and with 1,200 male-to-female sex changes to his credit, the old man of the business. Having studied plastic surgery at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, he started out back in the 1978 doing sex changes on Thais, but then many of those transsexuals moved overseas (a lot of them to Germany, he says) and married Europeans. These "lady boys" abroad were admired for their beauty, and word started to trickle out that Thailand was a place to get sexual reassignment surgery done cheaply and fairly artfully. By the late 90's, Preecha's clientele was made up almost entirely of Americans, Europeans and Australians. Preecha was fast -- in three hours, he could do sexual-reassignment surgery, add breasts and shave an Adam's apple -- and his fans claimed he didn't sacrifice aesthetics or sensation. He did most of his surgery at Bumrungrad, where many doctors had trained in the U.S. and the decor suggested a new Hyatt in some prosperous American exurb. 
Michelle Moore picked Preecha, who first operated on her last August. When I met her, on a March morning so humid my glasses fogged over the instant I stepped outside, she was back in Bangkok to get a bit of repair work done. "I wasn't real good about dilating the new vagina every day," she explained. "I didn't do what Preecha told me, and it kind of like collapsed on me." In the tiny, lace-curtained waiting room of Preecha's clinic, into which several rows of plastic chairs have somehow been crammed, rangy, raw-boned Moore was a large and incongruous presence. She was wearing jeans and a faded T-shirt with a drawing of a Formula 1 car. Her brown hair was long and a little raggedly cut. She looked a bit like David Bowie as a Philly motorhead. 
Normally, Moore is a friendly sort, but at that moment she was kind of ticked off because Preecha had told her that another surgeon, whom she did not know, would be operating on her. "I want to know who is this guy, where'd he go to school and blah, blah, blah," she said, gesturing with a plastic fork full of a street vendor's yellow curry. "I'm afraid, and nobody can blame me. This is serious stuff." 
The person patiently listening to her was Eddie Chaichana, Preecha's young nurse. Eddie is from a poor village in the north of Thailand. After he earns a little more money in Bangkok, he wants to go home and provide some much needed medical care there. But in the meantime he lives above Preecha's clinic and deals all day long and into the night with the requirements of transgendered foreigners. Some of them want a pizza; some want a better selection of cable TV; some want advice on the best beaches to head for when they are ready to strut their brand new stuff. Some of them have never been abroad and are scared to leave the darkened hotel rooms where they are recovering. 
At the moment, however, Moore was making perhaps the one request Eddie had not heard from a patient before. She wanted information on how to become a permanent resident of Thailand. She likes the people, the weather, the fact that she can get tailored suits for practically nothing. Having surgery abroad had opened her eyes to a life beyond Pennsylvania. "I like the United States," she said. "But there's too much red tape, especially in long-distance trucking." She asked Eddie to help find her a job, maybe figure out a way around some immigration problems. It was one thing Eddie couldn't do. It is medical tourists he had learned to serve -- the people who want a new body, for a good price, to take home. 
These days, there are plenty of people in Thailand -- from government officials to hotel owners to doctors and nurses -- banking on the country's new status as an international capital of discount plastic surgery. The sex-change industry is only the beginning, as they see it, though it certainly made sense to start there and build on some obvious strengths.
Thailand, as it happens, is a country whose male-to-female transsexuals make up an unusually accomplished and accepted subculture. There are no legal sanctions against homosexual or transgendered lifestyles, and kathoeys, or drag queens, are everywhere. In the late 90's, one of the country's most popular celebrities was a cross-dressing kick boxer who kissed his opponents and wore lipstick in the ring. The second-highest-grossing Thai movie ever made, "Iron Ladies," tells the (true) story of a transsexual volleyball team. Drag-queens and lady-boys are stock characters on Thai soaps. And the country's many transsexual cabarets employ performers who are delicately featured marvels of plastic surgery. I visited two transsexual bars and a cabaret in Bangkok one Sunday night; talking to Iman and Bam-Bam, two pretty, gum-chewing dancers with lustrous hair and matching mauve eye shadow, it was easy to forget that they were not genetic girls. It is true that the breasts they kept flashing genially at me were perfectly spherical and their hips exiguous, but then that kind of made them look like Victoria's Secret models, who are genetic girls as far as I know. 
Given the amount of reshaping transsexual performers require in order to increase their value in the tourist-driven entertainment business, it is not surprising that there are skilled plastic surgeons in Thailand. But in a country where the per capita income is $2,000, not even showgirls have unlimited money to spend on cosmetic surgery. And they had even less of it after the Asian economic crisis and the devaluation of the Thai baht in 1997. 
By then there were 131 private hospitals in Bangkok alone, most outfitted with up-to-date medical technology. Somebody had to fill all those beds and pay all those doctors, and after the baht took its plunge, not even the Thai middle class could afford private medical care anymore. (Those who couldn't pay out of pocket went to government hospitals.) That is when tourist officials and hospital administrators came up with a strategy: market Thailand as a place you would actually travel to for plastic surgery and maybe even other medical procedures as well. Thailand had doctors who earned a fraction of what their American counterparts do, though many of them had studied in the U.S. or Australia. It had highly trained nurses who were paid around $600 a month, a culture with a tradition of massage and other spa-worthy healing practices and in Bangkok, at least, a lot of high-tech medical equipment purchased during the economic boom and now sitting idle. Medical tourism would have a better rep than sex tourism, and it could easily be as lucrative. 
And so two years ago, the Tourism Authority of Thailand issued new directives to travel agents, suggesting that they offer their clients health-tourism packages -- trips that might include, say, laser eye surgery along with airfare and hotel. Thai travel agents talked up the country's medical bargains, and hospitals found new ways to advertise. At the hotel where I stayed, a regularly broadcast message advised me that I could get CNBC at "fine hospitals" throughout Thailand. And several hospitals and clinics in Bangkok started making concerted pitches to attract foreign tourists. The St. Carlos Hospital, where you can get a full range of plastic surgery, advertises itself as a "breakthrough integrated medical rejuvenation center providing spa, medical and fitness facilities." The hospital's Web site, whose opening page features a sun-dappled photograph of a handsome Caucasian couple, explains that "in Asia, retaining that youthful look is important. This has, in turn, led to the development in Thailand of cosmetic surgical techniques that are the envy of the medical profession in many G7 countries."
But it was Bumrungrad that took the merging of hospital and tourist accommodation the furthest. Under the administration of an American C.E.O. named Curtis Schroeder, the hospital began showing travel agents a slide-show presentation to get the word out about its bargains: $205 for an MRI, $267 for a complete physical, $1,200 for abdominal liposuction, $750 for full face resurfacing. From a medical point of view, Bumrungrad was already well equipped, with coronary care and dialysis units and sophisticated imaging technology. Now Schroeder, who is 44 and the former administrator of the U.S.C. Medical Center, set about furnishing it with the kind of lavish niceties to which American tourists are accustomed. 
After the hospital's makeover, a foreign visitor could expect five-star hotel extras: meet-and-greet service at the Bangkok airport, a multilingual personal escort to take him from test to test during physicals. And the rooms themselves were luxe and, by American standards, cheap -- some just $54 a night. There were 250-thread-count cotton sheets and complimentary toiletries in baskets woven by Thai hill tribes. The hospital brought in chefs from Bangkok's most glamorous restaurants -- a new one each month -- to cook patients' menus. For customers who found the cuisine too exotic, a McDonald's was installed in the lobby's food court. 
To advertise all these attractions, Schroeder opened outreach offices in cities across Asia. He figured it wouldn't be all that hard to attract elites from countries whose medical services lagged far behind Thailand's but who had the wherewithal "to shop around for Grandma's heart operation." Last year, he also opened an office in London, on the assumption that the National Health Service's waiting lists could propel some intrepid Brits halfway around the world for medical care. "I have a newspaper article from England right here," Schroeder told me one day, "that shows how people can wait three years for hip replacement surgery with the National Health Service. And it's the same thing in places like Sweden. There's got to be a market for us there." Schroeder handed me a newly produced brochure aimed at luring British patients to Bumrungrad. It promised what sounded like a medical paradise of "instant" care -- a place where the people (read: nurses) are "gentle, serene and gracious" yet modern and efficient, a soothing amalgam of Buddhist compassion and Western infrastructure. 
All this investment is beginning to pay off. Bumrungrad saw some 165,000 foreign patients last year. Schroeder knows that the kind of people who can afford plastic surgery or executive physicals in the United states are not necessarily the most price-sensitive, but he figures that everybody likes a bargain, especially if it can be combined with a vacation to a warm, tourist-friendly country. "We've got one couple from New York who comes here every year for their physicals," he said. "They love Thailand, and it's just an easy way for busy people to kind of multitask." 
Walking through the lobby at Bumrungrad one morning, past the lush ficus trees and the splashing fountain, I ran into Ruben Torral, a bouncy American who is Schroeder's right-hand man. We ordered two Starbucks lattes, and Torral recounted a couple of his sample pitches for surgical vacations. To promote the month's special on Lasik surgery, which corrects near-sightedness, Torral said he told prospective customers, "Have the surgery and see beautiful Thailand -- get it?" And for face lifts and such, Torral said the anonymity afforded by a hospital so very far from home might be an incentive for some Americans. "Look, you can come here, get a face lift and spend five days vacationing on the beach, and it's still going to cost you 30 or 40 percent less than it would if you had the same procedure in L.A. or New York. And guess what? Nobody at home needs to know what you've been up to. They just say, 'Wow, you look rested.' And you say 'Yeah, Thailand's great!"'
Personally, I find it hard to imagine spending any vacation time in a hospital if I can help it, let alone flying 24 hours to a country where vaccinations are recommended, the H.I.V. rate is 2 percent and the nurses don't speak my language just to get an operation I could get at home. I worry about surgical complications discovered in Economy Class somewhere over the Pacific. I envision having to ask a flight attendant for 9 or 10 yards of gauze and a shot of morphine. I think about less exacting imitators of the doctors at Bumrungrad trying to cash in on the foreign market and ruining, oh, say, your face. 
And most American plastic surgeons would agree with me. They take a dim view of all the sun-and-surf-and-nip-and-tuck destinations: Central America, Mexico, Thailand. Follow-up visits are a problem, they point out, and cultural ideals of beauty differ -- and more importantly, so do medical credentials and standards of care. "These are third-world countries -- what more do I really have to say?" said Daniel Morello, the president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. "All the best plastic surgeons in those countries come to the U.S. to train. So why would an American go there for surgery?" Every year, Morello said, "I am beset by 10 or 12 patients who went abroad for surgery and who have problems they want me to fix. These are people whose phone calls have not been answered, who have been abandoned by the doctor they saw." Morello added that many plastic surgeons here are reluctant to take such patients on, because "these are angry, disappointed people who tend to transfer that anger to you. You feel badly for them, but you feel they've been dumb, too. The notion of a vacation and surgery of any kind -- they really shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence." 
There may, however, be less risky strategies for coaxing well-heeled Westerners into the Thai health system. After my coffee with Torral, I made a brief stop in a public bathroom where yellow roses float serenely in a marble bowl by the sink and then took the elevator to Curtis Schroeder's office on the top floor.
Schroeder is a tall, well-tended man with sandy hair slicked back from his forehead and a youthful, pink complexion. The day we met, he was wearing a pearly gray suit and waxing enthusiastic about his latest project, something called the Vital Life Wellness Center, set to open this month. Schroeder leaned forward, elephant-print silk tie dangling. He thinks the center will be a big attraction for Americans into vitamin therapy, and he may be right. The lingo sounds spot-on, and "wellness" sounds like a smart direction for medical tourism to go in: "nutraceuticals," prevention, treatments that are trendy and costly and nonsurgical -- and, like plastic surgery, not covered by insurance at home. "We'll do body fluid assays, check for vitamin deficiencies, anti-oxidants, free radicals," Schroeder promised. At the Wellness Center, doctors analyzing data about a client's body would create "custom compound" supplements for him. "Some people now are taking 30-40 vitamin pills a day that they're buying at the local mall, and they don't need it," Schroeder explained. "It's passing through them, and all they've got is the most expensive urine in the world. Well, we don't want expensive urine here! We'll give you exactly what you need to take and no more, and then you'll come back and we'll test you again." 
So savvy and so neat was this vision, so far removed from the messy work of turning a man into a woman, that I nearly lost sight of the fact that, so far, the most successful Thai medical tourism -- the root of it all -- was sexual reassignment surgery. Curtis Schroeder, it was made clear to me, did not wish to talk about sexual reassignment surgery. Before I interviewed him, I met with a woman named Yadda Aparaks, the business director of Bumrungrad. She is a petite, impeccably groomed and rather obdurate person with whom I had the following conversation:
Aparaks: "We do sex changes, but we are not going to speak about that. We don't want to be known for doing sex change operations. Sex tourism, sex change, nothing like that."
Me: "But you have a whole section of your Web site on sexual reassignment surgery at Bumrungrad." 
Aparaks: "No, we don't have that."
Me: "Yes, you do."
Aparaks: "Well maybe somebody looking at our Web site can pull that up. If they're looking for that. But we're not going to talk about that." 
It seemed fruitless to press the point, so that was that. But later that day I met a man who knows intimately just how important sex changes are to the whole boom in medical tourism, who has made quite a nice living on them himself and who just chuckled when I told him what Aparaks said. 
Not much seems to bother Preecha Tiewtranon. He gives off an aura of quiet jollity, as though he had just heard a good joke or eaten a warm, tasty meal. And his vast and tolerant bemusement takes in all sorts of phenomena discomfiting to other people. Just for the heck of it and kind of expecting an oh-don't-be-silly reply, I asked him whether something I had read in a guidebook was true: namely, that penile reattachment surgery was performed more often in Thailand than in other countries and that Thailand was, in fact, the international capital of penile reattachment. 
"Oh, yes," he said. "We have many wives and girlfriends cutting off the husband's penises here. A few years ago, you had that Bobbitt, and everybody in America was so excited. And in Thailand, we though what's all the excitement? We have that all the time. We got very good at the microsurgery for reattaching the penis; it's a specialty for us." Preecha chuckled heartily. I joined in rather more hesitantly. 
Long ago, Preecha said, he had thought "transsexual people were kind of dirty people and I looked down on them." But then he started seeing a few transsexuals as patients, people who came in with horribly botched surgery to be repaired, and he felt sorry for them and thought, If they are going to do this anyway, somebody good should do it so they don't mutilate themselves. And after a while and to his surprise, he found that he liked his transsexual patients. Maybe even especially the foreigners -- those blundering Americans who didn't know the first thing about Thailand but who trusted him. 
In the end, what he liked was that the sex-change patients were grateful, which ordinary tourists, and people in general, so often weren't. "You know, someone you do stomach surgery on, maybe it's very hard for them, and you do a good job, but the patient is just saying, 'Oh pain, pain, pain,"' Preecha said. "The sexual-reassignment surgery patients are always happy. They don't complain! They say they are born again here in Thailand, and they are happy."

HEADLINE: 11. CASE STUDY: THE DEPRESSED POOR; LOCATION: WASHINGTON, D.C.; 
A Cure For Poverty

BYLINE:  By Andrew Solomon; Andrew Solomon is the author of "The Noonday Demon," to be published in June by Scribner.

 BODY:
Wendy was born just below the poverty line, where she spent the next 30 years of her life. These were grim times for her. When she was 6, a disabled friend of her alcoholic grandmother began abusing her sexually. In seventh grade she began to withdraw. "I felt there was no reason to go on," she says. "I did my schoolwork and everything, but I was not happy in any way. I would just stay to myself. Everyone thought I couldn't talk for a while, because for a few years there I wouldn't say anything to anyone." Her first boyfriend, from her neighborhood in the slums around Washington, was physically and verbally brutal. After the birth of her first child, when she was 17, she managed to "escape from him, I don't know how." Not long after, Wendy, a petite African-American woman with grave eyes and a wide mouth, was raped by a family friend. Soon after that, under pressure from her family, she married a man who was also abusive. She had three more children by him in the next two years. "He was abusing the children too, even though he was the one who wanted them, cursing and yelling all the time, and the spankings, I couldn't take that, over any little thing, and I couldn't protect them from it." She also had to assume responsibility at this time for her sister's children, because the sister was addicted to crack cocaine. 
 Wendy began to experience major depression -- not simply the generalized despair that might be expected of someone in her position, but an organic illness that was utterly disabling: "I'd had a job, but I had to quit because I just couldn't do it. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I felt like there was no reason to do anything. I'm already small, and I was losing more and more weight. I wouldn't get up to eat or anything. I just didn't care. Sometimes I would sit and just cry, cry, cry. Over nothing. I had nothing to say to my own children. After they left the house, I would get in bed with the door locked. I feared when they came home, 3 o'clock, and it just came so fast. I was just so tired." Wendy began to take pills, mostly painkillers. "It could be Tylenol or anything for pain, a lot of it, though, or anything I could get to put me to sleep." 
 Finally one day, in an unusual show of energy, Wendy went to the family-planning clinic to get a tubal ligation. At 28, she was responsible for 11 children, and the thought of another one petrified her. She happened to go in when Jeanne Miranda, an associate professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University, was screening subjects for a study of poor people suffering from depression. "She was definitely depressed, about as depressed as anyone I'd ever seen," recalls Miranda, who gave Wendy the diagnosis and swiftly put her into group therapy. "It was a relief to know there was something specific wrong," Wendy says. "They asked me to come to a meeting, and that was so hard. I didn't talk. I just cried."
On any given day, roughly 18 million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria for mood disorders, meaning that they have reached an emotional low that impairs their functioning. Three million of those are children. Depression claims more years of useful life in America than war, cancer and AIDS put together, according to the World Health Organization's World Health Report 2000. And the indigent depressed are among the most severely disabled populations in this country. There are no reliable figures on how many of these people there are, but 13.7 percent of Americans live below the poverty line, and according to one recent study, about 42 percent of heads of households receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children meet the criteria for clinical depression -- more than three times the national average. 
Despite the extended debates in the last decade about depression's causes, it seems fairly clear that it is usually the consequence of a genetic vulnerability activated by external stress. Most people have some level of genetic vulnerability. Those with a high vulnerability can have it triggered by a fairly minor event; those with a low degree of vulnerability will be triggered only by more significant trauma. But among the indigent, the traumas are so terrible and so frequent, says Miranda, that searching for the depressed among them is like checking for emphysema among coal miners. The depression rate among the poor is the highest of any social grouping in the United States, so high that many don't notice or question it. "If this is how all your friends are," Miranda says, "it begins to have a certain terrible normality to it."
In travels to some fairly remote parts of the world, I found that much the same rules apply to trauma-prone populations everywhere. Survivors of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia have an extremely high rate of depression. Phaly Nuon, a Cambodian woman who has founded a treatment center and an orphanage in Phnom Penh, describes seeing women who had made it through the horrific years of war only to become so depressed afterward that they let their own children starve to death in the resettlement camps. She said that these women, born to grim lives of rural poverty, had been disabled by what they had seen. I found similar phenomena among the Inuit of Greenland, tribal peoples in Senegal, the urban poor in Russia. Depression rates are very high all around the world among people with hard lives, and these people tend to be disproportionately poor.
Depression can be difficult enough to recognize among the affluent, but if you're way down the socioeconomic ladder, the signs may be even harder to distinguish. When someone in the middle classes becomes depressed and suddenly finds that he can't function at a high level, can't work, begins to withdraw, he is likely to attract the attention of friends and family members. But if you're poor, these symptoms don't seem much of a change. Your life has always been lousy; you've never been able to get or hold a decent job; you've never expected to accomplish much; and you've never entertained the idea that you have much control over what happens to you. 
The depressed poor perceive themselves to be supremely helpless -- so helpless that they neither seek nor embrace support. This means that most people who are poor and depressed stay poor and depressed. Poverty is depressing, and depression, leading as it does to dysfunction and isolation, is impoverishing.
The poor tend to have a passive relationship to fate: their lack of self-determination makes them far more likely to accommodate problems than to solve them (they are, by extension, far less likely to commit suicide than are the empowered). This passivity also causes them to accept treatment as passively as they accept their own misery, which means they can be helped through programs of assertive outreach. Medicaid recipients qualify for extensive care, but they have to claim it, and depressed people do not exercise rights or claim what should be theirs, even if they have the rare sophistication to recognize their own condition. They can be saved only by pressing insight onto them, often through muscular exhortation. 
Miranda is one of a small group of therapists who embrace this idea of assertive intervention. "If you treat their depression," says Miranda, "you give them a new world."
Wendy was not an easy subject at first. On more than one occasion a member of Miranda's staff had to go to her house and persuade her to come out. She said she had no time. She was taciturn and kept people at a distance. "Then they kept calling, telling me to come, pestering and insisting, like they wouldn't let go. I didn't like the first meetings. But I listened to the other women and realized that they had the same problems I was having, and I began to tell them things. I'd never told anyone those things. And the therapist asked us all these questions to change how we thought. And I just felt myself changing, and I began to get stronger."
After two months of group therapy, Wendy told her husband that she was leaving. "There was no arguing because I just didn't argue back. I just told him, 'I'm gone.' I was so strong. I was so happy."
It took two more months of therapy before Wendy found a job. Now, while she goes to work at a child-care center for the Navy, her children and her sister's go to school or another local child-care center. With her new salary, she has set herself and the children up in a new apartment. And a year into her group therapy, she plans to continue for as long as Miranda's program is operating. "My kids are so much happier," Wendy says. "They want to do things all the time now. We talk for hours every day. We read and do homework all together. We joke around. We all talk about careers, and before they didn't even think careers. I talk to them about drugs, and they've seen my sister, and they keep clean now. They don't cry like they used to. They don't fight like they did. 
"I never thought I would get this far. It feels good to be happy. I don't know how long it's going to last, but I sure hope it's forever." She smiles and shakes her head in wonder. "And if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that, I'd still be at home in bed, if I was still alive at all." Miranda says, "There are thousands of success stories as magical as this one, just waiting for appropriate interventions."
The treatments Wendy received did not include psychopharmaceutical intervention. What was it that enabled this metamorphosis? In part, it was simply the steady glow of attention from the doctors with whom she worked. In part, it was a cognitive shift. Miranda described Wendy as "clearly" having depression, but this had not been clear to Wendy even when she suffered extreme symptoms. The labeling of her complaint was an essential step toward her recovery from it. What can be named and described can be contained: the word "depression" separated Wendy's illness from her personality. If all the things she disliked in herself could be grouped elegantly together as aspects of a disease, that left her good qualities as the "real" Wendy, and it was much easier for her to like this real Wendy and to turn this real Wendy against the problems that afflicted her. To be given the idea of depression is to master a socially powerful linguistic tool. There are no people so starved for this vocabulary as the indigent depressed, which is why basic tools like cognitive group therapy can be so utterly transforming for them.
Many women in Wendy's situation would be even more expeditiously helped by pharmaceuticals. There are four impediments to such broadband treatment programs. The first is that the indigent populations who might be helped by medication have never really been identified. The second is that to be effective, antidepressant medications must be taken on an ongoing basis over an extended period of time. The lower people's education levels, the less likely they are to take a medication that does not have any immediately palpable effect when they take it. Such people are also unlikely to continue to take their pills once their symptoms have lifted. The third, of course, is cost, though in absolute terms it costs less to provide medication than it does to provide the social services that the indigent require. The fourth is a mode of transmission. Pharmaceutical executives to whom I mentioned all the above said they would willingly set up programs to discount medication for use in these populations if there were a way to convey it. "I simply didn't know that such a phenomenon existed on the scale you are describing," one executive told me. In the absence of government programs to facilitate the distribution of antidepressants to this population, however, even the most well-intentioned members of the pharmaceutical industry are stymied.
The privately financed Treatment Advocacy Center is the most conservative body issuing policy on treatment, and its position is that people whose condition can be improved through treatment should receive it whether they want to or not. It is their view that those who resist treatment place an unconscionable and unnecessary burden on society. The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, a nonprofit policy group at the other end of the spectrum, believes that commitment should almost always be voluntary and defines mental illness as interpretive. The A.C.L.U. takes the middle ground. It has published a statement that "the freedom to be wandering the streets, psychotic, ill and untreated, when there is a reasonable prospect of effective treatment, is not freedom; it is abandonment" -- though it also supports the right of people to make decisions about their own lives. The problem is that desperate people often dislike help because they do not believe that help will set them free. The answer is neither forced treatment nor abandonment; it is a process of forceful seduction predicated on the principle that those who are treated will be glad after the fact to have received such attention.
Joseph Rogers, the head of the Mental Health Association of Southeastern Pennsylvania, was indigent and depressed himself at one time; he spent a year living on a bench in Central Park before being drawn into an outreach program. "People who are isolated and lost are usually desperate for a little human connection," Rogers says. "Outreach can work. You just have to be willing to go out and engage them and re-engage them until they're ready to come with you." Rogers has helped to make Pennsylvania one of the most progressive states in the nation for mental health. In fact many people from neighboring states get shipped into Pennsylvania so they can take advantage of the systems there. 
Rogers also has created a chain of what he calls "drop-in centers," which are street-level storefronts, usually staffed by people who are themselves recovering from mental illnesses. This creates employment for the people who are just beginning to cope with a structured environment, and it gives people who are in bad shape a place to go and receive advice. Drop-in centers provide a transit zone between mental isolation and companionship. 
Popular wisdom holds that you need to address unemployment before you start worrying about the fancy business of the mental health of the unemployed. And greater prosperity is a good trigger for recovery. But it is perhaps easier and equally reasonable to treat the depression itself so that these people can alter their own lives.
Our failure to identify and treat the indigent depressed is not only cruel but also costly. Many of the depressed poor are welfare recipients who cannot hold jobs. They are given to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors. They are sometimes violent. Infants of depressed mothers show brain-wave patterns different from those of other infants, according to a study by Tiffany Field, chair of the Touch Research Institute. These altered patterns seem to relate to the closing down of essential brain circuits that, if they do not function in childhood, are probably inoperative later on. Treat the depression in the mother, and the infant's brain waves are likely to normalize. When a depressed mother is not treated, her children tend to end up in the welfare and prison systems: the sons of mothers with untreated depression are eight times more likely to become juvenile delinquents as are other children. Daughters of depressed mothers will have earlier puberty than other girls, according to a recent paper by Bruce Ellis and Judy Garber in the journal Child Development. And early puberty is usually associated with promiscuity, early pregnancy and mood disorders. 
According to the 1998 Green Book of the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means, state and federal government spends roughly $20 billion on cash transfers to poor nonelderly adults and their children, and roughly the same amount for food stamps for such families. If one makes the conservative estimate that 25 percent of people on welfare are depressed, that half of them can be treated successfully and that of that percentage, two-thirds could return to productive, at least part-time, work, factoring in treatment costs, that would still reduce welfare costs by as much as 8 percent -- a savings of almost $3.5 billion per year. Because the federal government also provides health care and other transfers for such families, the true savings could be quite a bit higher.
The dollar cost of interventionist treatment of depression is really quite small; the dollar cost of not treating depression is enormous. "Postponement of intervention does not result in savings," Representative Marge Roukema, a Republican from New Jersey and the co-chairwoman of the Working Group on Mental Illness, says. "You're really building in greater costs."
For more than a decade, Glenn Treisman of Johns Hopkins University has been studying and treating depression among indigent H.I.V.-positive and AIDS populations in Baltimore, most of whom are also substance-abusers. "Many people get H.I.V. when they can't muster the energy to care anymore," Treisman says. "These are people who are utterly demoralized by life and don't see any point in it. If we had treatments more broadly available for depression, I would guess from my clinical experience that the rate of H.I.V. infection in this country would be cut in half at least, with enormous consequent public-health savings." 
Mental-Health Services are still focused primarily on the noisy disorders, with schizophrenia and mania at the top of the list. "Of course we want to help nonviolent mentally ill people just as much as we want to help violent ones," Roukema told me. "But to draw any kind of substantial support, we have to show people that it serves their urgent self-interest to do something about mental-health care for the poor. We have to talk about preventing atrocious crimes that could be visited on them or their constituents at any moment. We can't talk simply about a better and more prosperous and more humane state."
There is no discussion in Congress at present about depression among the uninsured. Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who has been the joint sponsor of several important mental-health bills, says this situation is unlikely to change. "If you're asking whether we can expect much change simply because that change would serve everyone's advantage in immediate economic and human terms," Domenici says, "I regret to tell you that the answer is no."
It is hard to find anyone in Congress who is opposed on principle to healing the mentally ill. "The opposition is competition," says Representative John Porter, an Illinois Republican who until January was the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. Nonetheless, while declarations about the tragic nature of suicide and the danger of psychiatric complaints accumulate on the Congressional record, legislation pertinent to these statistics does not pass easily. "Progress here is excruciatingly gradual," says Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who has made regular attempts to introduce comprehensive legislation for mental-illness coverage. "The uninsured haven't even made it onto the radar screen around here yet."
There are programs, even some good ones, that are available to the poor mentally ill, but they exist inside hospitals. You have to find them yourself. Public-relations campaigns for treating mental illnesses -- signs on buses, TV ad spots and so on -- have had some success at bringing people into clinics, but the idea that indigent depressed people will ever have the wherewithal to seek and find help, even if they did figure out for themselves that they were depressed, is ludicrous. A program that did a basic mental-health screening at family-planning clinics or at job centers or at places where welfare checks are distributed might allow us at least to identify the people who are currently suffering from illness.
But the best place to start would probably be the welfare rolls. Major depression is frequently triggered by stresses, and there is no question that the lives of welfare recipients are extremely stressful. At the moment, however, welfare officers do no significant screening for depression. Welfare programs are essentially run by administrators, who do little or no actual social work. What tends to be noted in welfare reports as noncompliance is in many instances motivated by psychiatric trouble.
Some pilot studies are under way on the treatment of depression among the poor, and the results appear surprisingly consistent. I was given full access to subjects from several of these studies -- some involved therapy, others medication, still others a combination of the two. To my surprise, everyone I met felt that his or her lot had improved during treatment. They felt better about their lives, and they lived better. Even when faced with insurmountable obstacles, they progressed, often fast and sometimes far. Over and over again, as I spoke to more poor people who had been treated for depression, I heard tones of astonishment. How, after so many things had gone wrong for them, had they been swept up by this help that had changed their entire lives? "I asked the Lord to send me an angel," one woman told me. "And he answered my prayers."

HEADLINE: 10. CASE STUDY: MENOPAUSE; LOCATION: NEW YORK; 
The Estrogen Alternative

BYLINE:  By Sheryl Gay Stolberg; Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports on medicine and health policy for The Times.

 BODY:
There isn't a 50-year-old woman in America today who isn't obsessed with menopause. In my grandmother's day, the loss of a woman's ability to have babies was chalked up, quietly, to "the change of life" -- if, that is, she lived that long. Now aging baby boomers, never quiet about anything, can spend as many years without functioning ovaries as with them. Menopause, circa 2001, is no longer a life passage. It is a medical event.
 Of all the symptoms of menopause, the hot flash is the most intriguing. A classic hot flash begins with an aura, a vague sensation in the face and neck that blossoms over a period of a minute or two, skin temperature rising, pulse quickening, into a full-blown wave of heat and blushing and drenching sweat, often followed by chills. Japanese women, mysteriously, report fewer hot flashes than Americans. Spicy foods and hot drinks trigger hot flashes in some women but not others. Some women flash only sporadically. Some flash like clockwork, night and day, some only during sleep. 
 For decades, the standard therapy for hot flashes has been the hormone estrogen. The good news about estrogen is that it prevents osteoporosis, and possibly heart disease; the bad news is that, taken long-term, it may increase the risk of breast cancer. This has put the modern menopause generation in a pickle. 
Now comes a possible solution to the estrogen dilemma: black cohosh, the leading herbal therapy for hot flashes in Europe. A cousin of the buttercup, with tall spikes of brilliant white flowers and a gnarled, resin-scented root, black cohosh -- the name is believed to be Indian in origin -- grows wild in the deciduous forests of the eastern United States. American Indians have used it as a folk remedy for centuries. The Cherokee relied on alcoholic spirits of black cohosh root to treat rheumatism and ground the root into teas to treat consumption and fatigue; the Algonquins used it for kidney trouble. By 1849, the newly formed American Medical Association was describing black cohosh as useful for "the debility of females attendant upon uterine disorder." 
Today, the extract of black cohosh's roots and rhizome is sold in capsules or tablets of varying strength and dispensed in European pharmacies as a drug. Though no one is quite certain how the herb works, German studies show it is better at treating hot flashes than dummy pills, and Commission E, a German panel of scientific experts, recommends black cohosh for menopause and menstrual cramps. Word has spread across the Atlantic; according to Nutrition Business Journal, a trade publication, sales of black cohosh preparations in this country jumped to $34 million in 1999, from $11 million the year before -- a trend that is occurring almost entirely outside the medical mainstream, because many American doctors behave as though herbal remedies don't exist.
"Eighty percent of the world's population relies on traditional forms of medicine, chiefly herbal medicine," says Steven Foster, an expert on native American herbs. "From a global perspective, the United States is a third-world country when it comes to herbal products." In 1998, Foster published a review of the black cohosh medical literature in HerbalGram, a publication of the American Botanical Council, a nonprofit research and education group. "Black cohosh," Foster writes, "is a rising star on the herbal horizon." 
Now the National Institutes of Health is weighing in -- to either make all this official or debunk it. At Columbia University, Fredi Kronenberg, an expert in hot flashes who also directs the Rosenthal Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at Columbia, has a grant from the N.I.H. to study black cohosh; so, too, does Norman Farnsworth, a professor of pharmacognosy at the University of Illinois at Chicago and one of the nation's leading experts on medicinal plants. Both are running clinical trials that will subject black cohosh to the rigors of modern American science, testing its safety and effectiveness against that of placebos. And both are directing basic research to understand the herb's biological mechanisms.
No matter how these studies turn out, black cohosh will never replace estrogen, because it is probably not as powerful as the hormone and may not have the same positive effect on bones and the heart. But if it does ease hot flashes -- and both Kronenberg and Farnsworth say that based on past research there is little reason to think it will not -- American doctors may one day find themselves doing the unthinkable: recommending a traditional botanical folk remedy as an alternative to a modern prescription drug. 
A decade ago, there would have been little place for this kind of research in academic medicine; many serious scientists dismissed botanical remedies as quackery. But in recent years, just about every big-name university in the country -- Johns Hopkins, Duke, the University of California at Los Angeles -- has become involved in some type of alternative-medicine research. Their studies offer the promise of new treatments for everything from Alzheimer's disease to heart disease to AIDS.
The driving force behind this work is Congress, which in 1992 gave the National Institutes of Health $2 million to open an office of alternative medicine -- an initiative that many at the N.I.H. scorned as a waste of money and time. Two years later, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which classifies herbs as dietary supplements, as opposed to drugs, and allows them to be sold without the approval of the Food and Drug Administration or the stringent testing required of pharmaceuticals, so long as their manufacturers do not claim to prevent or treat disease.
The result has been an explosion in botanical sales; Americans spent $4 billion last year on herbal remedies, Nutrition Business Journal says, double what was spent in 1994. In Washington, meanwhile, Congress has kept pouring money into the N.I.H. alternative-medicine office; it has since evolved into the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, with a budget of $89 million and a well-respected virologist, Dr. Stephen E. Straus, as its director.
Straus has no particular affinity for herbs; asked if he takes any, he shakes his head in a vociferous no, as if to say yes would admit some kind of weakness or bias. His mission, he says, is simply to apply "exacting science" to the alternative therapies Americans are already spending money on. To that end, his center is financing studies on a laundry list of popular medicinal plants: gingko for memory loss; saw palmetto for enlarged prostate; echinacea for childhood ear infections. The first large-scale study, a $4.3 million four-year examination of St. John's Wort to treat mild depression, led by a team at Duke, is due to report results this fall. These herbs are in no way a panacea: another study, financed by a different branch of the N.I.H. and Pfizer, which makes a St. John's Wort extract, recently found it useless for serious depression.
Still, Straus says: "The Western scientific tradition has been enormously successful, but admittedly, it doesn't solve everything. The thought is that herbal remedies harbor all sorts of forgotten secrets. The fundamental question is, Are these claims correct?" 
To listen to Straus talk, it might sound as if nobody had ever studied herbal remedies before, but that is hardly the case. The problem for American doctors is that the research is not American research, conducted according to the strict standards to which pharmaceutical companies adhere. But that, says Varro E. Tyler, a professor emeritus of pharmacognosy at Purdue University, has more to do with pharmaceutical economics than whether botanicals are useful for treating disease.
Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, American medicine was steeped in herbals; black cohosh was listed in the United States Pharmacopoeia, the nation's official drug reference book, from 1820 to 1926. But around the time of World War II, drug manufacturers began focusing almost exclusively on synthetic molecules that, unlike herbs, could be patented and held the promise of big profits. So research stopped, and medicinal plants were dropped from use.
"It makes me very angry," Tyler says. "Many of these things are native American plants, like echinacea and saw palmetto, black cohosh. But we dropped them largely because companies felt they couldn't make any money on them." 
They were not dropped in Europe; Germans, especially, remained faithful to their long history with botanicals. "During the Third Reich, the Nazis actually promoted it," says Edzard Ernst, a Munich native and professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter in England. "They liked the idea of natural medicine. It fitted their ideology. It was very German, homemade, very Teutonic, that sort of thing. And potentially very cheap." 
With so many German doctors prescribing herbals, Ernst says, it was inevitable that manufacturers would begin doing research, if only to give themselves a marketing edge. The leading black cohosh manufacturer is Schaper & Brummer, which has been selling the herb under the trade name RemiFemin since 1955. Over the past half-century, about 15 clinical studies of black cohosh have been published in the scientific literature. Every one of them, says Johannes Freudenstein, head of research and production at Schaper & Brummer, has been conducted either by his company or with its product.
The best studies, Freudenstein says, show that RemiFemin is nearly as effective as estrogen and far more effective than dummy pills at treating hot flashes and is also useful in managing the mood swings and irritability that may go along with menopause. 
None of the clinical trials lasted longer than six months, so the jury is still out on whether black cohosh is safe over the long term. But the Schaper & Brummer findings were compelling enough to lure GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical giant, into a partnership with the German firm; Glaxo recently acquired the rights to market RemiFemin as a dietary supplement in the United States and is now waging a promotional blitz, complete with a national television ad campaign.
Michele Klingensmith, the Glaxo official managing RemiFemin's American introduction, explains her company's interest this way: Glaxo wanted to get into the herbal business and was looking for products that would fill unmet medical needs. "When we saw the data, we said, 'This is perfect."' 
But RemiFemin is hardly the only black cohosh preparation on the market, as a visit with Fredi Kronenberg confirms. On her desk she has an array of two dozen products containing black cohosh: teas and tinctures, creams and pills, with soothing pictures of flowers on their boxes and names like Flash-Ease and MenoPoise. Even Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, patented in 1876 "for the female discomforts," is advertising itself as Lydia Pinkham Herbal Compound, "now with black cohosh." 
The collection irritates Kronenberg; each May, she leads a course in botanical medicine for doctors who, she says, are often as confused as patients by the many herbs on the market. "They are all different dosages," she complains of the black cohosh collection. "Some are ground root. Some are extract, some have subtherapeutic doses, and the public just doesn't know what to make of it." 
Yet neither her study nor Farnsworth's will help sort the mess out. That is because women in their clinical trials will receive black cohosh extract prepared according to each study's specifications. The studies will answer only the narrow question of whether those two particular preparations have benefits. This is a problem common to all studies of herbs, and Farnsworth and Kronenberg approach it differently. 
If his study shows a positive effect, Farnsworth says, the University of Illinois could patent his group's "unique method" for standardizing black cohosh extract and then license that method to a company that would market a competitor to RemiFemin and the rest. Kronenberg, for her part, is not interested in commercializing black cohosh.
"I'm just interested in understanding how it works," she says. 
Knowing how black cohosh works, of course, will be essential to persuading American doctors to recommend it. Farnsworth explains: "If you know the mechanism of action, you can predict ahead of time what this extract might interact with. Then you can advise people whether or not to take it, or how to take it without getting side effects." 
But as for mechanism, unanswered questions abound. A 1985 pharmacological study conducted in Germany reported that black cohosh contained an isoflavone, a type of phytoestrogen, or plant estrogen. (Isoflavones are also found in soy, which has been studied as a treatment for hot flashes, on the theory that a soy-rich diet is the reason Japanese women have fewer of them.)
The isoflavone discovery offered a plausible explanation for how black cohosh works. But scientists have found contradictory results; in a recent analysis of 13 black cohosh samples, Kronenberg and her colleagues failed to find the compound. "We don't think it's in there," she says. And Farnsworth says his research suggests that black cohosh acts not on estrogen receptors (as it would if it contained isoflavones) but rather on the hypothalamus, the gland involved in regulating hormones and body temperature.
Or perhaps black cohosh contains an estrogenlike compound that hasn't been identified. If so, black cohosh, like estrogen, might indeed turn out to be good for the bones and the heart. But obvious questions remain. Is it safe for women who are at risk of breast cancer? And if it is safe, what is the proper dose? RemiFemin's recommended dose is 40 milligrams a day. Kronenberg's and Farnsworth's studies will test different amounts.
But then again, black cohosh may be nothing more than a dressed-up dummy pill. Menopause experts have long known that there is a powerful placebo effect in treating hot flashes; Dr. Wulf Utian, executive director of the North American Menopause Society, a scientific group that Kronenberg helped found, says that as many as 40 percent of women get relief from hot flashes with dummy pills. Despite the media hype over soy, Utian says, rigorous studies are showing little difference between it and placebos. "And that's what I would expect with black cohosh," he adds.
The scientist in Kronenberg thinks it is likely to be proved effective. But the naturalist in her can't help worrying that there might be a downside to the sudden explosion of botanical research. While some companies have recently begun cultivating black cohosh, a 1998 paper from the American Botanical Council warned that a growing commercial demand for the herb could threaten its long-term viability in its native environment. What will happen to the world's plant life if studies like Kronenberg's foster a big appetite among Americans for certain herbs? How will cultures that depend on botanicals as their only source of medicine be affected? 
And will the appeal of alternative medicine -- the idea that plants can heal, that they offer people the power to take their care into their own hands, far from the realm of the doctor's office -- be lost if botanicals like black cohosh are treated as just another drug? Part of the allure of herbal therapies is that they tap into a yearning for a simpler time, when menopause was nothing more than the change of life and Grandma's old-fashioned remedy might suffice. What will happen, then, if science takes the alternative out of alternative medicine?

HEADLINE: 1. CASE STUDY: GLOBALIZATION; LOCATION: EVERYWHERE; 
Together, in Sickness and in Health

BYLINE:  By Natalie Angier; Natalie Angier writes about science for The New York Times. Her latest book is "Woman: An Intimate Geography."

 BODY:
Not long ago, my older brother, Joe, flew in from Los Angeles for a family gathering at my home outside Washington, looking paler than a dieting vampire and muttering that he might be "coming down with something." The rest of us eyed him warily, washed our hands compulsively and broke out the echinacea and vitamin C. 
 By the time my brother-in-law, Dave, had flown back to Oregon, he was too sick to return to work. My daughter and I also took to bed for a day or two, but then gamely pulled ourselves together to attend a big party at my mother's apartment in Manhattan -- after which we collapsed once more in fevered, achy near-delirium. Later my mother told me that party guests from two different states had called to complain that I had given them some sort of "bug." 
 And so from one humble plucking of the kinship bond came an Attila-scale distribution of the season's flu virus, itself a strain that most likely had its genesis in Asia. My story is hardly unusual, and that is exactly my point. Today, diseases as common as the cold and as rare as Ebola are circling the globe with near telephonic speed, making long-distance connections and intercontinental infections almost as if by satellite. You needn't even bother to reach out and touch someone. If you live, if you're homeothermic biomass, you will be reached and touched. Microbes are, after all, members of the most ancient, zealous and Darwinically gilded 24-7 delivery consortium. They travel by land, sea, air, nose, blows, glove, love, sewage, steerage, rat backs, hat racks, uncooked burritos, overlooked mosquitoes.
And, oh, how they love the global village. How readily, for microbes, that village feels like home. Whether it's the recent outbreak of cholera in Buenos Aires, after years during which Latin America was free of the disease, or the debut in the emergency rooms of Manhattan of an African-born illness like West Nile fever, the globalization of disease is an unavoidable byproduct of the high holy multicultural hustle. And though microbes have always had the traveling bug, in centuries past, it at least took a few weeks or months for sailors to deliver a ship of rats bearing fleas with bubonic-plague bacteria from the Orient to Europe. Nowadays, a mosquito infested with the malaria parasite can be buzzing in Ghana at dawn and dining on an airport employee in Boston by cocktail hour. 
Every day brings fresh evidence of how intimate are the links that lash together nations, peoples, bodies, species. One land's meat, for example, seems every land's poison, as hapless Britain has struggled with a double whammy on its livestock. Since 1988, nearly 180,000 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -- aka mad cow disease -- have been reported in British cattle, along with several thousand cases elsewhere in Europe, raising fears that we're eating tainted hamburgers capable of delivering into our brains the deadly agent of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and prompting the Department of Agriculture to ban animal protein products from Europe. Vegetarianism has beckoned even more brightly in the last few weeks with the televised images of macabre mass barbecues, as Britain, the Netherlands and a number of other countries have struggled to combat the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among their livestock. Nearly five million animals in Britain and hundreds of thousands elsewhere in Europe have been killed or await execution, resulting in meat, dairy and leather shortages worldwide, not to mention the tanning of the political hide of the British prime minister, Tony Blair. 
"The globalization of health and disease is an incontrovertible fact," said Christopher J. Murray, a policy director with the World Health Organization in Geneva and an author of an influential report, "The Global Burden of Disease." "The travel and interaction between continents, and the exchange of people, animals, animal products, food products, disease vectors, are all vastly greater than in the past, and so is the potential for pathogens to move quickly from one place to another." 
"Today I can be in a place like Mecca, where there's an outbreak of meningitis, and I would not know I was sick with it until I got home," said David L. Heymann, executive director in charge of communicable diseases at the World Health Organization in Geneva. "And think of all the people I'd expose on my trip back." Especially given the robustly recycled vaporous substance that passes for air in a modern jetliner. 
The United States can give as well as it gets. In 1998, nearly 1,500 athletes from around the world competed in a triathlon in Springfield, Ill., where they were exposed during the swim portion of the event to leptospirosis bacteria, which can cause fever, chills, jaundice, meningitis and kidney failure. Of these, 72 sought medical attention, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent many weeks tracking down all the participants to warn them of possible symptoms and to seek immediate treatment should they arise, before permanent organ damage set in. Moreover, there was some risk of infected people releasing leptospirosis microbes into local water supplies through urination, further dispensing America's inadvertent gift to the spirit of international competition. "There's no epidemic in even the smallest corner of the globe that the world can afford to ignore," said Jacquelyn C. Campbell, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and a former member of the Institute of Medicine's Board on Global Health. "We're so interconnected that an isolationist's perspective is no longer an option."
A true understanding of that growing interconnectedness has to include the developing world, where most of the people on the planet live and where infectious diseases account for almost half the deaths each year. Half of those deaths can be attributed to three "pedestrian" yet persistently devastating diseases: malaria, H.I.V./AIDS and tuberculosis. Malaria kills more than one million people annually, the overwhelming majority of them children in sub-Saharan Africa. Many millions of other people living in more than 90 countries suffer from malaria, sometimes contracting it repeatedly year after year. Though they don't die of the disease, the debility and cost are enormous. By one estimate, Africa's gross domestic product would be $100 billion greater today than it is if malaria had been eliminated. And the warming global climate is carrying those malaria-bearing mosquitoes north. So is the 2:43 out of Kinshasa: planes landing in Charles de Gaulle Airport have recently been found to be carrying more than a few nonpaying passengers, leading European airlines to step up their preflight extermination efforts.
Sub-Saharan Africa also has taken the most brutal jackhammering from the AIDS epidemic. Of the 35 million people living with H.I.V. or AIDS in the world, 25 million are in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 5.4 million people who are newly infected with the virus each year, 4 million live in sub-Saharan Africa. Helen Epstein, a former instructor at Makerere University School of Medicine in Uganda, wrote recently in The New York Review of Books that "the AIDS epidemic in Africa may turn out to be the worst health crisis in the history of the human race." Thanks to the effectiveness of new drug regimens, Westerners have developed the false sense that AIDS is no longer a lethal disease. But apart from the fact that nobody knows how long patients on the new drug regimens will survive before the virus finally outmutates the current armamentarium, these drugs are expensive and difficult to take. 
Moreover, the AIDS epidemic in Africa is unlikely to remain confined to Africa: the strains of H.I.V. running rampant there, if left unchecked, are sure to gain novel malevolence that would allow them to spread elsewhere and overwhelm whatever resources we have devoted to defeating our Western-bred strains. And keep in mind that other highly populous countries like China and India are just beginning to feel the brunt of the disease. There's a perversely poetic loopiness at work: a disease that presumably had its origins in Africa made its first angry mark in America, then exploded in Africa, and is now moving onward, outward and back again, cat's-cradle style. It's not "Africa's" health crisis alone.
The only sane response to the world's AIDS crisis remains prevention -- a response that hardly attracts an ounce of attention, let alone pounds, dollars or rubles. Last year, a total of $165 million from all sources was devoted to AIDS prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with the $2.5 billion estimated as necessary to do even a perfunctory job. "When you see $9billion going into the response to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, where you would expect a few hundred or maybe a few thousand cases at the most, while other, far greater public health problems are seriously neglected, we have to ask if we're getting the bang for our health bucks that we ought to get," said Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel-laureate infectious-disease expert at Rockefeller University. Don't look to the United States to swoop in and fix it: of the top 20 industrialized nations, the United States devotes the smallest percentage of its gross domestic product to battling these international epidemics.
But disease isn't the only thing moving around the globe with increasing speed, binding far-flung countries together in a mutual medical destiny. Medicines and methods of treatment are also part of the worldwide exchange. Pharmaceutical companies in the United States and Europe export a vast array of medications -- from penicillin to protease inhibitors -- to the developing world. And by seeking out alternative, local solutions from around the world, those companies, along with the best-endowed Western hospitals and research facilities, are beginning to level the balance of trade.
Where their citizens' health is concerned, some developing nations clearly have the edge over us on doing much more at fire-sale prices. In Chile, for example, the per-capita income today is about $5,000, the same as it was in the United States in the year 1900. But while the average life expectancy in our country a century ago was 47, in Chile today it is 76 -- pretty much the same as ours is now. And while Cuba remains an economic backwater, Castro's commitment to universal health care has paid off: the infant mortality rate there is the lowest by far in Latin America. (Meanwhile, the United States, which has the finest available health care, was ranked 54th by the World Health Organization in terms of equality of access.) Whatever our squeamishness over methodology, we have a lot to learn from these countries and from others that have demonstrated successes in treating disease with a fraction of our resources. 
We also have a lot to learn about the potential medical applications of herbs and extracts native to obscure corners of the continents. Seeking them out and bringing them back to the lab for study -- bioprospecting, as these hunting expeditions have come to be known -- has become a big business unto itself, incorporating the quest not only for flora, fauna and fungi, but even for exotic human genes to which biotech companies now routinely purchase the rights in hopes they will yield some insight, and some profit.
Globalization has also underscored a potentially universal source of human strength: in the tribe. We are clansfolk at heart, hardly past the mutual flea-plucking stage, and evolved to traffic comfortably with a few scores of people at best. As a result, global health care workers have found that the most effective health programs are local and inclusive. For example, says Patricia L. Rosenfield of the Carnegie Corporation in New York and a former member of the Board on Global Health, "Thailand has one of the most effective AIDS programs in the world because they take the power of the community seriously." Their education efforts are concentrated locally on individual villages, schools, groups of prostitutes. The lesson of "think global, nag local" can work here too: when doctors in Minnesota took the time to contact families whose children need follow-up booster shots, the overall effectiveness of the local vaccination program rose markedly. And tuberculosis outbreaks in both Africa and New York have been tamed by keeping an eye on infected people and ensuring that they take their medications every day.
As a number of articles in this issue make clear, the world is moving beyond the old polarities of ancient and modern, global and vernacular, high-tech and no-tech. We're not just mixing our microbes; we're hybridizing our medical traditions. Elisabeth Rosenthal describes a promising treatment being used at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center that was developed by a folk healer in rural China. Matthew Steinglass visits a tribal doctor in South Africa who dispenses Western analgesics along with his herbal potions. In an article about a family of noble Italian lineage whose members suffer from an exceedingly rare genetic disease called fatal familial insomnia, D.T. Max describes the insights that the affliction has yielded into the general nature of prions, rogue proteins believed to be responsible for a number of brain disorders, mad cow disease among them. 
It's not always easy to admit that other tribes are more enlightened than we are. America refuses to adopt the metric system, by gum, and we're way behind most countries of the world when it comes to the promotion and acceptance of the finest form of disease prevention known to medicine -- breast-feeding. Sara Corbett describes the outrage and disgust that a Delaware woman elicits because she nurses her 4-year-old twins, though in many traditional societies breast-feeding children of 4, 5, 6 years of age is considered a sign of superlative mothering. And despite the sustained scoffery of American doctors, a number of "folk" remedies may be every bit as worthy as their mainstream pharmaco-counterparts, as Sheryl Gay Stolberg makes clear in her discussion of herbs like black cohosh, widely used in Europe but not here, to treat the symptoms of menopause. 
In the end, then, the great global agora of medicine is all about barter: buying, selling, swapping, titting, tatting, seducing and swindling. We import a malign parasite here, we export a rotten fast-food franchise there. Merck donates medicines for river blindness to Africa. Americans fly to Thailand for discount plastic surgery. Through the Internet, too, we've become an obligate if virtual superorganism, busy bees without borders, compulsively foraging through a billion sites for sensation, guidance, palliatives or cures for lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, nailbiting, insomnia, narcissism.
There is something unnerving about the distending volume of health information ricocheting through our cyberhive, much of it unexpurgated, unedited and unconfirmed. At the same time, there is something glorious -- O.K., I'll call it miraculous -- about anybody anywhere having free, instant computer access to Medline and all the papers published in thousands of medical journals around the world. Our modems have become medical devices, and as fast as microbes can move nowadays, ideas, Google willing, will always outrun them.

HEADLINE: Q and A 

BYLINE:  By PAUL FREIREICH

 BODY:
The Jews of Manaus
Q. We are interested in learning about places of Jewish interest in Manaus, Brazil. -- Anita Lifson, Washington 
 A. About 900 miles inland from the Atlantic, Manaus is the capital of the state of Amazonas, in northwest Brazil. Of the city's 1.5 million people, about 800 are Jewish, according to Isaac Dahan, the local synagogue's cantor. 
 The Jewish community of Manaus dates from about 1890, when Jews were fleeing poverty and an uncertain life in Morocco and when Brazil was experiencing a rubber boom. The smuggling of seeds for rubber trees out of Brazil to England in 1876 and the successful planting of seedlings in Indonesia and Ceylon eventually helped cause the bubble to burst.
Early in the 20th century, there were 4,000 Jews in Manaus. Its first synagogue opened in 1920 and the second followed 17 years later. The two merged in 1960 when the Beth Yaacov-Rabi Meyr synagogue was built at 630, Rua Leonardo Malcher; telephone (55-92) 234-9558. Services are held on Saturday and on the major holidays. Only last month 200 people attended a seder on the second night of Passover at the community center, the Clube Hebraica Manaus, 1842, Avenida Joaquim Nabuco; (55-92) 233-0217.
There are no scheduled guided tours to Jewish sites, one of which is a cemetery. But Fontur Travel Agency, at (55-92) 658-3052, can arrange a three-hour tour by car with an English-speaking guide for $110 a couple. 
Among the attractions of Manaus, a major jumping-off spot for tours of the Amazon, is the grand 700-seat Teatro Amazonas that dates from 1896, the era of the rubber boom. For a glimpse, visit www.internext.com .br/demasi. An opera festival, already in progress at the theater, on the Rua Tapajos, runs until May 26. Telephone: (55-92) 622-1880.

Biking in Amsterdam
Q. My husband and I will be vacationing in Amsterdam in June with our children, aged 13 and 19. Ideally, we would like daylong bike trips from Amsterdam that might help them meet other students. -- S. C., Bethlehem, Pa.
A. There are at least a couple of companies in Amsterdam that run daily tours on rented bikes and there are some that do just rentals. 
Mike's Bike Tours, at Lijnbaans gracht 302A, telephone (31-20) 6227970, attracts students and backpackers, says its manager, Mike Luksetitch. On the Web, see www .mikesbiketours.com/amsterdam .html. Tours, which meet in front of the west entrance of the Rijks museum, run three to four hours. From May 1 to Aug. 31, they start at 11:30 and 4 p.m. The price, now $15.10, at 2.45 guilders to the dollar, rises to $17.15 on June 1. A rental without a tour is $10.20 a day. Credit cards not accepted. The bicycles used are Schwinns with six gears.
While there may be 15 to 20 cyclists on an average tour, there is no maximum. Bicyclists travel along the Amstel River, passing a windmill, farm and factory that makes both cheese and clogs. Then they pass the Vondel Park, break for a beer at the square known as the Leidseplein. (Your 13-year-old need not drink, of course, but you may or may not feel comfortable with a stop at a pub.) 
If time permits, the route may include the Jordaan district, sort of a miniature Greenwich Village; the Anne Frank House or the West Church (Westkerk). 
Yellow Bike Guided Tours, at Nieuwzijds Kolk 29 (near Centraal Station), (31-20) 6206940, fax (31-20) 6207 140, www.yellowbike.nl, runs tours of the city and the countryside daily from April 1 to Oct. 31. The three-hour city tours depart at 9:30 a.m. and 1 p.m., and cost $14.25; the six-hour countryside tours depart at 11 a.m., and cost $18.40. Credit cards are not accepted. 
Tour groups are limited in size to15 for the country and 12 for the city. The bikes are the company's own Yellow Bikes, which have no gears. 
Bicyclists on the city tour pass by or through the harbor, the Anne Frank House, the Jordaan district and the Vondel Park, the Van Gogh Museum, the Rembrandt House and the red light district. Along the way, there's a stop for a coffee break. The countryside tour heads north of Amsterdam, follows the dike and passes a windmill. It stops for lunch at a pancake house in Broek, which is not included in the charge. 
Visitors to Amsterdam who prefer to strike out on their own can rent from one of these companies, whose rates depend on the model: 
MacBike, Mr. Visserplein 2, (31-20) 6200985, fax (31-20) 4222579; www.macbike.nl. The daily rate is $5.10 to $7.65. The company plans to offer guided three-hour tours daily for $10.20 plus the bike rental fee. 
Bike City, 68-70 Bloemgracht, (31-20) 6263721, fax (31-20) 4223326; www.bikecity.nl. The rate is 12.50 to 23.50 guilders. If a credit card is used, a 5 percent charge is added.

Seattle to Vancouver
Q. My family of 10 adults is meeting in Seattle with plans to travel to Vancouver to start an Alaskan cruise. Rather than pay 10 separate fares of $45 to the cruise company, we thought it might be more fun to rent a van or a bus and driver if the cost were comparable to the $450 we would otherwise pay. Can you advise? -- Ernest Prupi, Seabrook Island, S.C.
A. It takes about three hours to cover the 140 miles between Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Vancouver. For 10 people, a van or a minibus are the realistic options. A stretch limousine may sound like the stuff of fantasy, but it won't have room for all the luggage. 
Bayview Limousine Service, 22001 Pacific Highway South, Des Moines; (800) 606-7880 or (206) 824-6200, fax (206) 824-9884, www.bayviewlimo .com. It has Ford and Dodge vans in the 1998 to 2000 model years. Normally, they seat 14 passengers plus the driver. But to allow room for luggage, the rear seat is taken out, which still allows room for 10 passengers. The rate is $55 an hour, with a six-hour minimum. Added to that is a 20 percent tip plus a $4 airport parking charge and, for those who prefer to be met at the gate rather than the baggage claim area, another $10. Total: $410.
Beeline Tours, 1308 North 38th, Seattle; (800) 959-8387 or (206) 632-5162; cozybus@beelinetours.com. The rate is $550 for the trip on a 15-passenger minibus, which is basically a 1995 Ford Eldorado. Tips are not built into the fee structure. "They are accepted and earned, but not required," Michael Rogers, president of the company, said. Passengers are picked up at south end of the airport.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Hawaii Still Resists Cruise Ship Gambling

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
HAWAII has consistently rejected legalized gambling, making it one of only three states, including Utah and Tennessee, opposed to casinos, horse racing, state lotteries and other forms of wagering. Last year a proposal to allow gambling on cruise ships in Hawaii waters, on condition that 96 percent of the state's share of the gambling revenues be allotted to public education, passed the House Tourism Committee but stalled in the legislature. 
 But even if sentiment turned in favor of cruise ship gambling, approval would likely be stymied by federal prohibitions. 
 The most recent such law, passed in December, prohibits cruise ships with casinos from starting and ending cruises in Hawaii. The only ship that met those criteria was Norwegian Cruise Line's SuperStar Leo, which was scheduled to move from Asia to Hawaii this December to begin year-round weekly cruises within the Hawaiian Islands, so there was little doubt what vessel Congress had in mind. 
Even before passage of the law, officials of N.C.L., as the Malaysian-owned cruise line is known, had agreed to shutter the SuperStar Leo's casino while in Hawaiian waters, the same policy followed by cruise ships that visit Hawaii on their way to or from foreign ports. Besides, each weekly SuperStar Leo cruise was to include a three-day excursion to Fanning Island in Kiribati, south of Hawaii, a round-trip journey of about 2,100 miles, during which the ship's casino would be open. Or so went the plan.
Once the prohibition was passed, the SuperStar Leo could still visit Kiribati, but it could neither leave from nor return to Hawaii unless it got rid of its casino. But to the surprise of industry officials, who thought N.C.L. would turn its back on Hawaii, the company stayed. In a phone interview, Colin Veitch, N.C.L.'s president, said the company believes that the underserved Hawaiian market held great promise with or without gambling revenues. "On-board gambling revenue amounts to between 5 to 7 percent of our total net revenue," he said, "about what we make from the bar, the on-board shops or from land packages." Most cruise line revenues, he added, come from passengers' fares. And even without a casino, he said, he expected the 1,960-passenger SuperStar Leo to be full year round.
But in March, N.C.L., owned by Star Cruises, said it would keep the SuperStar Leo in Asia and deploy to Hawaii the 2,200-passenger Norwegian Star, under construction in Germany. Mr. Veitch said that it made more economic sense to keep the Leo where it is, with its casino intact, and build the Star without a casino. So the Star is set to depart Honolulu on its initial Hawaiian itinerary on Dec. 16, the same day the SuperStar Leo had been scheduled to depart, and on the same itinerary. 
But why had the Leo been singled out by Congress in the first place? Piecing together that puzzle requires recalling the military appropriations bill passed by Congress in 1997 and signed by President Clinton. Its passage, vigorously supported by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, and by the Defense Department, prompted Senator John McCain of Arizona to criticize it for awarding a monopoly to American Classic Voyages, which owns American Hawaii Cruises, a longtime fixture in the Islands. 
The provision decreed that no other company may operate any cruise ship accommodating at least 275 passengers among or between the Hawaiian Islands for at least 25 years. And it exempted American Classic Voyages from the law requiring that American ships be used to transport passengers between United States ports. As a result, American Classic bought Holland America's Nieuw Amsterdam, reflagged it as a United States vessel and renamed it the Patriot. In return for the money from Congress -- including a provision allocating $250,000 from a Defense Department maritime-technology program for initial design, which Senator McCain criticized as "an example of pork-barrel spending" -- American Classic agreed to build two cruise ships in the United States. But since the 1997 law did not prevent foreign-flag ships from carrying passengers between two or more American ports, as long as they also visited a foreign port during the cruise, N.C.L. did not anticipate any problems. While there are no foreign ports close to Hawaii suitable for cruise ship visits, Mr. Veitch said, the SuperStar Leo can reach 25 knots, about 5 knots faster than ships cruising the Caribbean, and therefore it could make the trip in each direction to Fanning Island and still have time to cruise the Hawaiian Islands. 
Until last fall no foreign ships were based in Hawaii and none were anticipated, whereupon N.C.L. announced SuperStar Leo's planned deployment to Honolulu with its weekly excursion to Fanning Island. In return, Senator Inouye added to the Labor Department appropriations bill a provision to ban casinos on cruise ships whose voyages start or end in Hawaii, even while those ships are in international waters. The bill passed handily, despite criticism from Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano of Hawaii, who contended that cruise ship gambling was a state matter, not an issue for Washington.
Senator McCain also criticized the bill, contending that it would further insulate American Classic Voyages from competition -- which Senator Inouye and American Classic deny. Senator Inouye, a longtime opponent of gambling in Hawaii, said that his provision was intended to clarify any ambiguity in federal law "as to what types of gambling on board vessels are allowed and not allowed in Hawaii."
The various laws affecting cruise ship gambling could be repealed, and there may be increased sentiment to do so if Hawaii tourism is hurt by the nation's softening economy; the cost of energy in California, Hawaii's biggest domestic source of tourists; and by the continuing economic woes in Japan, Hawaii's second biggest tourist market. For now, though, those laws seem most likely to be around a long time.

Fulminations

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
The specialists are in open rebellion at the theft of their vocabularies. Egged on by sly agitation in this space to fulminate about raids by the general public on their fields' linguistic larders, the specialists have at last found an outlet for their ire at the twisting of their favorite terms.
 "I cannot resist the invitation to rail against the boneheaded misuse of organic," fulminates Stephen Slatin, at the department of physiology and biophysics of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. "It does not, or certainly should not, mean 'vegetables grown without fertilizers' or 'fruit produced without pesticides.' " 
 Right on, says Richard Fireman of Chicago: "Organic used to mean 'carbon based.' An 'inorganic food' would be an oxymoron" -- prescriptive usagists would insist on the more specific "contradiction in terms" -- unless someone knows a way to get nourishment from stones."
Chemists think of an "organized body" as an animal or plant containing compounds derived from hydrocarbons; they call that kind of chemistry organic and bristle at the "unscientific" extension of meaning into food "grown without chemical additives or genetic manipulation." 
Geologists, too, excoriate lay writers with rocks in their heads. When I wrote that San Jose was the epicenter of the California computer industry's power consumption," Julian Stone of Rumson, N.J., noted: "Epicenter is a scientific term referring to the point on the surface of the earth above the underground focus of an earthquake. Do you mean that the center of power consumption in California is underground?" 
The geophysicist Joseph D. Sides adds, "Writers should be advised that epi- no more intensifies the meaning of center than does pen- intensify the meaning of ultimate." (The prefix epi- most often means "on" or "over"; pen, not a prefix, is from the Latin paene, "almost.") Sides defines epicenter as "the point on the surface of the earth vertically above the center of an earthquake, the quake's 'hypocenter.' " It is also, he says, "the point on the earth's surface vertically below the atmospheric detonation of a bomb, the 'hypercenter' of the explosion." He finds "misuse of the offending term attributable to spurious erudition on the part of the writers combined with scientific illiteracy on the part of copy editors."
Is your understanding of these terms growing exponentially? No! thunders a totality of mathematicians. "I'm vexed to hear some trend described as 'growing exponentially' when the writer means it is growing rapidly," writes Maurice Fox of Arlington, Va. "Exponential growth is not necessarily rapid. The mathematical term merely describes something whose rate of growth is proportional to its size. My savings account grows exponentially but not rapidly."
Geometric, or compound, growth can be fast or slow; if our economy grows by 0.1 percent a year, that's exponential, but the stock market tanks. A professor of physics at Tufts University, Roger Tobin, is equally annoyed at the lay misuse of exponential to mean "a whole lot," referring to quantity rather than rate of growth, "but to say my annoyance is exponentially greater today than yesterday is gibberish."
Tobin is not offended, however, by a general use of quantum to mean "sudden," provided we don't use it to mean "huge": "The crucial characteristic of a quantum jump isn't its size but its abruptness -- something goes from one state to another without passing through any intermediate states in between." That's one of the "stolen meanings" that started this specialist agitation, which is growing fast if not exponentially. 
Those intellectuals who name their companion animals Peeve (to be able to say "This is my pet, Peeve") have as their ally Jacques Barzun, America's only best-selling nonagenarian. "A couple of misplaced technicalities," he writes from San Antonio. "Synergy, which belongs to physiology and relates to the working together of muscles, etc. Applied to the merger of two clothing firms (actual), it is ridiculous, especially since technically the meaning is 'greater effect than the sum of the efforts.' " 
A semantic theft by educators is module, which Professor Barzun says "is used ambiguously to mean 'a class period' and 'a portion of program.' (Years ago, it was 'nucleus.') A module in architecture or building generally is a part that does not change size, character or function and thus serves as a measure of a larger whole. In a column, it is the measurement itself -- half the diameter of the base." 
Architects, too have their linguistic betes noires. ("Peeve, meet my bete, Noire.") "I am very annoyed at the current usage of the term architect," writes Fran Read, who is one. "Examples include 'architect of the peace plan,' 'software architect' and in the phrase spoken by several C.E.O.'s and commentators on CNBC, 'We rearchitected the software.' "
Read's pique is superstructured by Tim Groninger, a project engineer. "Word thievery in engineering has become especially acute," he seethes, "due to the ever-growing hunger for words in the world of computers. I can no longer use the word architecture in the traditional sense. The word now implies the design and construction of computer networks, not buildings."
The architect Edwin Elias-Narvaez piles on with "It is particularly galling to perform an Internet search for architect only to find thousands of references having nothing to do with the traditional meaning of the word." 
(The magazine Architectural Record recently interviewed Richard Saul Wurman, who said: "I invented the term information architect in 1975, when I was national chairman of the A.I.A. convention in Philadelphia. It was called 'The Architecture of Information.' Now I would say that somewhere between 20,000 and 100,000 people in the U.S. have information architect on their business cards.")
Fulminations from other fields are still coming in. Ophthalmologists narrow their eyes at the nearsighted semantic theft of their myopic. Yoga practitioners in rooster position cock-a-doodle mellowly but firmly about the extension of guru from "revered teacher and spiritual leader" to a sarcastic "self-appointed cult figure." And most of all, logicians everywhere pose the query, What are the philistines doing to our beg the question?
The specialists are not going to take it anymore. Semantic extensionists who want to beat them back should write to onlanguage@nytimes.com or On Language, The New York Times Washington Bureau, 1627 I Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20006. I'll be here at the epicenter.

Pox Populi

BYLINE:  By Verlyn Klinkenborg; Verlyn Klinkenborg is a member of the New York Times editorial board.

 BODY:
Since Feb. 19, Britain has been under the pall of foot-and-mouth disease, or aftosa fever, as it's called in other parts of the world. The clinical slides of afflicted animals are unpleasant enough. They show blistered tongues and gums, lesions on the coronary band, where hair meets hoof, a look of slackness and profuse salivation. But the news photographs are genuinely gruesome -- stiff, swollen cattle stacked on their backs in long rows for mass interment, sheep penned in great herds for killing, farmers looking away from the sight of it all in grief and disgust. If you believe Daniel Defoe, whose "A Journal of the Plague Year" is closely attested fiction, one of the worst horrors of the 1665 London plague was the shutting up of houses where infection was discovered. By official order, healthy occupants were imprisoned with the dying, a red cross marked on the door, a watchman posted outside. That's how the containment of foot-and-mouth disease works too. 
 Foot-and-mouth disease is a viral infection that causes fever, blisters and lesions, and results in weight loss and a reduction in milk production. It doesn't kill adult animals. It doesn't have to. The human fear of contagion kills them. Every disease is economic, to some extent, but foot-and-mouth is nearly a purely economic disease. Its worst effects are caused by fear of the economic consequences of its spread. Beasts that are healthy or would otherwise get well are destroyed not to save them from suffering but to keep them from endangering the market value of other, unaffected livestock. Above all, they're destroyed to protect international trade, since countries like the United States ban imports from countries where animals have been infected as well as those where they have been vaccinated (since it can be hard to tell vaccinated animals from infected ones). People who have no contact with agriculture -- most of us, in other words -- are sharply reminded from time to time that in the common agricultural view of things, cattle and sheep are primarily economic beings, their well-being, their care, their ultimate fate determined almost entirely by the investment they represent. This is one of those times. 
 It's not just images of mass killing, however, that make foot-and-mouth so disturbing. It's the fear of mass contagion, a fear that returns us, somehow, to a time of epidemics like smallpox or bubonic plague or Spanish influenza, a time when effective barriers against the spread of disease were almost nonexistent. Foot-and-mouth disease is an old-fashioned, pestilential scourge -- a word derived from the Latin excoriare, meaning, aptly, to strip off the hide. Foot-and-mouth moves swiftly, vehemently. It sifts across borders, carried on the wind, on the breath of animals, its symptoms condemning entire herds, whole regions. This is a mode of disease -- highly and pervasively contagious, like smallpox -- that's no longer familiar to most of us, not even in our nightmares.
The diseases we tend to dread these days are what might be called deep diseases: slow to catch, the catching and the ultimate causes often hidden as a result. Many cancers are deep diseases, and so is AIDS. Even when they are epidemic, we tend to think of these as inherently personal diseases. They don't rush through a whole society, sweeping away entire neighborhoods in a week or a month, driving the population into exile or seclusion. Deep diseases turn the body against itself, slowly twisting biological coherence into incoherence, inciting rebellion from within. 
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as B.S.E. or mad cow disease, is a deep disease, too, caused by prions, abnormally folded proteins that form clusters and slowly perforate the brain. Like AIDS, it's a relatively new deep disease. The European outbreak that was first recorded in 1986 was almost certainly caused when animal protein (some of it tainted with prions) was fed to cattle, part of the quest for a cheaper protein supplement and a greater profit margin in intensive agriculture. When humans eat meat containing prions, they don't contract B.S.E., but they can contract a related disease called new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which results in dementia, abrupt muscular jerking, seizures and death. 
Terrible as foot-and-mouth disease is, its superficiality and epidemiological haste are almost merciful. More than 1,400 cases have been identified in Britain since Feb. 19, and 2,240,000 animals, most of them sheep, have been either slaughtered or marked for slaughter. It's a staggering rate of destruction, but when the destruction is done, there's an ascertainable chance that the disease will have been contained. B.S.E. is a different story. Britain has destroyed nearly five million ruminant farm animals, and the number of British B.S.E. cases has fallen from nearly 37,000 in 1992 to fewer than 1,500 last year. But because it can take years to show itself, and because the official response to it was so sullen and so politically corrupt at first, there's really no gauging its spread. In recent months, it has appeared in several European countries where it was unknown before. The question waiting to be answered is, Where is B.S.E. still lurking? A pungent question, since it may be lurking in some of us.
That deep fear is the lingering ghost behind the present foot-and-mouth outbreak. Though the two diseases are profoundly different, the imagery that surrounds them is so close -- the verdant countryside, the piles of dead animals, the grief-stricken farmers -- that it's impossible to consider one in the absence of the other. On a practical level, the decision to kill all the livestock even remotely at risk for foot-and-mouth conforms to the standard agricultural and mathematical models for how to handle this scourge when vaccination is not an option. But on another level it is a form of political self-preservation. When people see the news images of this slaughter and its consuming fires -- smoke billowing out of the green hollows of Cumbria and Devon, smoke tainted by the smell of burning flesh -- they don't think back to the foot-and-mouth outbreak that hit Britain in 1967. They think back only a few years to the discovery of B.S.E. They remember how vociferously John Major's government insisted that nothing was wrong, and how ready it was to put public relations before public safety. The present government remembers it, too, which is one reason that in March and early April parts of Britain looked like the landscape of forgotten contagion.
One disease is never a perfect metaphor for another. There are always fundamental differences, as there are between B.S.E. and foot-and-mouth disease. From a human perspective, these two epidemics are almost ideally distinct: the fatal disease is not contagious; the contagious disease does not affect humans. But it's the resemblance between them that haunts us, not the dissimilarity, a resemblance that evokes other epochs, other epidemics when humans, not animals, were the victims.

High-End Apartment Projects Planned for Stamford

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
OF nine projects containing nearly 4,000 rental apartments under construction in Stamford or elbowing one another through the city's regulatory pipeline, almost all are flush with amenities: swimming pools, clubhouses, fitness rooms, high-tech business centers, concierges and a smorgasbord of additional offerings.
 Of course, not all will be built at once, said Paxton Kinol, senior director of development for the Connecticut operations of AvalonBay Communities, a Virginia-based company that has been building in Stamford for a decade. "Over the next three years, 1,000 to 1,400 will break ground," he predicted, "and they will be spread so that one project will fill up before the next becomes available. The market can sustain that." 
 Irene Korin, senior executive at Stamford's Office of Economic Development, said, "There is a pent-up demand for 4,000 units" at market rates. In addition, a need exists for 2,800 units of low-cost housing for families earning under $50,000, according to a study last year by Abeles Phillips Preiss & Shapiro Inc. 
"The Stamford area is off the charts for high median income," said Allan Mallach, Abeles's consultant on affordable housing. Calculated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the median has jumped to $109,800 this year from $102,400 in 2000. The number of apartments to be offered at market rents of $1,200 for studios to $3,600 for three-bedrooms will probably fill the need in the city. The number of "affordables," estimated at around 260, will not. 
"Families earning $50,000 a year can afford 30 percent, or $1,250 a month, rent, including utilities," Mr. Mallach said, so in a city where the median income is high, it is particularly difficult to get new housing built that is affordable for those earning less than the median.
Rising office-vacancy rates -- now about 10 percent for downtown Stamford, an increase of 1 percentage point to 3 percentage points more than the rate a few months ago, according to various local commercial brokers -- could stall new office construction, already postponed for lack of tenants and financing. Robin Stein, Stamford's land use planner, notes that "the good thing about housing is if the market doesn't prosper, you just reduce the rent." But offices on long-term leases with employee and equipment commitments do not have that flexibility.
One solution is to convert a site slated for office construction to residential construction under existing commercial zoning that allows apartments. That is what is planned for Signature Place, a development by Roseland Property of Short Hills, N.J., which will file plans this month for a three-tower complex of 932 apartments. It will have the distinction of being the tallest building in town, with its largest tower zooming 37 stories, or 350 feet, over downtown Stamford. The project will replace the vacant, weed-infested wilderness behind the Town Center Mall, known for decades as "the hole in the ground."
Marshall Teicher, principal at Roseland, said the towers would be built in two or more phases, with 37,000 square feet of shops, restaurants, greengrocers, video stores, fitness and other service establishments at street level. He hopes to break ground in September and open the first phase 16 months later.
Because its project is within the Urban Redevelopment District, Roseland is eligible for a program in which developers can gain the right to build more units than regulations would normally allow by setting aside money for creating low-cost units on a different site. "You can't just write a check," said Mr. Teicher, who has committed some $2 million. "You have to find the site and get involved with a nonprofit or a builder who will do the construction."
Avalon, the leading apartment builder in town, at least in numbers, is involved in three projects: Avalon Harbor and Grey rock Tower, now under construction, and Hanover Hall, a redevelopment. When they are completed next year, they will bring the company's total to 1,464 apartments in six Stamford projects dating from 1991.
Often criticized for cookie-cutter design and opportunistic use of state statutes to force multifamily housing into some suburban towns by guaranteeing a percentage of low-cost units, Avalon is attempting to make changes. Avalon Harbor will be the company's first waterfront complex, situated on a former oil tank farm at 150 Southfield Avenue. Living rooms will be larger than at its existing projects, balconies will be a more important focus of the design, corner apartments can be custom built, and each tenant will have one free parking space in the 611-car underground garage.
Half of the 68 slips in the project's marina and 88 garage spaces will be reserved for the public, and there will be public access to a fishing pier, pedestrian path and boardwalk over a marsh that is home to a variety of shore birds. Tenants will have exclusive use of the pool, fitness and business centers, indoor basketball and racquetball courts, a billiard room and clubroom. Rents for the 323 units will range from $1,300 a month for a studio to around $2,700 for three bedrooms, and higher for customized units. There will be no below-market apartments. 
But Greyrock Tower, Avalon's 306-unit project at 50 Forest Street on the site of the former Burdick Elementary School, complies with the requirement by the city's Urban Redevelopment District for 34 low-priced apartments for renters earning at most 50 percent of the median. Typically, a two-bedroom apartment at the market rate of $2,300 a month would cost an eligible renter $1,165 at the reduced rate. 
Under construction by Cappelli Enterprises of White Plains, the finished building will be purchased and managed by Avalon. "It's a means of getting new apartments at a predetermined price with little risk," said Mr. Kinol of Avalon. The first four floors of the stepped-down building -- from 17 stories in front to 12 in back -- will contain the concierge's station, business center, leasing office, laundry drop-off and exercise room. A fifth floor clubroom will open onto the pool and the first group of apartments. A garage backs the first four stories. Except for the 34 units, rents for one- to three-bedrooms will be the same as Avalon Harbor's.
At Park Square West in the Urban Redevelopment District under construction by Corcoran-Jennison of Dorchester, Mass., a swimming pool, fitness and business centers, rooftop putting green, game room, juice bar and tea garden will eventually be available to tenants of 433 studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments. To be built in two phases, some units will be ready for occupancy late this month, including a portion of the 86 low-cost units to be rented to tenants whose income is no more than 50 percent of the median. Market rate rents range from $1,575 to $3,600.
ANOTHER project using the off-site provision for low-cost units is under development by Archstone Communities of Boston. Scott Shaul, a principal, said the company had promised $280,000 for that purpose with regard to its 244-unit project on Washington Boulevard overlooking the Mill River. Approved by the Stamford Boards of Finance, Representatives and Planning, it will be considered by the Zoning and Environmental Boards this month. At a site not yet determined, 10 apartments will go to tenants earning no more than 25 percent of the median income, seven to people at 50 percent, and five at 60 percent. 
A second Archstone venture of 160 apartments has broken ground at the corner of Bedford and North Streets. Both projects will contain fitness and business centers, pools and clubhouses. Ground-floor shops and riverside restaurants will be installed at the Washington Boulevard complex.
Another project going before the Zoning Board this month is Starwood Buckingham's 239 town house complex called Palmer Hill, at the Greenwich border on Havemeyer Lane and Palmer Hill Road. Robert Dale, managing partner of Buckingham Partners of Greenwich, said that two- and three-story colonial-style units of one- to three-bedrooms in groups of three to six per cluster will rent for $2,500 to $3,000. A residents' clubhouse, pool, meeting and fitness rooms are included. Occupancy is expected in late 2002, with 10 percent of the units to be rented below market. 
Collins Enterprises of Greenwich is preparing applications for Admirals Wharf at Stamford Harbor, a $200 million-plus mixed-use development. Fifty of its 500 apartments will be offered at reduced rates; amenities include a private yacht club.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Fitting Into History's True Fabric

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
THOUGH I'm not a big baseball fan, I'm a big fan of baseball fans. It's inspiring to watch them follow the game as if it were a matter of life and death. Many of us follow the cityscape with the same nutty devotion. New York won big a few weeks ago, when the Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to approve Jean Nouvel's design for a new hotel in SoHo. The decision's physical impact on the cityscape will be contained. But its effect on the city's mental landscape could be immense.
 The site for the 12-story, 180-room hotel is on the north side of Grand Street, between Broadway and Mercer, in the Cast Iron Historic District, one of the nation's first neighborhoods to be designated for protection by preservation laws. Nouvel's design, however, rises well above mere local interest. The designer of such acclaimed works as the Cartier Foundation in Paris and the Lyons Opera House, Nouvel has produced a plan that reflects SoHo's image as an international destination, a district of museums, galleries and fashionable shops and an incubator for design firms linked to the risky Internet economy. 
 Nouvel's design is also risky, at least for a neighborhood that in recent years has invested heavily in cobblestone paving, cast-iron lampposts and other dubious Ye Olde theme park "improvements." In scale, proportions and materials, Nouvel's metal and glass facades recognizably honor the district's cast-iron heritage. But the ratio of glass to metal and, particularly, the treatment of the glass mark this as a contemporary design. It is good, good, good and bad, bad, bad. Complex, just how we like 'em.
But not how the local Community Board likes them, evidently. In approving the design, the city's landmarks agency, led by Jennifer J. Raab, overturned a previous resolution to reject the design by the local community board's landmarks panel. Here is an excerpt from that resolution:
"Whereas the building appears to be a Retro revival of early- or mid-20th century structures; and Whereas, a modern building might be appropriate in the cast iron district, but this is not it; Therefore, be it resolved that Community Board 2 recommends denial of the application."
You must admit, there's a certain magnificence to this collision of legal form and nonsensical content. The resolution might have been even more magnificent if it had come right out and said, "Whereas, it stinks."
I am sympathetic to the framers of this resolution. In a city brutalized by development, the difference between architecture and real estate may be hard to discern. At least the theme-park motifs give the community a sense of control over its fate. More important, there is nothing ignoble about the idea that architecture, as a public art, should share elements of a common language. By the same token, the ideal of a common language depends on the willingness to learn one. The power of buildings to communicate is not entirely contingent on architects. It is a public responsibility to attend to what buildings have to say. That duty, or pleasure, lies substantially with members of the public who assert the authority to judge what architects do.
To be approved by the landmarks commission for building in a historic district, a new design must meet a standard of "appropriateness." This is a legal term. Nobody concerned with art values would ever use it, for a very precise reason: it is evasive. It abdicates responsibility for personal opinion without surrendering the right to exercise it. Like "decency" or "cruel and unusual," the term is unstintingly obedient to prejudice. "Context," another term that appears in the commission's charter, is another euphemism for the right to exclude the unfamiliar.
"Appropriateness" and "context," used as formal terms for architectural evaluation, are period pieces. Their usage reflects generational values, not timeless truths. Battery Park City, an experiment well worth undertaking in 1979, when its master plan and design guidelines were adopted, is perhaps the fullest expression of those values. Paradoxically, the project was built on 92 acres of virgin landfill, with virtually no context to speak of. The design guidelines were based on the facades of prewar housing on the Upper East and West Sides of Manhattan. Here, the decisive line was crossed from preservation to preservationism, the belief that the new buildings in the city should emulate the appearance of old ones.
That was then, this is now. It turns out that few things in New York are more deeply contextual than change. That is the city's great salvation from the uniformity of the grid. Manhattan is a sublime space-time configuration, with time providing the necessary open end. As an experiment in its own right, Battery Park City upheld this tradition. But if "appropriateness" and "context" are to have any constructive use, preservationism's limitations must be taken into account. Those limitations are now part of the history the city has carved into its skin.
Let's say that Nouvel wants to explore the themes of separateness and connectedness in the urban realm. He wants to reflect on the extent to which each of these concepts is actuality or illusion. Obviously, in dealing with these matters, Nouvel will want to take the context of a historical district into account. He will incorporate it into his own artistic framework, in fact. He may also want to explore the history of the site.
But his context will also extend well beyond these local considerations. It may also include the history of philosophy, science, perhaps even of religion. And he will probably seek a relationship to the overarching history of architecture, to the Casa del Fascio, the Schroeder House, the Seagram Building and other landmarks whose architects explored similar ideas in the past.
For the SoHo hotel, Nouvel has drawn on features from adjacent buildings: scale, materials, facade proportions, cornices and so on. But he has also inverted, reversed, abstracted, twisted and otherwise played with these features. He has exploited new technologies in glass, for example, to develop a vocabulary of exposure, veiling, reflection, dissolution, solid and void and gradations on the spectrum from the familiar to the unknown. He has tinted the glass in gray, blue and red, reinterpreting colors typically found in the neighborhood's painted masonry buildings. With perpendicular fins and abstract imagery screened onto the glass, he has given the building skin uncommon depth.
The design shimmers with emotional content: the reds of desire, anger or anxiety, the blues of passivity or urban disconsolation. Rectangular shapes, resembling sprocket holes, are screened onto one facade, inviting passersby to visualize the hotel as it actually is: a setting for dramas of anticipation or escape, for fantasies fulfilled or disappointed, appetites whetted beyond the possibility of satisfaction. This is how the outside world looks from the inside.
These ideas were not developed by those who designed the glass towers of mid-century Manhattan. Nouvel's building is metal and glass. Lever House is metal and glass. So what? Carnegie Hall is brick. The Dakota apartment house is brick. Seen one brick building, seen them all, huh? As a public art form, architecture is subject to any kind of public opinion. Openness is one of the glories of the medium. But you can't build moral authority on lack of curiosity about your subject matter, and architecture shouldn't always be judged by theme park values. Retro? Googie? Lava lamps, anyone? Recourse to such commercial terms only highlights the need for buildings that address the concepts Nouvel has taken on.
An essay on separateness and connectedness may sound like an abstract philosophical exercise. Actually, it is the central issue around which controversies stirred up by new buildings typically revolve. It is also a central question in the efforts of Elias Canetti, Norbert Elias, Hannah Arendt and other thinkers to understand group beliefs, including the appeal of fascism. Where does one person stop and another person start? What makes public opinion change, sometimes overnight? Who wants the Yankees to move from the Bronx? Show hands!
Where does a community start and stop? Clearly, in a city as culturally ambitious as New York, and in a neighborhood famed for incubating creative talent, the community cannot be bound by Houston and Canal Streets. The community is global and cosmopolitan. It includes many who know the difference between talent and schlock, who pride themselves on that ability, and who believe that New York's identity, and its future, are staked to the power of artistic discrimination. What future can there be for any city that says to the present: "Not in my back yard"?
Gio Ponti proposed that the architect's job is to "interpret the life of the inhabitants, transforming it into an expression of civilization and culture." But what if the inhabitants -- or the neighbors, the community -- don't like the interpretation? As a critic, I take it for granted that architects are going to see and feel things that I haven't yet analyzed. That's their job. They pick up vibrations and crystallize them into forms whose beauty may not be immediately apparent. This is how history feeds into the future. One yearns for the day when a design is found "inappropriate" because (Whereas) it too closely resembles the old piece of junk next door.
I look back at the last 40 years as a time when New York began a valuable self-education in its architectural heritage. Long may the lesson continue. But toward the end of the last century, the city lost sight of the difference between architecture and architectural history. Communities live in time as well as space. Context is a matter of time as well as space. And historical awareness, T. S. Eliot said, means acknowledging the pastness of the past as well as its presence. This acknowledgement shows greater respect for history than merely to crib from period styles. That's why it's "appropriate" that the Landmarks Commission gave substance to it. Time is its business.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
With His Feet in Many Chinas, So Hard to Pin Down

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
AS the cliche goes, there is not one China but many: the People's Republic, of course, but also the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, the oppositional island of Taiwan and the numerous ethnic Chinese enclaves studded throughout Asia, Europe and the Americas. 
 As a filmmaker, Tsui Hark has lived or worked in most of those places and, in his films, has imagined many others, including many Chinas of a mythical or historical past. 
 Currently based in Hong Kong, where he is one of the local industry's most prolific and influential filmmakers, Mr. Tsui (his name is pronounced Choy Huck, though friends and family call him Trey) will also be a conspicuous presence around New York for the next few weeks.
A new feature, "Time and Tide," will open on Friday. Two of Mr. Tsui's classics, parts one and two of his "Once Upon a Time in China" series, have been playing at the Film Forum in Lower Manhattan. And an eight-film series of Mr. Tsui's rarely seen works, including the 1980 political allegory "We're Going to Eat You" (a k a, "Kung Fu Cannibals") will be shown at both the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village (May 25-27) and Plaza Twin in Brooklyn (May 31-July 5). 
A figure roughly analogous to Roger Corman, America's "King of the B's," Mr. Tsui is a wildly proficient filmmaker, with his name on at least 60 films since 1979. As a director, writer, producer or actor, he has worked in almost every conceivable genre, dashing from broad slapstick comedy to tearful Cantonese melodrama, with stops for animated films and folk tales along the way.
The eclectic nature of Mr. Tsui's work finds its roots in his background. An ethnic Chinese, he was born in 1951 in what was then French Indochina and is now Vietnam. When he was 15, his parents immigrated to Hong Kong, and three years later Mr. Tsui departed for the United States, where he studied painting at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and shot a 45-minute documentary on Asian-American history called "From Spikes to Spindles." 
After graduation, he moved on to New York, where he worked as an editor of a Chinatown newspaper and contributed to community theater and cable television productions. That experience was enough to land him a job as a television producer when he returned to Hong Kong in 1977. 
At that time, the old commercial structures of the Cantonese cinema were giving way in the face of a Hong Kong New Wave, composed largely of socially oriented television directors like Ann Hui, Allen Fong and Mr. Tsui. Mr. Tsui's television series "The Gold Dagger Romance" was a critical and commercial success that led to his first feature, "The Butterfly Murders" (1979), a bizarre blend of martial arts, mysticism and invented mythology that thrilled local audiences and attracted the attention of Western film festival directors. 
With his wife, Nansun Shi, Mr. Tsui founded his own studio, Film Workshop, in 1984, and two years later produced "A Better Tomorrow," a watershed film that made international figures of the director John Woo and the star Chow Yun-Fat, both of whom now work in American movies (Mr. Woo in "Mission Impossible 2," Mr. Chow in "Anna and the King"). "A Better Tomorrow" forged a new genre out of elements of the traditional Cantonese kung fu film and the American gangster movie of the 1930's, setting domestic box office records and inspiring a legion of imitations (including two sequels, one directed by Mr. Tsui).
With his time, talents and interests spread over so many endeavors, Mr. Tsui is a difficult man to pin down, yet his style is immediately identifiable. As a director, he is the primary source of the unbelievable dynamism, the machine-gun editing, the extreme camera angles and the headlong rushing movement that gave a new breath of life to Hong Kong films.
From the beginning, Mr. Tsui was always willing to go a little bit further than his colleagues. Where Asian action filmmakers like King Hu (whose graceful, lyrical style in films like "Raining in the Mountains" is the major influence on Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") were classicists who respected the integrity of their plots and characters, Mr. Tsui was an instinctive postmodernist for whom style was its own justification. 
Where King Hu told stories, Mr. Tsui assembled images, built rhythms, raided widely different cultural traditions and in general created a cinema meant to appeal to the eye, ear and skin far more than to the brain. Where the traditional Chinese martial arts films, the swordfighting films favored by Mandarin audiences or the barehanded kung fu films preferred by the Cantonese were grounded in the music, acrobatics and choreographed violence of Chinese opera, Mr. Tsui's films owed their allegiance equally to Western movies, television and pop music. Mr. Tsui perfectly summarized this blend with the English title he gave to one of his earliest successes, "Peking Opera Blues."
Shown at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, Mr. Tsui's ineffably weird "Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain" (which features the kung fu star Sammo Hung as a monk whose magically extensible eyebrows entangle and hold off a ball of cosmic evil) baffled and intrigued Western viewers with its unbridled imagination and incomprehensible plotting, pitting warlords against democratic activists in the chaotic years after the 1911 revolution. 
Somewhere between the poles of pure fantasy and sharp political engagement lies the essence of Mr. Tsui's work. For the critic Stephen Teo, whose book "Hong Kong Cinema: The Extra Dimensions" remains the definitive study of the region's filmmaking, Mr. Tsui's work represents a sort of "nationalism on speed." Here, "the mythic world of martial arts represents the peak of China's science and culture," Mr. Teo writes, and the dense, convoluted plots of his films portray a "China that has failed to realize its potential due to the failure of talented people to unite, engaging instead in internecine struggles to the detriment of all."
Perhaps it is Mr. Tsui's personal experience of the Chinese diaspora that has forged his vision of a hazy, hallucinated nation with no definite boundaries, an ambiguous history and traditions that can be instantly invented and instantly abandoned. The "Once Upon a Time in China" series, which began in 1991 and recently reached its sixth installment, is Mr. Tsui's most explicit attempt to create a country of the mind, a China that the Chinese can take with them, in the form of films, tapes and Asia's ubiquitous video compact disks, in their worldwide migrations.
The central character of the series, played in the first three episodes by Jet Li (a gifted martial artist who has now begun his own American career, as in "Romeo Must Die"), is a historical figure, Wong Fei-Hung, a freedom fighter from Guangdong Province. But for Chinese audiences, the historical reality of the character has long been absorbed by his incarnation in a series of martial arts adventures, produced through the 50's and 60's, starring Kwan Tak-Hing -- just as Wyatt Earp, Wild Bill Hickock and many other Western heroes have been assimilated by Hollywood. 
Jet Li's interpretation of the character is far more boyish and open than Kwan Tak-Hing's (at least in the few scraps of footage this writer has been able to see). Here, Wong Fei-Hung represents a younger, more flexible China, still committed to traditional values (he is a doctor of herbal medicine) but open to the use of Western technology (guns and movie cameras) when it suits his purposes.
Mr. Tsui has developed his notions of China through other historical series, including the "Swordsman" films (set in a more distant, magical past), the "Chinese Ghost Story" series (in which heroic monks confront demons with distinctly imperialist agendas) and many one-shots, including the shrewd, sober, meticulously crafted period adventure that might be his finest film, "The Blade" (1995). 
But increasingly Mr. Tsui has been leaving that theme behind. Like John Woo, he has followed the siren call of American studio filmmaking, directing the Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme in two features, "Double Team" (1997) and "Knock Off" (1998). For all of his evident adaptability, Mr. Tsui has not been able to complete the Hollywood transition, perhaps because he is too accustomed to being his own boss to accept the dictates of studio marketing advisers. 
Still, Mr. Tsui is discovering that you can't go home again, particularly when that home, Hong Kong, has been transformed by major political and economic upheavals. Investors have abandoned the Hong Kong cinema in recent years, frightened off by the Asian economic crisis and by the inroads that the Motion Picture Producers Association of America -- the international lobby of the Hollywood studios -- has been able to make into markets that once resisted imported product. Hollywood now seems poised to take over the Asian market just as it has conquered Europe, leaving little for indigenous filmmakers except low-budget genre films starring local pop stars and comics.
"Time and Tide" is the first film that Mr. Tsui has made in Hong Kong in five years, and it feels strikingly different from the work he did in the past. No longer does the notion of China, as a place real or imagined, figure in the fiction; the action could be taking place in any major city, and there is even a more or less gratuitous action sequence set in South America, a market where martial arts movies are very popular. Surviving from Mr. Tsui's established style is the film's incomprehensible plot, something to do with an improvised alliance between an apprentice bodyguard (the Cantonese pop star Nicholas Tse) and a minor gangster (the Taiwanese rocker Wu Bai) and a general sense of headlong energy.
The early sequences, in which Mr. Tse discovers he has accidentally impregnated a lesbian police officer, are a sly parody of Wong Kar-Wai's hyper-stylish Hong Kong melodramas ("In the Mood for Love"), but the film eventually turns into a nonstop shoot'em-out, with a wild finale that finds the female lead (Cathy Tsui) giving birth while simultaneously fending off an army of attackers with an automatic pistol. The target of the parody has shifted from Wong Kar-Wai to John Woo, who featured an unforgettable maternity ward shootout in his 1992 movie "Hard Boiled."
"Time and Tide" suggests that Mr. Tsui now sees his challenge as separating himself from the moribund Hong Kong film industry, which he helped to create and was largely created by. Like Mr. Wong and Mr. Woo, he must find a way to recreate himself as a global filmmaker, with no particular loyalty to any production system, national character or sense of cultural history. There may still be many Chinas, but the movies are fast becoming their own sovereign domain, a vast, featureless country in which local distinctions are lost.

HEADLINE: Nassau Government Buildings Going to Seed 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
NASSAU COUNTY is falling down. Oh, the county government's most glaring budget gaps are being patched up, the tax rolls are being updated and the arm wrestling with union leaders over contract concessions has begun. But the millions of dollars' worth of buildings it owns -- literally the facades it presents to the public -- have fallen into such disrepair that the county complex in Garden City is beginning to look like a third-world capital.
 County officials say there's enough money to pay janitors, painters, plumbers, carpenters and electricians and buy them the materials they need. Even so, the job isn't getting done. New York State reimburses counties for the upkeep of state court buildings, but over the last two years it has withheld $2 million from Nassau because of what David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration, described as "the county's failure to meet the standards in the contract." Now, the state is moving to assume direct responsibility for maintenance of its court buildings in Nassau. 
 Maintenance at all county-owned buildings is coming under renewed scrutiny. In the last two weeks, Judith A. Jacobs, the majority leader of the Nassau County Legislature, has asked the county attorney for a list of all property it owns or uses, requested that the county Health Department conduct periodic safety inspections of all county-owned buildings and asked for a full accounting of a county-owned warehouse at 404 Peninsula Boulevard in Hempstead.
Those requests were prompted by Ms. Jacobs' April 19 visit to the Hempstead building, which stores paper the county uses for copying and printing.
"That was the worst thing I've ever seen," she said. "A garage door had been eaten by rats and termites. Rolls of paper and boxes had been eaten by rats. There was a horrible odor that we kept thinking was from a dead animal. And there were stains on the rolls of paper that we thought were water stains from the roof that had caved in. I was nauseated by what was there; we all felt sick. We were later told it was rat urine we had seen and smelled."
"What happened with the oversight by general services to allow this building to deteriorate to this level?" she asked in a memo to William Tripp, who as deputy commissioner of Recreation, Parks and Support Services is the official responsible for building maintenance.
Asked what she believed was the cause of the maintenance problem, Ms. Jacobs replied: "There's a lack of oversight and not enough employees. And those who are there can do only what is humanly possible."
Mr. Tripp said that although his department is budgeted for 306 full-time employees, it has only 267. "The economy has been very good and it was difficult to fill lower-paying custodial jobs," he explained. "People could get higher-paying jobs in private industry."
But John Zaher, a spokesman for the county executive's office, said the county managed to spend $472,000 in 2000 for temporary custodial help.
Mr. Zaher said the Nassau Council of Black Clergy had been illegally operating a food pantry in space loaned by the county at one end of the Hempstead building and that its food had caused the rodent problem. He said all food in that section of the building was discarded and the area cleaned and fumigated. He said the county-owned space at other end of the building, where the Long Island Council of Churches stores food for its food pantry, was not affected.
Mr. Zaher said the cleanup crew discarded about $2,000 worth of ruined county material, but that the bulk of the supplies were salvageable and would continue to be stored there. He also said the county was studying whether to repair or replace the leaky roof.
Ms. Jacobs said her office has received complaints about the maintenance of other county buildings. In the County Executive Building at 1 West Street in Garden City, Ms. Jacobs pointed out rooms where paint and plasterboard are coming off the walls. Around the corner, beneath the weather-beaten dome of the Old Courthouse, wires could be seen hanging down through the ceiling where tiles used to be.
Anthony P. Giustino, the president of C.S.E.A. Local 830, which represents 11,000 county workers, said the Department of Social Services building on 11th Street has a history of fires and fire code violations.
His assistant, Timothy J. Corr, said the air conditioning in the building housing the county clerk's office "is broken four out of five days" and that this condition has existed for the last three years.
Another union official, Stanley Bergman, said that basic cleaning was not being done. "The carpets are rarely vacuumed, the bathrooms are filthy, the floors are not swept and employees are bringing in their own mops and toilet paper," he said.
Mr. Tripp said electrical problems at the Department of Social Services building are being corrected. Regarding conditions in the Old Courthouse, Mr. Tripp said the county Legislature would be asked in the next two or three months to approve the hiring of a consultant to determine the scope of the work that needs to be done there.
He also said the county Legislature rejected a proposed $8 million capital improvement bond issue for the county clerk's building five years ago and that it has tabled a request for a smaller appropriation.
"The cleanliness in the building has been improved in the last year and a half," Mr. Tripp insisted. "I have heard nothing about employees bringing in their own toilet paper. If someone did that, I'm sure I would have gotten a bill."
Mr. Tripp said Deputy County Executive Curtis Fisher had been appointed by the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, to lead a committee to survey all county buildings and to deal immediately with all acute needs.
"We'll prioritize those projects, taking into consideration those buildings to which the public has access and those with the greatest number of county employees," said Mr. Tripp, who will sit on the committee. "I assess the county buildings to be in fair condition. Some buildings are a 10 -- 10 is the best -- and some are a 1, like the Hempstead building."
Ms. Jacobs said she would rate the county's buildings as "fair to horrible. Fair is the highest I would ever give one," she said, "and it goes downhill from there pretty rapidly."
Michael G. Zapson, a Democratic member of the county Legislature, said the court buildings are at the lower end of the scale. "I think the courts are poorly maintained and I'm not surprised the state is tossing us off the job," he said.
The state's takeover of court building maintenance, now scheduled for June, comes none too soon for court officials, who say repeated complaints about conditions in their buildings have fallen on deaf ears.
Justice Edward G. McCabe, the county's administrative judge, sent a letter March 7 to Ms. Jacobs. 
"All water fountains have been closed due to lead in the containers," he wrote. "Leaks are not repaired, carpeting is in shreds and mended with electrical tape, ceilings in various offices are falling in pieces and left unrepaired, juror seating -- particularly in the County Court -- is in deplorable condition, handicapped ramp railings have been removed and not replaced, and cleanliness in each building is almost non-existent."
Until 1998, the state reimbursed the counties 25 percent of their maintenance costs. That was increased to 50 percent in 1999 and to 75 percent last year. Two months ago, it was increased to 100 percent. 
About four years ago, Mr. Zapson said, the state began complaining about conditions in the state court buildings in Nassau. Two years ago, it balked at reimbursing the county.
Mr. Tripp said the county was not told until about a year ago that the state was refusing to pay the cleaning bill. He said the county did not notice because there is such a lag in state reimbursement payments that the last check from the state arrived on March 24, 2001, even though reimbursement payments were ended Jan. 1, 1999.
He said that one of the first things the county did was to change the company the county had hired to clean the buildings. And he pointed out that the county Legislature will be asked on Monday to approve a $12 million bond issue to repair leaks in the roofs and windows of the court buildings.
Mr. Zapson said he believes a big part of the problem was the amount the county paid the cleaning service. 
"We paid 29 cents per square foot for cleaning," Mr. Zapson said, noting that the state believes it should cost 70 cents per square foot to get the job done right.
He also attributed the poor cleaning job to "poor administration by the county." 
Ms. Jacobs said all of the building problems point to an "infrastructure breakdown."
"The county's budget collapse is only an indicator of a collapse throughout the county," she said. "How do you explain this to taxpayers who are living in the richest county in the state?"
Asked where the county would get the money to make the necessary repairs because of the county's money crunch, Ms. Jacobs replied: "When the health, safety and welfare of individuals are at stake, it is the responsibility of the county to provide livable and habitable conditions. I'm not talking about turning this into the Taj Mahal, but I can find the money to sweep the floor, paint the walls and have an exterminator come in once a month."

HEADLINE: Habitats/West Orange, N.J.; 
A Garden Designer Finds The Grass Is Greener

BYLINE:  By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
ARE there any great places to live that are still undiscovered, where regular people can buy houses for the price of a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan? 
 Bill Mitchell thinks there is at least one, and he talks about his new town with the passion characteristic of recent converts. It is charming, he says, and all the shopping he needs is nearby. It's diverse, with a variety of ethnic and economic groups. It has the architecture and terrain of Westchester County without the high prices. And, he says, as a gay man, he feels perfectly comfortable. 
 The town is West Orange, N.J., where Mr. Mitchell spent $270,000 last July for a three-bedroom house with a porch that in the winter looks out on the Manhattan skyline and in the summer on leafy trees. 
The town was developed in the 1920's and 30's as a suburb of Newark. But a few years ago, it became a more appealing option for New Yorkers when direct train service was started to Penn Station. It takes just 30 minutes.
Mr. Mitchell, however, doesn't spend a lot of time on trains. Most days he drives, loading equipment and plants into his van for the trip to Manhattan, where he designs and installs rooftop and terrace gardens. Mr. Mitchell became passionate about gardening when he was working as a computer systems designer and living in an apartment at Castle Village near West 181st Street in Manhattan. The complex has acres of gardens, and Mr. Mitchell volunteered to work in them.
"I would come home in my suit and go right down and start weeding," he said. When his company decided to have an outside firm do its computer work, Mr. Mitchell decided to change careers. He got his certificate in landscape design and horticulture from the New York Botanical Garden.
The apartment in Washington Heights was spectacular, a large one-bedroom penthouse with view of the Hudson River and the Palisades. Mr. Mitchell might still be there were it not for the death of Gary Parks, with whom he lived for for 15 years. When Mr. Parks, a dance critic and editor, died about a year and a half ago from a brain tumor, the apartment no longer seemed right.
Mr. Mitchell wanted an easy place to keep a car, and he wanted a house that could accommodate two dogs, so that his yellow Labrador, Bella, would have company. 
And so, thinking about moving, he went to New Jersey one day to visit Marcia and Chris Pelletiere, friends in South Orange. He and Mrs. Pelletiere sing in an eight-person a cappella group called the Accidentals.
Caught up in their enthusiasm for the area, he spent part of the day driving around with Dennis Cahill of ReMax Village Square in South Orange. A month or so later, Mr. Cahill called and told him that one of the Tudor-style houses he liked was for sale; it had been on the market for 12 hours and already had four offers.
Mr. Mitchell immediately offered a bit more than the asking price, figuring he could sell his penthouse in a minute, and got the house. "My sainted father gave me a bridge loan," he said -- a short-term loan intended to bridge the time span between buying one house and selling another. He closed on the house in July and moved in in October, after painting, buying new appliances and replacing some floors.
ON the first story, his house has a small foyer leading to, on the left, the living room, with a beamed, vaulted ceiling and stone fireplace, and on the right, a dining room. Over the fireplace in the living room is a portrait done by his great-great uncle, Maurice Siegler, who lived in South Orange. Although Mr. Mitchell discovered the town through his friends, he actually spent the first few years of his life in the area, where the Russian Jews on his mother's side and the Greeks on his father's side had settled. Most of his childhood, though, was spent in Willingboro, a suburb farther south in New Jersey.
Beyond the dining room is a large eat-in kitchen with a sitting area. Upstairs is a bedroom, Bella's room and a television/guest room.
On a warm spring day, Mr. Mitchell sat on the porch he had painted a French blue-green and talked about the garden he plans to create when he is not so busy with clients. "This is one of my dreams," he said, "to design a debris garden." 
He plans to use old castoff items, maybe turning a celadon green toilet tank into a bird bath, and the bowl into a water lily pool. A radiator he found in the house might make a good table base. "Most people in New York don't want that kind of garden," he said. "I'm going to provide an example."
He will also put up fences to protect Bella and his new dog, a golden-retriever-Rottweiler mix named Sam. When he decided to move to New Jersey and get another dog, he thought he would get a small, cute, cuddly one. Instead he ended up with a big ferocious one that showed up in a neighbor's yard, abandoned.
The house was easy to furnish, because he had quite a bit in his apartment in the city. Surprisingly in a strong market, the apartment hasn't yet sold. The first potential buyer backed out at the last minute, and the second was rejected by the co-op board. Because the price is in line with others in the building, Mr. Mitchell was mystified by the lack of bids.
Then, when he noticed that deals kept falling through on important personal dates, like his anniversary with Mr. Parks, he wondered if maybe he was being sent a message from another world.
He called an exorcist in Ohio who had been recommended by friends, an exorcist who, as Mr. Mitchell put it, works remote. "He took a look, figuratively speaking," Mr. Mitchell said. The exorcist told him that Mr. Parks's spirit was in fact in the house in New Jersey and wasn't blocking the sale.
Many agents are showing the apartment, and Mr. Mitchell is hopeful. Meanwhile, he's happy in his new place, a place that instantly felt like home.
"I don't know anything about feng shui," he said, "but it's just comfortable. I think I'm very lucky."

HEADLINE: DOWN THE SHORE; 
Staying Power

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: OCEAN CITY 

 BODY:
David Pitfield is trying to sell his four-bedroom duplex near 45th Street and Asbury Avenue a couple of blocks from the beach in the quiet south end of the island. Recently, Mr. Pitfield decided to move up to a new, bigger house a few blocks away, but he isn't particularly worried if he doesn't unload the old one quickly.
 "I can tell you that he can easily get $3,000 a week for the place in rent," said Mark Grimes, Mr. Pitfield's agent at Ocean City Realty. "I'd estimate that rents here for good properties have doubled in the last four or five years. It may soon flatten, but that hasn't happened yet." 
 Times are flush at the Shore. For the last few years, the boom in rentals was attributed to the good economy and the raging bull stock market. This year, the economy has slowed significantly and the bull market has had its horns shaved. Still, no one is anticipating a bad summer.
"Now I guess we say that gas prices are keeping people closer to home and that people know they have a good time when they come," said Candace Forbes, owner of Ralph Hayes Realty Inc. in Point Pleasant Beach. "As long as the people here aren't too greedy with prices, we can attract the same clientele year after year."
Ms. Forbes said that the towns farther north -- from the less expensive ones like Lavellette to the upscale ones like Mantaloking -- were doing quite well. The well-to-do are apparently unworried about prices, she said, and the budget-minded have a little extra cash to spend at the beach.
"Here in Point Pleasant Beach, our rentals are going fairly well, but we still have openings," she said. "Things are going for approximately what they rented for last year. Most of the openings we have left are for early July and late August, but there are spots elsewhere as well."
She said weekly rents for three-bedroom units ranged from $2,500 to $2,800 for a beachfront condominium to $1,500 for a unit with one bathroom a block from the beach to $1,000 for a smaller place with no air conditioning about two blocks away.
In Wildwood, farther south along the 126-mile Jersey coast, the rental market is booming. "Rents have gone way up here, especially in quieter Wildwood Crest and North Wildwood," said Jessica Lees, at Lees Real Estate Agency. "People are excited about a Wildwood revival, with all the Doo-Wop architecture and new restaurants."
"I know a man who raised his rent $700 a week this year, which is unheard of here," Ms. Lees added. "It's a four-bedroom, three-bath beachfront in North Wildwood that went from $2,300 to $3,000 a week in one year, and he booked it up." 
Still, she said that most rentals in Wildwood went for far less. "Even one block off the beach, you can find a two-bedroom apartment for as little as $600 in Wildwood Crest," she said. "I still think we have something for anyone, but it looks good for both higher rents and more people renting."
Not that there aren't some clouds. Some real estate agents, like Mike Powers at Tim Kerr Power Play Realty in Avalon, are a bit wary. For instance, Mr. Kerr said that in Avalon -- an upscale resort situated with Stone Harbor on what is known as Seven-Mile Island between Wildwood and Atlantic City -- some owners might have jacked up prices a bit too much.
"Some people bought for high prices and think they have to justify it with exorbitant rents," said Mr. Powers, who noted that there are actually fewer rental properties in town this year because of duplexes made into single-family homes and owners who have decided they no longer need to rent to make the mortgage.
"At some point you have to say that renting for $5,000 a week at the shore isn't what you want to do," he said. "If it isn't a really great house, maybe you either decide to buy something yourself, go to something more reasonable or vacation in Europe for that kind of money."
But for bed-and-breakfasts in places like Bay Head farther north and Cape May to the South, life is good. Many places in Cape May now require a four-night minimum for small, if charming, rooms that cost $150 a night or more.
"It's really getting almost year-round here," said Patricia Joyce, who owns the Duke of Windsor bed-and-breakfast on Washington Street in Cape May. "People come from late February to New Year's. But the summers have been really good of late. There are more than 50 places here in town, and everyone seems to be doing well."
Things seem to be changing a bit in the towns of Margate, Ventnor and Longport, which share Absecon Island with the larger and tawdrier Atlantic City. Historically, people have rented homes in those towns for the season -- with few vacationers, if any, staying for only a week.
"But now I see a lot of people who want to come for one month instead of the whole summer," said Ronnie Alper, a real estate agent in Margate. "The summer rental market is a little slower here because people just aren't doing the whole summer as much or those who do have finally bought their own houses."
On the other hand, prices haven't really gone down, Ms. Alper said, noting that one five-bedroom house in Margate one up from the beach was rented for $58,000 for the summer, up from $44,000 last year.
"I would have thought people would have been more affected by the stock market," she said. "But if you love the ocean, you just want to be here whatever it costs."

HEADLINE: Why Mortgage Rates Aren't Even Better 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
DELIGHTED though they may be at the potential business, mortgage brokers are grinding their teeth, frustrated by a bulging loan-application pipeline that was jammed, at first, by refinance fence-sitters waiting for that optimal interest rate, followed around April 15 by tax write-off seekers urged on by their accountants, and in recent weeks by Fed rate-cut dreamers.
 At the same time, would-be borrowers are confused and even angry that, in fact, the recent short-term interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has had little or no effect on reducing long-term mortgage rates. For what most borrowers don't understand, say mortgage-industry analysts, is that immediate moves by the Fed are far removed from mortgage rates -- which already were, and still are, near historic lows. 
 "The phones have been ringing off the hook," said James Fresella, president of Apollo Financial Services, a small, three-agent mortgage lender in Riverdale, N.J. "When the Fed cuts rates, we're inundated with anywhere from 30 to 40 calls a day; and normally it would be two to three a day."
Then come the strained conversations. 
"They're yelling, 'What do you mean? Are you crazy? Why aren't mortgage rates coming down?' " Mr. Fresella said. "It's very frustrating. And you have to be courteous enough to explain to them that even though the Fed cuts rates, it doesn't affect mortgages directly." 
The picture is little different, just enlarged, at the 60-agent New York Mortgage Company in Manhattan. "Everybody's loan-processing pipelines are bursting," said Steven Schnall, the company president. "It's been happening all year."
"The problem for lenders is that, unlike in a purchase transaction where the borrower must immediately go to closing," Mr. Schnall said, "a lot of refinancers have been sitting on the fence, waiting to lock in, because of rumors that the Fed was going to cut rates."
"There were certain people who were very happy with a 6.875 percent rate a few weeks ago," he continued, "and those were the people who heard the talk that the Fed was going to cut rates. So they said, 'I'll wait.' And they were surprised that the Fed cut had almost no effect."
On April 17, the day before the Fed announced its latest half-point rate cut, interest on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.36 percent. At the start of business last Thursday, the average was 7.32 percent.
Since the beginning of the year, said Douglas Duncan, the senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, "more than 50 percent of all mortgage applications in the nation have been for the purpose of refinancing."
"People are converting adjustable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages," Mr. Duncan said, as they try to lock in to current favorable rates. "People are shortening their terms; going to a 15- or 20-year mortgage, rather than refinancing a 30-year. They are taking cash out of the equity they've built up in their homes to pay off personal debt. Or they are just looking to lower their monthly payments."
For several months, Francisco Cedeno has been weighing whether to refinance the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on the home he bought in Union, N.J., a year ago. He has been discussing it, increasingly frequently, with Mr. Fresella at the Apollo mortgage firm.
"I've been calling Jim for the last two months," Mr. Cedeno said. "The last month it was kind of weekly, and now it's come to every two, three days, right after the last Fed cut."
Mr. Cedeno, a hedge fund analyst, and his wife, Maritza, have two children, Angelica, 4, and Steven, 1. "We bought about a year ago, when interest rates were peaking," Mr. Cedeno said. The price for the four-bedroom, extended Cape was $175,000, of which $160,000 was financed at 8.25 percent. 
"I see the Fed dropping rates, the economy slowing down, and I'm thinking that's a good thing for refinancing," Mr. Cedeno said. "Then I found out that that only affects short-term rates, and mortgage rates are still going up."
The Cedenos hope to lower their monthly payments so they can renovate the driveway, the front steps, the kitchen. "Some of the work I'm doing myself, with some relatives," Mr. Cedeno said. "I can't really make a long commitment with a contractor."
"When you try to make a move, it's like the rates know you're coming, and they go up," he said. "I'm frustrated because, well, I don't know, some days they're down, some days up -- nothing concrete."
Besides the average of 7.36 percent for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages on April 17 -- the day before the Fed's last rate cut -- the average for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages that day was 6.92 percent, and for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages it was 6.43 percent for the first year of the mortgage. (Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARM's, initially offer low rates for a set number of years -- as a sort of enticement -- after which the rates may rise steeply.)
By Thursday morning, the average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages stood at 7.32 percent, four basis points below the rate on April 17 (each percentage point equals 100 basis points); the 15-year fixed rate was 6.82, down 10 basis points, and one-year adjustable rates averaged 6.21 percent, 22 basis points below the rate on the day before the Fed cut. 
"There is a great expectation that mortgage rates will immediately move in the same direction and by the same magnitude as changes in Fed monetary policy," said David W. Berson, the chief economist for Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home financing agency. "As a result, when the Fed cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points on April 18, the popular expectation was that long-term mortgage rates would immediately decline by the same amount."
"In fact," Dr. Berson said, "mortgage rates had already incorporated the expectation of this Fed easing of the federal funds rate into the level of long-term mortgage rates."
ONE analyst, Keith Gumbinger of HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Butler, N.J., tweaked the media for its coverage of the Fed and mortgage rates. "The airwaves and news pages were full of discussion of how the Fed move will bring lower borrowing costs to home buyers, refinancers, consumer borrowers," Mr. Gumbinger said. "But painting the Fed move as an across-the-board rate cut for everybody left many potential borrowers with a bad taste in their mouths when their brokers told them, 'Rates aren't going down; they're actually rising right now.' " Long-term mortgage rates had actually spiked up a bit in the days after the Fed cut.
"Follow-up pieces may more completely evaluate what happens, what it means," Mr. Gumbinger said, "but nothing grabs a consumer like a 40-point headline."
What most borrowers are unaware of is that mortgage rates are not set by the Fed; they are, instead, closely tied to long-term bond yields. A significant portion of the bond market consists of bundles of mortgage-backed securities, whose yields tend to rise and fall along with long-term Treasury bonds -- not with the short-term rates that the Fed directly influences. And this year long-term rates have not fallen very much, a fact that has surprised some bond market analysts.
Sometimes, when the Fed raises short-term interest rates because it wants to pre-empt an increase in inflation, long-term mortgage rates may rise in order to make the bundles of mortgages sold to investors attractive to buyers fearful of future inflation. At other times, when the Fed lowers short-term interest rates in order to stimulate the economy, mortgage rates may not drop as steeply as the cut made by the Fed, and may even rise because they have already declined in anticipation that the Fed would be easing rates. 
The latter scenario is precisely what has happened in recent months, said Mr. Gumbinger, the analyst at HSH Associates.
On April 18, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates -- specifically the federal funds rate, which is the overnight lending rate between banks, and the discount rate, which is the interest rate the Fed charges banks to borrow from it -- by 0.5 percent, or 50 basis points. "The Fed stated that it believed the economy is soft and that the softness will continue," Mr. Gumbinger said. 
"What does it mean to Mr. and Mrs. Mortgage Borrower? Unfortunately, very little," Mr. Gumbinger continued, "because mortgage interest rates did most of their declining last year, long before the Fed got involved, and remain near historic lows." The low for the last 10 years -- in fact, the last 33 years -- was 6.68 percent in October 1998.
From mid-May of 2000 until early January of this year, the average interest on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined from 8.82 percent to 7.34 percent. Surprisingly, the long decline was sparked by a half-point increase in the federal funds rate to 6.5 percent on May 16, 2000, which, coupled with sharply rising energy prices, caused a marked slowdown in economic growth.
"The high cost of short-term borrowing helped slow the economy appreciably, which was the Fed's intent because growth had been running so strong that the Fed was afraid inflation might gain a toehold," Mr. Gumbinger said. "However, as those higher short-term interest rates began to do their work, the higher energy prices kicked in, causing a more pronounced slowing in the economy than the Fed anticipated."
"Yet, even as the economy slowed, the Fed held those short-term rates at a very high level," Mr. Gumbinger continued. "And long-term mortgage rates declined along with the diminishing growth in the economy." Because demand for credit is very low during a slowdown and inflation pressures are usually near their low point, lenders lower rates to attract borrowers.
"That brought us up to January of this year." Mr. Gumbinger said. "The Fed responded to -- what's a nice word for it? -- the unexpected slowdown by trimming rates one half of a percentage point on Jan. 3. And because the Federal Reserve has shown its willingness to address the economic slowdown, thereby increasing the possibility of renewed growth just down the road, mortgage interest rates stopped declining, and have since been bouncing in a narrow range."
SINCE the Fed's first interest rate cut on Jan. 3, 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates have fluctuated between a high of 7.34 percent during the week ended Jan. 26 and a low of 7.07 percent the week of March 23. "So on Jan. 3," Mr. Gumbinger said, "there was that half-point cut by the Fed; then, on Jan. 31, there was another; on March 20, another, and on April 18, the most recent one. But despite those cuts totaling 200 basis points, mortgage rates have moved in a range of only 27 basis points."
Dr. Berson at Fannie Mae concurs with that scenario, adding that even another Fed cut is unlikely to further reduce mortgage rates. "It's likely that another 50 basis points of Fed easing is already incorporated into the current level of mortgage rates," he said. "The economy would have to weaken so much more than currently anticipated that the Fed would have to go beyond the 50 basis points already anticipated for the next several months in order for long-term mortgage rates to decline further."
Mr. Duncan at the Mortgage Bankers Association said, however, that he "would disagree slightly that a full 50 basis points are already incorporated into interest rates in mortgage markets."
"Certainly 25 basis points are already in the market," he said, "but there is some potential for lowering mortgage interest rates if the Fed goes another 50 basis points."
"Still," he added, "the bottom line for mortgage consumers is that there is not much room for a decline in rates."
One year after buying his two-bedroom duplex town house condominium on West 89th Street, complete with a fireplace and a garden in the back -- "not many New Yorkers can say they have their own tree" -- Steven Savad is sitting on the mortgage refinance fence.
Mr. Savad, chief financial officer of Restaurant.com, an Internet company that creates Web sites for restaurants, and his wife, Sherri, an advertising planner, paid just under $1 million for their home. "You're sort of a victim of whatever the rates are at the time you buy," he said. 
The Savads financed about half the purchase price with an adjustable-rate mortgage in which the rate is fixed for the first five years, then becomes an adjustable in which rates can change annually for the remainder of the 30-year term. The rate for the loan, called a 5-1 ARM, was 8.125 percent, carrying a monthly payment of about $4,000.
While he has "no regrets about the mortgage," Mr. Savad is taking a hard look at the new realities.
"If I simply wanted to refinance with the same vehicle that I have -- a new 5-1 ARM -- I could do it and reduce my monthly payment by roughly 15 percent," Mr. Savad said. "But the rate wouldn't be much different on a 10-year fixed because I've also seen them at around 7 percent."
The Savads, their interest piqued by news coverage of the Fed rate cuts, are thick into the process. "In this day and age, with the way news is broadcast, you almost can't help but breathe it," Mr. Savad said.
"I'm going to lock in, that's for sure," he said. "The question is when, exactly -- likely very soon."

State of the Reunion

BYLINE:  By MARCY WEBSTER; Marcy Webster is a writer who lives in Moorestown.

 BODY:
WE'RE in our celebration years. We attend significant anniversaries and birthdays so often that I recently bought an economy-size roll of gold-foil gift wrap. Our own household is temporarily between milestones, but we're beginning to gear up for something major: our 50th anniversary will fall in the middle of this year.
 Probably both of us would prefer to have a low-key party at the house in South Jersey where we've lived for more than 30 years. Our nearby children have overflow room for the two others who live far away, so we can send the North Carolina family to our son's house in Riverside and the Vermonters can sleep six miles south in Haddonfield. Our old house with its well-worn rooms and big, shady yard is a perfect place to convene. We've fixed our grandchildren an attic playroom and a gated secret garden beneath the wisteria. 
 It would be work. There are 16 of us now. The children help in substantial ways, but conservatively, that's 24 sheets, 640 dirty dishes, 200 bottles for recycling, 50 discussions about plans, 10 losses of the remote control and 20 arguments about the rules of games. And when we are at home, we tend to slide into our original roles. I feel responsible for everything. Still the guardian mother, I worry about designated drivers and dangerous escapades. I'm always trying to fix things. Fussing to keep mayonnaise off William's sandwiches and poultices on Rowan's poison ivy. Fretting until I force a smile out of anyone who's sulking. My husband, a most peaceful and patient man, overreacts to the pressure and gets cranky if everybody doesn't eat together. He stands at the stove broiling fish to order while the potatoes are still like stones. Sometimes our children fall back into the sibling roles that they've really outgrown, and once in a while an unresolved issue simmers along with the soup.
It would be more expensive but more relaxing to do what we did for our 40th anniversary. In each quarter of that year, we left New Jersey to take one of our second-generation families on a short trip. That's demanding in its own way, but we had fun planning an appropriate place for each group so that the golfers didn't have to go to museums and the childless couples didn't have to wait for a sitter to show up.
We took the turnpike south to the kind of relaxed venues where it's acceptable to sit around in stocking feet, sipping beer and reliving sandies and miracle putts. The couples with toddlers met us at a safe place on a New England lake where we spent long days in steady rowboats and early nights in rooms that smelled of cedar logs. We saw our children, and their children, in settings that brought out their best. We learned once more how much talent and energy and affection they have. That kind of trip allows us to focus all our loving attention on one set of people without the inevitable competition for favor that surfaces now and then in even the most selflessly mature people. And to tell the truth, we like their undivided interest in us.
Last spring we were missing our Charlotte-based son and his family. So we met them in Virginia for a weekend, and on Saturday night we found ourselves in the formal dining room of an elegant hotel. There was spectacular food and service but, most rewarding of all, there was an orchestra playing romantic music by Rodgers and Hart. I danced with my 10-year-old grandson, his parents danced together, but the evening's most tenacious dancer was Hannah, who led her grandfather onto the floor time after time while their entrees got cold and the other diners applauded their twirls. I hope we can keep those tender moments coming, celebration or not. It's the kind of interlude that gets muffled in the confusion of a larger cast.
Traveling that way, in intimate groups, eliminates the intensity that we'd have in a full family reunion. But then, aren't we losing the point? If 50 years of marriage is about anything, it's about that. It's about common memory and shared feelings, no matter if the memories still burn and the feelings still hurt. What are we celebrating if not the struggle and the triumph of raising four people who love one another and us, most of the time?
I cherish the meals when our children sit around the table and reminisce about the epic failures of our house cuisine. They don't remember them right, but that's O.K. The lime peas story is true, and the birthday cake that no one could cut or chew; those disasters were mine. I get anxious when they move from food to "What was the worst thing you ever did?" to "What was your closest call?" But from the distance of 48 years of motherhood, I ought to be able to make myself relax and listen.
If we celebrate at home, I will have to relinquish my podium behind the sink and find a helper to deal with the dishes and a caterer to provide the food. If we're lucky, we can coordinate the fruit, corn and tomatoes that the out-of-staters crave with a break in the summer humidity that they can no longer endure.
And I'll hide the balding teddy bear that both sons claim, or Solomon-like, slice it down the middle and sew up a half of each. There will be an alcove set aside where the little girls can dance, and we'll spin 50 years of music, our picks. If we have to, we can hire a referee for the soccer games, and another one for the Scrabble. 
But if I should win the lottery before then, I'm cancelling that plan and taking everybody to a luxury resort in Hawaii.

Discounts That Come to Travelers Who Wait

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
MICHAEL DWECK, an advertising executive from New York, was eager to attend a dinner his brother was giving in San Francisco last winter. Although the party had been planned for a while, his brother forgot to invite him until the day before.
 For many people, talk of making such a trip would have ended right there. After all, who wants to pay the premium prices that airlines and hotels typically charge for last-minute bookings? 
 As it turned out, Mr. Dweck, who is 42, did not have to. He found a great deal on one of a growing number of Web sites that specialize in such travel. He said he paid $408 for a package including a round-trip ticket from Kennedy International Airport to San Francisco, on nonstop flights, and a two-night hotel stay at the Sofitel in nearby Redwood City, with a waterfront view. He figures that he saved about $2,000 on the trip: the cheapest fare he could find elsewhere for a transcontinental flight was $1,680, he said, while Sofitel's rack room rate that weekend was $360 a night. 
His experience is not unusual. More travelers are finding 11th-hour bargains, whether on specialized sites like site59.com, which Mr. Dweck used for his California trip, or on general travel sites like those operated by Priceline, American Express and Expedia, which is controlled by Microsoft.
Many of these sites are now receiving huge numbers of tour packages, cruises, hotel rooms and airline tickets to sell, and at unusually low prices, because of continuing soft conditions in the travel industry.
The speed of the Internet has made it easier to book at the last minute. In a report issued last July, PhoCusWright, a Sherman, Conn., company that researches online travel, found that one-quarter of all Internet users, or about 25 million people, took an "unplanned, last-minute or spur-of-the-moment" trip recently. The Travel Industry Association of America, a trade group, noted a similar trend in survey results released in February. It found that one-third of all nonbusiness travelers who planned and booked trips online did so within two weeks of their departures.
Of course, not everyone may be comfortable booking a holiday at the last minute. Such travel often means a lack of choice, whether among airlines, cruise lines, hotel chains or even destinations. But people whose plans are flexible -- or who just have a sense of adventure -- can save from 10 to 70 percent off published travel prices. That certainly appeals to Cheryl Tormey, 43, a bill collector from Monroe, Conn. She says she has bought cruise vacations for herself and her husband, Raymond, 45, a computer technician, from moments-notice.com for the last three summers and plans to buy another this year, probably in late June. "I've got to wait to see what's available," she said. "Although it could get nerve-racking, I've gotten used to doing this. I've saved a tremendous amount of money on the cruises, probably a couple of hundred to five hundred dollars," on each cruise.
As travelers' acceptance has grown, so has the supply of offerings. David S. Miranda, chairman of LastMinuteTravel.com, which started in February 2000, says his company is receiving 30 to 40 percent more discount offers today than it did a year ago, at prices 10 percent lower. And Mike Putman, president of 11thHourVacations.com, established in 1996, says he has received more new inventory in the last six weeks than in the previous nine months. Both sites are also reporting significant sales increases. Mr. Putman says his sales have quintupled since the start of the year, while Mr. Miranda expects second-quarter sales to climb 50 percent over the first quarter.
Pauline Frommer, editor of the Web site Frommers.com, which tracks travel bargains, said the deals were numerous. "We're seeing tremendously low rates -- like a $655, six-night, air-and-hotel package in Paris in June -- in part because of the recession, and in part because of fears about foot-and-mouth and mad cow diseases in Europe," she said. "There's also an incredible surge in Alaska cruise deals, because of overbuilding by the cruise lines and people being nervous about spending money."
FOR the longer term, Kate Rice, an analyst at PhoCusWright, predicted that the spur-of-the-moment travel sector could surpass other online travel categories because the last-minute sites "do such a great job putting together distressed inventory that suppliers can sell cheaply, without undermining their published prices."
Web sites sell last-minute travel in a variety of ways. Most of the sites are privately owned, although some are public or backed by larger travel companies. 
Some sites specialize in creating and selling their own offers. Those sites include site59.com, which started a year ago and is backed by the Boston Consulting Group, Goldman Sachs, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Bass and others. Another is a publicly traded company, lastminute.com, which began in Britain in 1998 and is backed by Bass, Starwood and the British Airports Authority, among others; it also has sites for several other countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Australia and South Africa. (When Americans buy travel from these sites, they must make their own arrangements to reach an overseas destination where their trip would begin. Also, all airline tickets must be picked up abroad.)
Some sites, like LastMinuteTravel.com and Travelzoo.com, essentially act as billboards for other travel companies. They post discounts the companies choose to offer and link buyers directly to sites where they can make purchases. Go-today.com offers vacation packages created by its parent company, Europe Express, a wholesaler that sells tours to travel agents, while moments-notice.com, which has a $25 annual membership fee, offers tour packages and cruises that travel companies are unable to sell. 
Then there are the Web sites that sell all types of travel, including the last-minute variety. Those sites include Expedia.com, AmericanExpress.com, Travelocity.com, Hotwire.com and Priceline.com. And most major United States airlines have offered deeply discounted tickets online for last-minute travel for the last several years, while TravelWeb.com has offered deeply discounted hotel rooms for stays the next weekend.
Not surprisingly, major restrictions are often imposed on last-minute bookings. Site59.com, for example, usually does not permit changes or refunds, while most others charge a fee for cancellations or changes. Some sites, like Priceline and Hotwire, do not reveal the name of the travel company whose services they sell until the purchase is made, while others, like site59.com, show that information up front.
Travelers can also sign up for sites' electronic mailing lists. Many sites send out regular e-mail alerts, some tailored to their customers' individual interests. 
Todd Leasure, 32, a mortgage broker from Marietta, Ga., whose family also owns a condominium in Longboat Key, Fla., has arranged for LastMinuteTravel.com to notify him whenever there is an air-fare sale on flights between Atlanta and Tampa. He says he has bought discounted tickets four times through the site, most recently in March, when he found a $135 round trip on Delta. "I usually don't know when I can go to Florida until the day I travel or the day before because I'm a salesman," he said. "I have to take care of my clients, because if I don't, they'll get upset with me."
JOB responsibilities also keep Tara Kennelly, 32, an executive assistant at AOL Time Warner who lives in Hazlet, N.J., from planning too far in advance. In February, she bought a weeklong vacation with her fiance, Kennneth Lagana, an executive at cbssportsline.com, to Playa del Carmen, Mexico, through LastMinuteTravel.com. They paid a total of $1,278 for the trip, which included two round-trip tickets on American Trans Air and upgraded hotel accommodations at the Allegro Royal Hideaway. 
Ms. Kennelly said they "were just looking to get away, but we couldn't plan that far in advance."
"We looked online and it came out perfectly," she added. "I always wanted to go to Mexico, and the price was incredible."
She was so pleased with the arrangements, she said, that she expects to use the service again, when she goes on her honeymoon next spring.
Mr. Dweck, meanwhile, says he expects to take more impromptu trips over the next few months, rather than spending all his vacation time on Long Island beaches.
"Instead of renting a house in Montauk, as I have for the past four years, this summer I'll probably take four or five little trips with site59 and go to Montauk for a couple of weeks," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Personal Business page last Sunday discussed last-minute travel bargains available over the Web. The article cited the positive experience of Michael Dweck, an advertising executive from Manhattan, who had used a travel site, site59.com, for an impromptu trip to San Francisco. Mr. Dweck was quoted as saying he would probably use the site again.
A reader has pointed out that Mr. Dweck's company, Dweck! Inc., has a relationship with site59.com; he is listed as a creative partner. Mr. Dweck, telephoned last week, said that he saw no conflict because he took the impromptu trip in February 2000, before he signed on with the company, and that the article erred in saying the trip was this past winter. The article's author, a freelancer, said she had been unaware of Mr. Dweck's dealings with site59.com and had been directed to him by its public relations firm when she asked for names of recent customers.

Arrow Electronics Reports A Rise in Quarterly Income
Arrow Electronics Inc. (NYSE: ARW) of Melville has reported that its net income for the first quarter was $77.4 million on sales of $3.3 billion, or 74 cents a share. In the first quarter last year, Arrow reported income of $63.1 million on sales of $2.8 billion, or 65 cents a share. 
 Francis M. Scricco, Arrow's president and chief executive, said that there might be some softening of results in the months ahead. Weakening economic conditions in North America resulted in a sales slowdown late in the first quarter. 
 "Our operations in the Asia/Pacific region experienced a similar weakening during the quarter," he said. "In Europe, however, our businesses continued to perform well. Second-quarter unit volumes will be below first-quarter levels. Given our industry's well-documented supply imbalances, gross margin erosion can be expected."
Arrow, a distributor of electronic components and computer products, is Long Island's largest company, with sales revenues of $13 billion last year.

Around the Island
Del Laboratories (Amex: DLI) of Uniondale announced Monday that net sales for the first quarter were $72.7 million, up from $67.5 million in last year's first quarter. Net earnings were $1.3 million, or 16 cents a share, up from $501,000, or 6 cents a share last year. The results "reflect the continued strength of our brands," said Dan K. Wassong, the chairman and president. . . . Curative Health Services (Nasdaq: CURE) of Hauppauge has reported that first-quarter revenues were down compared with last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $13.5 million, compared with $22.2 million in 2000. "Considering the weakness in the hospital industry, we're pleased with the performance," said John Prior, the company's president. . . . Vicon Industries Inc. (Amex: VII) of Hauppauge said that sales for the second quarter of its fiscal year slipped to $17.2 million, from $17.4 million in the same period a year ago. Net income totaled $418,000, or 9 cents a share, up from $186,000, or 4 cents a share. Ken Darby, the chief executive, said the results reflected a slowing economy. . . . Morton's Restaurant Group (NYSE: MRG) of New Hyde Park has urged shareholders to reject what it called a hostile takeover bid from the BFMA Holding Corporation of Pompano Beach, Fla. Carl C. Icahn is backing the Florida group.

HEADLINE: ...And to Penny-Pinching Wizardry 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
BY now, it is the stuff of legend: in the 1980's, Robert L. Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, came up with the idea of removing just one olive from every dinner salad served to passengers. They would never notice, let alone squawk, he figured, and the airline could save some money. He was right, to the tune of $40,000 a year.
 For much of the 1990's, while the bull ran free on Wall Street and corporate tills brimmed with cash, those kinds of small-but-they-add-up cost considerations were few and far between in corporate America. Then the dot-coms began imploding, many of them disappearing and many others metamorphosing from perk-filled playgrounds to bare-bones bastions. And now, as the larger economy has turned from boom to blah, the spirit of Crandall's Olive is stalking most corporate and Wall Street halls. 
 Sure, the companies are going after the multimillion-dollar cuts -- the asset sales, the downsizing, the buying of goods and services on the Internet, the farming-out of manufacturing and assembly operations to low-cost parts of the world. But all kinds of companies, from Wall Street firms like Credit Suisse First Boston to manufacturers like Xerox to media concerns like AOL Time Warner, are also chopping away at work amenities. Gone are the lobster-and-Champagne celebrations, the daily fresh flowers and free sodas, the first-class (or even business-class) air travel, the limousines, the meetings in exotic climes -- much of the same fat, in fact, that many companies eliminated after the market crash of 1987 but that had crept back on.
"We're not saying, 'Stay at Motel 6 and eat at McDonald's,' and we're not attacking compensation, benefits or any of the things that make for real quality of life," said Kenneth S. Goldman, chief financial officer of Student Advantage, a direct marketing company in Boston. "But you can drink filtered water instead of bottled, and you can be happy at a Holiday Inn instead of a Marriott. And not everyone needs a cell phone, and no one needs a limo."
While the companies are direct about asking their employees to tighten their belts, they are making their customers sacrifice, too. More olives, as well as many other things big and small, are disappearing from the flight plan. Airlines are cutting back on staff, flights and paper tickets, as well as on breakfasts, juice and wine selections and even the table linens in first class. United Airlines alone is saving about $50,000 a year by removing olives, lemon peels and grapefruit juice from its list of bar condiments.
IN the true spirit of Crandall's Olive, some companies are introducing cost-saving measures in ways that they hope their customers will never notice. There are fewer diapers in many packages of Procter & Gamble's Luvs and Pampers, and Kimberly-Clark's Huggies. The prices for the smaller packages are lower, but the per-diaper charge is higher. And customers who buy Fritos and Cheetos, made by the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo, are getting smaller packages with fewer treats for the same money.
The lighter packages have bulked up corporate coffers: for the first quarter of the year, operating earnings at Frito-Lay North America were up 10 percent from the comparable period last year, in large part, said Andrew Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, because of that so-called weight-out program.
Product variety is on the downswing, too. Online shoppers, for example, can no longer buy an $8 rake from Amazon.com. The company recognized that shipping it -- or a host of other low-ticket products -- cost enough to eat up any profit margin on them.
Employees, however, are so far bearing the brunt of many of the corporate cuts. In some cases, companies are simply enforcing rules that no one much followed in the boom days. In others, they are imposing -- or strongly suggesting -- new fiscal restraints. But the fact is, company after company is clamping down.
Here are some of the areas under the cost cutters' microscopes:

HOUSEKEEPING -- American Standard, the maker of plumbing fixtures and air conditioners, is saving $70,000 a year at a plant in Tyler, Tex., by having its crew vacuum the entryway floor mats instead of sending out the mats for cleaning. The same factory was paying to have used wooden pallets carted away; now it is selling them. The net gain is $38,000 a year.

GREENERY -- Xerox is saving $200,000 a year by cutting out a plant-watering service; employees have installed an "adopt a plant" program to keep the foliage hydrated. Art Institutes International at San Francisco, a commercial art school, went one better. It had been paying a local company about $700 a month to provide and maintain plants and cut flowers throughout its seven-story building; it has reduced the cost to $450 by forgoing foliage in hallways, offices and other areas that only the staff frequents. "We want to be smart with how we spend our resources, without looking like we're cutting costs," said Barbara L. Roberts, the school's president.

RIDES HOME -- The Goldman Sachs Group used to pay for car services to drive analysts home after 8 p.m., even if they lived in suburbs that were a triple-digit fare away. "Now, unless we're really working well past 9 p.m., we settle for a taxi to the train station," a Goldman analyst said.

FREE FOOD -- Goldman has also eliminated the boxes of apples, grapes and oranges that used to be available all day. And editors and writers at Time Inc., part of AOL Time Warner, have been weaned from the free fruit, sodas and lavish closing-night dinners to which they had become accustomed. At Xerox, catered meetings are out. Instead, "people order in subs that they pay for out of their own pockets, or take a break and have lunch in a local cafeteria," said Kathleen A. Hargather, vice president for nonproduction purchasing.

OFFICE SUPPLIES -- Student Advantage insists that all employees use the pens and papers that the company stocks in bulk -- "if you want neon-colored Post-it notes or gel pens, it's on your nickel," Mr. Goldman said. And Canon U.S.A. is recycling furniture. For example, during an expansion, its Hawaii office asked for about $70,000 for new chairs, desks and such. Instead, Canon shipped excess furniture from its Jamesburg, N.J., office. The shipping and reassembling cost was $17,000.

TRINKETS AND TROPHIES -- Investment bankers at Credit Suisse First Boston have been told to keep the cost of Lucite mementos -- the fancy clear tokens that are usually distributed to clients and bankers after a deal and that can cost $75 to $250 each -- to below $2,500 a deal. The firm used to give out 20 to 50 a deal, including some to members of the Credit Suisse team; now the bankers are to give most of the trophies to clients. (At The New York Times Company, even little keepsakes are going by the boards. At the annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day last month, some girls complained that for the first time they did not get goody bags and had to bring their own pencils and paper.)

CELEBRATIONS -- It used to be that when a big merger deal went down, the investment bankers and their clients -- and their spouses or significant others -- would have lavish weekend celebrations at hotels or convention centers. And those were in addition to the closing dinners, with lobster and free-flowing Champagne. Several big investment banks, including Credit Suisse, Goldman and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, are eliminating such weekends and asking their staffs to keep down the dinner guest lists.
"It's not as onerous as you might expect," one investment banker said. "After all, there just aren't that many deals to celebrate these days."
Nor do the Wall Street firms expect any big resurgence soon. Instead of flying its managing directors somewhere for its usual summer meeting, Goldman Sachs will hold a teleconference. The firm has already canceled its annual winter dinner, a year-end celebration at which hundreds of partners from around the world convened to make merry in merrier times.
Many less frivolous expenses are being cut, too.
Some companies, like Electronic Data Systems and Xerox, report that they are curtailing off-site training sessions and are instead encouraging employees to use online tutorials or are asking some of their own employees to teach classes.
Merrill Lynch used to provide high-producing brokers with access to expensive computer-linked trading networks like Level II, which provides real-time information on Nasdaq trades. Now, if they want it, brokers must pay for the service themselves -- as well as for any assistants deemed superfluous.
"Level II was a nice but not necessary tool to have, but I really need two assistants," said one broker, who has dropped the data service but is paying his second aide's $4,000-a-month salary himself.
Time Inc. is getting rid of one of its most coveted jobs, that of editor at large. Editors who held that title made as much as $300,000 a year consulting to the company's various publications, yet produced little actual text themselves. Now some have been asked to join the staffs of its magazines, while others are renegotiating their salaries. Of about a dozen such editors, at least four have left the full-time staff; those who remained have joined specific magazines.
A growing number of companies are encouraging or even mandating paid or unpaid vacations, sometimes to allow for a temporary plant closing, sometimes to get accrued vacation time off the books, sometimes just to cut overall payroll costs.
And some, like Credit Suisse First Boston and Intel, are trying to keep the payroll from swelling by asking the graduating students to whom they had made job offers to delay their starting dates -- or not to come at all.
THE reasons for the penny-pinching vary widely. At companies that have cut whole swaths of employees, it appears unseemly not to spread the pain among those who remain. And now that the dot-com universe has lost much of its allure, few companies feel that they need special perquisites to recruit or retain most employees.
Companies also want to show customers and shareholders that they are holding the line on costs. "Due to current market conditions, firms want to display an 'all business, less pleasure' attitude," said Eliezer M. Fich, a visiting assistant professor of finance at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
But big cost cuts have big costs of their own. Laying off employees requires huge reserves for severance. Installing supply-chain management programs or setting up Internet buying and selling services can also be expensive and disruptive. For instance, Nova Chemicals, based in Calgary, Alberta, is spending $3 million to install a system that will let it buy many of its supplies online.
But there is no financial cost in cutting back on fruit and parties. Nor is the psychic cost very high these days. Employees -- many of whom have seen colleagues and neighbors laid off -- are for the most part accepting the cutbacks without much squawking. "You can't blame the company for trying to save a buck by getting rid of the unnecessary," another Goldman analyst said.
In fact, employees at some companies are pitching their own ideas for cuts. Soon after Richard H. Brown became the chairman of Electronic Data Systems in January 1999, he sent an e-mail message to the company's 140,000 employees, asking each to come up with an idea for saving $1,000 at E.D.S.
"Employees in Michigan got rid of extra phone lines, a team in California got rid of modems, three people in Toronto began booking air travel seven days in advance," Mr. Brown recalled. "People voluntarily booked cheaper hotels and canceled expensive training sessions in favor of Internet courses."
Such savings gave a big boost to the bottom line -- as did the layoffs of more than 13,000 employees. E.D.S. ended last year with operating margins of 9.5 percent, compared with 7.5 percent in 1998.
A MANAGER at one Xerox division made something of a game out of a company-imposed cutback. In the first quarter last year, Xerox held 114 lavish kickoff meetings at which sales representatives enjoyed themselves as their bosses pepped them up to sell the latest products. This year the company, which has lost money for several quarters, saved $19 million by holding just 15 "live" meetings and holding the others with a combination of conference calls and intranet slides.
To forestall the inevitable grumbling, Michael Long, the manager in charge of the sales meeting at Xerox Business Service Systems, sent care packages to the sales staff. The packages, costing $11.81 each, included microwave popcorn, crayons, balloons, chocolate coins and a happy-sad picture of the field vice president that could be reversed by the participants during the meeting to help them visualize their leader's reactions.
"We inserted music and trivia quizzes and sound effects, we kept the meeting light, and we embraced the idea of 'fun without funds,' " Mr. Long said.
Companies that are not under such financial pressure are more likely to try the carrot than the stick. Canon U.S.A., a main Xerox competitor, never used to pick up extra hotel costs for employees who wanted to extend business trips over a weekend. Now, it will do so to take advantage of the cheaper air fares available for trips that include Saturday-night stays. "I don't want anyone to feel they have to stay over the weekend, but if they want to, and it saves us money, we'll encourage it," said Seymour Liebman, a Canon executive vice president.
Similarly, Barry W. Perry, chief executive of Engelhard, a specialty chemical company, recently installed a video conference setup on the executive floor of its headquarters in Iselin, N.J..
"Historically, when our executives needed to talk to people elsewhere, they flew," Mr. Perry said. "I didn't want to put in an edict about cutting out executive travel, but I think they'll soon realize this is faster as well as cheaper."
E.D.S. did not want to carry the cost of the employee health club at its Plano, Tex., headquarters, but it also did not want to take away the perk. So it recently donated the gym to the local Y.M.C.A. -- and arranged for employees and their families to receive discounts. "Families weren't allowed to use it when we owned it, so they saw it as a plus," Mr. Brown said.
Many companies, while not asking employees to give up anything, are nonetheless forcing them to conserve on supplies; others are asking that they procure things more cheaply.
Ames Department Stores, a discount chain, just installed lights that are set off by motion at its headquarters in Rocky Hill, Conn., "and our people are getting used to flinging their hands up every now and so often to keep the office lights on," said Rolando de Aguiar, Ames's chief financial and chief administrative officer.
Xerox, whose employees now must rent compact cars when they travel, is refusing to pay the high gasoline prices that rental companies charge when an employee forgets to fill the tank before returning the car. "We're looking for savings associated with usage as well as with eliminating costs," Ms. Hargather said.
Companies that have held the line on costs for some time are having to dig deep to find more fat. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & Flom, the big New York law firm, clamped down on meal allowances, car services and catering costs during the recession of the early 1990's, "so we don't have a lot of easy pickings laying around now," said Earle Yaffa, the firm's managing director.
Skadden did find some new savings: it now uses lower-quality copy paper and has cut out administrative clerks -- the college students it used to hire during the summer to fill in for vacationers. "Actually, we had to work hard to keep these people busy, and we realized we don't really need them," Mr. Yaffa said.
Similarly, Lehman Brothers Holdings went through "a pretty extensive program to whack costs" in the mid-90's, according to William J. Ahearn, a Lehman spokesman. Though Mr. Ahearn said Lehman "never offered the free shoeshines and massages that people thought we did," the firm nonetheless saved $300 million by cutting back on "chairs, computers, lights, air travel, everything except salary or bonus or incentives."
This time around, Lehman has gone well beyond such incidentals. For example, it used to pay Bear Stearns to handle the transaction-clearing activities for its stock trades; recently, it started handling the process on its own, at an estimated savings of $35 million a year.
The key for all these companies, of course, is to make sure that the excesses do not creep back in when the bull returns to Wall Street and health is restored to balance sheets.
"I still worry a little about how to make people recognize that all this cost-cutting isn't a short-term thing," Ms. Hargather of Xerox said. "Our goal has got to be to keep costs down, not just get them down."

HEADLINE: LOVE & MONEY; 
You're in a Jam? Here I Am

BYLINE:  By ELLYN SPRAGINS; Ellyn Spragins is a freelance writer in Maplewood, N.J. Her column about money's influence on relationships appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: loveandmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I THOUGHT that there would be a lot of pain and angst from the current wave of corporate layoffs that is roiling people's lives. Silly me. Pain and angst are so last century. The new economy, tattered though it may be, now has a companion -- the new, happy-go-lucky layoff. 
 It works like this: You are handed a pink slip from your employer, but it's no big deal because layoffs are a part of life these days. You'll write a novel or start your own business. Maybe you'll just charge right back into the same industry. Drake Beam Morin, a firm in Stamford, Conn., that helps with career transitions, has even documented how easily these layoffs go down the hatch. It found that more than two-thirds of the 3,000 laid-off executives it surveyed from January 1999 to April 2000 were not very concerned about finances and said their job searches had improved family relationships or had no effect on them. 
 Funny, that is not how I remember it. When my husband was laid off during Wall Street's turbulent 1980's, our relationship was stretched painfully. Losing a salary wasn't as bad as losing the balance in our partnership. John sometimes trudged off to a phone booth in Grand Central Terminal rather than stay at home and listen to me angrily and obsessively itemize his job-hunting tasks.
It was a strain to act normally around friends. I remember wishing I didn't have to explain why someone had spotted my husband, unshaven and unshowered, picking up a dozen bagels downtown long after other husbands had boarded the 6:45. Both John and I can still recall the mixture of gratitude and resentment we felt toward supportive former colleagues who were still collecting year-end bonuses and Hermes ties.
Has all of that really disappeared? Well, there are plenty of happy layoff stories around. But why did an old friend refuse to discuss her husband's layoff from a year ago -- on or off the record? What made another close colleague clam up about her own recent job loss? Then there was the executive who has been laid off four times in 10 years. He didn't want his name used.
The stigma may be gone for some. But losing a job is still a profound assault on your identity -- the face you present to yourself and to the world -- not to mention your bank account.
Friends and family usually pass the early stages of unemployment with flying colors. Supportive, loving -- you name the heart-warming behavior -- they enact it. It is the third, fifth, or seventh month of unemployment that turns spouses into part-time enemies and friends into indifferent slugs. 
Patrick Hansard, 47, of Princeton, N.J., was laid off in January from Grolier Inc., the book publisher, after it was acquired by Scholastic; he had run Grolier's international marketing and sales division. The job loss was his second in four years. Remembering the first, yearlong job search, he said, "At first, I didn't want to contact colleagues too often, because I felt like a burden." Pushing himself into networking, he was upset by how unhelpful some of his closest co-workers were. "It puts your relationship in a different light," he said. "The memory of their behavior will remain."
I learned the first rule of living with a laid-off spouse: Listen and care. But don't let his identity crisis cause you to doubt him. Jill Andresky Fraser, who interviewed dozens of laid-off workers for her book, "White Collar Sweatshop" (W. W. Norton), says most people who receive pink slips blame themselves. "They feel like a failure, and that feeling plays itself out with other people," she said. "They are unable or unwilling to socialize. No matter how supportive their spouse is, they feel guilty and jealous."
The rule for friends of laid-off workers is equally simple: Act normally and be persistent. That may be difficult if a friendship revolved around the friend's job, its perks or its salary. Should you continue to include your laid-off friend in after-work drinks with colleagues? Should you include him when buying tickets to an expensive new show? The more that those activities mattered to you, the more distant you'll feel, said Joan Indursky DiFuria, co-founder of the Money Meaning & Choices Institute, a counseling service in San Francisco that helps people deal with the emotional issues surrounding money.
On the other hand, she added, if your friendship is built upon "a person's kindness, spirituality, athleticism or other qualities, the more there is to hold the relationship together."
ACTING "normally" doesn't mean avoiding sensitive topics and expensive restaurants. The trick is to continue enjoying all the things you liked about your laid-off friend. Don't stop the invitations now, even if you think he can't afford to go along. 
Recognize that you won't get it right all the time. Some days, out-of-work friends will want to talk endlessly about their job searches. Other days, they will slam down the phone when asked if they have landed anything. 
But getting it right is not as important as it seems. Staying the course is what matters. You won't save them from pain and angst. But you will let them know that the job wasn't everything.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Super Duty F-250 and Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD; 
Reaching Critical Mass in the Civilian Arms Race

BYLINE:  By DAN NEIL 

 BODY:
AMERICA is the land of the very, very big. Big hair, big malls, big cities, big Las Vegas hotels that look like big cities, big movies starring big ships that sink in a big way. Big is practically a good unto itself, not to be confused with the relativistic notion of "scale," to which some old-fashioned professors of design still cling.
 If the roads seem smaller, it is only because you are sharing them with a new breed of giants. Heavy-duty pickups -- loosely defined as trucks with gross vehicle weight, or G.V.W., of more than 8,500 pounds, including the vehicle and the maximum cargo load -- account for about a third of the two million full-size pickups bought annually in the United States. 
 Once these trucks were merely girded versions of full-size, light-duty trucks. Then, for 1999, Ford brought out its Super Duty series, a group of Sumo-sized pickups several inches larger in every dimension than comparable F-150 series trucks. 
General Motors' answer is the Chevy Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD, both new for 2001. Though not quite as large as the Super Dutys -- the G.M. 4x4's are about 77 inches high, compared with Ford's N.B.A.-caliber 80 inches -- they are sufficiently enormous to cause one's mental pinball game to tilt. My test truck, a Silverado 3500 4x4 Extended Cab LS (the model designations are enormous, too), loomed over traffic like a lifeguard crossing the kiddie pool.
Trucks in this class are a peculiar breed of rolling trompe l'oeil; they have the visual cues and proportions of regular pickups, only supersized. It is as if Roger Corman, the B-movie master, had applied the same forced perspective he previously used on spiders, rabbits and overradiated women.
The needs of consumers notwithstanding, an arms-race mentality seems to have taken hold in the heavy-duty pickup market. Last year, Ford made hay with the Super Duty's superlatives -- it had the most towing and cargo capacity in its class. This year, it is G.M.'s turn to crow, since the Silverado and Sierra HD's have the beefiest engines, the most towing capacity, the highest cargo limits. In a segment closely tied to the American work ethic, there is equity in being the biggest, strongest and toughest.
The dog yet to bark is Dodge, which is considering building its own uber-truck. Currently, the biggest Dodge Ram, the 3500 4x4, based on a light-duty chassis, loses the cargo-carrying comparison by more than a half-ton to the Silverado HD.

Chevy: An Easy-Listening Diesel
The biggest motor in G.M.'s fleet is the new Duramax 6600 turbo-diesel V-8, which produces 300 horsepower and a seismic 520 foot-pounds of torque. Developed jointly with Isuzu, the Duramax does for big diesel engines what Volkswagen's 1.8-liter did for small ones -- that is, make them behave so much like gas engines that you notice the difference mainly at the pump. The Duramax banishes the noisy clatter of big diesels; at idle, it sounds as if someone is softly playing maracas in the glovebox.
But the Duramax is hardly delicate. The engine carries a 200,000-mile warranty and G.M. practically dares buyers to break it. With it, the Silverado 3500 4x4 has a gross combined vehicle weight rating (the maximum combined weight of truck, trailer and cargo) of 24,000 pounds. The HD series is also available with less potent engines, including a 6-liter gasoline V-8 (300 horsepower, 360 foot-pounds of torque) and an 8.1-liter big-block V-8 (340 horses, 455 foot-pounds). The gasoline engines are available with a new six-speed manual transmission and a more familiar four-speed automatic.
Channeling the diesel's muscle to the ground is a six-speed manual transmission or a new five-speed automatic from Allison, the largest supplier of automatic transmissions to the commercial truck market. The Silverado's height makes room for its tractorlike underpinnings, huge axles, differentials and frame rails. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes with dynamic rear proportioning, which adjusts the braking power for the cargo load, are standard.
For all its heavy-duty hardware, the Silverado HD is remarkably civilized. G.M. employs two sets of leaf springs in the rear. For a comfortable ride, the supple upper leaves support the vehicle when unloaded -- think of Big Daddy Contractor driving to the job site. Loaded, the truck settles onto the thicker leaf springs underneath. The tested Silverado, at $41,206, was loaded with leather, polished alloy wheels, OnStar electronics and an optional electronic shift transfer case, with push-button activation of four-wheel drive. The exterior styling was similarly executive, with a smoothly integrated front grille bisected by a thick chrome bar wearing Chevy's gold bow tie. Much of the rear of the truck is clad in body panels of composite resin -- plastic, if you like -- which give the truck a futuristic sheen. 

INSIDE TRACK: An 800-pound gorilla in a Hugo Boss suit.

Ford: Supersized Inside and Out
With more than 44 vehicle configurations -- including two- and four-wheel-drive, single or dual rear wheels, an assortment of cabs, bed sizes, trim levels and engines -- the Super Duty chassis can be many things to a great many entrepreneurs. In the two and a half years since the series was introduced, more than 1.1 million have been sold. And that's not counting the jumbo Excursion S.U.V. built from many of the same parts.
The Super Duty's styling is wonderfully over-the-top, with what looks like chrome barbells for grille accents and a huge all-steel bumper for a its jaw. Hiding under the bumper is a structure to help prevent drive-over damage in the event that this gladiator should collide with a smaller vehicle.
The exterior is finished with cues from long-haul trucks: cut-down window sills and extended rocker-panel steps to aid those trying to vault into the knee-high cabin.
You can get a Super Crew with four big doors, but I drove a SuperCab with smaller, front-opening rear doors. (Ford prefers not to call them "suicide doors.") The interior felt like a six-passenger handball court, with 67 inches between doors -- so much room that you cannot lean on the center armrest and prop your other elbow on the door, unless you are, you know, circus folk.
Various amenities are similarly elephantine: a huge cup holder tray on which you could serve high tea; a center armrest "mobile office center" the size of a laundry hamper. Otherwise, the switches, dials and gauges are Dearborn orthodox.
Ford offers three engines in the Super Duty line: a 5.4-liter V-8 rated at 235 horsepower and 335 foot-pounds of torque; a 6.8-liter V-10 (275/410); and a 7.3-liter diesel V-8 (235 horses and a whopping 500 foot-pounds of torque at a low 1,600 r.p.m). The test truck -- an F-250 Super Duty 4WD XLT -- came with the single-overhead-cam V-10, which provides almost all its torque at a mere 2,000 r.p.m. It ran quietly and smoothly and was enough to put the 5,642-pound vehicle afoul of the highway patrol within 9 seconds from being at a standstill.
My F-250 had the beefy 4R100 four-speed automatic transmission and shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive. In a brief off-road venture in the four-wheel low range, the Ford had a distinctly agricultural feel. The high cost of renting a crane discouraged me from trying to get the truck stuck in the mud.
The Super Duty is many things, but nimble is not one of them. A turning radius of 48 feet makes you feel, when parking, as though you are arriving by air in Lakehurst, N.J., with the newsreel cameras rolling. Given its nose-heavy balance and its solid-beam, leaf-spring suspension front and rear, the Super Duty 4x4 is, as might be expected, not particularly limber around corners. It spins its tires vigorously at the least excuse, and when unloaded, the ride is somewhat jouncy and bouncy. It would behave better with the proverbial ton of bricks in the back.
However, like the Silverado HD, the Super Duty is surprisingly genteel inside. The cabin is quiet and vibration-free. The steering is light and responsive. Thanks to its prodigious wheelbase (up to 172.4 inches with the Crew Cab), it provides limo-like smoothness on the highway -- great, if you have seven tons of prom dates to chauffeur.
All Super Dutys have four-wheel disc brakes, and antilock brakes are standard on the larger versions. The test vehicle checked in at a reasonable $31,195.
What is not to like? Well, someone may have to answer to a higher power for the fuel economy, or lack thereof. My test model got about 10 miles to the gallon in mixed driving, but I feel sure I could have coaxed it down to single digits. Visibility through the side windows is fairly limited; regular-sized vehicles -- like Cadillacs -- can ride along unseen below the sills. Use those mirrors!
But, over all, I could not help but be seduced by the Super Duty's charms, the first of which is the sheer, moronic fun of driving a wicked monster truck. Besides, I liked the opportunity to pose as a burly blue-collar guy. Here I come, Big Daddy Contractor. Look at the hourly workers run.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Stock Investors Manage to Ignore 223,000 Lost Jobs

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
A GIANT tree fell in the forest on Friday, but to stock market investors, it didn't make a sound.
 The crash that only the bond market appeared to hear was the news that the United States economy lost more jobs in April than it had at any time during the last 10 years. According to the Labor Department, payrolls plummeted by 223,000 in the month, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 percent, its highest in two and a half years. Equally ominous was the rate of employment growth as measured by a survey of households; for the first time in a decade, it fell into negative territory. That rate typically goes negative only in a recession. 
 What the jobs report signified to some economists was an imminent weakening in consumer spending. So far, that spending has held up remarkably well, giving the only bounce to an otherwise drooping economy.
But to stock investors, the jobs report was a nonevent. They remain convinced that the economy will recover in the second half, in large part because Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is slashing interest rates. The bulls argue that stocks are the place to be, because the market sees past the current slowdown and has a quick recovery in its sights.
Rising unemployment, however, changes the quick-recovery script substantially. As long as they have jobs, consumers are willing to keep up profligate spending habits even if they have to borrow money to do so. Once they lose their jobs, however, consumers may well snap their wallets shut.
"In the face of rising joblessness, consumer confidence gets hit," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "That will take personal consumption growth well below the 3 percent pace we've been cruising at during the last couple of quarters."
Add this to the already weak spending by corporations and the negative impact that a strong dollar will have on exports, and Mr. Roach concludes that the relatively narrow economic downturn is about to become much broader.
James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, has a similar worry. He says that within three to four months, the nation's unemployment rate may be as high as 5.4 percent. "We're going into this slowdown with the highest fixed-cost structure ever at companies, because of the technology boom," he said. Those costs are the interest expenses and depreciation costs that followed corporations' big investments in technology. "If you can't cut your fixed-cost structure, you've got to cut your variable," he said. "That's why we've seen such alarming layoff announcements."
Mr. Paulsen reckons that with such high fixed costs, corporations may continue to pare jobs even when the economy is growing slowly. "Because interest rates have been coming down, consumers have been able to pile on more debt," he said. "But if you start destroying jobs, we're going to find out there is a consumer debt problem. And that's one of the reasons we are going to have a hard time restarting the economy."
Which brings us to Mr. Greenspan. While stock market investors revere him, others think his rate cuts may have a muted impact this time around.
"We'll probably have a nice fiscal stimulus," Mr. Roach said. "But the Fed will not be able to get the classic traction with this policy easing. The real problem here is that America is working through the aftershocks of an equity bubble. And balance-sheet adjustments, both on the part of companies and consumers, must be made before the economy can respond as it classically does to a monetary ease."

HEADLINE: An Executives' Guide To Crystal Gazing . . . 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT; Interviews by Riva D. Atlas, David Barboza, Julian E. Barnes, Keith Bradsher, Claudia H. Deutsch, Geraldine Fabrikant, John Files, Chris Gaither, Jenny Holland, Melody Petersen and Laurence Zuckerman.

 BODY:
LAYOFFS and unemployment are rising, but so is the stock market. Consumer confidence and corporate profits are falling, but nine days ago the government announced that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter. Shoppers cut back during the all-important holiday season a few months ago, but they opened their wallets again at the start of the year.
 Trying to get a steady read on the economy isn't easy these days, as executives, investors and virtually everybody else, including Alan Greenspan, will acknowledge. "This has been a very peculiar time," said Gail Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board, a research group that calculates the index of leading indicators each month. 
 More than most, chief executives need to know where the economy is going. If the country is poised for another growth spurt, businesses should build new plants and buy more technology equipment. But if a recession is looming, they should clear out their inventories and avoid committing millions of dollars to risky ventures. 
Executives seek advice before making these decisions, but over the years, many have also come to rely on their own wits to sort through conflicting information. And they turn to a surprising variety of economic indicators and common-sense measures -- like the length of taxi lines. Some look deep within their own companies to statistics that a top executive might not normally follow; others keep an eye on industries that seemingly have nothing to do with their own.
In recent days, Money & Business asked more than a dozen top executives at large American corporations to reveal their favorite ways to predict the economy's future. Their answers, excerpted below, included the usual suspects, like the consumer confidence index, which measures the population's feelings and expectations. But there were also some unusual ones, like the crowds, or lack thereof, at karaoke bars in Japan.
There is a rich history to the search for the right economic tea leaf. In the 1870's, an English economist named William Stanley Jevons tried to use long-term weather forecasts to predict harvests and, in turn, the economy. He called his idea "the sunspot theory," but it did not work, said David Colander, an economic historian at Middlebury College.
In the 1940's, the art of forecasting received an important lift from all the new data that researchers began to gather in an effort to explain the Great Depression. By the 1960's, many economists had come to believe that they fully understood the business cycle, which they thought hinged on a tradeoff between growth and inflation. The "stagflation" of the following decade, when prices rose but the economy did not, proved them wrong.
"The economy is extraordinarily complex," Mr. Colander said. "Once in a while, it stays smooth and has patterns. And if it stays smooth for awhile, you get a false sense of security that you think you understand it."
In recent years, as the economy has changed in character, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been known to review reams of data, from corrugated-box sales to a little-watched corporate debt rate.
He also relies on one of the oldest data-gathering techniques, one that many chief executives appear to like: talking to people and asking them what they see.
For the moment, the executives seem to be split into two camps. The optimists are paying close attention to consumers and, as a result, think that the economy will probably avoid a recession. The pessimists, meanwhile, see gloom in the corporate sector.

MICHAEL D. EISNER -- Chairman and chief executive, the Walt Disney Company.
I would say that we look at the consumer confidence numbers that come out and we look at the advance reservations at our parks in Tokyo, Europe and Florida. And I have always been a believer in talking to people about classified advertising. Help-wanted ads are usually a good indicator of the economy.
The best indicator we have is the number of investment bankers that call in bad times. In bad times we get five times as many calls from bankers with ideas about what to buy. They want action because their business is bad. They are motivated to get things done so that their companies will have fees and make money. So we find that our strategic investing calls increase. And right now a lot of people are calling.
Our reservations are O.K. They are a little softer than last year but stronger than 1999. So it is not that the sky is falling, but we do see some softness. Consumer confidence is tied to picking up the phone and making reservations.
My personal point of view of a recession: I don't personally think it is going to go on that long. I don't think it is going to be as long as people think. But I just don't know. Alan Greenspan is the guy to call.

JACQUES NASSER -- Chief executive and president, the Ford Motor Company.
We've consistently undercalled our industry's demand, and I think this is an indication of how resilient the economy has become. But it's also very clear that there is an economic slowdown well under way.
We look at capital investment; we look at business sentiment indices, including purchasing managers' indices. We also have some internal indicators that we look at: for example, Hertz with car rentals, both on the leisure side and the business side of the equation. Hertz, as you also know, has equipment rentals, primarily for construction but also for other equipment. That's an early indicator as well. We also look at the commercial end of the truck market, which is a fairly good long-term indicator as well.
Readings on consumer confidence, we think, are vital also, because not only do they provide advance signals about developments in the job market but they also translate into consumers' expectations about their own personal financial situation.
On a more sort of fundamental basis, we read and interpret Federal Reserve policy, about what the interaction is going to be. The level of interest rates is obviously important in determining the economy's performance, particularly if you're looking out beyond, say, six or nine months.
Hertz really revolves around two businesses. One is the business sector, and two is travel, leisure travel. When businesses are pulling back, or there is a slowdown, you get reduced travel. We had a substantial drop in the first quarter of this year. So that's a pretty good indicator actually. That was a signal we would see further weakening as the year rolls by, and I think we're starting to see that.

BRUCE CHIZEN -- Chief executive and president, Adobe Systems.
We look at the weekly sell-through of our products products purchased and listen to what our customers are saying. The other, more anecdotal thing I look at is, when I travel to different cities, I look at taxicab lines, traffic and activity in the evening -- in other words, how crowded the restaurants and bars and entertainment destinations are. In Japan, when I go out with partners and customers, I go into the karaoke bars and see how crowded they are. When I see the taxi lines are relatively short, the bars and restaurants are easy to get into and not crowded, and there's not as much traffic, that all signals to me that the economy is hurting.
When I was in Japan, around May of 1998, I noticed it, but it didn't register. I wasn't paying that much attention to it. But business hit a wall in August of '98, relative to the Asian economy.
I was in Japan recently. I saw no change between July of last year, October and February. I take that as a good sign. That's reflected in our business. Our Asian business continues to perform very well.
In the Bay Area, I jog a few times every week. I've noticed a doubling and, in some cases, tripling of the homes for sale. I also noticed, for the first time in many years, real estate signs saying, "Price Reduced." That is a major concern I have about not only real estate, but the overall economy.

ROBERT A. ECKERT -- Chairman and chief executive, Mattel.
Despite the incredible strength of the U.S. economy over the last decade or so, the fact is the economy is still cyclical. This recent expansion was longer and stronger than normal and the current slowdown, or even contraction, shouldn't be a surprise. The toy industry has historically been less sensitive to economic downturns than some other industries. The reality is that growth in the toy industry is much more sensitive to product innovation.
At the end of the day, a parent or grandparent will still spend $10 or $15 on a Barbie doll for their child's birthday.
I look at a lot of statistics, but because we are a manufacturer of consumer goods -- toys -- the two most relevant indicators to our industry are consumer confidence and retail sales trends across all categories. I also look at employment trends. It's not rocket science -- people who are employed feel better about their prospects, and have more disposable income to spend.
Within the toy industry, I track closely the NPD sales data an industry indicator , which tells me people are buying toys. I was encouraged by the fourth-quarter over-the-counter sales numbers at retail; the fourth-quarter accounts for about half of the annual sales of the toy industry.
This is the slowest time for toys, but the good news is, despite the slowing economy, the toy industry is holding up nicely.

LEO F. MULLIN -- Chairman and chief executive, Delta Air Lines.
Through the end of December, we felt that the economy was holding up well. Then, right at the first of January, it was like it went off a cliff. We saw a very substantial decrease in both traffic and in margins. Delta had some problem sorting out exactly how much of that was due to the economy versus some of our labor difficulties that were going on at the same time. But there was no question that the economy was the larger of the two factors. 
What happens in the airline business is that you can get a little bit of a lag with respect to the impact of an economic slowdown. But then as soon as businesses begin to realize what is happening, it can be a very precipitous reaction. Travel is viewed as one of the more discretionary items. We saw that kind of precipitous decline take place in the first quarter and we see that definitely continuing into the second quarter.
The leisure business is holding up somewhat better. It is the businesses who react most strongly and swiftly to the economy. Our core shuttle markets from Boston to New York and New York to Washington are a perfect example. Our revenue passenger miles were down by almost 13 percent. Our load factor the number of seats filled was down by 5.3 percent.
What we look at ourselves, in terms of future indicators, is advance bookings. It is not what I would call a great economic indicator, but it is a pretty good financial indicator for a couple of months anyway. The third month out it gets a little weak.
Our advance bookings in May, June and July are between 3 1/2 and 5 percent down from last year. At least half of that is related to Delta's labor issues and the fact that we have suffered some booking-away problems because of that. Interestingly, by July, advanced bookings are down between 1 and 2 percent so it looks somewhat better. But I think that July is the weaker indicator.
What I would take from all of this is continuing substantial economic weakness in the second quarter and the expectation of some improvement in the third quarter. But if you look at the whole year, it is just going to be a very tough year for our airline and airlines in general.

CHRISTOPHER GALVIN -- Chairman and chief executive, Motorola.
It is clear to us that segments of the telecommunications and semiconductor industry are definitely in a recession. The indicator to watch is order growth for telecom equipment, which has fallen in the range of 10 to 40 percentage points over the past three to four months. Order growth today is negative, and inventories for the industry are still climbing in many places.
We do not feel that the U.S. economy is currently in a recession. What remains uncertain is whether the economy may still slip into a recession. I would put the chances at about 50-50. The economic problems in the U.S. are starting to spill over into rest of world's high-tech industries, somewhat in Europe and less so in Asia. At the same time, with the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, and a tax cut on the horizon, we would hope to see, barring unforeseen circumstances, the U.S. economy return to a "normal" growth path by late this year or early 2002.
We believe the telecom industry, as measured by capital expenditures, will return gradually to positive territory early next year. The problem is the inventory overhang. The industry, however, will work through that issue.

J. T. BATTENBERG III -- Chairman, chief executive and president, Delphi Automotive Systems.
I am beginning to see some leveling out of economic trends. I basically look at six different criteria, and then a couple that are kind of specific to our industry.
On a macro level, the first thing I look at every month is the consumer confidence. That drives so much in the auto industry. The consumer confidence has dropped, but it's beginning to certainly level off, at a much lower level -- but nevertheless it is beginning to level off.
I also look at the National Association of Purchasing Management's purchasing agents index, and that, too, had a precipitous drop for the last eight months, actually 10 months. But it has leveled off somewhat in the last couple of months. And then I look at the North American seasonally adjusted annual rate of vehicle sales , and that looks again to be leveling off from a pretty precipitous drop.
Personal savings have never been this low and debt has never been this high. So those I watch, and there are slight bends in the curves relative to both of those indicators. 
Probably the single most important thing that I pay attention to on a regular basis is the days of inventory and the actual field inventory in the car industry. And focusing on North America, if you go back a year ago, the North American days of inventory were running in the 60, 61, 62 area month after month, which is pretty healthy, the range being 45 to 73 or 74, depending on the original equipment manufacturer. And it peaked in the November, December, January time frame; we were getting up into the 76, 77 days, and the range was again 44 to maybe 104, 105, 106. March was down to a 60 average again, 60 days of inventory for the industry in North America, back to where it was a year ago, which is encouraging. 

J.W. MARRIOTT JR. -- Chairman and chief executive, Marriott International.
Our business is driven largely by the technology companies and pharmaceutical companies. Business has spiked the last seven to eight years because of the strong technology industry. But we have seen a drop-off in business travel the last few months because technology companies have cut back.
I look at the Nasdaq. I think it is a good indicator of how investment companies view a comeback of the technology sector. A comeback in technology would lead to more travel. And business travel is the biggest market segment in our business. I also pay attention to consumer confidence, which affects the leisure part of travel. Consumer spending is driving the economy.
This is a very strange downturn, because auto sales have been strong and unemployment is low and housing sales are good. But technology has been low and those are our big customers. Company investment and spending on technology generates a lot of travel. Thirty-five percent of our business is made up of conventions and groups, 45 percent transient business travel and about 20 percent leisure travel.

ALAN LACY -- Chairman and chief executive, Sears, Roebuck & Company.
At the moment, we anticipate the second quarter to be slow, and we're cautious about the second half of the year. There have been interest-rate cuts, which are terrific, but the consumer is concerned about gas prices and job cuts. We have not seen any real signs of improvement.
Things that are not being promoted, they're not buying. If it's not discounted, they're not buying. What we often see is the consumer is only responding to the item on sale. I think March sales were as weak as people can recall.
We're a broad-line retailer. On the hard-line side, housing turnover is a good indicator. New construction and resales -- we look at the combination. When people move into a new home, they buy new appliances. The soft side is affected by weather and style, so that is difficult. We have a better leading indicator in hard-line items -- appliances, washers, dryers, refrigerators, ranges.
If you went back to last year, there was talk about the economy slowing down. We knew it would slow. But this year, it's quicker than we anticipated. When people are still worried about energy and worried about job loss, it's difficult.

SCOTT COOK -- Chairman of the executive committee, Intuit.
When you're doing things like taxes and accounting, people are going to have to do that regardless of what's going on with the economy. But there is one indicator, or driver, that I look at: a tax cut. One, the tax cut enriches consumers so they buy more; and two, the complexity and change in the tax cut cause more people to go out and buy TurboTax. Which certainly enriches us.

JOSEPH GALLI Jr. -- Chief executive and president, Newell Rubbermaid.
I visited over 500 retail stores in the last month, all over the world. There is a lot of inventory at retail and there is a slower sell-through environment. 
When I was at Black & Decker, I was forced to look at housing starts and interest rates and all the things you look at in a cyclical business. At Newell Rubbermaid we look at broader G.N.P. measures, we look for overall retail trends, comparable store sales -- things that indicate overall retail activity.
This is a unique and difficult time. I believe most manufacturers misjudged it and didn't see the economic slowdown happening, so manufacturers continued to encourage retailers to buy a lot of product, and retailers continued to buy a lot of product, and now we are all going through a correction.
We are going to have a large group of people that will be deployed at retail stores. Their primary job will be to merchandise our products, but an important part of their responsibility is to keep their antennae up and identify trends in spending. That can be product-specific trends or macroeconomic trends. When you have that presence at store level you don't get surprised, you don't have things creep up on you that you should have seen coming.

KENNETH LEWIS -- Chairman, chief executive and president, the Bank of America Corporation.
The U.S. economy will remain in the midst of an uneven economic slowdown, in which capital spending and profits will continue to decline sharply while consumer spending and housing will continue to grow. While pockets of weakness exist, the Federal Reserve's rapid and decisive easing of monetary policy points to rebounding demand in the second half of the year.
Bank of America's activities illustrate the resilience of the economy: our consumer credit quality remains healthy, consumer deposits continue to increase, mortgage activity is robust and many of our capital markets efforts continue to enjoy healthy growth.

PATRICIA F. RUSSO -- President and chief operating officer, the Eastman Kodak Company.
I look at several things to see which way the economy is moving. Housing starts are always a good indicator of the general economy. Auto sales tell me whether people are feeling confident enough to buy new cars. And I pay a lot of attention to sales at mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart. These are the places that reflect the habits of a broad swath of consumers, much more so than sales at pricey places like Bendel's.
I even look at Home Depot -- at the beginning of a downturn, people may decide to renovate themselves, instead of hiring a contractor or buying a new house. When housing starts are low and Home Depot sales are falling, too, it's a gauge that things are getting worse, not turning around.

GLEN A. BARTON -- Chairman and chief executive, Caterpillar.
Lower interest rates bode well for Caterpillar. These, coupled with tax-cut legislation, should result in the economy improving in the last half of this year. This would positively impact our business in the latter part of 2001 and into the following years.
We closely monitor several key economic indicators, including housing starts, commodity prices, highway construction and energy prices.

HENRY A. McKINNELL -- Chairman and chief executive, Pfizer.
The key economic indicator at the moment is consumer confidence. Industrial spending has clearly collapsed. Consumers are still doing all right but there is a degree of nervousness. I think we're going to go through a period of low to no economic growth. But with a tax cut and with time for the interest-rate reductions to have an effect, I think we'll see an improvement in six to nine months.

DONNY DEUTSCH -- Chairman and chief executive, Deutsch Inc., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Running an advertising agency, you get a great looking glass out at the economy. I look at the health of my clients' businesses, whether it's Domino's or Mitsubishi. They are all healthy businesses, but they are handling things in a tougher way. Cars, pharmaceuticals, banks -- people are cautiously optimistic. I haven't seen clients cutting budgets. There is business to be had, but it's not a gravy train anymore. In the next 18 months we'll see the economy heading in the right direction; the strong will survive.
The big thing is who's in the White House -- people vote with their pocketbooks. We have a Republican administration, which is obviously quite committed to using every catalyst possible to stimulate the economy. We have the right engine in the White House -- much more aggressive in terms of tax cuts, and it's given consumers permission to think that there is a new wind blowing. I project the next six months will gradually go in the right direction, then 12 to 18 months after that, really start to head in the right direction. The worst is behind us.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Modern Asia's Anomaly: The Girls Who Don't Get Born

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
WOMEN are making strides in both India and China, which together are home to a third of humanity. They are living longer and are more likely to be able to read and write than ever before. In democratic India, more than a million women have been elected to village councils in the past decade.
 Yet, despite this progress, female fetuses are being aborted at startling rates in China and across broad swaths of India, new census data shows. As the population of girls relative to boys has tumbled in northern and western India over the past decade, these regions have begun to catch up with China's dismal statistics. The spread of ultrasound technology in these societies, with their strong preferences for sons, has made it easy to find out the sex of a child before birth and to abort unwanted daughters. 
 But why is this bias against girls so pronounced in large parts of South and East Asia when it is not in many other regions of the developing world? What is it about China and these areas of India, with their radically different histories and forms of government, that explains this terrible convergence? And why, even now, don't the women themselves -- more likely than ever before to be literate -- insist on giving birth to their girls?
Economists and demographers are beginning to grapple with these questions and say there are likely to be many complex factors at play. But some think the answer lies in a particular form of patriarchal family, common in most parts of both regions. In such families, the daughter's responsibility to care for her parents largely ends at marriage, while the son's lasts for life. And in India and China, where there is still no universal, government-sponsored social security system, the question of who supports aging parents is very important, these researchers say.
"The grown woman can be useful," said Monica Das Gupta, a demographer at the World Bank in Washington who has co-written papers on this subject. "She can work in the fields and be a good mother, but the fact that she's educated and employed doesn't change her value to her parents, who won't benefit from all that."
Intriguingly, Ms. Das Gupta, who studied family patterns across the developing world, says that in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia, daughters and sons share the job of caring for their aging parents -- and in these regions the sex ratios are normal.
In most parts of both India and China, where more than two billion people live, it is generally a son who carries on the family line, inherits ancestral land, cares for his parents as they age and performs the most important ceremonial roles when they die. In India, the son lights his parents' funeral pyres, helping set their souls at peace. In China, he cares for his parents' spirits in the afterlife so they do not wander for eternity as hungry ghosts.
In contrast, a daughter in either society typically leaves her natal family after marrying to become part of her husband's family, moving in with them and tending to her in-laws. "There's a traditional expression used in China," said Li Shuzhuo, director of the Population Research Center at Xian Jiaotong University in Xian, China. "Daughters are like water that splashes out of the family and cannot be gotten back after marriage."
Before ultrasound, girls were sometimes victims of infanticide, but much more commonly they were victims of neglect -- not fed as well as boys or taken to the doctor as quickly. But the advent of sex-selective abortions has added a new and definitive means for acting on a prejudice against girls -- and statistics reflect the results, experts say.
NORMALLY, women around the world give birth to 105 or 106 boys for every 100 girls. But according to China's latest census, there were 117 boys born for every 100 girls in 2000, up from 114 in 1990.
And in India, the early 2001 census data show that in the north and west, which include some of the richest states, the ratio of girls to boys, from birth to age 6, has declined sharply in the same decade. In Punjab the rate has fallen to 793 girls per 1,000 boys from 875; in Rajasthan from 915 to 865; in Gujarat from 928 to 878, and in Maharashtra from 946 TO 917. The overall rate in India fell from 945 to 927.
Discrimination faced by girls both before and after birth has contributed to the fact that 50 million to 80 million more girls and women might have been alive today in India and China, according to demographers and economists, had they received treatment equal to that of boys and men.
Each country has its own policies or customs that may well have intensified the problem. In China, pressure to abort girls has been increased by family planning rules that limit couples to one or two children. In India, the sizable dowries that families pay to get daughters married add to the financial burden of raising girls. But in both societies, Ms. Das Gupta and Professor Li maintain in a paper they co-wrote, the kind of patriarchal family system prevalent in much of India and China is the root of the preference for sons, who are needed to provide security for parents in old age. It is a theory that echoes in the words of ordinary people in Punjab, India's richest agricultural state. 
"THE boy is like the lamp of the family, and everybody wants it lit continuously," said Jaswinder Kaur, a women's health worker in Daffarpur. "The woman realizes that her value goes up with the birth of sons and down with daughters."
India and China both prohibit sex-selective abortions, but the practice is hard to police since the pregnant women and those who perform the abortions have every incentive to keep the secret. But the numbers from the new census have drawn wide attention in India. Some officials are saying the law must be more stringently enforced; women's advocates call for a social movement against customs like dowry.
The high priests of the Sikh religion recently announced that anyone who becomes a "kudi-maar" -- daughter-killer -- will be excommunicated. Punjab, which now has the lowest proportion in the nation of young girls to boys, has a large Sikh population. 
The experience of South Korea suggests that urbanization, modernization and rising prosperity may help loosen the bonds of traditional family life, said Minja Kim Choe, a demographer at the East-West Center in Honolulu. Figures there, she says, show the ratio there seeming to peak in 1990 at 117 boys per 100 girls and declining to 110 by 1999. While that's still high, it is better, she said. South Korea's economic transformation, she believes, is gradually weakening the patriarchal family system as people become more independent economically and socially from their families.
But China and India are still mainly agrarian societies, and it is likely to be a long time before these lumbering behemoths can hope to see such benefits.

HEADLINE: A Lost Vote for Human Rights 

BYLINE:  By Merle Goldman; Merle Goldman, professor of history at Boston University, was an American delegate to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1993 and is author of "Sowing the Seeds of Democracy in China."

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
China's satisfaction with the American loss of a seat at the 53-member United Nations Commission on Human Rights reveals how important the United States has been at the commission in dealing with China's human rights abuses. Now there will be no nation willing to sponsor resolutions critical of China -- at a time of intensifying repression of religious groups, notably the Falun Gong movement, and democratic reformers. In addition, we have lost a forum to call attention to the arrest of two American citizens, Wu Jianmin and Li Shaomin, who have been detained for several months without charges. 
 Since 1990, in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the United States has sponsored resolutions at the human rights commission critical of China's abuses. And virtually every year, China has been able to block a vote on the resolution because it has the support of many developing nations that agree with its assertion that, for less developed countries, priority should be given to economic rights and to rights of sovereignty -- that is, noninterference in a country's internal affairs. 
 Despite these regular defeats, debates within the United Nations human rights commission have been far more effective than Congressional denunciations or criticism by human rights and other groups in moving China toward compliance with international norms. The multilateral nature of the commission, many of whose members have been hostile to the United States, has made it difficult for China -- itself currently on the commission -- to dismiss criticisms as merely manifestations of domestic American power politics or overreaching "hegemonism."
For example, the desire to avoid censure by the human rights commission has led China to affirm certain principles that, until the 1990's, it totally rejected. In 1997, China signed the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights after several of our allies -- France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Canada and Australia -- had decided not to cosponsor an American resolution aimed at China. The following year, in return for the United States' not sponsoring a critical resolution, Beijing signed the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
It is true that these advances came in the context of quiet diplomacy, as advocated by China; but it is equally true that the threat of public censure at the United Nations commission was critical to China's acceptance of the two covenants.
In this year's commission meeting, the United States could get no other Western country to join it in sponsoring a resolution critical of China and had to sponsor one on its own. Nevertheless, prevention of that resolution's passing was so important to China that President Jiang Zemin toured Latin America in part to line up votes against it.
The loss of our commission seat seems to have been due to many factors, including neglect of our European allies, a resurgent unilateralism in the Bush administration and a certain inattention to diplomatic detail. In any case, we have now lost the most effective forum for bringing pressure on China with regard to human rights. Some will say that United Nations human rights resolutions are meaningless because there is no way to enforce them. But because China wants to be a major global player, it has increasingly, though reluctantly, complied with or signed onto norms recognized by the world community. These universal norms may not always temper the actions of China's leaders, but they encourage and inspire those in China who seek to gain political and religious rights and fight against their government's abuse of human rights.

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Fire Last Time; 
Finding Embers in the Ashes

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
CAN it happen here? 
 In the aftermath of three days of violence between police and roving crowds of protesters and vandals in Cincinnati last month, the question has hung over other American cities in distress. 
 To be sure, there was a specific trigger to the unrest in Cincinnati: the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman after years of complaints by black residents that they were victims of racial profiling and excessive police force.
But deeper root causes -- intensified racial and economic segregation; the further hollowing out of city centers; and mounting minority frustration over being bypassed during the last decade's prosperity -- simmer in many other major yet shrinking cities that have not erupted, like Baltimore, Philadelphia and this aging Rust Belt industrial center that is trying to reinvent itself after five decades of declining population. 
The economic undercurrent to the urban riots of the 1960's is evident today. Of course, at least some of the economic glory of the 1990's filtered down to low-income minority groups. Black unemployment rates dropped, though they are still higher than rates for whites. Poverty levels declined, though they are still worrisomely high. African-Americans gained greater political power in states, cities, and Congress. Yet it is at the very moment when momentous change seems within reach, that minority frustrations are likely to hit a boiling point, say urban affairs experts. 
"When change is possible, people feel much bolder and turn outward, and won't accept the excuses for why things aren't going well," said William E. Spriggs, director of the National Urban League's Institute for Opportunity and Equality in Washington. "If that's not addressed, you've created a powder keg."
These concerns are heightened in the nation's declining cities -- about one out of four major urban centers in the last decade -- which suffered middle-class, white flight, but in most cases failed to draw the immigrants and service industries that helped offset declines elsewhere. 
In northern industrial cities, like most here in Ohio -- where all but one of the 15 largest cities lost population in the 1990's -- the 2000 census helps reveal a growing spatial divide that separates rich and poor and diminishes economic opportunity for the most needy. The economic geography has been changing. While metropolitan areas have been sprawling outward, the poorest residents remained bunched downtown. Yet job growth now tends to be greatest in the suburbs, often hard to reach on mass transit. 
"A lot of these issues stem from the concentration of poverty in a decentralized economy, where opportunity drifts out to the suburbs while the poor, particularly the minority poor, stay behind," said Bruce Katz, director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. And as cities spread out, many traditional social buffers against economic and community shocks, including churches and a vibrant black middle-class, are now isolated from low-income people.
"When we have high levels of racial and economic segregation, people live separately and don't interact," said Paul A. Jargowsky, a political economist at the University of Texas at Dallas. "Many minorities' interaction with the white community is limited to law enforcement or minimum-wage jobs. That creates a contempt and distrust." 
Even when economic opportunity beckons, it may have the perverse effect of bypassing and, in some cases displacing, those most in need.
The area where rioters took to the streets in Cincinnati, the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, is actually experiencing a renaissance. The Main Street entertainment district has undergone a facelift. Upscale housing has displaced crack houses. It's a story of urban revival that's being played out in former pockets of poverty from New York to Los Angeles. 
Middle-class whites will leave their suburban homes for the city, but most expect the police to be there in force to protect them. So police officers, many critics say, often harass the long-time minority residents to assuage newcomers. 
"Is there something about the gentrification of certain neighborhoods that can breed police enforcement that hassles people, and stark, in-your-face resentment among low-income population meeting head-on with affluent whites?" asked Claudia J. Coulton, co-director of the Center on Urban Poverty and Social Change at Case Western Reserve University here.
So far, Cleveland has largely avoided this pitfall, in part through a mini-housing boom that is revitalizing increasingly diverse neighborhoods. Middle-class blacks are returning from the suburbs. But lower-income blacks may feel like Sara Hakim, 34, a nurse and former Gulf War veteran who parks cars at a downtown hotel and plans to leave: "There's no room for growth." 
In other majority-black cities like Detroit and St. Louis, black control of the levers of power, from the mayor's office to the chief of police, has often helped defuse tensions even in bleak economic times. 
SO the question is, what ignites a city? In Cincinnati, as in the Los Angeles riots in 1992, the volatile combination of race relations and police behavior triggered violent protests. 
"Could this happen in any city? The answer is yes, but the conditions are hard to tease out," said Jeremy Travis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who is a former deputy New York City police commissioner. There is no universal prescription to help cities cope with these issues, but many have taken steps that help. Most police officers here and all new officers in Boston, for example, must live within the city limits. Pittsburgh subjected its police department to Justice Department oversight to settle litigation. 
In Cleveland and Denver, civic, corporate and community leaders have worked closely to develop strategies to revive downtowns. Since the turmoil in Cincinnati, business leaders have been involved in programs for summer jobs.
But civic leaders and urban experts are keeping a wary eye on the flagging economy. "In declining cities, there's less money for police and other services," Eric H. Monkkonen, a professor of urban history and policy studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. "If cities begin a period of decline with a problematic police department, those problems will get worse."

Mostly Bad News Draws Mostly Cheers

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Stocks ended the week on a high note as a weaker-than-expected employment report had investors guessing that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates to stave off a recession.
 With one of the worst earnings seasons in recent years almost a memory, there was also a sense that the bad news is out and that corporate profits can only improve. 
 On that front, two companies that have been battered recently, the Internet stalwart Priceline.com and the consumer giant Procter & Gamble, announced better-than-expected earnings, prompting surges in technology and blue-chip stocks.
 Looking for bargains, investors snapped up technology stocks, pushing the Nasdaq composite index to 2,191.53, up 115.85, or 5.6 percent, for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 10,951.24, up 141.19, or 1.3 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also climbed, to 1,266.61, up 13.56, or 1.1 percent.
 The Treasury market also rallied. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 5.20 percent, from 5.32 percent a week earlier. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

Want Some Respect? A Few Jobs to Consider

BYLINE:  By Julie Flaherty 

 BODY:
Which is most important when choosing a career: money or respect? If it is respect, then the ideal job may be in a classroom.
 About 1,400 people nationwide were asked their views last month about six occupations -- athlete, doctor, lawyer, politician, social worker and teacher. 
Some 57 percent said they had the most respect for teachers, while about one-fourth picked doctors. 
 Social workers were chosen by 8 percent, but athletes, some of whom command top-dollar salaries and grace cereal boxes, received highest marks from only 2 percent. Eighty-seven percent, however, said professional athletes had the responsibility to be role models.
"We thought they would probably be high on the list," said Phil Wiseman, a vice president of Maritz Marketing Research, a firm in Fenton, Mo., that conducted the survey and released the results last week. "If I were an athlete, I would be concerned that my image is not so good with the American public."
Still, it is slightly better than that of lawyers, who received top marks from less than 2 percent of the people surveyed, and politicians, at less than 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Those Tax Disadvantages 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The column drew attention to one tax problem, but here is another: It is high time to end the $3,000 limit on net capital losses. Aside from this nominal amount, and the carryforward potential to future years, capital gains are treated like gambling. 
You can set losses against gains, but no net losses can be charged against income. 
 The rule should be: Charge all losses against current income, with carryover allowed only when net income turns negative. That way, truly unfortunate investors wouldn't spend their lives paying off a disaster. Not all of them can get back into the market, but having cash flow from a quick write-off would help. This idea would do more to stimulate the economy than President Bush's tax plan.

HEADLINE: Despite Swift Spread of TB, Russians May Reject Big Loan 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 5 

 BODY:
Hit with objections from drug makers, legislators and its own Health Ministry, the Russian government is debating whether to turn down a $150 million loan that some experts call crucial to containing a serious tuberculosis epidemic.
 The World Bank loan would go to a strategy to stop TB in its breeding grounds, especially the country's overcrowded prisons. 
 The need is great -- one in every thousand Russians has TB, triple the rate of a decade ago and about 15 times the rate in the United States. And there is little debate over the strategy itself, which has largely proven itself in trials in several provinces. 
What is suddenly at issue is whether Russia needs the help the World Bank is offering -- or whether, as some opponents charge, it is part of a ploy by Western drug companies to seize the Russian market from home-based drug companies.
The Health Ministry official in charge of tuberculosis programs, Dr. Mikhail Perelman, said in an interview today that Russia's war on TB is adequately financed by the Kremlin and is, in his view, already showing results.
And Boris Spiegel, the chairman of a parliamentary committee on national security in health, said he believed that the loan would flood Russia with foreign-made drugs just as domestic manufacturers are starting to prosper.
"If this loan is accepted, the Russian pharmaceutical industry will be brought to its knees," he said in an interview. "We have information showing that this is yet another internal fraud being carried out by the World Bank."
Those complaints appear to have swayed the Ministry of Health, which, officials involved in the negotiations said today, withdrew its support for the loan last month. A formal offer from the World Bank to begin final negotiations on the loan, delivered to the Kremlin in mid-April, has gone unanswered.
Last week, the proposed loan received a scorching reception in Mr. Spiegel's parliamentary committee, where, according to a Moscow newspaper account, it was judged another attempt to impose Western rules on a weakened Russia -- and reap a profit along the way.
A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said today only that talks were continuing. A Health Ministry official involved in the negotiations declined through a spokesman to talk by telephone.
"We're trying to clarify the situation with the government, and then we'll see," Jean-Jacques de St. Antoine, the senior World Bank official in charge of Russian health programs, said in a telephone interview today from Washington. "I think there's a lot of misunderstanding on the part of the pharmaceuticals industry as to what this loan would do."
In some Western experts' eyes, the stakes go well beyond Russia. 
Tuberculosis here is notable not only for its swift rise, but also for its growing resistance to the array of drugs used to attack it.
Few new drugs have been developed to fight tuberculosis in recent years. And while accurate statistics do not exist, experts agree that strains of multi-drug-resistant TB are far more common here than in most countries. 
The threat is heightened by the size of Russia's prison population -- at 963,000, one of the world's largest, and a major incubator of the disease. In some prisons, as many as one fifth of all TB cases are multi-drug-resistant.
Some experts fear that the number of TB cases will explode in the near future as the AIDS epidemic sweeps across Russia, claiming hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Roughly half of all people with AIDS who are exposed to TB contract the disease, these experts say. One recent study predicted that, absent new health programs, the combination of AIDS, TB and intravenous drug use will claim more than 850,000 working-age adults in Russia by 2005. 
"The problem is that if you leave people untreated, it's not just that they're untreated. They infect others," said Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the director of the program on infectious disease and social change at Harvard Medical School. He helps run an international tuberculosis project in Tomsk Province, in southern Siberia, where TB infection rates in prisons are high.
"Prisoners are released every year," he said. "It's not going to be long before people with multi-drug-resistant TB wind up in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. This is a concern for the whole world. It's not just a Russian problem."
Dr. Perelman, a surgeon and TB expert in Russia, agrees that the situation is serious. But he also says it is overstated. Tuberculosis cases seem to have skyrocketed, he says, because reporting was scattershot until 1999. And what he regards as two major indicators of the epidemic's pace -- overall mortality and the incidence of TB among children -- have been flat for the last two years.
He complained that until recently, international experts insisted that Russians follow the same regimen -- ensuring that drugs are taken daily under the direct observation of medical workers -- prescribed throughout the third world. But third world nations have no options beyond a daily regimen of drugs; Russian medicine, he said, has far more sophisticated ways of attacking TB which can and should supplement drugs.
"Russia, with its advanced space program, a nuclear power, a highly intellectually developed society, cannot be in that category," Dr. Perelman said.
Today Mr. de St. Antoine, of the World Bank, sought to allay any fears that the bank was trying to usurp Russia's lead role in combating tuberculosis. To the contrary, he said, Russia's medical industry should benefit from the $150 million program, which specifically favors domestic contractors and even gives Russian pharmaceutical manufacturers an automatic 15 percent edge in bids to supply drugs to treatment programs.
Dr. Perelman, who stressed that he had no direct role in negotiating the loan, was nonetheless unmoved.
"The great desire of the bank to give this loan is much greater than the desire of Russia to receive it," he said.

Closing Shop in a Once-Thriving Irish Enclave

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

 BODY:
Mary O'Sullivan remembers when the Tara Irish Gift Shop was something more than just another business in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Inwood, when it stood as a sentimental tie to the old country amid the loneliness of the new. 
 Now, with the Irish mostly gone from Inwood, Mrs. O'Sullivan is consigning her shop to a symbolism of another sort: after 35 years, she and her partners are closing the store, stranding the last old hands of one nationality and making way for another. 
 "It's just the old ones who are left now, not enough to keep a business going," said Mrs. O'Sullivan who operates the shop at 609 West 207th Street with Thomas and Kathleen Traynor. "Most of the Irish have moved away." 
Until recently, the streets north of Dyckman Street made one of the city's most recognizable Irish enclaves, marked by Irish pubs, Roman Catholic churches and Gaelic football matches in Isham Park. According to census figures, the proportion of Inwood residents either born in Ireland or in the United States to Irish natives peaked in 1960 at close to 20 percent. In the early 1990's, immigration policy specifically favored Ireland, and Inwood was among several New York City neighborhoods that received an influx of Irish immigrants. But better economic conditions in Ireland have led many Irish immigrants who arrived in the last decade to return home.
Figures from the 2000 census showing the number of Irish currently in Inwood are not yet available, but they hardly seem necessary to tell the story: Gaelic football has been replaced by soccer. The Church of the Good Shepherd is struggling to balance its books. And the big "K" has fallen off the sign marking Keenan's, one of the handful of tattered Irish pubs still hanging around.
"There were Irish pubs all up and down the street here, and every apartment building had 20 or 25 Irish families," said James McCarthy, 63, who still refers to the land of his birth as the "Irish Free State," the name it had the year he was born. 
The Irish of Inwood have been replaced largely by immigrants from the Dominican Republic, who began arriving in large numbers in the 1970's. Figures from the 2000 census show that nearly 75 percent of Inwood's population claims Hispanic heritage.
A visit to the Tara Irish Gift Shop brings the neighborhood's transformation into focus. The shop sits quietly on a corridor bustling with the commerce and commotion of one of the city's most dynamic immigrant groups. On the streets, Spanish mingles with merengue, signs hawk comidas and the talk turns to futbol and work. 
At Tara, the shelves offer a sad assortment of items that seem leftover from another age: checkered Irish walking caps, Celtic crosses and green neckties bedecked with little Irish flags. One corner holds a selection of Irish snacks boasting of their blandness: Wheetabix, cream crackers, Irish tea. 
On a recent morning, Peter Naughton ambled in to pick up his weekly batch of Irish newspapers. Mr. Naughton, 77, said he came to New York from County Mayo in 1948. He moved first to the South Bronx, then to Washington Heights, joining the Irish exodus from both neighborhoods, and then, 30 years ago, to Inwood, figuring it the last Irish redoubt. Now that his son has moved away and his wife, Julia, is dead, he is mostly alone, and the papers he picks up each week -- The Irish Independent, The Western People -- help remind him of his youthful days. 
"The place means a lot to the Irish here," said Mr. Naughton, his accent as round and thick as if he just landed. "There's only the likes of myself and a few others now, and it kind of holds us together." 
A retired mechanic for Con Edison, Mr. Naughton recalled the day when he realized that the Irish in Inwood were headed for extinction. It was about 1987, when he was coaching a Gaelic football team for children. "In one week, most of the team was gone," he said. "Just like that. They moved away."
The newspapers at Tara serve as a measure of the change. Thirty years ago, Inwood locals bought up huge stacks of Irish periodicals, including tiny papers from Irish towns and counties. Today, Mrs. O'Sullivan and Mrs. Traynor stuff most of them into envelopes and mail them to old neighbors who have moved away, to Florida, to California, to New Jersey.
Mrs. O'Sullivan says she figures Tara will stay open for a few more weeks, until a new tenant is found. John McDonagh, the real estate broker trying to rent the property, says he has had a few nibbles already, from Hispanic and Korean businessmen. As word of Tara's closing spreads through the neighborhood, many of Inwood's current and former Irish residents are stopping in to say farewell. 
"We're going to miss you," an Irish woman called to Mrs. O'Sullivan from the sidewalk the other day. "I've moved to Riverdale."

HEADLINE: SUGAR RULES DEFY FREE-TRADE LOGIC 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: SUGAR LAND, Tex. 

 BODY:
For anyone who thinks of the United States as a free-trade nation, the 10-story brick sugar refinery on Highway 90A here on the outskirts of Houston is startling. 
 The plant can produce up to 500,000 tons of sugar a year, enough to sweeten about 90 billion doughnuts. But while America has a sweet tooth, it does not need all that sugar. Indeed, America is swimming in sugar, largely because the sugar business is one of the economy's most protectionist niches. 
 Sugar programs that protect growers from foreign competition cost American consumers almost $2 billion a year in higher prices for everything from candy bars to cold cereal, according to government studies. Artificially high prices have led to overproduction, leaving taxpayers the owners of one million tons of sugar that they pay $1.4 million a month just to store, some of it in Sugar Land. 
Yet earlier this year the owner of the plant here -- the Imperial Sugar Company, the nation's biggest sugar refiner -- was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, because it has lost so much money lately turning relatively high-priced raw sugar into the refined sugar it sells into a depressed, glutted market. 
Now, refiners are demanding an overhaul of the sugar program. Consumer groups want it abolished. And even its backers and beneficiaries -- big growers that are major donors to both political parties -- are dissatisfied. They want more protection, complaining that new trade initiatives, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, threaten to undermine the industry and further depress the price of sugar. 
Congress is now hearing testimony on these matters as it takes up a new farm bill. The conventional wisdom is that Washington is unlikely to scrap a program that has bipartisan support, any more than it has been prone to eliminate supports for other farmers. 
But some lawmakers say sugar policy, in particular, is ripe for revision.
"Events of the past year indicate that the sugar program is becoming increasingly unmanageable and that radical reforms are needed urgently," said Richard G. Lugar, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a longtime opponent of the program. 
At the heart of the debate is a sugar policy that since the New Deal has held that domestic growers ought to be shielded from the vagaries of the commodity markets. The current program, put in place in 1981, promised that kind of stability by limiting imports and making loans to growers. 
But in recent years, helped by technology and weather, production has exploded. And government policies and price supports, on balance, encouraged farmers to abandon even more seriously depressed crops in favor of sugar beets and cane. 
Overproduction sent prices tumbling, hurting growers. But the hardest hit were cane refiners. At times, the prices they paid for raw sugar were higher than those at which they could sell refined sugar. 
If nothing changes, industry officials fear a ferocious one-two punch: the possible loss of cane-refining capacity at home, which could hurt food producers, and a steady rise in imports, which could wipe out both domestic growers and refiners. 
Free-market economists say that might be the most efficient outcome, but no industry disappears without a fight. The refiners are just one of the interest groups that have stormed Capitol Hill. 
None are so powerful as the nation's largest producer of raw sugar, the Flo-Sun Corporation of Palm Beach, Fla., run by Jose Pepe Fanjul and Alfonso Fanjul, Cuban exiles who created a sugar empire in the Florida Everglades and who are now big donors to both Republicans and Democrats. 
Flo-Sun and other giant producers want to strengthen the program by putting new restrictions on domestic production of sugar beets and cane. They also want to limit the scope of any future trade deal that might lead to what they consider unfair competition. 
"We don't believe we ought to sacrifice the American farmer to bring in sugar that is subsidized by other governments," said Judy Sanchez, a spokeswoman at U.S. Sugar, one of Florida's biggest cane producers. 
Critics of the program -- from food producers to refiners to consumer groups -- would like the program discarded or significantly weakened.
"We want the program phased out," said Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the Coalition for Sugar Reform, a trade group that represents food and consumer groups, taxpayer watchdogs and environmental organizations. "This is corporate welfare for the very rich. The program results in higher prices for consumers, direct payments by U.S. taxpayers to sugar growers, and it's the Achilles' heel of U.S. trade policy." 
Chicago, home of Sara Lee cakes and Brach's Starlight Mints candies, has aligned itself with the critics. A few weeks ago, Mayor Richard M. Daley and other city leaders announced that they would lobby Congress to end the sugar program, which they said was hurting the city's makers of candy and food by inflating costs. 
Indeed, the General Accounting Office says the sugar program cost consumers about $1.9 billion in 1998, with the chief beneficiaries being beet and cane growers. 
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is a strong backer of the sugar program, says Americans are not being overcharged. Rather, he contends, prices on the world market are artificially depressed by surplus sugar from countries that subsidize production.
"The world price has nothing to do with the cost of sugar," he said. "And my contention is that the program causes stable prices."
Americans' appetite for sugar is measured in pounds. The average person in this sugar-saturated country consumes more than 70 pounds a year of refined sugar and that does not include most soft drinks, sauces and syrups, which are sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. 
But even that appetite is no match for current levels of sugar production. A record 8.5 million tons of sugar was produced in the United States in 1999, and that sent raw sugar prices tumbling to 18 cents a pound, the lowest level in 20 years. The Agriculture Department stepped in last June to buy 132,000 tons, at a cost of $54 million, or 20 cents a pound. 
Imperial Sugar -- already burdened by $500 million in debt because of an acquisition spree -- was hit harder than anyone in the industry. The company was forced to buy raw sugar cane at about the same price that it could sell the finished product.
"We're out of gas before we turn the lights on," said I. H. Kempner III, Imperial Sugar's chairman, whose family acquired its first holdings in 1907. Imperial filed for bankruptcy protection in January. 
The New York-based Domino, a unit of Tate & Lyle of Britain and a leading supplier of pure cane sugar to grocery chains, is also "in desperate shape," said Margaret Blamberg, a spokeswoman. C&H Sugar, a big California refiner, is struggling both with low sugar prices and the state's rising energy costs. 
For growers, the biggest threat is the political tide favoring free trade. Under Nafta, Mexico is getting greater access to the American sugar market. And in 2008, the agreement will give Mexico unlimited access to the American market.
Just how much Mexican sugar can enter the American market this year is in dispute. American trade officials say that about 100,000 tons of surplus sugar is allowed in, while Mexican officials say the figure is 500,000 tons. Under an agreement reached at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks in 1994, the United States is required to import about 1.1 million tons of sugar a year. 
The solution, the growers say, is more protection for the industry. Two weeks ago, the House Agriculture Committee heard testimony from the major sugar producers, who proposed stricter marketing and production controls at home and more restrictive trade policies. 
"You have to fix the big trade problems," said Luther Markwart, chairman of the American Sugar Alliance, which represents the major growers. 
Trade experts, however, say the sugar program makes free-trade talk seem hollow. 
"Sugar is a nightmare in terms of trade negotiations," said Prof. Robin A. King, an expert on trade policy at Georgetown University. "This is one reason other countries get frustrated with our position on free trade. They say, 'We want to trade, but the items we produce you won't let in.' "

HEADLINE: Princeton Picks Professor As President 

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., May 5 

 BODY:
Shirley M. Tilghman, a molecular biologist who was among the architects of the national effort to map the human genome and an early advocate for women in a field still dominated by men, was named the 19th president of Princeton University today.
 Dr. Tilghman, a popular Princeton professor and a prominent researcher, has become widely sought-after for national commissions and panels dealing with some of the thorniest ethical dilemmas in science, including embryonic stem-cell research and human cloning. 
 When she takes office on June 15, she will become the second woman to lead an Ivy League institution, by just two weeks; Judith Rodin, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, was the first, and on July 1, Ruth J. Simmons will become president of Brown University. 
"She has something of the Tiger spirit in her, that spirit that only those of us close to the place can really understand," Robert H. Rawson Jr., a trustee who led the search committee, said after the announcement beneath portraits of George Washington and King George in Nassau Hall. "She epitomizes the strengths, the values, that those of us who care about this place think are distinctive about Princeton." 
Dr. Tilghman, 54, broke into a smile of relief after the announcement today, she said, "It is time for a woman president," she said. Noting that Princeton, with 6,300 students, started admitting women in 1969, she said "I am just excited to have the incredible privilege to be that person.
"I feel I have this institution in my blood," she added.
Harold T. Shapiro, an economist, announced last fall that he would retire after more than 13 years as president of Princeton.
Dr. Tilghman (pronounced TILL-man), was originally one of five faculty members on the search committee. But about six weeks ago, after she excused herself early from a meeting to teach a class, Mr. Rawson said, the rest of the committee members decided to ask her to become a candidate. She agreed to resign from the committee and go through formal candidate screening.
She joined Princeton as a professor in 1986, and became head of the university's Institute for Integrative Genomics in 1998, a job that has given her some training in the fundraising that will be demanded of her as president.
She is also the parent of a Princeton junior, and she said today that she had learned about campus life from "some rather fascinating conversations with my daughter, Rebecca."
Her research has focused on the imprinting of genes -- the way some genes function differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. At the National Institutes of Health in the 1970's, she was among the researchers to isolate one of the first mammalian genes. She has been equally devoted to teaching, and was awarded Princeton's President's Award for Distinguished Teaching in 1996. This morning, when trustees came out of their meeting to tell her she had been unanimously chosen as president, she was busy reading senior theses.
She was an unexpected and unconventional choice for this tradition-bound, ivy-decked campus, where students today were preparing for the swirl of spring house parties at the eating clubs along Prospect Avenue.
She has argued to abolish tenure, calling it "no friend to women" because the trial period leading up to the tenure decision usually coincides with childbearing years, pressuring many women to choose between a family and career. She herself raised two children as a single mother while continuing her research. Dr. Tilghman has also said that the federal government should deny funding to scientific meetings that do not include women on their panels of presenters.
She headed the National Institutes of Health committee that established guidelines for the use of embryonic stem cells in biomedical research. The cells, taken from an embryo a few days after conception, give rise to all the tissues of the adult body. She recently argued to the Bush administration to continue funding for stem-cell research despite the protests of abortion rights opponents.
Dr. Tilghman has also tried to infect amateurs with her own enthusiasm for her field. She has taught science courses to undergraduates not planning to major in science and special courses on behavioral genetics to alumni.
She has long sought to encourage young scientists, and women in particular. She pointed out that while women were entering science in numbers comparable to men, they were not breaking into senior faculty ranks in the same proportion.
Like her predecessor, Dr. Shapiro, Dr. Tilghman was born and raised in Canada. She graduated from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and taught in Sierra Leone for two years before earning her doctorate at Temple University in Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Rejuvenating the Vacation Village

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
PHILIPPE BOURGUIGNON says Club Med is "about rejuvenation, not about evasion."
 "It's about rediscovering yourself -- in body and mind," he adds. 
 That may sound pretentious to those who think of Club Med in terms of tanned social organizers frolicking with good-looking guests in faux Polynesian villages.
But Mr. Bourguignon, 53, the chief executive of Club Mediterranee S.A., is no slouch at rejuvenation. In his most recent corporate success, he revived the fortunes of Club Med in North America, where its business has expanded in the last six months. That is the first time in five years that Club Med has shown improved results in North America, its most important market after France. 
To help achieve this, Mr. Bourguignon opened a ski village at Crested Butte, Colo., and cut Club Med's operating costs by reducing the number of North America management centers from seven to one, in Coral Gables, Fla. To maintain the momentum, he is building a Club Med World, a kind of urban leisure center, in Montreal, and plans others in cities like Chicago, Miami and New York.
For Mr. Bourguignon, success in North America has special meaning. In the 1970's, he began his executive career there, building a chain of Novotel and Sofitel hotels for the French hotel group, Accor. In 1988, he was hired by the Walt Disney Company, ultimately emerging as the executive who rescued the failing Euro Disney, operator of the Disneyland Paris theme park.
A statue of Donald Duck, displayed in his office, is a reminder of those years. A farewell gift from his colleagues at Disney, it shows Donald hauling a heavy suitcase, affixed with a sticker that reads, "Club Med." 
The revival of Club Med in North America mirrors what Mr. Bourguignon has achieved globally. In the three years since his arrival in 1997, he has spent $350 million to renovate 70 of Club Med's 120 villages. He has cut operating costs by eliminating management overlap and consolidating telephone reservation centers. To refocus marketing, he has closed sales offices in countries that were not significant sources of Club Med customers -- like Russia, Venezuela, the Czech Republic and Sweden.
Of course, Club Med's revival coincided in part with the boom in consumer spending of the late 1990's. So it may be too soon to know if Club Med's new life is largely a result of that boom or of the reorganization. With economies in many parts of the world weakening, Mr. Bourguignon acknowledged that Club Med's performance in the last six months has been "a little disappointing." The company's stock price, as well, has weakened with the broader market; on Friday it traded at 74.55 euros, compared with a high of 152 euros last July.
As Mr. Bourguignon described them, Club Med's losses in the 1990's were partly a result of its success, which had prevented serious improvements in the way the company was run. A culture of chumminess and conviviality, he said, was "often not compatible with rigorous management." 
"The whole system was paternalistic," he said in an interview. "But at a point where you have 125 projects in 40 countries, there is a limit to how you can manage a company in a paternalistic way."
In 1999, two years after Mr. Bourguignon's arrival, Club Med resumed paying dividends, which had been suspended in 1996. By the 2000 fiscal year, which ended Oct. 31, operating profit was up 45 percent, to 103 million euros, or $92 million, while net profit rose 51 percent, to 59 million euros. Capacity utilization, a measure of customers vacationing at Club Med villages, rose to 73.7 percent, from 69.6 percent a year earlier and 68 percent two years earlier.
The improvements represent a big change from 1997, when Club Med's owners sought out Mr. Bourguignon. Shareholders, led by the Agnelli family of Italy, which controls 21 percent, turned to him after losing patience with Serge Trigano, the son of Gilbert Trigano, who helped invent the concept of vacation villages in the 1950's. 
Club Med had suffered three years of losses in six years. Mr. Bourguignon had a reputation as a turnaround specialist from his years at Accor and Euro Disney. He was named chief executive at Euro Disney after it suffered heavy losses in the early 1990's, and engineered a revival by cutting costs and prices and making subtle cultural adjustments, like introducing wine in the park restaurants. 
The Agnellis are pleased with their choice.
"We were looking for the very best in Paris, and he was the best," said Tiberto Ruy Brandolini d'Adda, director of the Agnelli's Exor investment group and chairman of Club Med. "He basically changed the way Club Med is run, and the results are there."
Mr. Bourguignon was no stranger to Club Med when he took over. On one wall in his office, a photograph shows him, his wife and two children peering over a sand dune while vacationing at a Club Med in Morocco not too long before he joined the company. Several executives whom he hired at Euro Disney were Club Med veterans.
But Mr. Bourguignon is not limiting himself to reviving Club Med. He is expanding it.
Last June in Paris, he opened the first of a planned chain of 15 urban fitness and entertainment clubs, known as Club Med World, that combine restaurants, shopping, dancing, children's games and circus-theme novelties like trapeze swinging.
In January, he paid $55 million for France's biggest chain of health clubs, Gymnase Club, with 30 fitness centers and 170 franchises. He is seeking partners for the Club Med Online site, where the company sells packaged vacation trips and merchandise like apparel and sunglasses with the Club Med logo.
NOT everyone is optimistic that Mr. Bourguignon's strategy will succeed. Nigel Reed, who follows Club Med at the BNP Paribas investment bank, said the company was hemmed in by broader economic forces that could curtail spending on vacations. He said there might be more weakness in Club Med's stock price before a longer-term improvement.
"In the last three years, there's been a return of economic growth in Europe, a revival of consumer confidence, and that's helped Club Med," Mr. Reed said. Yet Club Med's fixed costs remain high, he said, so a recession in markets like North America could squeeze profits. Moreover, new concepts like Club Med World are untested, he said. Another potential weakness is merchandising, which could dilute the value of the brand. 
Mr. Bourguignon said he was not deterred. Cost-cutting is not over, he said, and he defends the push into new activities. If he failed to create new revenue sources, he said, Club Med could suffer "the baby blues" -- the corporate equivalent of postpartum depression -- after the turnaround of its core business. 
Fitness clubs and Club Med World, he said, are extensions into clients' everyday lives of the kind of disinhibiting activities they enjoy at Club Med villages -- dancing, onstage singing, even swinging on a trapeze. 
"We want to move fast," Mr. Bourguignon said. "We don't want to be copied."

 THE MOBILIZATION OF SHAME
A World View of Human Rights.
By Robert F. Drinan.
240 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $24.95.
 Human rights are again high on the international agenda, after years of cold-war stalemate between two blocs that not only disagreed on even the fundamental definition of rights, but justified violations of them in the name of larger ideological goals. Many nations now participate in a complex international system of human rights treaties, conventions and institutions. In a comprehensive, if sometimes rambling, overview of this system, Robert F. Drinan, a Jesuit priest, professor of law at Georgetown University and human rights advocate, seeks in "The Mobilization of Shame" to tell the "amazing story of how the family of nations has struggled to develop and inculcate human rights in the past three generations." 
A former United States congressman, Drinan is understandably concerned first and foremost with American policy. He describes the importance of American support for the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal and the establishment of the United Nations, as well as the incorporation of some human rights-supporting mechanisms into American foreign policy, especially since the Carter years. But despite "the desire to provide leadership and moral ideals" that he believes lies "deep within the American soul," he argues that American backing for human rights has been inconsistent at best. 
While praising positive achievements like the 1992 Torture Victims Protection Act, which allows foreign citizens to sue their tormentors in American courts, and the State Department's annual country-by-country reports on human rights, Drinan criticizes the United States' frequent unwillingness to cooperate in international human rights efforts. The United States is the only nation besides Somalia that has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, though it "leads the developed world in child poverty." It is one of a small number of countries -- including China and Iran -- that account for most of the world's executions, despite an emerging international consensus against the death penalty. In 1998 it found itself in equally unfortunate company as one of only seven nations to oppose the statute for an international criminal court, which President Bill Clinton signed but which the Senate is unlikely to ratify anytime soon. 
The few human rights treaties the United States has signed contain reservations ensuring that they do not conflict with existing domestic law. Even in the new, post-cold-war order, many Americans resist even the appearance of sacrificing sovereignty to an international authority, and tend to support international human rights efforts only as long as they do not obligate us to alter our own practices. 
But Drinan provides little real insight into the reasons for this American mind-set. Nor does he discuss specific American objections to human rights instruments or suggest ways of responding to them. It is thus difficult to evaluate his assertion that "the United States more than any other country will shape the future of the amazing developments in international human rights." In fact, much leadership on human rights has lately come from outside the United States: Drinan himself describes Europe's well-developed regional human rights system, for example, and Europe and Canada have led the way in supporting an international criminal court. 
Drinan's overall outlook for human rights is hopeful, and his optimism is not entirely unjustified. It was hardly imaginable, when he published a similar summary of the status of international human rights in 1987 ("Cry of the Oppressed"), that only a few years later the Soviet bloc would crumble, United States-supported dictatorships in Latin America would be replaced by democracies and apartheid in South Africa would vanish. 
But although the end of the cold war renewed the possibility of international cooperation, it hardly spelled the end of rights abuses. Drinan singles out several issues for closer scrutiny, including the right to food, prisoners' rights, the death penalty and religious freedom, but here his optimism seems to take him too far. Given recent events in China and Afghanistan, for example, is it really "plausible to think that the abolition of intolerance and persecution based on religious differences may be on the horizon"? 
More important, Drinan's proposals for dealing with those who continue to refuse to adhere to international human rights standards are unsatisfying. As the title of the book suggests, Drinan views shame and indignation as the strongest weapons in the human rights arsenal: "Ultimately," he maintains, "this is the moral power which, more than laws or economic sanctions, will induce nations to follow the less traveled road that leads to democracy and equality." 
Yet he provides no evidence that shame is an effective method of overcoming the "deep-seated self-interest of all nations" and forcing them to change abusive practices. It was not a moral awakening, but military and economic pressure, that caused Serbia to renounce Slobodan Milosevic. It is difficult to imagine the regimes of Iraq or Cuba responding to moral suasion. And governments that disagree on the very definition of fundamental rights, like China -- which claims that it protects its people's economic and social rights -- see no reason to be ashamed. Shame and outrage may prompt individuals to stand up for the rights of others, and they surely help motivate the growing number of human rights organizations that play a crucial international role. But they cannot alone protect human rights on a larger scale. 
Drinan might have given greater attention to the long-term need for more concrete mechanisms like regional and international institutions with the power to enforce their decisions. A beginning has been made with the highly effective European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions are largely binding on the members of the Council of Europe, and the current international criminal tribunals, which have imprisoned top war criminals.
One would have wished that Drinan, with his years of experience, had offered more practical guidance for the future. Still, in the current debates it is valuable to have a writer of such undeniable moral stature remind us of the importance of international cooperation on human rights, and point out the embarrassment of Washington's reluctance to participate in existing human rights mechanisms.

HEADLINE: Cheney's Energy Plan 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Bush administration says we are in an energy crisis, yet in his recent energy speech (front page, May 1), Vice President Dick Cheney proposed drilling for oil that wouldn't hit the pumps for years. 
 The administration also says it cares about consumers and the environment, yet Mr. 
Cheney did not offer anything that would lower gasoline prices or reduce power plant pollution this summer. To top it off, Mr. Cheney said we must build more than 1,300 new power plants, ignoring recent Energy Department data that show that we can satisfy energy demand without building most of those plants.
There are faster, cheaper and cleaner ways to meet our energy needs. We could improve efficiency at our power plants, increase fuel economy in our cars, and increase investments in renewable energy and other advanced technologies. In contrast, increasing our reliance on oil and coal is like taking up smoking to lose weight.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Image And Reality On Social Security

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FOUR questions could be posed to the bipartisan commission that President Bush appointed last week to devise a plan for personal investment accounts in Social Security:
 * Do we need to do this? 
 There is a case to be made that Social Security's financial outlook is troubled enough to justify a major overhaul. But there is also a deeply held suspicion among liberals that the financial problem is just an excuse for conservatives to begin dismantling the jewel of New Deal programs. 
The official best-guess forecast is that Social Security will start drawing on general government revenue to pay benefits in 15 years and that the "trust fund" -- the government's accumulated i.o.u.'s to the retirement system -- will be exhausted in 2038. At that point, the system would be able to pay beneficiaries less than three-quarters of what has been promised to them.
Using more optimistic economic and technical assumptions, however, Social Security faces no problem over the 75-year period used to assess its financial soundness.
Policy should not be made on a bet that things will work out. Still, no less an authority than Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has suggested that if recent gains in the growth rate of productivity hold up over the long run, then the outlook for Social Security, as for the economy, may be brighter than it now appears.
Given Social Security's remarkably successful record of reducing poverty among the elderly and providing retirees with a safety net, the burden is on those who would alter it to convince the public that there is a need for change.
* Can we afford it?
Creating private accounts may be costly, and so far the Bush administration has not made any specific provision to pay for the initiative.
There is no money specifically set aside for overhauling Social Security in the 10-year budget plan worked out last week by Congress and the White House. And though the administration has suggested that it could tap a portion of the federal budget surplus to help finance the creation of the accounts, doing so could be problematic in both political and economic terms.
To gauge the price tag for personal investment accounts, both supporters and critics of privatization use the proposal most often held up as an example of such a system: diverting into private accounts two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that pays for Social Security.
Over a decade, those two percentage points would add up to $800 billion to $1 trillion. By diverting that money out of the revenue stream going into the trust fund, the proposal would leave the trust fund that much poorer. Either more money would have to be placed in the trust fund, presumably out of general government revenue, or the guaranteed benefits paid from the trust fund would have to be reduced.
The problem is not insurmountable. But Mr. Bush and his commission will have to show in detail how they will make the numbers add up -- especially in light of the president's expensive agenda on other fronts, from tax cuts to a national missile defense.
* Will there be vegetables before dessert?
Creating personal accounts will not solve Social Security's problems by itself. Unless the nation is willing to commit large sums out of general tax revenue to Social Security -- a sharp break with the system's history of being self-financed through the payroll tax -- it will probably have to take additional steps to restore the program's long-term solvency. Those include further raising the age at which workers can claim full retirement benefits (it is already rising gradually to 67 from 65) and paring back cost-of-living increases.
Mr. Bush has been vague about whether his commission will consider such steps, and about whether he would support them. Ultimately, he will have to make some tough choices and suffer the political consequences if he wants his plan to be credible.
* Is this politically feasible?
Mr. Bush ran on a pledge to create private Social Security accounts, and he now occupies the White House. Yet the politics remain complicated. 
While there is receptivity among workers to the idea, there are still plenty of people who think that no one should tinker with Social Security. The last year has shown that markets go down as well as up. And despite Mr. Bush's victory, many Democrats relish the prospect of using the issue against Republicans in midterm elections next year.
To win, Mr. Bush will have to rally public opinion behind him before he can assemble the votes he needs in Congress. And that is a tough job.

Can Entrepreneurs and Environmentalists Mix?

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
MANY Americans consider economic interests and environmental protection about as compatible as, well, oil and water. Bob Epstein is out to change that perception. 
 A Silicon Valley private investor and entrepreneur best known as a co-founder of Sybase, the database maker, Mr. Epstein believes that good environmental policy can make good economic sense. His organization, Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2 for short, tries to bring business people and logic into the debate about how best to balance business needs with environmentalists' concerns. 
 Mr. Epstein's vision is to link the entrpreneurial fervor of places like Silicon Valley with the environmental movement. 
"I saw it as a business problem," said Mr. Epstein, who founded E2 a year ago with Nicole Lederer, a friend and environmental activist. A sustainable environment along with a growing economy, Mr. Epstein said, "will only happen through the promotion of ideas, not by maintaining the status quo."
From the start, E2 was intended to appeal to executives pressed for time. It promises to take just 10 minutes of a member's time a month -- asking them to write letters or to make well-placed phone calls. And it holds teleconferences and "eco salons," or discussion groups about the environment, to brief members on issues. Members must donate at least $1,000 to the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental organization based in New York that is collaborating with E2.
But the biggest contribution by the members may be their influence. Watching politicians stream through Silicon Valley over the last few years, Mr. Epstein realized how much power entrepreneurs had -- and how often, in his view, they squandered it.
E2's members, predominantly venture capitalists and chief executives, have lobbied for policies ranging from preserving old forests to opposing petroleum-company desires to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
"It's unfortunate that all business gets painted as wanting to oppose the environment and slow change," said Robert Fisher, the former president of Gap Stores and an E2 member. "There are a lot of people who want to leave their children with a world that is in better shape."
MR. EPSTEIN is certainly not the first technology entrepreneur devoted to environmental causes. Among the most prominent examples, Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel, has committed more than $30 million to Conservation International, a group based in Washington. Paul G. Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, has established a foundation to preserve forests.
E2's efforts come as stereotypical attitudes about business opposition to environmental causes have sometimes been reinforced by the new Bush administration. President Bush has taken steps to overturn some regulations and policies opposed by big business but cherished by the environmental movement.
In the next few days, Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to issue a report prepared by his energy task force. He has indicated that it will call for heavier reliance on oil, natural gas and nuclear power and less on conservation.
While some of the more contentious proposals, including one to permit drilling in the Arctic Refuge, are unlikely to gain enough legislative support to be passed, environmentalists fear that damaging deals will be brokered privately.
Mr. Epstein and his colleagues contend that environmentalists must speak the language of business if they want to get through to the Bush team, which prides itself on its M.B.A.-style approach to governing.
E2 conveys "the kind of message that's going to resonate with this administration," said Greg Wetstone, director of advocacy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The council and E2 have sought to make a persuasive case for ecologically friendly policies, stressing long-term benefits and savings over near-term appeasement of business interests.
One issue involves air-conditioners. The Bush administration wants to lower the federal efficiency standard required for residential air-conditioners, but the council says that proposal would increase electrical consumption nationally by 14,000 megawatts -- equal to what is generated by more than 50 midsize power plants. E2 members have lobbied to keep the higher standard.
Good environmental policy can often save money, advocates say. They point to regulations on tires as one possibility: While the tires on a new car are subject to fuel efficiency standards, replacement tires are not, and they can significantly reduce a vehicle's gas mileage. But a 3 percent increase in the fuel efficiency of replacement tires could save the equivalent of all the oil that could be produced in the Arctic, according to the resource council's studies.
Critics within the oil industry contend that groups like E2 have noble goals but are naive, particularly about energy problems.
"Gimmicks like better tires are minor; of course it's always good to improve tires," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Energy Research Foundation, a group in New York that is supported by the oil industry. "That's not going to have much of an effect. Oil demand is rising." 
Still, findings like the council's tire study have energized Mr. Epstein. And he has tried to practice what he preaches. He said he had cut the energy consumption costs in his own Berkeley, Calif., home by 15 percent over the last six months, largely by repairing his clothes dryer so it works more efficiently and by using energy-saving light bulbs. And he drives a Toyota Prius, a hybrid car that uses both electric and gasoline power. The car gets 44 miles to the gallon and cuts emissions by as much as half, Mr. Epstein said, and is quiet and comfortable. It cost no more than his last car, a Honda Accord.
Rather than throwing more supply at the energy-shortage problem, which he called a Bush administration solution, Mr. Epstein contended that reducing demand would have a more profound effect.
THAT message appears to be resonating with more executives like Mr. Epstein. Gary Hammer, an entrepreneur whose latest start-up, Great Circle Water, recycles waste water, attended an E2 eco-salon in February, at which topics ranged from California's energy crisis to global climate change. It was held at the Palo Alto, Calif., home of an E2 member, Sandra Slater, who gave a tour of her house, which generates 80 percent of its own energy. 
Mr. Hammer was immediately sold on E2. "I sent a check within a week," he said.
Many E2 members said they had long wanted to be more active in causes they considered important, but had not known where to start. Alan Buder, the chief operating and financial officer at Addwater, a San Francisco-based marketing company, said that when Mr. Epstein, a friend, told him about E2, "it just struck a chord."
"Bob makes it very easy to do good things," he added. "It's all teed up for you."
So far, E2 has attracted 200 members, many of whom had never been part of an organized environmental effort.
In running E2, Mr. Epstein has borrowed many techniques from start-ups: invest in a team you consider good, like the resources council; build a network; and make effective use of capital. The current task, he said, is to scale up. "I see this as a great opportunity to encourage innovation, drive markets for new products and lower costs," he said.
Incidentally, he suggested, that is not a bad way to jump-start the economy.

HEADLINE: The Nation: There's No Accounting; 
The Economy's Apples and Oranges

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
DICK CHENEY laid down the framework of the Bush administration's energy policy last week, saying the nation needs 1,000 new electricity-generating plants and relegating conservation to the realm of "personal virtue." 
 But while debates will rage over the vice president's approach -- and over the increasing reliance on nuclear power, domestic drilling and other elements it would entail -- what the energy policy is really meant to protect and preserve will probably go unquestioned: growth. 
 A nation is by definition thriving if its major indices say people are making more things and spending more money on them, as reflected in the sweeping economic measure of the gross domestic product and the detailed portraits provided by housing starts, car sales and retail sales. The Clinton administration saw to it that the economy's health became a bipartisan priority. And energy is one of the economy's most essential ingredients. 
Environmentalists have repeatedly pointed out that what Americans really consume, in a staggering variety of ways, shapes and paint jobs, is a diminishing store of natural resources. But that message has been obscured by a simple problem, one that is increasingly on the minds of economists: the absence of a common, objective measure of the cost of growth. 
"Growth is one index of our society," said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a research group in Washington. "But if the cost is air we can't breathe or that we've paved over the whole country, it's a rather dubious accomplishment."
Traditional indices make it easy to see economic problems, just by looking at which direction the Nasdaq, the Dow and the unemployment rate are heading. Numbers can be attached to how much we spend and how many cars roll off a production line. But those are not the whole of a nation's health. Despite the efficiencies technology has delivered, the push towards more building, buying, driving and Web-surfing leaves nicks and scars on the body of a nation whose vastness hides their ubiquity. 
Occasionally, the limits of the logic of economic growth become obvious. Take the Exxon Valdez spill: the cleanup of 240,000 barrels of crude oil spurred all sorts of business activity, even as it blackened pristine island beaches. But other situations that economists refer to as "the anomalies of gross domestic product" often go without comment, as when companies and governments gain jobs and income from shearing old-growth forests. 
"When developing countries cut down old growth forest, G.D.P. goes up," said Charles D. Kolstad, Bren professor of environmental economics and policy at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "Conceptually, of course, it's wrong. It's like taking furniture and burning it for fuel." 
In his new book, "You Can't Eat G.N.P." (Perseus Books, 2001), Eric A. Davidson, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center, writes: "We had better not lose sight of the fact that our wealth and our comfort are derived from a combination of natural resources -- soil, water, air, forests, oceans, mineral deposits, climate -- and the skill and ingenuity with which we utilize and manage those resources. If we neglect or abuse those natural resources, we undermine our own prosperity."
But how can, say, the loss of a wetland be quantified?
"We are to a certain extent prisoners of the indices we use," said Nancy Kete, director of the climate, energy and pollution program at the World Resources Institute in Washington. "G.D.P. is a flawed instrument of how well we're doing, but we're stuck not having an index of well-being."
The United States almost had one. In 1937, Simon Kuznets, then creating many of the techniques for measuring economic activity now in use (and who won a Nobel Prize in 1971), suggested that the government should also measure environmental degradation, and his first assessments of the economy at the Bureau of Economic Analysis did just that. They proved, not surprisingly, politically controversial and were discarded.
 THERE have been recent attempts to develop a more nuanced national measure. In 1999, the National Academy of Sciences, at the behest of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, issued a study on "asymmetry" in the accounting of economic growth. A Washington economist involved in the project said: "The idea was that if you cut down trees and don't replace them, then you're exaggerating the standard of living. It's like if you're living off your savings. It's not sustainable."
The report suggested that the government look at side effects to economic growth to which a market valuation could be attached, like the costs of health care or early death from environmental pollution. But Congress blocked the bureau's attempts because, economists involved in the process say, the bureau chose to examine the impact of developing mineral resources, which troubled several key congressmen from resource-rich states. 
Some independent research groups have tried to devise a kind of "green accounting" or "general progress indicator," but most economists say that so far, attempts to merge G.D.P. and environmental damage are seriously flawed. Green indices often rely on surveys that ask people what they value in a particular place, or how much extra they might be willing to pay for a commodity to protect an area. It is even more difficult for people to say how much they value an entire ecosystem. Loss and damage are only readily measured in discrete areas.
 AS the economy slows, any questioning of the price of growth may be drowned out in the effort to raise again the tide that lifts all boats. It may have happened already: President Bush dropped his support for regulating emissions of carbon dioxide because that could increase energy prices. Mr. Bush may forego plans to open up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, but only because the political cost is too high, not the environmental toll. 
Omer Yonel, the chief executive of North Coast Energy, a small Ohio natural gas company owned by the Dutch utility NUON, would welcome new areas in the United States where his company could drill. A European, Mr. Yonel notes that America has so far avoided the difficult choices Europe has made about consumption, including, for example, paying higher taxes on gasoline. 
Without objective instruments to mark the toll of economic growth, people rely on the subjective: the stifling heat of successive summers, the forests and fields turned over to homes and shopping malls, the thickening air above cities, their sympathy toward various environmental protests. But unlike many Western Europeans, Americans have moved farther from conservation and restraint in the last 20 years.
"When you pollute here, the sky still stays so blue," Mr. Yonel said. "The pollution just goes somewhere else, your country is so huge."

The Farce Is With Us

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
It was, if you believe the official story, a case of farce majeure: House Republican leaders had to call off Thursday's planned vote on the budget resolution because two pages that were supposed to be in the document were accidentally omitted. Strangely, the two missing pages happened to contain language crucial to the compromise that had persuaded moderates to agree to the budget. Just as strangely, the budget resolution contained only a 4 percent increase in spending -- the amount George W. Bush originally wanted, not the 5 percent he had agreed to. 
 Whatever really happened, the fundamental cause of the mishap was that the Republican leadership was trying to pull a fast one -- to rush through a huge tax cut before anyone had a chance to look at the details. Now the case of the missing pages has delayed things for a few days. So may I suggest that Congress -- and Senate moderates in particular -- check carefully around that Xerox machine? You see, there seem to be a few other pages missing from the budget plan. 
 For starters, we seem to be missing the page that factors in the likely cost of a missile defense system. (The page that explains how missile defense will work in the first place is missing from some other document.) Nobody knows how much this system will cost, but few think it will come in under $100 billion.
We also seem to be missing the page that explains how the conventional defense buildup being planned by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld -- reports suggest an extra $25 billion per year on weapons systems alone, that is, $250 billion or more over the next decade -- is consistent with a budget that makes no room for increases in defense spending beyond those already proposed by the Clinton administration.
Then there's the page about prescription drug coverage under Medicare -- a solemn pledge by Mr. Bush during the campaign. Everyone in Congress agrees that the $115 billion allotted by the administration is laughably inadequate, that a realistic program would cost hundreds of billions more. But the extra money doesn't seem to be in the budget plan; maybe the missing page explains the discrepancy.
Somewhere near the page on prescription drug coverage we might find an explanation of the administration's position on the Medicare hospital insurance surplus -- $400 billion that both parties have promised to put in a "lockbox," but which the administration plans to devote to other uses. Presumably there's a missing page that explains why this isn't a naked plan to raid Medicare to pay for tax cuts. 
Then there's the puzzle of how the administration plans to maintain government services in the face of a growing population while increasing spending no faster than inflation. Either some unspecified drastic cuts are planned or the spending numbers are at least $400 billion too small. I'm sure there's a page somewhere that explains what's going on.
Not all the missing pages involve spending. Everyone familiar with the issue knows that the Bush tax cut will cause a crisis involving the Alternative Minimum Tax, causing the much-hated tax to apply to tens of millions of additional taxpayers. The inevitable fix will reduce revenue by at least $300 billion, but there doesn't seem to be any allowance for that revenue loss in the budget. I guess there must be a missing page that explains why.
Finally, there's the page on Social Security reform. Because Social Security has been run on a pay-as-you-go basis, with each generation's taxes financing the previous generation's retirement, the system has a huge "implicit debt" -- the money promised to people whose past contributions were used to support their elders. If Mr. Bush wants to partially privatize the system, he must pay off some of that implicit debt; to make his campaign proposal work would require infusing more than a trillion dollars into the Social Security system. But that money isn't in his budget plan. There must be a missing page with some explanation of the omission. 
Oh, and there's one more page missing: the one that explains why moderates should support a tax cut that, while slightly smaller than Mr. Bush wanted, is still irresponsibly large -- and why they should put their names to a budget resolution that is patently, shamelessly dishonest.

What if the Buffalo Roam Into Foot-and-Mouth?

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

 BODY:
BRITAIN'S prime minister, Tony Blair, preparing for an election, declared last week that his government was bringing foot-and-mouth under control. But in Washington, officials are drawing up detailed plans of what they will do if -- some say when -- the foot-and-mouth virus arrives in this country. They know they have a luxury denied Europeans: time to make advance battle plans. But they also have to grapple with one major problem that Europe was spared -- wildlife. 
 Recently, a federal emergency team played its first foot-and-mouth war game. "We felt that to tackle this issue we had to be well prepared for the worst, using the same agencies that would be involved in a chemical or biological incident, a Bhopal industrial disaster or bioterrorism," said Clifford Oliver, director of crisis planning for the Department of Agriculture. 
 But the team suddenly realized there were no provisions for protecting the millions of wild animals that could be threatened by the virus -- from wild boars to graceful long-horned antelopes -- or for controlling the birds and rodents that could be its most elusive carriers. In Europe, wildlife is so diminished that it is largely irrelevant to the foot-and-mouth blitzkrieg. 
According to United States Department of Agriculture guidelines, evidence of the virus in wildlife populations would prompt the same federal response as an infected cattle herd: "diagnosis, quarantine, depopulation, disposal and enforcement." That is, killing and burying or burning innumerable wild animals. 
"The contingency plans were very upsetting, especially for the implications for wildlife," said one federal scientist involved in the planning. "What are they going to do, send agents with rifles up in helicopters to go shoot wild rams in the Rockies?" 
Probably not, in a country with a strong attachment to its wildlife, enshrined in everything from national parks to the Endangered Species Act. Federal officials are trying to figure out how to protect the wildlife, perhaps with an early quarantine of some of the 100 million acres of wilderness, to make sure the disease doesn't spread to, say, the wild bison that are considered part of the country's cultural heritage. 
"There are so many unknowns about American wildlife that we have to develop creative strategies to protect and quarantine bison, deer, elk and antelope before they become victims of the disease," said Scott D. Wright, of the National Wildlife Health Center at the United States Geological Survey. "Tourists would rather be kept away from a national park than see a pile of dead wild animals."
 A CAUTIONARY alert has been sent to federal wildlife authorities explaining the planning and reminding them that wildlife could be endangered. During an outbreak in 1922, over 22,000 deer were killed in California for fear they would carry the disease.
In Britain, the authorities decided to stay away from the remaining deer. "They never found an infected deer and they figured that if they went to inspect the herds they would flush them out of the forest towards the disease," said Lynda Kelley, an Agriculture Department veterinarian who spent five weeks in Britain fighting the epidemic.
South Africa offers a more chilling example. It is the one country rich in wildlife that has been struck with foot-and-mouth. The disease remains endemic in the wild cape buffalo, but no one suggests killing off the infected animals. The species was nearly wiped out by another disease in the 1920's.
Of course, America must also fight some of the same battles Europe did. Small farmers and environmentalists shudder at the prospect of the slaughter of millions of domestic and wild animals to stop what they call an "economic disease"; large ranchers, the federal government and agribusiness leaders say the disease has to be swiftly contained and that requires an aggressive culling of all infected animals. 
Foot-and-mouth disease does not harm humans and is usually fatal only to young animals. It creates painful blisters in the feet and mouths of infected animals and leads to weight loss as well as a loss of milk in dairy cows. The real threat is economic: the presence of the virus would lead to an automatic ban on exporting American meat, a $50 billion annual business.
The debate over vaccination has new life here, too. Like Europe, the United States says it will not use vaccines before, or even in the early stages of, an epidemic because vaccinated animals have the same incriminating antibodies as those that are infected. Neither can be exported. Under the current plans even if animals are vaccinated, they would be used as part of the buffer zone and killed once the infection is contained. New vaccines might leave a different marker, allowing exports to continue. 
But the most compelling battle is likely to be the one Europe didn't have to face. As it stands, biologists like Bob Ferris, of the conservation group Defenders of Wildlife, know what will happen if the virus strikes a species on the endangered list: "If it gets into the woodland caribou of the northern Rockies or the pronghorn antelope in Arizona, those animals will be gone forever."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Answer Is Blowing in the Wind (and Riding in Birds and Deer and ...)"How could the foot-and-mouth virus spread in the United States? You can count the ways: ARRIVALThe virus could cross the ocean in many ways: in a shipping container, in a passenger's sandwich, in mud on a traveler's shoe. Once it is here... 1....the virus could be spread simply by riding damp winds or by finding its way into the bowels of a seagull. A virus can survive there and later be spread in the bird's excrement. 2. Should the infected excrement come in contact with cattle, the virus would infect the herd -- but it would not stop there. 3. The virus can move deeper into the country if, for instance a deer were to breach a ranch fence to enjoy an infected salt lick and then spread the disease to other deer. 4. Crows and other scavenging birds might then pick at carcasses of infected animals. 5. As they migrate, the birds could carry the virus deeper into the country.

Behind The Shield, A 3-Sided Rivalry

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
IT is a distant memory, but the common enemy that loomed over the Antiballistic Missile Treaty negotiations three decades ago was China.
 In March 1969, when Richard M. Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhnev began the negotiations that led to the signing of the 1972 treaty, they were convinced that the best defense against global nuclear war was mutual exposure to each other's offense. But because both -- especially Mr. Brezhnev -- feared the rising power of China, they agreed that each side could deploy a single antimissile site to protect its capital or another strategic target. That would eliminate the China threat. 
 "I would imagine that the Soviet Union would be just as reluctant as we would be to leave their country naked against a potential Chinese Communist threat," Mr. Nixon said. 
This was the dawn of triangular diplomacy, the three-cornered plane of relations between Washington, Moscow and Beijing where the cold war forged treaties of necessity, transitory alliances and opportunities for leverage so that no adversary could totally dominate.
Today, triangular diplomacy is coming back.
When President Bush outlined his vision last week for a robust new configuration of ballistic missile defenses, he offered an implicit deal to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin: cooperate with America's plan to scrap the ABM Treaty and erect a new missile defense architecture over the United States and its allies. Russia's reward: a role in a "joint defense," meaning that its military industries might also ride the rising technological tide promised by "Star Wars."
Conspicuously, Mr. Bush did not make the same offer to China. In fact, he barely mentioned China in his speech, though its national nuclear deterrent -- 20 or so ICBM's -- now stands at most risk of being negated.
Intended or not, the global politics of missile defense in a new era of threats -- ostensibly from North Korea, Iran and Iraq -- is also shaping a new strategic bulwark against China. And after Mr. Bush's showdown on Hainan Island over the American spy plane, and the big sale of new American weapons to Taiwan, grand strategy and American domestic politics are driving Mr. Bush toward lumping China among the rogue nations whose missiles need to be quarantined.
China isn't helping. Its weak collective of civilian leaders has loosed the military and security services to repress all critics while militarizing the coastline facing Taiwan. Under Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, the Politburo's leading twosome, progressive thinking has withered.
Still, today's triangle is a geometry of transformed players and angles different from those of the Nixon era. In the cold war, the United States sought irrevocably to break the Soviet-Chinese alliance that threatened America with a two-front war. In the early 1970's, Mr. Nixon staged the opening to China in order to play's on Mr. Brezhnev's fears that if he attacked Europe, a hostile China might strike his rear flank.
Now there is no Soviet enemy, just a weakened Russia whose largest goals are to find a home in Europe and rebuild a devastated economy, even though its maneuverings sometimes raise American hackles.
China, however, stands as a gathering economic colossus led by an insecure circle of Leninists and quasi-capitalists under Mr. Jiang, who fears what democracy and freedom might unleash in China's people.
Of the two, Russia, for all of its post-Soviet flaws, has made its choice. As Mr. Bush pointed out, Russia now elects its president. China, as Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, likes to say, is now America's "strategic competitor" and poses a war risk in Asia by its constant pressure on Taiwan to accept reunification.
PROFOUND choices now lie ahead for each strategic player on the triangle. 
For Russia, up to the moment that Mr. Putin recognized the existence of new ballistic missile threats last year, China stood shoulder to shoulder as an ally in opposition to America's missile shield idea. But Mr. Putin has been hedging his bets lately.
True, he mounted a diplomatic offensive with North Korea, Iran and Iraq to demonstrate that the missile threat from "rogue nations" might be moderated through diplomacy, rather than a shield. European countries applauded. But Mr. Putin and his military chiefs also developed plans on how to help build mobile missile defense systems that could be used against any "rogue" that threatened the West and its allies. A multinational approach would preserve the ABM Treaty since no one country could manipulate missile defenses for strategic advantage.
Suddenly China was isolated. Russia had broken ranks. And though Beijing has remained silent about Russia's shift in policy, China continues to denounce any missile defense proposals -- as the New China Agency did last week. The reason is simple. China's nuclear weapons are the ultimate guarantor of its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan, where a strong independence movement emboldened by American military support is driving China and the United States toward a new confrontation.
China's nuclear missiles are meant to deter American forces from interfering if Beijing decides to act against Taiwan, by blockade or otherwise. Thus Beijing sees missile defenses as a ploy to contain China.
Beijing is fighting to escape its isolation. With its entry into the World Trade Organization and its bid for the Olympic Games, it is trying to show Mr. Bush its compass is pointed in the right direction for stability and prosperity. Indeed, billions of dollars of Taiwanese investment still flows onto the mainland.
Strangely, the war issue looms over a topography of development and new wealth, which ought to suggest to all sides that military restraint will allow the Chinese eventually to sort out Taiwan's status to their liking.
For the United States, it is too early to say whether Mr. Bush is sincere in his offer to have Moscow participate in a joint defense. But it is no secret here that Mr. Putin views Western proposals for missile defense as a technology train that is leaving the station. Moscow fears that if it does so without Russia aboard, not only could expanding missile defenses be aimed at its own shrinking arsenal, but Russian defense industries might miss the bonanza.
In such thinking, it doesn't matter that missile defense may become a modern-day Maginot Line, easily outflanked by nuclear bombs carried ashore in suitcases or shipping containers. What matters is whether Russia can integrate its security with the West. Even NATO expansion would be easier for Russia to swallow under a shared umbrella.
But what about Russia's geometry with China? It is also too early to say that Russia is indifferent to China's growing isolation. The pragmatic Mr. Putin is unlikely to allow his advance westward to destabilize Russia's relations with the 1.3 billion Chinese with whom he shares a continent -- just as he has not let military cooperation with Beijing slow the process of binding Russia to Europe.
The next move in the triangle belongs to Mr. Bush, as he sends his emissaries out in the coming weeks.
If he and his European allies extend a hand to Russia as a partner in missile defense, China will stand alone, its national nuclear deterrent stripped of credibility. It is hard to imagine that China, so weakened, would stand still for that. Perhaps Mr. Bush and his advisers are counting on China's loss of leverage to thwart any plan by Beijing's military to force the Taiwan issue before Mr. Jiang and Mr. Li leave the political stage, probably next year. 
But even after they leave, as long as China keeps putting off an evolution toward democracy, the Taiwanese will want to keep their distance -- and the war issue will loom. 
UP to now, much of the debate over missile defenses has centered on when -- or whether -- the devices can be made to work. In fact, advances in technology are making missile defenses at least conceivable in the new century. But the most critical question may be how that technology is grafted onto the politics of a world where China, Russia and the United States calculate how to protect their own interests. That may be what decides whether it really works -- in other words, whether Mr. Bush will be enhancing global stability or undermining it by pushing forward now.

HEADLINE: A Blinkered Energy Strategy 

 BODY:
President Bush has said that his forthcoming energy package will be a balanced mix of recommendations aimed at increasing supply and, through improved energy efficiency, lowering demand. But it will be surprising if things actually turn out that way. The main architect of the energy plan is Vice President Dick Cheney, who made clear in a speech last weekend that the plan would focus heavily on increasing supplies of fossil fuels. With the certitude that he brings to most matters, Mr. Cheney contemptuously dismissed those who would look elsewhere to satisfy the country's energy needs. "Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue," he said, "but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy."
 As Mr. Cheney well knows, there are few people who actually believe that conservation alone can satisfy the country's energy needs. The country's electrical transmission lines need upgrading, there are bottlenecks in the system that distributes natural gas, and there are undoubtedly deposits of natural gas that can be extracted with minimal environmental damage from federal lands that are already open for exploration. But conservation -- saving energy by using it more efficiently -- can also make a huge difference, and for Mr. Cheney to imply otherwise simply reinforces the suspicion that his strategy is little more than a clever effort to sell the country on the need for more drilling. 
 Take first the fuel supply. Mr. Cheney is determined to drill for oil on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which could yield as much as 600,000 barrels of economically recoverable oil per day by 2010. By contrast, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that gradually raising the fuel efficiency of light trucks and cars to 35 miles per gallon would save 1.5 million barrels a day in 2010 and 4.5 million barrels a day by 2020 -- up to seven times what the refuge could produce. Moreover, these would be permanent energy savings that would not require invading an ecological treasure. 
Improved energy efficiency would also diminish the need for new power plants. In the same speech, Mr. Cheney asserted that energy demands are rising so fast that the country will need to build 1,300 new generating plants in the next 20 years. This assertion was based on a report of questionable integrity from the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Energy Department that has traditionally promoted conventional energy sources like coal and oil and downplayed the potential of efficiency and renewable energy. It is also the same report that Mr. Bush used to justify his decision to withdraw from the Kyoto accords on global warming. 
Meanwhile, the administration has conveniently ignored another Energy Department study published late last year -- "Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future," compiled by scientists at some of the Energy Department's national laboratories. The study argued that efficiency measures alone could obviate the need for building 610 of the 1,300 plants. For example, constructing buildings that were more energy efficient would eliminate the need for 100 plants, while rules approved near the end of the Clinton administration mandating more efficient appliances -- air-conditioners, clothes dryers and water heaters -- would save an additional 180 plants.
Increased energy efficiency could even rescue the president from the folly of punching holes in the Arctic, drilling off the coast of Florida and invading the national forests along the Rocky Mountain Front. But the key Bush officials do not see the potential in conservation. In its budget, the administration actually proposed a 30 percent cut in funding for a government-auto industry partnership that is seeking to develop a new generation of energy-efficient vehicles. That partnership, an Al Gore favorite that Detroit also loves, is helping to speed development of hybrid cars that get up to 60 miles per gallon. The White House has also threatened to weaken the new standards for central air-conditioners, while the Energy Department proposes to cut in half its spending on alternative fuel sources like wind, solar energy and fuel cells. 
The budget holds out the hope that these research funds will be restored in 2004 -- but only with money earned from oil leases in the Arctic refuge should Congress allow drilling there. There can be no plainer illustration of the bias toward extraction that defines what we know so far about Mr. Cheney's energy strategy.

Mr. Lazio Goes to Washington, Again

BYLINE:  By Patrick McGeehan 

 BODY:
After several months of doing odd jobs, speaking at schools and cutting ribbons, Rick Lazio will be fully employed again.
 Mr. 
Lazio, the former Congressman who lost a Senate race to Hillary Rodham Clinton last year in New York, has been named the first chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, an exclusive group of chief executives that includes Philip J. Purcell of Morgan Stanley and William B. Harrison Jr. of J. P. Morgan Chase. Mr. Lazio said he would build consensus among the chiefs on "long-term issues that are going to affect the financial services industry and the economy here in America." 
 Starting on July 1, Mr. Lazio, 43, again will be commuting from his home on Long Island to Washington, where the forum plans to set up an office. In the meantime, he has filled in as a host on CNN's "Crossfire" and, according to his Web site, welcomed the arrival of Teddy Roosevelt's Medal of Honor in Long Island and visited Miss Vedder's sixth-grade class in Babylon.

Union Tries New Route In Eastman Kodak Vote

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Hershey Jr. 

 BODY:
This time, Bill Bradley, the former senator and basketball star whose bid for the Democratic presidential nomination fell short last year, is almost certain to win an election. But millions of union members, a natural constituency, will not be supporting him. 
 The occasion is the annual meeting on Wednesday of Eastman Kodak, which has fended off repeated proposals by the Service Employees International Union and its allies to persuade the company to abandon its practice of having shareholders vote on only one-third of its board seats each year. The union wants to vote on the entire board at once, contending that certain conditions may warrant cleaning house. But the company says staggered terms provide "continuity and stability." 
 For four years in a row, the proposals, which are nonbinding, have obtained more than 50 percent of the shares cast but a minority of the total shares outstanding. Directors have ignored the votes. "No other corporation has disenfranchised shareholder majority will so often and so consistently," said Steve Abrecht, executive director of the trust that runs the union's pension funds.
For this year's meeting, in St. Paul, the union has changed its strategy. It has enlisted other institutional investors to withhold votes from Mr. Bradley, the owner of 20 shares as of March, and three current directors, including Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chairwoman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and a director since 1997.
Among those committed not to support the nominees are Amalgamated Bank, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the Teamsters union and the New York City Employees Retirement System.

HEADLINE: California Struggling Over Budget Amid Crisis 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, May 3 

 BODY:
The dot-com boom produced such unexpected cascades of tax revenues in California over the last several years that the Legislature's early summer budget negotiations had come to look more like Christmas morning than partisan maneuvering.
 "What fighting there was was over what ornaments we were going to put on the Christmas tree," said Bill Campbell, the former chairman of the Republican caucus in the State Assembly. 
 But with a swiftness that has taken many here by surprise, the state's energy shortages and halting economic growth have transformed the annual budget exercise into a symbol of how deeply the power crisis is starting to divide the state. Already, leaders on both sides are saying they are unlikely to conclude the budget before the deadline of July 1, when the new fiscal year begins, and the Republican minority has said it will hold up any deal until Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, reduces the size of his plan for covering the costs of the energy crisis. 
With California's utilities crushed under the weight of soaring wholesale power prices, the state has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity. What began as an emergency measure has become an open-ended, budget-wrecking commitment.
The governor estimates that the state will suffer a net loss of more than $9 billion from the power purchases this year alone. Some experts call the estimate too low, but most agree the purchases will not only wipe out the budget surplus for the current fiscal year but also gobble up the better portion of the state's hard-earned reserves. 
The generous $83 billion budget that Mr. Davis had proposed in January for the fiscal year that begins on July 1 is being all but abandoned.
Many one-time expenditures, like programs for public safety, are likely to be dropped, and most legislators are abandoning hopes for more spending on pet projects, like centers for the elderly and swimming pools. Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, chairman of the budget committee, said that spending on education would remain strong, but that the health care and transportation budgets might be trimmed. 
"This is a moving target," Mr. Cardenas said. "We may still see some growth in certain areas, but this will be nothing like the last two years or so. We all have to go through a huge psychological adjustment." 
The Republicans have identified $3.5 billion in cuts, including areas like higher education and welfare. 
Even some Democrats have complained that the governor has not fully disclosed just how badly the power crisis is undermining the state's finances, and say the cuts may need to go deeper. 
"What a lot of people do not fully realize is that there has been a dramatic impact on the state's cash position already, and it will get worse," Kathleen Connell, the state controller and a Democrat, said in an interview. "I will be out of funds in the general fund very shortly." 
Philip Angelides, the state treasurer and also a Democrat, complained that with the budget being depleted by up to $90 million a day, "there's no end game." 
Even the governor's sobering projections, Mr. Angelides said, were based on optimistic assumptions, like savings from large-scale energy conservation, that could fail to materialize.
Governor Davis has proposed selling $12.5 billion in bonds, the largest state offering in history, and having ratepayers repay the bonds over 15 years. The proceeds would be used to repay the state for its power purchases. 
The Republicans have blocked approval for the bond offering and this week offered their own plan. They believe the state should simply eat the losses on what it has spent for power to date. While painful, that would reduce the bond offering, they say, to about $8 billion and ease the burden that ratepayers would have to bear.
George Runner, the Republicans' chief budget negotiator, said that approach would also force the Democrats to undertake long-range reductions in the size of the government.
"Why pay the money back if it's just going to be spent by the Democrats on growing programs?" Mr. Runner asked. "This is the right time for some austerity."
So far, Governor Davis has not responded to the Republican plan. His director of finance, Tim Gage, said in an interview only that the governor was committed to maintaining educational spending, and that he believed the bond plan must move ahead. 
Mr. Campbell, the Republican assemblyman, said: "The big problem is we still don't know our position, how much this is costing. We'll know more after a summer of blackouts, but who wants to make a budget then?"

HEADLINE: Sunday Q & A 

 BODY:
 Sunday Q & A begins today and will appear in this section weekly. Readers are invited to send in questions about national or international affairs; those selected will be answered by Times correspondents who specialize in those issues. Information about submitting questions appears below. 

Where Greenspan Invests

Q. What does Alan Greenspan do with his money?

A. Richard W. Stevenson, a Washington correspondent who covers the Federal Reserve, responds:
 He does not play the stock market.
Mr. Greenspan's financial disclosure statement, last updated less than a year ago, lists income-producing assets valued at $2.26 million to $6.76 million. Nearly all of it was in the form of short-term Treasury bills, with some in cash. Those investments produced income of $169,000 to $532,000 in 1999 (the form requires only ranges for asset values and income). Mr. Greenspan also draws a government salary of $161,200 a year.
Federal Reserve officials said that Mr. Greenspan, like other Fed governors, is technically allowed to own stocks and to trade them, with certain limitations, including a ban on buying and selling in the week before or the day of meetings of the central bank at which it considers changes in interest rates. 
But they said Mr. Greenspan had chosen to go beyond the technical restrictions and not invest in anything other than short-term Treasury securities, which are less subject to interest rate variations than longer-term bonds. 
He has stocks in the family. His wife, Andrea Mitchell, the NBC News correspondent, holds shares in companies that include Abbott Laboratories, Kimberly Clark and Anheuser-Busch.

Learning a Tough Language

Q. What are the hardest languages for English speakers to learn?

A. Diana Jean Schemo, a Washington correspondent, responds:
Ray Clifford, provost of the Defense Language Institute, says the difficulty of learning a foreign language is directly related to how much it differs from a student's native language, in its rules of syntax and grammar, its alphabet and even the culture it springs from.
The Defense Department devotes the most time, 63 weeks, to teaching its hardest languages, which include Arabic, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Less difficult are Russian and the Slavic languages, Vietnamese, Farsi and some Asian languages, to which the Defense Department devotes 47 weeks' training, followed by German, Indonesian and other languages ranked with them in difficulty. Romance languages are considered the easiest for Americans with little foreign language background to master, along with some Scandinavian languages.
The State Department grades languages similarly, but counts Mongolian and Georgian among its "super hard" languages. Notably, perhaps because many of its employees have studied a foreign language previously, it also considers German as easy to learn as French, Spanish and other Romance languages.

Camera Shy in Afghanistan

Q. If the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan are against depicting the human form on statues, how do they feel about photographs?

A. Barry Bearak, a New Delhi correspondent who has frequently reported from Afghanistan, responds:
Generally, the top Talibans have little regard for Kodak moments and have banned depictions of the human form whether in photographs, films or paintings. When given a visa, reporters are warned against taking pictures of any living thing. But in practice, people are seldom discouraged when a camera is pointed at a donkey or a tree.
There is no known photograph of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader. But a few other mullahs will sit for a snapshot or two. On the front line, a photographer is often pestered by commanders and soldiers who want to be immortalized in the company of a rocket launcher. 
Photographs are actually required when applying for a passport or visa, though in the case of women, only the eyes are allowed to show. Afghan men, if they are Muslims, are required to wear beards -- and untrimmed ones at that. My passport photo, taken in 1998, shows me cleanshaven. I have since added an often-ragged fluff of whiskers. Whatever the effect on my looks, several visa officers have commended me for making spiritual progress.

Send questions by e-mail to sundayq&a@ nytimes.com, or by mail to Sunday Q & A, The New York Times, 229 West 43rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Those of widest interest will be selected, but unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.

HEADLINE: At Home, Mexico Mistreats Its Migrant Farmhands 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: VILLA JUAREZ, Mexico 

 BODY:
If Patricio Gomez had left his country to work illegally on farms in the United States, Mexico's new president would call him a national hero and insist that he enjoy decent working conditions. But instead Mr. Gomez provides food for American grocery shelves from this side of the border, and the Mexican government has not paid the same attention to his plight.
 "No one defends us," Mr. Gomez, 33, said while hauling wooden stakes taller than himself to a field of sweet red peppers on a farm near here in the western state of Sinaloa. "They do not pay us what they promised. And if we are sick, they do not give us the medicine we need." 
 By noon on a recent day, Mr. Gomez, as haggard as a scarecrow, had been at work seven hours. He expected to work until sunset for a little more than $5 for the day. His barefoot children -- ages 8, 10 and 11 -- worked at his side. 
Asked whether they attended school, Mr. Gomez lowered his eyes and shook his head to signify no. Each one was an important breadwinner, he said. And the $1,500 the Gomez family hoped to take home at the end of the harvest was just about all the money the family would have for the year. "If the whole family does not work," Mr. Gomez lamented, "we all starve."
Like birds that follow migratory patterns set by the seasons, Mr. Gomez and his family are among the one million Mexicans who abandon their homes for part of the year to move north with the harvests.
President Vicente Fox has been an outspoken advocate of Mexican laborers in the United States, pressing Washington to improve their working conditions. But in his five months in office, he has not devoted a speech to the cares of migrant workers at home. And after his election it was discovered that children as young as 11 worked at the Fox family's own plants packing vegetables. 
From November until May, tens of thousands of migrants circle the Gulf Coast states to cut sugar cane and pick oranges and cotton. Others fan out across Mexico's heartland to pack cauliflower and broccoli and tobacco. And in the nation's largest migrations, hundreds of thousands migrate along routes that cut a long figure eight along Mexico's Pacific northwest to harvest millions of boxes of fruit and vegetables, most of it for export to the United States.
About 200,000 people settle in nearly 150 work camps across Sinaloa, arriving on fleets of buses sent by the growers. The migrants -- the poorest of Mexico's 40 million poor -- are called jornaleros (hor-nah-LAY-ros), a name derived from the Spanish word for a day's wage. And their lives look like a twisted reflection in a carnival mirror of the experiences of unskilled Mexican workers in the United States.
They do not leave their homes because they are looking for better wages; they leave because they are looking for any wages. Many of these internal migrants earn nothing at all at home -- there are no paying jobs around -- and survive only on the beans and corn that they manage to grow on little plots outside their tumbledown houses. 
They do not travel in gangs of single men, but mostly as families or entire communities. Almost 40 percent are Indians who do not speak Spanish well.
And although their work has made Sinaloa the largest producer of vegetables in the nation, for the months that they are here they live as outcasts in ramshackle work camps made from tin. Half are women and girls, farm worker advocates report, and at least 30 percent are children under 15.
President Fox has created a new cabinet-level agency to work on issues of Mexicans abroad. He has pressed President Bush to open the border to a freer flow of Mexican workers. Members of Mr. Fox's cabinet are involved in negotiations with Washington over the creation of programs to give the Mexican workers more power to demand fair wages and decent living conditions.
And in a May Day celebration last Tuesday, Mr. Fox honored as "heroes" those Mexicans who had been forced by economic hardships to pursue a better way of life north of the border and who send nearly $8 billion of earnings back to their homeland.
But Mr. Fox, the son of ranchers, has not devoted any significant political capital to the abuses against migrants who labor on Mexican soil. And when Mexican reporters discovered that children had been employed in packing plants owned by his family, a violation of Mexican law, the president sought first to distance himself from the matter, saying: "This is not an issue for me. It is an issue for others whose names are Fox." Later, Mr. Fox's family dismissed more than 20 minors from the operations and the president acknowledged the violations as a sad reality of Mexican life.
"This is an issue for all of Mexico," he said. "It is an issue we want to resolve."
Without his usual fanfare, Mr. Fox went on to increase spending for the single federal program aimed at building housing, schools and day-care centers for migrant farm workers by 25 percent. But five months after his budget was approved by Congress, officials said, money for the project is still being held up as officials decide how it should be used. 
Mexico's minister of social development, Josefina Vasquez Mota, said that the Fox administration had increased spending on migrant farm worker programs more than on any other of the agency's programs. And when asked about labor violations, especially the use of child workers, she said corruption continued in all sectors of Mexican society. She added, "The lack of respect for the law in the countryside hurts the most vulnerable people in our country."
"We not only recognize the grave inequalities that are endured by the jornaleros, we are worried about them," she said. "And we are determined to make improvements."
Ms. Vasquez said that in an effort to create jobs in the south, President Fox had promised to lure border plants away from the industrial north and to offer micro-loans so that peasant farmers could start small businesses at home.
The government has also spent $52 million in the last five years to improve worker camps. In Sinaloa, officials said, some 20 percent of them are in "decent condition." 
But all sides agree -- government officials, growers and farm worker advocates -- that the overwhelming majority of Mexican farm workers endure dangerous and unsanitary conditions.
"I know that conditions for Mexican workers in the United States are bad," said Hubert C. de Grammont, a sociologist who has studied Mexican agriculture and the plight of migrant farm workers for more than 20 years. "But it is difficult to try to defend the human rights of migrants in the United States when migrants are ignored and disrespected in our own country."
Camp Caimanes near this town seems a microcosm of Mexico's dark side, a shantytown of 2,000 people at the edge of a field of tomatoes where residents take relief from the heat in the brown-green water of a canal; where children, exhausted after a day at work in the fields, never protest bedtime; and where drug abuse has increasingly become the most popular form of recreation.
The workers live in long, flat barracks with primitive cement hearths out front for cooking. Each family gets one room, about the size of a garage, and many families come with a dozen relatives each.
Fresh out of college, 22-year-old Viviana Parra Flores is one of two social workers assigned to worker problems. But during a walk around the camp with her and a colleague, they made clear that the camp often escaped their control. After leaving the fly-infested day-care center, the counselors said that four children had died during the harvest.
Only the night before, a fire had destroyed some hovels at the camp. No one was injured, the social workers said. But most of the workers who had lived there, about 20 families, lost everything, down to every cent they had earned for the season.
Ruperta Tolentino Fernandez, her long braids matted with mud, said her family lost about $1,000. She and her husband have five children, ranging in age from 3 to 14. All but the 3-year-old work, she said.
"Now we will be beggars when we go home," she said.
Sinaloa's governor, Juan S. Millan, said: "Just a couple of years ago, there were only a few camps where I could take visitors without feeling ashamed. Today, there are a few more decent camps. But there is so much more that needs to be done." 
In Sinaloa, agriculture is a $600 million industry controlled by an elite group of fewer than 20 families, said Maria Teresa Guerra, a human rights lawyer who has written a book about the state's farm workers. Sinaloa is the largest producer of vegetables in the nation thanks to its 11 rivers and a sprawling system of government-built dams and canals.
One grower, Roberto Gotsis, took a visitor on a tour of a camp he had just built for 200 of his company's 1,000 workers. His family, he said, had been growing cucumbers, tomatoes and red peppers in Sinaloa since the 1920's.
Mr. Gotsis, who has a degree from the University of Arizona, estimated that the company sold tomatoes in the United States for almost $7 a box. Peppers, he said, fetch about $15 a box. As for his workers, he added, they earn about a nickel for each box they filled.
On a tour of the day-care center he had built in the new camp, the 36-year-old Mr. Gotsis proclaimed the arrival to power of a "new generation" of growers who "understand that our workers must live better." 
Lorenzo Perez, who spent the season at another camp, Penjamo, was pretty happy with life one recent Saturday. He had made about $7 that day, a couple of dollars more than usual. But what was most exciting, he said, was that he had finally picked more tomatoes than his father. "Now I am the fastest cutter in my family," he gloated. 
Diana Ramirez, 14, was washing jeans in the canal below. She smiled as Lorenzo bragged and vowed that he would stop picking tomatoes one day and drive a tractor.
When asked about her own hopes, Diana's mind cast forward as far as tomorrow. "Women do not drive tractors," she said with a shrug. "I will work in the fields."

HEADLINE: U.S. SCIENTISTS SEE BIG POWER SAVINGS FROM CONSERVATION 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
Scientists at the country's national laboratories have projected enormous energy savings if the government takes aggressive steps to encourage energy conservation in homes, factories, offices, appliances, cars and power plants.
 Their studies, completed just before the Bush administration took office, are at odds with the administration's repeated assertions in recent weeks that the nation needs to build a big new power plant every week for the next 20 years to keep up with the demand for electricity, and that big increases in production of coal and natural gas are needed to fuel those plants. 
 A lengthy and detailed report based on three years of work by five national laboratories said that a government-led efficiency program emphasizing research and incentives to adopt new technologies could reduce the growth in electricity demand by 20 percent to 47 percent.
That would be the equivalent of between 265 and 610 big 300-megawatt power plants, a steep reduction from the 1,300 new plants that the administration predicts will be needed. The range depends on how aggressively the government encourages efficiency in buildings, factories and appliances, as well as on the price of energy, which affects whether new technologies are economically attractive. 
Another laboratory study found that government office buildings could cut their own use of power by one-fifth at no net cost to the taxpayers by adopting widespread energy conservation measures, paying for the estimated $5 billion investment with the energy savings.
But the Bush administration, which is in the final stages of preparing a strategy to deal with what it calls an energy crisis, has not publicized these findings, relying instead primarily on advice from economists at the Energy Department's Energy Information Agency, who often take a skeptical view of projected efficiency gains and predict a much greater need for fossil fuel supplies.
Administration officials said that some of the national laboratories' studies were based on theoretical assumptions that do not translate well into policy.
"We are looking for practical solutions here," said Jeanne Lopatto, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department. "Whatever works, we're interested in. But some of these ideas have been funded over many years and they have a very small impact on energy needs."
The once obscure debate between scientists at the national laboratories and economists at the information agency, both sides working for the Department of Energy, reflects a raging dispute between President Bush and many Democrats and environmentalists. While both sides agree that the United States faces energy problems, Mr. Bush's team has emphasized the quest for new supplies, while his critics emphasize untapped potential to reduce demand.
Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking publicly last week on the energy plan he is in charge of drafting, used the information agency's projections when he said that the nation would need at least 1,300 new power plants by 2020. Mr. Cheney used the figure to dramatize the need to mobilize public and private resources to close a supply gap.
Mr. Cheney has not publicly noted that other Energy Department studies show ways to trim that number. The conservation measures that the scientists consider feasible would save future energy costs and prevent air pollution from hundreds of power plants.
The laboratories' estimates assume widespread application of some time-tested efficiency standards and the success of some newer inventions that scientists love but many bottom-line economists tend to distrust as expensive or unrealistic.
Their work was reviewed by outside experts from industry, government and universities.
Some of the proposed conservation steps are neither costly nor complex. Just this week, researchers at the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed a fluorescent table lamp that reduces the need for overhead lighting. The laboratory says the lamp matches the combined output of a 300-watt halogen lamp and a 150-watt bulb, but uses a quarter of the energy.
"Widespread use of this lighting system in offices and homes could greatly reduce the current power problems we have in California," said Michael Siminovitch, a scientist at the laboratory.
Other technologies have been proved in field tests. At Fort Polk, an Army base in Louisiana, electricity use during peak hours fell by 43 percent after base managers installed fluorescent lights, low-flow shower heads, new attic insulation and new home heating and cooling systems.
Most of the savings came from installing geothermal heat pumps, an efficient home heating and cooling system that circulates fluids through underground coils but otherwise uses conventional technologies. Hundreds of homes on the base were equipped with the systems, generating immediate cost savings for electricity and totally eliminating the homes' use of natural gas for water heating. The entire installation cost was covered by a private contractor that makes a profit by sharing in the government's cost savings for the first 20 years.
The heat pumps, though still something of a novelty, are completely proven and save so much money that President Bush installed a system at his new ranch home in Crawford, Tex., Mr. Cheney's official home, the Naval Observatory in Washington, also uses geothermal heat pumps to cut down on its energy bill.
A study prepared by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory last year contended that striving to make such savings often made sound economic sense.
The study found that the federal government, the largest energy user in the United States with some 500,000 buildings, could reduce its own energy consumption by one-fifth. The investment necessary to realize those gains would be $5.2 billion, the study said, but the energy savings would knock nearly $1 billion annually off the government's energy bill, an attractive rate of return.
Some private companies have already made significant advances in what are known as combined heat and generation plants, which could become industry standards, energy department experts say. Chevron has estimated that it saved $100 million a year after it withdrew a refinery from the Texas electricity grid and relied on an on-site generator, which allowed it to recycle waste heat from the generation process for refining.
New efficiency standards for clothes washers, water heaters and air-conditioners adopted by the Clinton administration were projected by the Clinton Energy Department to reduce electricity demand by the equivalent of 170 300-megawatt power plants over 20 years if fully enforced.
President Bush's fiscal 2002 budget slashed the department's spending on researching and developing energy-efficient buildings and factories, more fuel-efficient automobiles, new appliance standards and more efficient lighting. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said some of that work was better left to the private sector.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, both former oil industry executives, seem to have assigned a tertiary role to efficiency improvements, behind new drilling for oil and gas and new construction of energy infrastructure, like pipelines and power plants. Neither the president nor the vice president has promoted his own energy-saving home as a model.
In fact, Mr. Cheney said last week, "Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy."

HEADLINE: Questions of Style In Warnaco's Fall 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
EVEN in 1992, after Linda Wachner had engineered the leveraged buyout of Warnaco Inc., a sedate maker of intimate apparel, and turned it into a cash machine, taken it public and become a darling of investors, stock analysts and financial writers, few mistook her for the model executive of management textbooks.
 That year, Fortune magazine named her America's "most successful businesswoman" and other publications grouped her with movers and shakers like Henry Kravis and Ronald Perelman. But even in the most generous tributes, there were always mentions or hints of Mrs. Wachner's unusual excesses in her use of her position. 
 She became known for an outsized compensation package -- in 1999, for example, her base salaries, totaling $3.785 million, from Warnaco and Authentic Fitness (which Warnaco has since bought), exceeded the base salary for John F. Welch Jr. at General Electric, which has roughly 50 times the revenue and 100 times the net income. (Mr. Welch, however, received about $10 million in bonuses that year, while Mrs. Wachner got none, and Warnaco said the boards of both companies had approved her compensation.) 
Mrs. Wachner also developed a reputation for demoralizing employees by publicly dressing them down for missing sales and profit goals or for simply displeasing her. Often, many former employees said, the attacks were personal rather than professional, and not infrequently laced with crude references to sex, race or ethnicity -- an accusation that Mrs. Wachner flatly denies.
As one of the few high-profile women running a big company in the early 1990's, however, Mrs. Wachner was a Teflon chief executive. She was, after all, still building Warnaco from a sleepy bra company with $590 million in sales into a $2.25 billion-a-year powerhouse with a dream team of retail brands like Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, Chaps by Ralph Lauren sportswear and Speedo swimsuits. She delivered financial results that made her widely discussed indulgences, financial and managerial, appear to be a means to an end -- or at least a forgivable sideshow.
No longer. The Warnaco Group, as the company is now known, has almost completely collapsed. The company announced last month that it lost $338 million last year, or $6.41 a share, and had little more than $11 million in cash on hand. The stock has crashed from $44.375 a share in July 1998 to 75 cents on Friday. At the beginning of April, the company, laden with almost $1.84 billion in debt, acknowledged that it was in violation of the terms of its bank loans. A few days later, Warnaco's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, said that unless Warnaco could renegotiate the terms of those loans, they had "substantial doubt" that the company could continue its operations.
If that were not enough, in the last nine months, two groups of shareholders have filed class-action lawsuits contending that Warnaco and its executives artificially inflated the price of the company's stock by issuing false and misleading statements about its financial performance. And last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission notified the Warnaco Group that it was investigating possible violations of securities laws in connection with previously filed financial statements and reports.
Emboldened by these events, many investors, former employees and retail partners are now willing to assert what was only whispered all along: that Mrs. Wachner's management style has hurt and perhaps even killed the company. These intimates of the company argue that her personal criticism of employees, among other things, has led to excessive staff turnover and robbed the company of talent it needed to maintain quality operations. Warnaco has, for example, employed three chief financial officers at the Authentic Fitness division in five years, five presidents of Calvin Klein Kids in three years and three heads of Warnaco Intimate Apparel in four years. 
These critics also say that Mrs. Wachner's lust for Midas-size pay packages has caused the company to make poor short-term decisions that buoyed the top line and plumped earnings. They want her out.
"We have lost confidence in her," said Ted White, director for corporate governance at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the giant pension fund known as Calpers, which owned 260,856, or 0.5 percent, of the company's shares as of its latest filing and is agitating for her ouster. "We are distressed with the performance and we question whether she has the ability to turn the company around."
Warnaco has an answer to Mrs. Wachner's critics. It amounts to this: a lot of bad luck, not Mrs. Wachner, has hurt the company.
The confluence of closings, bankruptcies and consolidations among retailers, as well as the weak economy and the adverse impact of a well-publicized lawsuit by Calvin Klein, all contributed to Warnaco's current position, said Howard Rubenstein, whose public relations firm was hired to represent the company in recent weeks. High interest rates in the last part of 2000 compounded the problem, Mr. Rubenstein added.
Mrs. Wachner declined to be interviewed, but in a written statement denied that she was unprofessional to employees. "My management style is tough but fair," she said. "I would certainly never knowingly do anything to humiliate or embarrass anyone."

Conquered and Divided
In May 2000, when Calvin Klein sued Warnaco and Mrs. Wachner to try to terminate her license to make his jeans, the personal nature of his attack was conspicuous. The complaint, in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, called Mrs. Wachner abusive and unprofessional.
In an interview at the time, Mr. Klein angrily expanded on the topic. "She runs it like a monarchy," he fumed, describing Mrs. Wachner's performance at Warnaco. "She is abusive to our people. Verbally, the language is disgusting."
The visceral nature of Mr. Klein's comments stunned outsiders, but former employees say it came as no surprise to them. In interviews, more than a dozen former employees consistently painted Mrs. Wachner as an executive with a brilliant financial mind, but also as a manager with an autocratic style that often became abusive. For example, employees say she routinely used racial or ethnic slurs when chastising employees.
In her written response, Mrs. Wachner categorically denied making such remarks.
To counter criticism from former employees, Warnaco provided several current executives who, in phone interviews that were monitored by a company lawyer, described Mrs. Wachner as an exemplary employer. For example, Suzanne Karkus, president of the Calvin Klein Jeans women's division, said that in her 20 years in the business, she had never had a boss who was more honest or supportive. "If she gives her word, she comes through 100 percent," Ms. Karkus said. 
Christopher G. Staff, president and chief operating officer of the Authentic Fitness unit, said Mrs. Wachner's compassion for employees was evident when a manager collapsed in the office several years ago. "Linda not only got down on the floor with him and called 911, she went with the litter to the hospital," Mr. Staff recalled.
In other interviews, though, some former employees who consider themselves among Mrs. Wachner's most ardent admirers did not say she was easy to work for. But they said she upbraided employees only for good reason. "If you expect everyone to be extremely nice and polite -- it is unrealistic for apparel," said Martin J. Rose, who ran Warnaco's worldwide advertising and marketing from February 1997 to February 1999. "I don't think she ever lost her temper in a way that was unjustifiable."
Chris Heyn, who was president of Warnaco's Hathaway shirt division from 1991 until 1992, said Mrs. Wachner could be intimidating, but only when people failed to do their jobs. "When you did not make numbers, she would dress you down and make you feel knee-high and it was terrifying," he said. "But she only lost it over business stuff. Only when we missed numbers."
Many other former employees, however, said Mrs. Wachner's wrath was kindled easily, was often irrational and often crossed the line between business and personal. Most former employees, even those who left on good terms, refused to speak for attribution because they still feared Mrs. Wachner. One former executive, raising a common theme, said, "The only people who survive at Warnaco were people who were abused children."
Another added: "She is the main reason why Warnaco has grown and the main reason it has fallen apart. There is some genius there, but she cannot run a $2 billion corporation by herself."
Several employees described a common practice designed, they felt, to make them feel small: Late in the evening, Mrs. Wachner would telephone an employee who had fallen out of favor and demand that he or she meet her at the offices of Warnaco, at 90 Park Avenue in Manhattan, at 39th Street, the next morning. Then she would leave them sitting in a room for hours, sometimes the entire day, waiting for her.
Another specific incident, recalled by several employees, involved Alexander Cannon, who was president of the men's sportswear division at Warnaco until 1998. They said that at a meeting of executives, Mrs. Wachner turned to Mr. Cannon and belittled him with a crude comment about the behavior of his wife, from whom he had just separated. Mr. Cannon declined to comment. Mrs. Wachner declined to discuss the specific allegation. A Warnaco spokesman noted that Mr. Cannon had worked at the company for 11 years.
Another employee remembered being castigated by Mrs. Wachner at a meeting of division presidents after a batch of shirts had arrived from a factory at an unacceptably low quality level; he later learned that Mrs. Wachner had changed his order from including an enzyme wash to a less expensive garment wash, altering the quality, without informing him.
Mrs. Wachner and her senior advisers do not recall any such incident, said Stanley Silverstein, general counsel for Warnaco. He said Mrs. Wachner always insisted on the highest quality.
The widespread impression that Mrs. Wachner treats employees roughly has left Warnaco with one of the highest executive turnover rates in the industry, several retail talent-recruiting agents said.
Former employees said this made it harder for the company to cope with the economic slowdown that began last year. The firings, or "public hangings," as one former employee characterized them, made executives reluctant to warn of slowing sales or defecting customers. "People were overwhelmingly afraid to do anything that might be construed as not toeing the company line, as it was perceived as traitorous," he said.
Mr. Silverstein discounted the effect of employee turnover. "There is high turnover in the apparel industry generally," he said. "Warnaco's experience tracks this industry pattern." He added that all current division presidents had been with the company for years. For example, David Clark, president of the intimate apparel division, has been with the company for 22 years, and Susan Guensch, president of the Speedo unit, has worked for that business for 16 years.
Without the company's cooperation, it is impossible to say exactly what the turnover rate is at Warnaco. But in addition to those already cited, executives who have departed include Mr. Cannon, who left less than a month after Mrs. Wachner was said to have commented on his wife; he is now president for merchandising at Nautica Sportswear. The former head of the Calvin Klein underwear division, John Kourakos, left in 1996 and is now president for menswear at Tommy Hilfiger. And the president in charge of Chaps by Ralph Lauren, Mindy Grossman, left in 1994 and is now global vice president for apparel at Nike. James R. Mogan, who was recruited from Maidenform in 1997 to be president of intimate apparel at Warnaco, left last month.
"Linda is her own worst enemy," said another former employee, who said she has repeatedly been asked to return to the company. "No one who can get work elsewhere wants to put up with her."

In Pursuit of Sales Targets
Mrs. Wachner's legend in the rag trade has grown so large that it is sometimes hard to separate fact from fiction. One story that some employees swear by, but that Mrs. Wachner adamantly denies, is that she had a flashing light for her gold BMW and would use it to move quickly through congested Manhattan traffic. The story may well be apocryphal -- Warnaco said its drivers do not recall using flashing lights -- but like any good legend, it suggests a kernel of truth. It portrays a Linda Joy Wachner determined to get ahead at any cost.
Former employees, investors and clients for Warnaco goods concur in describing Mrs. Wachner as someone determined to make goals, no matter how she got there. Former employees describe a women obsessed with hitting financial targets like sales and earnings -- especially earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization costs are deducted. This rough measure of a company's operational earning power, known as Ebitda, is an important gauge of whether a company with big debts can repay loans. It also figured in calculations for Mrs. Wachner's bonus.
Of course, many modern chief executives have used tricks to keep revenue numbers up and to appease Wall Street. But Mrs. Wachner's critics say the short-term methods she used to meet analysts' forecasts -- like selling excess inventory at cut-rate prices -- now haunt her.
The main issue behind Calvin Klein's lawsuit, for example, was whether Warnaco had cheapened his brand by selling an unauthorized number of jeans to discount outlets like BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club, a unit of Wal-Mart Stores. The suit was settled before the court could decide if Mrs. Wachner had exceeded her authority, but pretrial discovery left little doubt that Warnaco was selling huge quantities of Klein jeans to such outlets.
Former employees recall that in the last week of each quarter, Mrs. Wachner would round up her senior executives on the company plane and visit the headquarters of Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's consecutively until enough merchandise was sold to meet the revenue numbers the company had promised to Wall Street. "If we were not making the numbers, we were on the plane trying to dump merchandise," said one former employee from Warnaco's Klein division.
These employees said that in addition to eroding the brand integrity of her most important licensee, such discount sales were corroding the company's relationship with department stores, Warnaco's most important clients. "In order to make our numbers one quarter, she sold over one million units to Sam's Club," recalled another former employee, referring to pairs of jeans. "These were first-quality goods that were scheduled to go department stores.
"It left all the people who we had orders with, like Federated and May, high and dry and very angry," said the former employee, referring to the two big department store companies.
Warnaco also showed its insensitivity to exclusivity concerns from department stores in January 2000, when Mrs. Wachner decided to sell Calvin Klein underwear in J. C. Penney stores. That helped to bolster Warnaco's sales, but it infuriated upscale department stores that did not like being grouped with Penney.
At the time, Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's, one of Federated Department Stores' chains, complained to Women's Wear Daily, the retail industry trade newspaper, that selling to Penney "dulls the luster of the brand."
Other Calvin Klein licensees affirmed that view in depositions taken for the Calvin Klein lawsuit against Warnaco. "We are not in as many doors, and our profit margins are now a lot weaker," testified Jordan Lipson, chief executive of American Essentials, which makes Calvin Klein brand socks. He said Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom had called him to express their displeasure.
Warnaco denied that its sales to the discount warehouse stores interfered with its commitments to department stores, and said that in the changing retail market, the company had to reach out to the new outlets. "These extremely successful retailers have changed the tapestry of retailing in the U.S.," Mr. Rubenstein, the spokesman, said. "And Warnaco would be remiss not to participate in this phenomenon."
Because most chains do not break down their sales by brand, it is impossible to say with certainty that Mrs. Wachner's actions cost Warnaco any department-store business. But financial results show that while she added sales from J. C. Penney and continued to feed the discount warehouses, Warnaco's revenue took a steep dive last year.
Excluding revenue from companies that it acquired in 1999, most significantly Authentic Fitness, Warnaco said its net revenue declined by $271.4 million, or 13.2 percent, from a year earlier. Sales of Calvin Klein goods shrank by $134.8 million.
In a conference call with stock analysts after filing the company's annual report, Mrs. Wachner blamed a soft retail environment and the loss of major retail customers like Uptons, a unit of the privately owned American Retail Group of Norcross, Ga.; Eatons, a Canadian chain acquired by Sears Canada Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck; and Mercantile, which was bought by Dillard's Inc. (Warnaco also blamed bankruptcies or consolidations at Uptons, Eatons and Mercantile for disappointing sales in 1999 in an amended annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)
While the general retail environment did slow last year, comparative data indicates that Warnaco's troubles ran much deeper than the industry as a whole. Annual sales for intimate apparel in the United States were down in 2000, but only by 0.2 percent across the industry, according to NPD, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.
At one Warnaco competitor, the Sara Lee Corporation, which makes the Wonderbra, sales for intimates and underwear rose 6.2 percent in the nine months ended March 31, 2001. Similarly, the VF Corporation reported that sales of its two main department-store lingerie brands, Vanity Fair and Lily of France, had grown by more than 10 percent each last year. "We think we are taking market share," Cindy Knoebel, a spokeswoman for VF, said.
In its annual report, Warnaco noted that its market share for bras at department and specialty stores, as measured by NPD, had slipped to 35.7 percent in 2000 from 39 percent in 1999. "Our consistent record of share growth dominance is not diminished by a modest decline in year-over-year share," Mr. Silverstein, the general counsel, said.
But if Mrs. Wachner's effort to make sales and earnings numbers meet ever-greater goals hurt the company, they had the opposite effect on her own bottom line.
In 1996, 1997 and 1998, for example, Warnaco's Ebitda fell short of the amount Mrs. Wachner needed to earn a $1.3 million bonus for meeting Ebitda targets. But in each of those years, Warnaco, like many other companies, recorded certain expenses as very large nonrecurring charges. Under the terms of Mrs. Wachner's compensation contract, in the calculation of her bonus, "extraordinary charges" may be excluded from earnings with the approval of the board's compensation committee, Warnaco says. That allowed Mrs. Wachner to take her full bonus in those years.
In 1998, for example, Warnaco's annual report to the S.E.C. said its "adjusted" Ebitda was $384 million, beating its $297.6 million target and earning Mrs. Wachner a $1.3 million bonus. If $197 million in special charges and $55 million in "general corporate expenses" had been stripped out, however, Ebitda would have missed the goal and Mrs. Wachner would not have received her bonus. (Earnings have been so poor since then that she did not get a bonus in 1999 or 2000.)
Investors and securities analysts who have criticized Mrs. Wachner's pay package are suspicious, because nonrecurring and extraordinary charges occurred in 8 of the last 10 years. They also pointed out that these nonrecurring charges included routine apparel-industry business costs like write-downs for excess inventory and costs associated with introducing a new brand or sprucing up an old one.
Warnaco said the charges were all made in accordance with accounting standards and were accepted by its auditors, then PriceWaterhouseCoopers. (In 1999, Warnaco changed auditors to Deloitte & Touche.)
"The actions were taken by the company to rationalize 14 acquisitions and 7 divestitures over the last six years without regard to bonus considerations," Mr. Silverstein said.
Outsiders remained critical of the sum Mrs. Wachner received. "How can anyone justify that pay?" asked Graef Crystal, a well-known executive-compensation expert who is critical of excess pay. Mr. Crystal estimated that since 1993, Mrs. Wachner took home at least $158.5 million in salary, bonus and stock gains from Warnaco and Authentic Fitness. "She treats that company like her personal wallet," he said.
The company said that more than half of that figure, about $87 million, came from stock options, and that the money was reinvested in Warnaco stock.

Friends in High Places
With Warnaco struggling for its life, large investors like Calpers are putting pressure on Warnaco's board to make Mrs. Wachner more accountable or to fire her.
The board includes outsiders like Walter F. Loeb, publisher of a retail industry newsletter bearing his name, and Donald G. Drapkin, a vice chairman of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Ronald Perelman's investment company, as well as insiders like William S. Finkelstein, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Warnaco. But much attention is being directed at two newly appointed directors, Harvey Golub, former chairman of American Express, and Frank A. Olson, chairman of the Hertz Corporation, to see how they might shake up the company.
Joseph A. Califano Jr., a secretary of health, education and welfare under President Jimmy Carter and a Warnaco director since 1993, said in a statement supplied by Mr. Rubenstein that Mrs. Wachner had the "full support of the board of directors and will continue to commit her energy and her talents to leading the company through these challenging times."
Certainly, Mrs. Wachner is not to be counted out easily. In the past, she has used luxurious homes on the Upper East Side and in Southampton to woo powerful friends, like the billionaire Sid R. Bass, who have come to her defense. Over the last year or so, Mr. Bass's Prime 66 Partners bought large volumes of Warnaco stock on the open market, and owns almost 10 percent of the company.
Perhaps more important to Mrs. Wachner's future is her contract, which contains a very golden parachute. If the company fires her, it is obliged by the contract to pay her five times the highest annual salary and bonus that she has ever received; that would mean a parachute of about $44 million. That is more cash than the company has in its accounts, Mr. Crystal said.
In a newspaper interview last year, faced with the perennial question of why turnover was so high at her company, Ms. Wachner said Warnaco had "no room for nonperformance."
This week, through a spokesman, she dismissed the idea that the company's current problems might cause her to resign for nonperformance. "Absolutely not," the spokesman quoted her as saying.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Civil War: All for One and None for You

BYLINE:  By NEAL GABLER; Neal Gabler is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality."

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT last year's presidential campaign, George W. Bush's recurring mantra was bipartisanship. Everywhere the Republican nominee went, he reminded voters of the cooperation he had forged between his Republican gubernatorial administration in Texas and the state's Democrats; and he promised it would be the same in a Bush White House. President Bush picked up the theme again for the flood of coverage marking his 100th day in office, telling one interviewer that he had already effected a "change in attitude" in Washington where, he said, it was no longer a zero-sum game between the parties.
 To his credit, Mr. Bush sensed that the American people were tired of all the political rancor. For more than 30 years, the country had been divided -- first between hawks and doves on Vietnam; then between President Richard M. Nixon's supporters and detractors on Watergate; then between Reaganites and unreconstructed liberals; and for the last eight years between the right wing that had overtaken the Republican Party and Bill Clinton, who said that his biggest puzzlement was the hatred the opposition directed toward him. 
 In the past, Americans had learned to live with political jousting and even appreciate it. After all, politicians always disagree; that is the essence of politics. What made the fractiousness of the last 30 years so disturbing was the depth and venomousness of the disagreement -- though it was part of an increased fractiousness throughout the culture, in everything from intensifying divisions among racial and ethnic groups to television programs like "Crossfire." Everywhere, Americans were yelling at one another. 
Hostility is still a growth industry, but Americans seem less tolerant of incivility after the Clinton impeachment raised it to new levels. Indeed, when he began his appeal to bipartisanship, Mr. Bush may have tapped into a "niceness" offensive that had gradually been creeping across the nation.
You can see it in the way the Motion Picture Academy has its Oscar presenters announce, "And the Oscar goes to . . . " rather than "And the winner is . . . " You can see it in the increasing emphasis in education on the theory of multiple intelligences, which rewards students who might not otherwise be rewarded by the traditional intellectual yardsticks. You can see it in youth sports leagues that regularly give every participant a trophy rather than celebrate winners. You even see it in the exaggerated cruelty of Anne Robinson, the hostess on "The Weakest Link," who serves to ridicule hostility while she exercises it. All these subtly testify to a reduction in the meanness that had been overtaking the country -- a desire to get along again.
In this kinder, gentler nation, Mr. Bush seemed ideally cast as Mr. Congeniality. Part of his appeal is that he, like his father, is a moderator if not exactly a moderate, someone who views politics as a kind of fraternity party where people are expected to get along. He not only campaigned on the notion that the American people want their representatives to put the public weal above petty partisan concerns, he displayed a personal manner, self-effacing and glad-handing, that seemed to prove the importance of personality over politics, of cooperation over strident ideology.
So how does this square with the marked partisanship of his first 100 days, where he left most Democrats out of the budget process, rebuked American allies on the Kyoto treaty and sought to undo many of President Clinton's environmental initiatives? It squares because President Bush's idea of bipartisanship is something far different from, say, the Republican Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg's support of Harry S. Truman's policy of communist containment or the Republican Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirkson's support of Lyndon B. Johnson's Medicare bill. 
This isn't proposed as a means to an end -- say, creating a consensus on policy -- as bipartisanship historically has been. For President Bush, presiding over an America that seems to just want nice, bipartisanship is posited as an end in itself. In effect, this new bipartisanship purports to create a consensus on the importance of creating a consensus, and it is predicated on the notion that the American people are so desirous of a less toxic political tone that they really don't care what the consensus is about.
Seen this way, bipartisanship is less a policy than an aesthetic -- a glow of good cheer to satisfy the desire for comity. But because it is an aesthetic, it doesn't require reconciliation. In its name you can just as easily use the opposition's refusal to surrender to your program as evidence of their refusal to engage in bipartisanship -- the charge Senator William R. Bennett, Republican of Utah, leveled at Democrats in the budget debate. They opposed Mr. Bush's full $1.6 trillion tax cut, he said, only because they wanted to embarrass him. As Mr. Bush's supporters seemed to see it, the Democrats who opposed him should be voted out at the next tribal council for not sacrificing themselves to the common good.
IF this sounds familiar, it should. This sort of bipartisan aesthetic draped over blatant partisanship is the basis of the highly rated television programs "Survivor" and "The Weakest Link." Key to their popularity is that they satisfy both the new niceness and the old competitiveness -- providing the vicarious warmth of community and the vicarious charge of aggression. The subtext of both shows is that while one must ostensibly work for the common good, one does so only to the point where the common good serves one's needs. After that, it is every man for himself.
In a way, President Bush, by managing to be both genial and single-minded, is the first "Survivor" president. He has adapted the "Survivor" techniques to the political arena, talking endlessly about the "new tone" in Washington while advancing his own interests, and he has received generally high marks for doing so. But there is a contradiction here -- as on "Survivor" itself. A unilateral bipartisanship of capitulation is like President Bush's compassionate conservatism or his economic environmentalism. It doesn't gibe. Mr. Bush may not be the "moronic president" that his critics assert, but he is the "oxymoronic president" -- whose partisan actions seem often to belie his benign bipartisan words. 
Even so, the president may have read the public mood correctly in knowing that a smile and handshake are far more important to the American people than political infighting at a time when the entire culture has been riven with conflict. If so, he may be painting the Democrats into the same corner the Republicans painted themselves into when they shut down the government rather than bargain with President Clinton. He can always blame them for not getting along. 
On the other hand, there is the chance people may see through the bipartisan aesthetic no matter how enticing the image of political brotherhood; what works on "Survivor" may be unstable in the political arena. Indeed, the one desire of the public powerful enough to trump the aesthetics of comity may be the desire for something genuine within the never-ending spin. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has built a bipartisan following not just by talking about bipartisanship but by crossing political divides and defying ideological boilerplate. Without that, a bipartisan aesthetic is just politics as usual with a happy face.
Everyone says they want niceness now, but during these first hundred days, the public is still the Kucha and Ogakor tribes on Survivor, and the president is still angling for the prize, flashing a smile while waiting to bare his teeth.

HEADLINE: Tony Blair's Big Idea 

BYLINE:  By Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott; Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, law professors at Yale, are authors of "The Stakeholder Society."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Tony Blair's re-election campaign opens a trans-Atlantic dialogue on the future of equal opportunity. While President Bush pushes for an enormous tax cut, Mr. Blair, the British prime minister, proposes giving the next generation a start toward economic security and independence. 
 Mr. Blair's big idea is to guarantee each child a financial stake. Every infant born in Britain would receive a baby bond worth between $450 and $750, which would mature when he or she reached 18. The Treasury would make additional deposits of $75 to $150 when the child was 5, 11 and 16. Thanks to compound interest, young adults would start life with as much as $7,500, which could be used for a variety of purposes -- from college tuition to buying a home, from starting a business to a rainy-day fund. 
 Mr. Blair's proposal puts real substance into idle talk about a third way between socialism and capitalism, and stands in sharp contrast to President Bush's plan for a large tax cut. Mr. Blair's proposal affirms the values of private property, personal responsibility and economic freedom while also giving all young adults, not just the lucky few with rich parents, a chance to take charge of their lives.
President Bush's commitment to leave no child behind is fine, but not enough to equip adults for freedom -- especially those Americans who don't go to college. University students get enormous subsidies, but they are not in the majority. The rest of America needs cash in the bank to withstand economic shocks and gain economic self-confidence.
The stakeholding idea has a rich history. In 1797, Tom Paine argued that all new democratic republics should guarantee each 21-year-old citizen a grant equivalent to 15 pounds. Over the last decade, academics and politicians have looked again at stakeholding. Moderate Democrats have proposed government-funded children's savings accounts. And this year, the Bush administration even included a small amount in its budget for individual development accounts, which help the poor build assets. But Tony Blair is the first major world leader to put stakeholding where it belongs -- at the top of the list of political priorities.
What if Mr. Bush had approached his budget in the same spirit as Mr. Blair? Suppose the president had dedicated $1.35 trillion over 10 years, not to a tax cut, but to a baby-bond plan. That sum would finance an annual bond program of $135 billion, giving each of the four million babies born in America each year a bond of almost $34,000. With interest, these bonds would (conservatively) yield $50,000 when they matured.
The Blair government is considering whether to restrict the money's use to ensure responsible spending. We suggest that an American program should instead give full control only to high-school graduates.
We believe that a nation committed to equal opportunity can make a sizeable commitment to its young citizens. But if these numbers seem outsize, consider what even a portion of the tax-cut dollars could mean for an American-style baby bond. With these bonds, the adults of the next generation would start off with a stake in America and take their rightful place as members of a property-holding democracy.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Texan Finds That Pay Phones Can Pay Off

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Wireless phones do not frighten Charlie Sullivan. He has one himself and talks on it all day long while he drives around Texas seeking new places to put pay phones. He has 1,375 of those.
 Lots of people say wireless phones ought to scare Mr. Sullivan, president of ComChoice, a privately owned pay phone company based in Canyon Lake, in central Texas, about midway between San Antonio and Austin. But Mr. Sullivan intends to belie the widespread notion that cell phones are pushing pay phones off the American landscape. 
 The common wisdom has been spread by some of the largest pay phone companies, including Verizon, which tell their shareholders that wireless growth has undercut their pay phone operations. Wall Street analysts use the same reasoning to underscore the inexorable strength of wireless stocks. Even a trade group representing 1,450 independent pay phone companies like ComChoice perpetuates the idea, in pleading for government regulations more favorable to its members. Charitable organizations also raise the alarm, warning that homeless people will soon have no place to make phone calls. 
In defiance of the myth of the vanishing pay phone, Mr. Sullivan is competing with the large phone companies by putting his telephones in places where other telephones, including wireless ones, are scarce and where people tend to make calls using coins instead of credit cards -- something that lets his company collect more of the money directly. 
His favorite locations include low-income neighborhoods like the south side of San Antonio near South New Braunfels Avenue, and buildings maintained by the Del Rio public housing authority. He has secured various spots throughout the border city of Laredo. He also likes highway convenience stores and truck stops, where he can snag the mobile who may have no mobile phones. 
Operating 900 to 1,000 pay phones last year, ComChoice had revenue of just over $1.2 million, with an operating profit of $139,000, according to Mr. Sullivan.
"This whole idea that cell phone technology has killed the pay phone business is really not the case," Mr. Sullivan said. 
Industry data would seem to support his point. Since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which ordered the Federal Communications Commission to encourage competition in the pay phone industry and ensure that phones are available in low-income areas, the number of wireless subscribers has grown by 189 percent, to more than 110 million, according to the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, a trade group. And yet, since 1997, the total number of pay phones has held steady around 2.1 million, according to the National Payphone Clearinghouse, which coordinates payments from long-distance companies. 
BellSouth cited wireless phones as a factor when it said in February that it would abandon the pay phone business whether or not the company could find a buyer for the 143,000 phones it owns in nine Southeastern states. Indicating that use of pay phones had fallen sharply, BellSouth said it would leave the pay phone business by the end of 2002 and focus on broadband communications, wireless telephones and interactive pagers. BellSouth has recently combined its wireless business with that of another regional Bell, SBC Communications, to create a new wireless company, Cingular. 
SBC, which has a 60 percent stake in Cingular, is also the owner of Southwestern Bell, the local telephone monopoly in Texas, Oklahoma and three other contiguous states. And even if BellSouth is no longer interested in the pay phone business, Southwestern Bell has shown every sign of staying in the game. In fact, gas station by gas station, street corner by street corner, Southwestern Bell is competing with Charlie Sullivan.
"Southwestern Bell considers the pay phone business to be very competitive," said Joe Izbrand, a spokesman for SBC. "We continue to view it as a viable part of our business."
Mr. Sullivan's competition with Southwestern Bell has been fierce, not only in the market but in court. Twice he has been party to class-action lawsuits against Southwestern Bell, accusing it of using predatory practices and subterfuge to maintain its hold on the pay phone business in Oklahoma and Texas.
Mr. Sullivan's involvement in the business began in 1991, when he founded Payphone Providers Inc. in Texas, seven years after many state public utility commissions took part in the breakup of the Bell system by allowing private ownership of pay phones. 
From a mere four phones initially, his business gradually grew. And for years the main antagonists of him and other pay phone operators were the long-distance companies, whose 1-800 and calling-card calls the pay phone providers are required by law to carry -- even though payment typically awaited an often complicated and protracted process with the various carriers that might be involved in any one call. In the third quarter of last year, Mr. Sullivan said, he received $78,000 in compensation for such calls but was unable to collect an additional $117,000 he said he was owed.
Pay phone owners won a significant victory earlier this year, however, when the F.C.C. ruled that the first long-distance carrier that picks up any call not involving coins -- usually a well-known outfit like Qwest or AT&T -- is the company automatically responsible for compensating the pay phone operator. 
"Now that we can track it back to one carrier, that's going to change the economics of this business big time," Mr. Sullivan said.
By 1995, Mr. Sullivan's business owned 350 phones. From each, he grossed an average of $120 a month from coin calls and $75 from operator-assisted calls. But his partners were squabbling, so Payphone Providers sold out to another independent pay phone company in Texas.
The next year, the Telecommunications Act elicited a frenzy of activity from pay phone operators. The law barred the Bell companies from discriminating in favor of their own pay phone services and from subsidizing their pay phone operations through revenue from local telephone customers. 
With 10 partners, Mr. Sullivan formed Coin Link L.L.C. and joined a land rush to the north, where the Oklahoma Corporation Commission had become one of the last state utility commissions to allow pay phone competition. Coin Link set up some 700 phones at a cost of about $1,500 apiece. But Southwestern Bell's longstanding monopoly was a force to reckon with. 
"They literally had a pay phone everywhere a pay phone could possibly be needed, paid for by the rate payers," Mr. Sullivan said. After losing about $200,000 a year, Coin Link sold its phones to various other independent operators for $2,000 to $3,000 each in 1998. By that time, Mr. Sullivan had already turned his attention back to Texas, starting ComChoice in 1997 and buying 535 phones from a company in Houston.
But Coin Link had not completely given up on Oklahoma. There, it and eight other companies had sued Southwestern Bell, accusing it of violating state and federal antitrust laws by saturating the market and using restrictive long-term contracts and other measures to deter competition.
In its defense, Southwestern Bell argued that it was easy to enter the pay phone market in Oklahoma, that more than 50 competitors had done so and in fact were winning away some of the most profitable locations. But last May, the jury in the case ordered Southwestern Bell to pay more than $7.4 million, an amount later trebled by the state. Southwestern Bell has filed to appeal the decision. 
In Texas, meanwhile, a group of plaintiffs including Mr. Sullivan has made similar antitrust accusations against Southwestern Bell. In a state court in Johnson County, near Dallas, the plaintiffs contend that Southwestern Bell used unfair tactics to secure long-term pay phone contracts with property owners and destroyed the concrete pads left behind when property owners tried to switch pay phone companies.
"We strongly deny the allegations and intend to vigorously defend our position," said Mr. Izbrand, the SBC spokesman. Southwestern Bell recently made its formal denial in a court filing.
As the lawsuits progress, Mr. Sullivan keeps looking for profitable places to put pay phones. 
These days, in a good month, his phones gross $161 apiece on average: $107 in change, $22 from the operator-assisted calls and $32 from the various other coinless calls. Convenience stores with gas pumps in poor neighborhoods do well. And Mr. Sullivan just recently won the bidding in Austin for a prime spot on Cesar Chavez Street, which a lot of folks still call East First Street.
"Everybody keeps going back to this thing that all of our business is being lost to cell phones," Mr. Sullivan said. "That's simply not true. But it's pushing everybody to fight for these good locations."

HEADLINE: Stay-at-Home Instinct Fosters Flush Times At 'Shelter' Magazines 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Before Marian McEvoy arrived with her trademark stiletto heels and red lipstick to take over as editor in chief of House Beautiful, the interior design magazine, the featured cover lines were often the likes of "Classics With a Twist." Photo spreads eschewed people in favor of table legs and draperies, and articles in the 105-year-old magazine focused on practical decorating matters. 
 As of February, Ms. McEvoy's House Beautiful began to feature headlines like "Exotic Romance" and articles about apartments for "budding rock stars." Actual human beings -- even celebrities -- scampered through the photo spreads with naked infants and posed barefoot on the cover. Paint hues were described with phrases like "the color equivalents of deep, long kisses." 
 "The category has loosened up a lot," Ms. McEvoy, the former editor of Elle Decor, said in her Hearst Magazines office. "It's cool to decorate. Retail stores like Crate and Barrel and Ikea have opened middle America's imagination." 
Ms. McEvoy pursed her lips, as glossed and red as an antique Ming Dynasty lacquer cabinet, and confided an important point. 
"Look, even guys don't think it's sissy any more to think about what kind of sheets they sleep on," she said.
The magazine world, hard hit by the economic downturn, is worried about disappearing advertising, but magazines about interior decorating -- known in the magazine industry as shelter magazines -- are thriving, a testament to their skill at evoking fantasy and enticing advertisers.
And whether you think the magazines are sissy or not, their field is among the most swiftly changing in the magazine industry and is bitterly -- even nastily -- competitive. Over the last 10 months, a domino effect has toppled editors at all of the major shelter magazines. Others are scrambling for their jobs, have resigned and taken coveted projects and staff members with them or remain locked in Oedipal struggles with former mentors.
All of this dynamism comes at a time when there are more shelter magazines than ever before, from Architectural Digest, with its celebrity fantasies, to small-circulation magazines as eclectic as Nest, which has featured articles about how prison inmates decorate their cells and how some sexual fetishists dress in diapers and decorate their homes with adult-size cribs and strollers. 
Architectural Digest, at 81 years old, is considered by most of the industry to be at the top of the heap. Because it has a relatively small staff and generates as much advertising as Vanity Fair, it is one of the most profitable magazines at Advance Publications' Conde Nast. House & Garden, apart from a two-year hiatus, is 100 this year, and combines high- and low-brow sensibilities -- the Baccarat and Crate and Barrel aesthetic, according to its editor. House Beautiful, 105, has long been considered the middle-brow read for middle America, but Ms. McEvoy -- is bringing it to a much more sophisticated level. And Homestyle -- a magazine hemorrhaging money from its parent company, Gruner & Jahr -- has also hired a new editor from House & Garden to make it less about chicken recipes and more about Chippendale, less franks-and-beans and more Frank Lloyd Wright. 
"There are so many shelter magazines now, and they're all struggling to get their piece of the American audience," said Jeffrey Bilhuber, an interior decorator whose clients include Peter Jennings and David Bowie. "I call it bohemians at the gate." 
One reason there are so many magazines is that those interior design-obsessed bohemians buy a lot, no matter what the economy is up to. The advertisers that appears in most shelter magazines -- food, furniture, pharmaceuticals -- are part of categories that do not go away during a depressed market, so they are generally considered recession-proof by publishers. For example, home furnishings advertisers have spent $236 million advertising in magazines this year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, an increase of 11.4 percent.
"What do you do when you don't have money?" Ms. McEvoy said. "You stay home. You look at the dining room chairs. You notice they're dingy. You think about paint." 
Valerie Muller, senior vice president and director for print services at MediaCom in New York, the media agency owned by the Grey Global Group, said Americans are thinking more about their homes than in previous decades.
"It's that whole feng shui, simplify your life, beautify your home thing," Ms. Muller said. "Advertisers love that environment." 
And advertising pages and revenue at most of the shelter magazines are up. At a time when ad pages for the magazine industry over all are down 6.9 percent for the year to date, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, Architectural Digest's pages are up 12 percent; Elle Decor's, 8 percent; House & Garden's, 6 percent; and Homestyle's, 7 percent. Last November, The New York Times Magazine introduced a special Style & Entertaining magazine, published twice a year, to capture the overflow of advertising in the special Home Design issues, also published twice a year.
The continued success of the shelter magazines may have something to do with the fact that like fashion magazines they are mostly about fantasy. Even in a magazine that purports to offer practical decorating solutions, like Hearst's House Beautiful, there are lavish photo spreads of impossibly tidy and luxurious rooms the likes of which most Americans will never set foot in, let alone be able to afford to decorate. The half-acre of Brunschwig & Fils fabric decorating the bedroom of Gayfryd and Saul Steinberg's Long Island bedroom -- featured in House Beautiful -- cost at least as much as most Americans make in a year.
David Brooks, the author of "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There" (Simon & Schuster, 2000), said the shelter magazines are about the American yearning for utopia. 
"They are about the desire to build a perfect world," he said. "They are totally unrelated to the lives anybody leads. No one is that neat. And no one has that much carefully arranged bric-a-brac."
Of course, whose version of utopia is better is the subject of much speculation among decorators and editors. Some interior decorators and architects complain that the magazines are all, in the uniform quest for high-end sophistication, becoming indistinguishable from one another -- with the exception of Architectural Digest. 
Lee F. Mindel, of the design firm Shelton, Mindel & Associates, said: "There are so many of them now, they cancel each other out. They are so superficial that most of them have just become about fashion. It's a hemline mentality. Pink is back. Beige is the new black. Traditional is back. More is more. Less is more. Less is less. So then you get a pack mentality. It's boring." 
One reason the magazines may resemble one another is that there is such a small and slightly inbred pool of editors qualified to run them. So when Ms. McEvoy left Elle Decor, her longtime deputy, Margaret Russell, took over. When Homestyle needed a new editor, it took Dominique Browning's longtime deputy at House & Garden, Suzanne Slesin. Ms. Slesin's remade magazine is supposed to go head to head with House Beautiful and her former employer, House & Garden. 
Mr. Bilhuber, the decorator, described it as "a merry-go-round of editrixes." 
In the last five years, magazine companies have started a host of new, smaller shelter magazines, making the competition for ad dollars more intense than ever before. Readers suspicious of cozy arrangements have long questioned whether the relationship between the editorial content of the magazines is too closely linked to advertisers' desires.
"No one will come out and say it," said Martin S. Walker, a consultant to the magazine industry. "But it has been happening since time immemorial." 
Two years ago, This Old House -- published by Time Inc. -- included in several issues an editorial insert poster that read at the bottom, "This poster is brought to you by Ace Hardware, the source for all your hardware needs." The magazine was stripped of a nomination for a National Magazine Award because of the use of an advertisers' logo on an editorial page. At the time, the president of the magazine explained that because Ace was a major sponsor of the magazine's companion television show, he felt that it deserved special treatment.
For almost two decades, Architectural Digest has had a policy of mentioning only advertisers in the magazine's captions, said Robert Pini, a spokesman for the magazine.
And at Elle Decor, Ms. Russell said she fends advertisers off daily. "You have to be very careful," she said. "Advertisers ask me for editorial coverage all the time. I get dozens of e-mails every day." Ms. Russell said that she always reminds advertisers that legitimate magazines do not have to resort to anything that looks like editorial payola. 
There have been instances of ethical tinkering at other magazines. In 1997, Home magazine, published by the Lagardere unit Hachette Filipacchi, featured a three-page editorial spread about painting a cottage in New Orleans and mentioned Benjamin Moore paints a dozen times. Benjamin Moore, an advertiser, had provided both the paint and the photographs on the spread for the magazine. The Wall Street Journal reported the incident, and the editor, Gail Steves, acknowledged that it was a joint project and said, "It's as much their story as it is ours." 
Ms. Browning at House & Garden said editorial and advertising remain separate at her magazines but explained what often seems like overly nice treatment to advertisers. "There's not really a hard-hitting investigative way to look at interior design," she said. "Would we write about decorators who overcharge? Maybe. Would we write a story about why a teacup costs $150? Sure." 
Ms. Browning also added that readers of shelter magazines tend to read the advertisements as avidly as they do the editorial matter, so their expectations of dirt-digging are fairly low. 
Mr. Brooks said that no matter how fantastical they may be, there will always be a market for the shelter books.
"One of my rules is that shallow people are greedy for money, and that profound people are greedy for real estate," Mr. Brooks said. He said that he had spoken to builders who reported that clients arrive at their architecture office with large boxes of pages ripped from the shelter magazines over the years. 
"Affluent people invest years in renovating their homes," he said. "They don't go to war. They renovate. It is the major psychological trauma of their lives, and they need guidance. There will always be a market for that kind of therapy."

HEADLINE: Contract Talks With Actors Move to Front 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 6 

 BODY:
When William Daniels was running for president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1999, he liked to do his interviews at Art's Delicatessen in Studio City, "where every sandwich is a work of Art," surrounded by some of the insurgents who helped him unseat the previous union leadership.
 Although always earnest and intense, Mr. Daniels grew most voluble when the subject turned to longtime actors who were paid basic scale for guest appearances on television programs or supporting roles in films. 
 What was happening, Mr. Daniels said, was that as many Hollywood studios and networks became corporate cogs in huge media conglomerates and pressure to cut costs intensified, producers were spending through the roof to get top-name lead actors while nickel-and-diming everyone else, including the supporting performers. 
"It's a real shame, an outrage," Mr. Daniels said at the time. "And I hope we're able to do something about it."
Now is his chance.
When the Writers Guild of America settled late last week on a tentative three-year contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a coalition representing the major studios and networks, attention shifted to the coming talks on a new contract covering the 135,000 actors represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
Gone is the threat of dual strikes this summer by writers and actors -- assuming that, as expected, the 11,000 members of the writers' union vote to approve the tentative pact -- but still hanging out there is a potential strike by actors that could shut down film production as well as the making of such scripted television programs as sit-coms, hourlong dramas and made-for-television movies.
The actors' contract with the production companies expires at midnight on June 30, and talks have yet to begin. 
Union officials said they had wanted to give the writers' union time to settle its talks, and it was only a couple of weeks ago that the leaders of the huge and fractious actors' union agreed on their goals in this year's talks, which are expected to begin in the next 10 days.
The consensus over the weekend was that the settlement by the writers' union -- which had seemed more militant and outspoken than the actors going into this year's round of talks -- helped make it much less likely that there would be any Hollywood strike this summer. 
One official with another Hollywood union said that with the settlement by writers, "the odds of there being an actors' strike now have fallen to under 20 percent."
Neil Begley, an analyst for Moody's Investors Service, argued that unlike the writers' union, which had not been on strike since 1988, the Screen Actors Guild was coming off a bruising five-month strike last year for a contract covering work in commercials and might be less eager to hit the streets again. 
At the same time, Mr. Daniels and other union leaders have gone out of their way to quiet talk of a strike and to stress their belief that an agreement is possible. And with the settlement by writers in place, many of its provisions could be used in cobbling together a contract for actors.
News of the settlement by writers was greeted with something close to ecstasy throughout Hollywood, which had been almost frantic over the prospect of dual strikes this summer. Indeed, the entire country seemed to respond to the upbeat mood. The first of the big summer popcorn movies, "The Mummy Returns," opened on Friday, the same day the writers settled, and estimates today had it earning $70.1 million this weekend, the largest three-day opening ever for a movie on a nonholiday weekend, beating the $64.9 million earned in 1998 by "Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace."
The economic portion of the tentative pact -- the only part that would have any correlation to an agreement for actors -- included a 3.5 percent increase in basic minimums plus a roster of improvements in a variety of formulas used to calculate payments for the use of film and television programs after their initial release, or residuals. Most significant seemed to be the removal of a cap on residuals for the sale of programs in foreign markets, which was expected to increase residuals for writers by $1.3 million over the life of the contract.
Mr. Daniels and other officials for the actors' union -- including Brian Walton, the chief negotiator, who had held a similar position for the writers until he was ousted two years ago -- declined to be interviewed in advance of the opening of their negotiations. Instead, they issued a statement congratulating the writers' union for its "careful effort to come to a new agreement without a work stoppage." 
Still, there may have been a hint of irritation in the statement at the frequently cited implication that the settlement by writers on matters like residual payments could simply be transplanted to a contract for actors. 
Mr. Daniels and other SAG officials said they would be spending the next several days studying the writers' deal "to see if it will be helpful in finding a way to address the specific needs of actors in our upcoming negotiations."
In other words, while there may be some crossover, the concerns of actors do not entirely match those of writers.
"Everybody is telling us that the writers' agreement is template for us, but we're trying to back away from that somewhat," said Greg Krizman, the chief spokesman for the actors.
Some feel there is also a danger in letting the euphoria over a settlement by writers distract from the potential danger of a walkout by actors. While it would have taken several months of a strike by writers before the impact would have been felt in the entertainment industry, a walkout by actors has the potential of shutting down business from Day 1.
And it is worth remembering, many caution, that the SAG leadership came to power by promising to take a tougher line with the production companies, much like the leaders of the writers' guild. Mr. Daniels and the union leaders may feel the need to address issues like diminishing pay for journeymen performers.
Also, the actors' union is a notoriously recalcitrant and fractious group. The bitter election two years ago that allowed Mr. Daniels and his supporters to oust the previous regime, headed by the actor Richard Masur, is still sending waves through the union. For example, it took the union much longer than many anticipated to hire Mr. Walton as its chief negotiator and to assemble its list of demands.
Still, on the positive side, the actors' union has by all reports assembled a roster of demands that is shorter and more focused than in previous talks, when negotiations sometimes bogged down on discussions of relatively minor work rules.
"The key question, if there is an actors' strike, which doesn't seem likely, is whether the union will decide to throw up picket lines," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Development Corporation. "If they do strike and they do throw up picket lines and try to disrupt activity, the end result would be the same sort of shutdown that everyone has been fearing."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Power's New Day 

BYLINE:  By Richard Rhodes; Richard Rhodes is the author of "Nuclear Renewal" and "The Making of the Atomic Bomb."

DATELINE: MADISON, Conn. 

 BODY:
Technologies are born, grow, thrive and decline, much as living organisms do. That should not be surprising. Since they derive from human knowledge, their effective application must be learned, and they compete for social and economic territory.
 Nuclear power, a product of naval propulsion research, emerged in the United States in the 1950's. Its first use as a commercial energy source came about because it had obvious benefits for pollution control. A Pennsylvania utility, Duquesne Light, built the first commercial nuclear power reactor at Shippingport, Pa., in 1954. The utility had planned to build a coal-fired power plant. When the public objected to further smoke pollution around smoky Pittsburgh, Duquesne switched to nuclear power. 
 Public acceptance of a new technology is essential to its growth. Nuclear power, associated in the public's mind with nuclear weapons, was probably commercialized prematurely, while its complexities were still being worked out. Its environmental benefits were not fully appreciated in the early decades because air pollution was abating under government regulation in the 1960's and 1970's, and global warming had not yet emerged as the ultimate environmental challenge. When conservation slowed electricity demand after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and 1974, utilities canceled orders for new power plants, both nuclear and coal. Almost all new plants built since then have been fueled with natural gas. 
But the population of the United States is growing, adding the equivalent of one California every 10 years. Demand has caught up with supply even with significant improvements in energy efficiency and conservation, and the United States has become the world's leading greenhouse gas emitter. These factors make a renewal of nuclear power likely.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has begun carefully extending licenses for existing reactors for an additional 20 years; eventually all 104 operating United States power reactors will probably be relicensed. Since they produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases, that's good news. The nuclear industry is consolidating, focusing experience and expertise. Several reactors that have been shut down will probably be restored to operation. Several others that were left unfinished when demand slowed will probably be completed. Two or three new advanced light-water reactors, designs the N.R.C. has already pre-licensed, will probably be built at sites that already have construction permits. One company, Exelon, is considering seeking licensing of a simpler reactor, designed so that it cannot melt down, that uses a bed of billiard-ball-sized "pebbles" of compacted uranium oxide and graphite as its fuel and helium as its coolant and working fluid, passing the fission-heated helium directly into a turbine to generate electricity even more cheaply than burning natural gas. If the pebble-bed modular reactor wins approval from the N.R.C., other utilities may decide to use this technology as well.
Americans are beginning to understand one of the unique benefits of nuclear technology. A majority now say they approve of nuclear power, a shift that appears to indicate awareness that nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases that lead to global warming. There is less evidence of public understanding of radiation and nuclear waste. Antinuclear activism began in the 1960's with concerns about the disposal of nuclear waste, and disposal continues to be the nuclear industry's Number 1 public-relations problem.
The disposal debate is likely to move to center stage later this year, when the scientists and engineers evaluating Yucca Mountain, north of Las Vegas, as a possible permanent waste repository expect to deliver their final report.
All energy technologies produce waste. Burning fossil fuels -- even relatively clean fuel like natural gas -- generates waste that cannot be contained within the power plant, as nuclear waste is, but must be released into the environment as air pollution and toxic waste. In the case of coal, burning releases ash that is mildly radioactive, because radioactive uranium and thorium are ubiquitous in the earth's crust, including coal seams. Even renewable technologies like wind power and solar photovoltaics produce waste: manufacturing the materials for the multitude of collectors necessary to gather up such diffuse sources as wind and sunlight requires burning fossil fuels. Thus wind or solar power systems release far more greenhouse gases across their life cycles than does a nuclear system of equivalent output.
The great advantage of nuclear power is its ability to wrest enormous energy from a small volume of fuel. One metric ton of nuclear fuel produces energy equivalent to two million to three million tons of fossil fuel. Waste volumes are comparably scaled: fossil fuel systems generate hundreds of thousands of metric tons of gaseous, particulate and solid wastes, but nuclear systems produce less than 1,000 metric tons of high- and low-level waste per plant per year. The high-level waste is intensely radioactive at first, but its small volume means it can be and is effectively isolated and contained. When a nuclear plant is dismantled (few have been so far), the several hundred thousand tons of concrete, which is mildly radioactive, is buried in the same sort of commercial waste site used for radioactive medical and industrial wastes.
Spent nuclear fuel loses radioactivity steadily; after 500 years it is no more radioactive than high-grade uranium ore. The risk of radioactive waste's seeping past multiple barriers would be small compared to health risks posed by air pollution from burning fossil fuels, which the World Health Organization estimates causes three million deaths a year, with 15,000 deaths annually in the United States from coal particulates alone. Substituting small, sequestered volumes of nuclear waste for vast, dispersed volumes of toxic wastes from fossil fuels could provide an enormous improvement in public health.
The other risk that nuclear power supposedly raises is nuclear proliferation. In fact, no nation has developed nuclear weapons using plutonium from spent power reactor fuel. It's much easier to make weapons from plutonium bred specifically for that purpose. Inspection and proper accounting and control of nuclear materials are the answer to proliferation, not limits to nuclear power.
France once burned coal; that nation's electricity is now 80 percent nuclear, with five times less air pollution and with carbon dioxide emissions 10 times lower than Germany's and 13 times lower than Denmark's. At a conference recently in Japan (another nuclear leader, with 36 percent nuclear electricity), French nuclear industry executive Anne Lanvergeon proposed improving the debate about nuclear power by creating an authoritative world database that would assess the advantages and disadvantages of each type of energy in terms of use of resources and economic, environmental and health impact. Measured against other energy sources, nuclear power would emerge at the top of such a list.
Energy needs in the United States will grow in the coming decades, even with improved efficiency and more strenuous conservation. Nuclear energy needs to be a major component of our energy supply if we hope both to reduce air pollution and limit global warming.

HEADLINE: South Korea's Conservative Press Takes Heat From the Liberals 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Monday, May 7 

 BODY:
The chief editorial writer at Hankyoreh, a liberal voice among South Korea's largely conservative newspapers ever since its founding in 1988, pointed to the 62,000 names on bronze tablets in the lobby of the paper's cramped concrete building.
 "The government did not want us purged journalists to have a new newspaper," said the writer, Jung Yun Joo. "We did not have enough capital. We were all poor. These 62,000 Koreans contributed the money to start this newspaper. All their names are here." 
 The paper was born soon after demonstrations forced a military government to agree to presidential elections, and it has been biting and irreverent ever since. It supported the antigovernment politician Kim Dae Jung in the 1987 and 1992 elections and in his successful campaign in 1997, at the depth of South Korea's economic crisis.
But now a new battle is under way between the government and the press, with an odd twist. This time critics say the government is trying to stop the big three papers from criticizing the liberal Mr. Kim, whose popularity is waning under their attacks.
Ostensibly, all the country's 23 news media companies were at one stage under investigation for possible violations of tax and fair trade laws, but executives of the three biggest-selling papers -- Chosun Ilbo, JoongAng Ilbo and Dong A Ilbo -- say they are being singled out.
Chosun Ilbo, circulation about 2.1 million, JoongAng Ilbo, with a circulation of two million, and Dong A Ilbo, with 1.8 million, control about 70 percent of newspaper sales in Korea and provide more news than rivals like Hankyoreh, whose 400,000 readers buy that paper mainly for its viewpoint.
"The motivation behind this investigation," said Kim Young Hie, vice president of JoongAng Ilbo, "is to muzzle the big-three papers, because they are critical of the president and his policies."
As a precedent, he cited the jailing in 1999 of Hong Seok Hyun, publisher of JoongAng Ilbo. He was held for two months, fined $2.65 million and ordered to pay $9 million in back taxes on charges of having evaded taxes against a separate company he controls with other family members.
"Of course, the arrest of Mr. Hong was an effort at suppressing criticism," said Mr. Kim, formerly the paper's Washington correspondent.
The government recently extended the deadline on the tax investigation of the three leading papers from today until June 19, a move that many people suspect shows its determination to find evidence to bring charges. "It is all part of an attempt to suppress the press," said Chosun Ilbo in an editorial published today, charging tax officials with "engaging in an abusive and politically motivated investigation."
At the same time, the government's fair trade commission has drawn up a list of numerous violations of the fair trade act by the top three papers and has said it would impose penalties. 
The list includes the printing of hundreds of thousands of extra copies as a way to inflate circulation figures and raise advertising prices, forcing newsdealers to take more copies than they can sell and asking suppliers of newsprint to donate gifts for company-sponsored events.
The extent of the inquiries raises questions among many people, not just those in charge of the papers.
"Legally the papers are subject to investigation, but some people may suspect the intention," said Yu Jae Cheon, vice president of Hallym University, who has written extensively on the press. "Even the reporters are being investigated."
Certainly the government has reason to be angry at the papers.
The big three have been criticizing Kim Dae Jung for failing to resolve economic problems while compromising with North Korea in his efforts at reconciliation.
"What we have today is a government that listens to no one while ruling out of arrogance, self-righteousness and an 'imperial' mindset," Chosun Ilbo fulminated in a recent editorial. 
Whatever the results of the investigation, the paper clearly believes that it has a majority of Koreans on its side. "Popular sentiment was so unsettled late last year," it editorialized, that Mr. Kim "had to be very careful about leaving the country to accept the Nobel Peace Prize" -- a reminder of potentially dangerous discontent at home. 
Government officials deny any relationship between the investigations and Kim Dae Jung's observation on the need for "media reform" at a news conference in January.
The president "understands there's an opinion about media reform," said Sung Chang Ki, director general of the Korean Information Service. "But the current tax investigation is part of a regular and routine audit."
Kim Dae Choong, editor in chief of Chosun Ilbo, denounced such claims as nonsense.
At Hankyoreh, Jung Yun Joo worried that Mr. Kim's concern for his legacy would keep him from cracking down hard. The big papers, he said, "are more than kings; they are emperors. They should apologize for their sins." 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 7 about a South Korean tax investigation of several conservative newspaper companies referred incompletely to the history of one reformist newspaper, Han kroyeh. It was organized in 1987 and has long espoused the views of President Kim Dae Jung. But it did not begin publication until the next year and so did not support Mr. Kim in the election of 1987.

HEADLINE: San Jose Journal; 
Filming Another Side of Silicon Valley

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., May 5 

 BODY:
In the old days of the New Economy say, one long year ago -- the only story in Silicon Valley was about all that money.
 The legends of the high-tech boom were paper millionaires yet to reach their 30's, start-up companies financed by more venture capital than they knew what to do with (open-bar parties were common in those days) and houses for sale with 30 bidders offering six figures over the asking price. 
 But Deborah Kaufman and Alan Snitow, filmmakers from Berkeley, were determined to document the other side of that life. They knew people who rode buses all night because they could not afford housing, and who scraped by working in plants for some of the wealthiest corporations in the world. 
Ms. Kaufman and Mr. Snitow, who had produced one documentary, "Blacks and Jews," delved into the unglamorous side of the Valley, the people struggling to get by.
Their timing was impeccable. With laid-off dot-comers re-evaluating their short stints as masters of the world, forming support groups and going back to school to be teachers, a documentary about the dark side of the valley has struck a nerve.
"Secrets of Silicon Valley," shot on videotape for $300,000, is a hit.
The film, which focuses on a young temporary worker at a San Jose plant that assembles and packages Hewlett-Packard printers and on the director of a nonprofit computer training center in East Palo Alto, the poorest town in the richest region in the country, played to sold-out audiences in its limited release in three independent theaters in the Bay Area. 
And to the surprise of the filmmakers, who conceived of "Secrets" with schools and perhaps public television in mind, the film on Friday began a run at a commercial triplex, the Towne Theater here in San Jose, the unofficial capital of Silicon Valley.
Ron Regalia, the advertising director for the Towne, said the 60-minute film sold out the three days it played in the theater last month, and interest was so high that people kept calling and sending e-mail to ask whether it would play again. 
Ms. Kaufman, the founding director of the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, and Mr. Snitow, a former news producer for the Bay Area Fox station, are delighted. The talk about the film, which appears to appeal to dot-comers as well as to those who were left out of the boom, is catching the attention of distributors in New York, the Midwest and New England. 
"We really wanted the film to get people thinking and talking about the downside of the New Economy," Ms. Kaufman said, "so it's great that the film has the chance to reach the broadest audience possible."
The film chronicles a year in the life of Magda Escobar, the director of Plugged In, a community organization designed to acquaint unskilled poor people, mostly local members of minorities, with the digital world, and Raj Jayadev, an activist who takes a job packaging Hewlett-Packard printers as a temporary worker with Manpower Services Inc. 
Ms. Escobar's story begins with Plugged In winning the Sandhill Challenge, a soapbox derby for charity that Silicon Valley venture capitalists take as seriously as the World Series. The film follows the eviction of Plugged In from its building to make way for a shopping mall, and a visit from President Bill Clinton and Jesse Jackson last year. 
Mr. Jayadev's story, which uses stock footage of the plant because Hewlett-Packard would not allow the filmmakers inside, shows his efforts to organize workers to call attention to ergonomic hazards and concerns that paychecks may have been shortchanged. 
Ms. Escobar, who is still trying to raise money for a new headquarters for Plugged In -- Hewlett-Packard is one of its sponsors -- sounded relieved about the film. "When people are making documentaries, you're not exactly sure what the perspective might be," she said. "It was kind of cool to see it."
Mr. Jayadev, who runs a collective called De-bug to organize temporary workers, was equally pleased. 
"I'm happy that the film is getting looked at by a lot of people," he said, "because I think it's important to show all aspects of the New Economy."
Outside the Towne Theater on Friday night, people waiting to see the film said much the same thing. "The media never focused on the other side of the equation," said Bill Ferguson, who works at a job training center. 
Those who have seen the film have said the protagonists have star potential. "I loved his line about how we should think about how machines just don't materialize -- how they come from human hands," said Sheila MacMurray, a part-time liberal arts student at San Jose State University, referring to Mr. Jayadev. "He seems like a real leader for the post-New Economy."

HEADLINE: Montanans Weigh Options on a Toxic Legacy 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONNER, Mont. 

 BODY:
Tumbling over boulders and winding through the red rock canyons and grassy meadows of western Montana, the Clark Fork appears to be a classic Western river. 
 But the Clark Fork has a checkered past. Its beauty hides the fact that along most of its 120 miles in Montana it is contaminated with more than a century's worth of cadmium, arsenic, copper and other toxic mine waste that has washed down from the hard rock mining that began in 1864 at Butte. 
 The last stop for the mine waste since 1907 has been here, behind the Milltown Dam, creating a huge pile of toxic sludge, six miles upstream from Missoula, a college town known as the Garden City. 
In the next few months, the Environmental Protection Agency will decide the fate of this river full of heavy metals.
"I can't see how anyone would think you could just leave 6.5 million cubic yards of toxic waste," said Tracy Stone-Manning, executive director of the Clark Fork Coalition, an environmental group. "The only solution is to get it out." 
But for ARCO, the oil company that bought Anaconda Copper Mining in 1977, only to find that it had inherited an expensive mess that is one of the largest Superfund sites in the nation, the only economical solution is to let sleeping dogs lie. 
"People in favor of removal grossly underestimate the problem of removal," said Sandy Stash, a vice president at ARCO, now part of British Petroleum, and the head of the cleanup. "You will do more harm than good." The removal of sediment, by ARCO estimates, would cost at least $100 million, take 12 years and disrupt the river for that long. 
Large-scale underground mining in Butte ended in the 1950's, when Anaconda took the lid off the "richest hill on Earth," and created a milewide open pit. ARCO closed operations there in the early 1980's.
But the bills for the mess the miners made, much to the dismay of ARCO, are still rolling in. The cost for the cleanup to date is $700 million and is expected to reach $1 billion by the time company leaves, sometime in the next decade. Ms. Stash said profits from the property were negligible for the few years it remained operating. 
Many local residents portray the dam as a toxic time bomb. In February 1996, an ice jam 10 miles long and 14 feet thick built up steam and headed down river, a huge frozen missile that many feared would take out part of the dam and unleash the waste. 
Instead, the Montana Power Company, which owns the dam, drew down the water level and stranded the ice above the dam. But the water that the power company released churned up four feet of heavy metals that had been at the bottom of the reservoir and flushed it into the river. 
The result, county officials say, was a huge fish kill. Though the state limit for copper is 18 parts per billion, tests showed copper levels of 400 parts per billion. The following spring, a count by state fisheries of young rainbow and brown trout showed a decline of 86 percent and a decrease of two-thirds in the number of larger rainbow trout. ARCO officials are skeptical about what Ms. Stash called "the alleged fish kill" because no dead fish were seen.
There are other problems with the 19th-century timber crib dam. Earthquakes are a possibility. Inspectors have found water leaking through cracks. And then there is the arsenic. High levels of the metal from the reservoir behind the dam leaked into groundwater and contaminated the wells of several dozen residents. ARCO drilled a deep new well to create safe water, but there are fears that the arsenic problem will return. 
Ms. Stash says that a large rubber dam attached to the present structure will ward off problems from ice jams. And the power company says that the cracks are nothing to worry about, comparing them with cracks in a sidewalk. 
Now there is a growing sentiment in Missoula, all along the political spectrum, not only to remove the sediments but to take out the dam as well, a project that ARCO says could cost up to $300 million. The E.P.A. estimates the cost of removal of the sediment at $120 million, the cost of the removal of both dam and sediment at $130 million and the cost of leaving the material and retrofitting the dam at $20 million. 
A proposal by Missoula County, called Two Rivers, would also remove another dam on the nearby Blackfoot River and allow the rivers to reconnect after a century apart, which would create a stretch of white water where the Milltown Dam now stands. "The possibilities are outstanding if we can pull this thing off," said Peter Nielsen, an author of the proposal.

HEADLINE: Beijing Jails a U.S.-Based Chinese Entrepreneur 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 6 

 BODY:
Liu Yaping left a comfortable life in the United States to seek out business opportunities in the city where he was born.
 A permanent resident of the United States with a home in Weston, Conn., he traveled frequently in the last six years to Hohhot, the capital of the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, often staying for months at a time. 
 When he tried to start a company to design Web sites last year, he seemed headed for success. He had good contacts, including influential family members and friends from his school days. He spoke the language. His work experience in America gave him a leg up in Western business practices. 
But on March 8, one day before he was to return to the United States for talks with investors, public security officers dragged Mr. Liu off the street and he has been held incommunicado in a military prison ever since, family members and lawyers said.
And, although Mr. Liu is officially charged only with two minor economic crimes, his lawyers say his treatment has been inexplicably harsh. His family and lawyers have been refused permission to see him, although such visits are guaranteed under China's criminal procedure law. 
Highly placed friends who have made inquiries have been advised to stay away from a "major case." And Mr. Liu was detained for more than a month before being charged.
More alarming to the family, Mr. Liu's younger brother has been asked to pay two large bills for emergency hospital visits, one of which included a CAT scan of the brain, said his wife, Pei Zhang, a United States citizen. And his family and lawyers fear that he may have been beaten in jail.
Even for China, where courts and the police are sometimes lax in adhering to legal procedures, lawyers here and in the United States find Mr. Liu's treatment mystifying.
"Generally they at least make a pass at following rules," said Jerome Cohen, a professor of law at New York University who is working on the case, "but in this case they are for some reason choosing to violate their own criminal procedure laws."
Mr. Liu, 48, is one of a growing number of Chinese-born United States residents who have found themselves mysteriously detained by the Chinese authorities in the last six months, a trend that Western diplomats say reflects increasingly aggressive behavior by China's security agencies toward this group.
"Usually Chinese high-level judicial agencies tend to be very careful and monitor cases involving green card holders," said Zhang Jianzhong, a Chinese lawyer who is involved in the case. "If there are irregularities, they can apply a lot of pressure. It's not a deciding factor, but it can have an effect."
But he added: "This influence goes up and down with U.S.-China relations. It may not work in his favor now."
Even Mr. Liu's wife, in the United States, and his brothers, in China, are perplexed by the detention, although they suspect that high police officials may be using him to settle old scores. Mr. Liu previously sold elevators to the Public Security Bureau and became enmeshed in power struggles there.
Last month the State Department officially urged American citizens and green card holders who had been born in China to "carefully assess" their risk of detention if they traveled there, particularly if they had publicly criticized the government or had close contacts with Taiwan.
The State Department advisory was prompted by the detention for varying lengths of time of six American citizens and a number of United States green card holders in the last half-year. Most were academics, though some were businessmen.
While the others were picked up by China's Ministry of State Security, which usually deals with espionage, Mr. Liu was detained by China's ordinary police force, the Public Security Bureau.
But such distinctions are not always clear in China: this week the police suddenly told Mr. Liu's Chinese lawyers that they could not visit because the case involved state secrets, even though Mr. Liu is primarily charged with economic crimes.
Under Chinese law, the right to a lawyer is not guaranteed if "state secrets" are involved.
Mr. Liu's current problems began last year, when he and his wife began setting up their company in Hohhot.
The couple had emigrated to the United States in the early 1990's with their son, now 15. While Ms. Zhang and their son are already United States citizens, Mr. Liu did not complete the naturalization process.
In November, traveling on a Chinese passport, Mr. Liu registered a wholly foreign-owned company in Hohhot in his wife's name and began to put together the money committed to the project. In late February the company got its first project, from a government company, Ms. Zhang said.
But on March 8 the Public Security Bureau suddenly seized Mr. Liu and sealed the company bank account, moves that the police later said were necessary because the company had failed to pay taxes and to deposit the required investment money within three months. The bureau confirmed his arrest declined to answer further questions.
But Mr. Zhang, the lawyer, said seizing Mr. Liu and detaining him incommunicado for two months would be highly unusual treatment for such "light crimes."
He said the first enforcement procedure for overdue taxes is delivery of an official notice, which Mr. Liu was handed only after he had spent a month in jail. Normally the notice can be appealed, although that is not possible from prison.
The lawyer added that the usual punishment for failing to put up required investment funds is to revoke the business's license. And he said that in such a case the prisoner is normally eligible for release pending trial. But requests for bail have gone unanswered.
"There are lots of questions about these charges," he said. "It just doesn't make sense. We are trying to handle this conflict so that Mr. Liu can receive his rights under Chinese law."
But so far lawyers and Mr. Liu's relatives in Hohhot, who declined to be interviewed by the foreign press, have come up empty-handed.
Ms. Zhang said she had begun to feel extra urgency about a visit after Mr. Liu's brother, Liu Yaou, who still lives in Hohhot, began receiving the medical bills.
On April 5 he was asked to pay the equivalent of $300 for two hospital visits for an unspecified illness. On April 6 Mr. Liu managed to pass a note out of hospital, saying he was vomiting, slurring his speech and losing his vision. On April 17 Mr. Liu's brother was again asked to pay a hospital bill, this one for about $400. But when Mr. Liu's family calls to inquire about his physical condition, they are told he is in "good health," Ms. Zhang said.
A radiologist who answered the phone at one of the two hospitals that treated Mr. Zhang said his CAT scan had shown a growth on one of the arteries in his brain. Ms. Zhang said her husband, 48, had not previously complained of feeling unwell. 
Although such conditions are not generally caused by trauma, Mr. Liu's lawyers nonetheless fear the worst and add that their fears will only be calmed when they are allowed to see him.
"It's obvious that they don't want anyone to see this man," said Mr. Cohen, the New York lawyer, "so naturally we're worried about his physical condition."

HEADLINE: After Two Centuries, Washington Is Losing Its Only Public Hospital 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
On the day that federal officials decided to put this city's first and only public hospital out of business, business continued there as usual. A woman, hugely pregnant and a week past her due date, received an ultrasound examination in the sweltering heat, the still air moved about by a fan because the air-conditioning had not yet been turned on.
 On the maternity ward, a 14-year-old girl gave birth in a room of peeling wallpaper and cracked paint; the baby swallowed its own stool during the delivery and was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit for oxygen. On the cancer ward, a nurse made her rounds with dollar bills stuffed in her pockets. She never knew, she explained, when a patient might need bus fare home. 
 So has it ever been at the District of Columbia General Hospital. Since its founding as an almshouse nearly two centuries ago, D.C. General, as it is known, has embraced this city's sick and poor, most of them African-Americans, when there was nowhere else for them to go. It has trained generations of black doctors; many, committed to serving the underserved, stayed on. But the hospital has also been sorely mismanaged, and it has bled red ink to the point of bankruptcy. 
Last Monday, in a move that followed a nationwide trend, the federal control board that oversees the city's financial affairs contracted with a consortium of private health care providers to run the hospital and six separate city clinics. The hospital's own outpatient clinics and emergency room will remain open. But the inpatient and trauma wards -- in essence, the hospital itself -- will be shuttered.
"We are tossing public health into the trash," said Dr. Michal Young, a neonatologist and president of the hospital's medical and dental staff. "When you lose public health in the capital of the most powerful nation in the world, it is an indicator of what the rest of the country is going to do."
Indeed, it is an indicator of what the rest of the country is already doing. Over the last two decades, as competition has forced hospital mergers and acquisitions, the number of public hospitals has dwindled. In 1999, the last year for which figures are available, that number was 1,197, down from 1,778 in 1980, according to the American Hospital Association. By comparison, the number of private hospitals dropped to 3,759 from 4,052. 
Public hospitals offer free care for the indigent, typically at greater levels than private hospitals, and at taxpayers' expense. Some, as in Boston and Baltimore, have been absorbed into nonprofit university hospitals, which remain committed to serving the poor. Others have become private entities; still others, as in St. Louis, have shut down. 
And dozens, if not hundreds, of small rural public hospitals have closed, said Larry S. Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems. "In cities and in rural areas, hospitals have an increasingly difficult time making it," Mr. Gage said, "and public hospitals are often the most vulnerable institutions."
Mr. Gage says he is not overly concerned about the privatization of government-run hospitals, so long as what he calls their "safety-net mission" is retained. And in many cases it has been, experts say. But others mourn the loss of the institutions that have historically been the nation's health care providers of last resort.
"These are a treasure and we shouldn't let them go," said Sandra Opdycke, author of "No One Was Turned Away" (Oxford University Press, 1999), about the New York City public hospital system. "They have never had the kind of care and respect that they deserve, and especially now, they are not getting it."
Alan Sager, a professor of public health at Boston University who consulted with the unions at D.C. General in an effort to keep the hospital open, said, "What is lost is a guaranteed open door, a room at the inn."
D.C. General sits in the city's depressed Southeast section, at the end of a forlorn stretch of Massachusetts Avenue, a street that in the prosperous Northwest area is home to the elegant mansions of Embassy Row. The hospital is a collection of mostly aging brick buildings, sprawled over a 68-acre riverfront site that includes the city morgue and jail. At its peak, after World War II, D.C. General had enough patients to fill 1,600 beds. 
Last Monday, the patient count was 119, a reflection of staffing cuts, uncertainty about the hospital's future and the reality, faced by all hospitals, that patients today are sent home sooner and often not admitted at all. 
The hospital had been in dire financial straits for more than a decade, as was the city, which is why the control board was established in 1995. Michael Barch, until last week the hospital's chief executive (he took that job just six months ago, after his predecessor was fired amid accusations of fraud), said the hospital's budget dance had been the same for several years. Each year, the city offered a $45 million subsidy. Each year, the hospital overspent it by many millions, with the city making up the difference. 
Of Washington's 550,000 residents, an estimated 80,000 lack insurance. At the same time, the city's health statistics are abysmal.
"We have a life expectancy for African-American men that is 59, the lowest in the country," said Dr. Ivan C. A. Walks, the city's health commissioner. The infant mortality rate, 12.5 per 1,000 births, is nearly double the national average. 
The city in 1996 put the hospital and the city clinics under the auspices of a new body, the Public Benefits Corporation, which was supposed to act like a business. That strategy worked in Denver. But it failed here.
The corporation "never integrated the clinics with the hospital," said Alice M. Rivlin, an economist at the Brookings Institution who is chairwoman of the federal control board. Some clinic doctors were not qualified to admit patients to the hospital. Nurses at the clinics and the hospital earned different salaries. Antiquated computers made it impossible to track patients. 
The hospital's financial records were a mess. Sixty percent of D.C. General's patients were insured, Mr. Barch said, yet often they were not billed. "It was a culture that said, 'We're here to serve patients, not to harass them about paying,' " he said.
In January 1999, a new mayor, Anthony A. Williams, took office. "We talked," Ms. Rivlin said, "and I urged him to get on top of the hospital problem." 
Mr. Williams, previously the city's chief financial officer, is regarded here as something of a technocrat and politically naive. At a recent news conference, his press secretary had to remind him to look at the cameras. He did not expect the deep resentment he would engender by stepping into the hospital's affairs. 
"Thank God for four-year terms," Mr. Williams said in a recent interview. 
By last year, city auditors had warned that the hospital was about to run out of money and would soon be forced to shut down. "We were in a crisis," Ms. Rivlin said. The solution, the mayor and his staff concluded, was to get the city out of the health care business. 
"We began looking around the country at other jurisdictions," said Dr. Walks, the health commissioner. "San Diego, Detroit, Tampa. What we found is that if you do these transitions correctly, you can expect three things: increased access, increased quality and cost savings."
According to a 1999 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, for every 100 public hospitals in the United States, one closes and two convert to private ownership or management each year. But for Washington, finding a private partner was not easy. About 200 people turned out for a bidder's conference, Dr. Walks said. Two bids were submitted.
One came from a group led by Mr. Barch, who proposed building a smaller hospital on the site of D.C. General. That plan was rejected. The other came from a consortium led by Greater Southeast Community Hospital, a Washington hospital that went bankrupt in late 1999 but has been bought and turned around by an Arizona company.
For $90 million each year from taxpayers (the Public Benefits Corporation spent $120 million last year), Greater Southeast has promised to increase medical services -- including hospital admissions, surgeries and primary care -- for uninsured patients by 34 percent.
The big question, of course, is whether it can live up to that commitment. The company's financial history leaves many residents as well as the City Council, which voted unanimously to oppose the privatization, uneasy. 
Mayor Williams is confident that the uninsured will get more, and better, care. "I'm going to sleep like a baby at night," he said, "because I've done the right thing."
But Dr. Sager, the Boston University professor, says the mayor underestimates the intimate relationship between patients and hospitals. When a hospital closes, he said, 30 percent of its patients simply cease seeking care for a time. 
"Hospitals are not interchangeable parts in some health care machine," Dr. Sager said. "It takes a while to reweave a connection."
That connection is keenly felt at D.C. General, by both patients and doctors.
"I feel that I was led by the Lord to come here," said Dr. Steven Tucker, director of obstetrics and gynecology, who arrived three years ago. Once, he had dreams of renovating the maternity ward. "This institution," Dr. Tucker said, "has never been given a fair shake."
To whites in Washington, the hospital symbolized everything that was wrong with the city. But to blacks, it stood as a symbol of culture and history. With its privatization, conspiracy theories abound. Some blacks say they believe the mayor, who is himself African-American, wants the riverfront land for redevelopment.
"The eradication of D.C. General is a statement that there is no place for the black community, for the low-income residents, the people that have lived here through thick and thin, ups and downs," said the Rev. Graylan Hagler, pastor of the Ply mouth Congregational United Church of Christ. "Not only is the hospital being removed, but those populations are being removed."
But more than a symbol, D.C. General was a medical home for the disenfranchised. Last month, a homeless man became ill during a court hearing on misdemeanor charges and died a short while later in a holding cell. While he was still in court, gasping for breath, he begged of the judge, "Just take me to D.C. General."

But it has also been losing money. (Photographs by Carol T. Powers for The New York Times)(pg. A13)

HEADLINE: Now You Need an Area Code Just to Call Your Neighbors 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Technology is supposed to make life easier, but the simple act of making a phone call is becoming more complicated.
 Facing a shortage of telephone numbers -- "number exhaustion" to use the industry term -- regulators are adding area codes at a furious pace. Since 1995, 138 area codes have been added around the country, raising the national total to 344. Between 1984 and 1994, the nation made do by adding only nine. In certain populous areas, including metropolitan New York and Boston, new area codes are often interspersed among existing ones. 
 The result is one of the subtle ironies of the Information Age. Even as consumers benefit from growth in communications options, growing numbers of them must now dial 10 or 11 digits instead of the usual seven when placing a local telephone call -- sometimes even when calling within the same area code. 
"It is incredibly disorienting," said Miguel Segovia, a graduate student at Harvard Divinity School. "I now get the annoying feeling that my life is becoming cluttered with numbers."
Regulators and phone companies support dialing the extra numbers because they want to avoid costly equipment upgrades. Besides, they point out, adding the area code to local calls allows them to use a numbering system that has worked well since 1947. But critics say the nation runs the risk of yet another number shortage within a decade that could lead to a wholesale revamping of the system, possibly resulting in even more digits to dial.
Some consumers wonder why the United States has not followed the pattern of some European and Asian countries, which have treated number exhaustion by simply adding a single digit to seven-digit local numbers. The old number for the Tate Gallery in London, for example, was 887-8008. The Tate's new number for callers in central London is 7887-8008.
By contrast, in Manhattan, where the 646 and 917 area codes have joined the time-honored 212, it is not unheard of for someone within a block of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to dial 10 or 11 digits to reach the Met's information desk. (Unlike a call from a landline, a local call on a cell phone normally does not require dialing "1" before the area code.)
One reason United States phone companies do not use eight-digit numbers may be because some countries have already had to abandon eight-digit systems. France, for one, switched from an eight-digit system to a 10-digit one several years ago.
Then there is the sheer scope of the United States telephone network, which serves almost 500 million different numbers -- nearly two numbers for every American man, woman and well-connected child.
"There are just a lot more phone numbers today than five years ago," said Ron Conners, director of the North American Numbering Plan Administrator, the industry's numeracy coordinator, which is run by NeuStar Inc., a private company in Washington.
While area codes can be added to the American phone network with relative ease, at fairly low cost, converting phone companies to an eight-digit system would mean reprogramming their software and acquiring new switching equipment to route calls. Corporate customers, meanwhile, would need to purchase new interoffice communications systems, like automated switchboards known as PBX's, among other measures.
Nationwide, such a makeover would cost at least $75 billion, the Federal Communications Commission estimates. And some analysts, like Lee Selwyn, president of Economics & Technology, a telecommunications research company in Boston, say the cost could be even higher. Mr. Selwyn puts the figure around $150 billion -- approaching the amount that corporations spent in anticipation of potential Year 2000 computer problems.
Perhaps the biggest vexation for local callers occurs when they have to dial 10 digits for all local calls -- even within the same area code. For consumers in some parts of the country this extra step has not been necessary, because the local phone company simply chose to split an existing geographic area into two. But in populous areas, rather than splitting areas, regulators often take an overlay approach -- dropping new area codes over the same geographic area already served by an existing code. In such cases, as in Boston's recent 857 overlay, regulators have chosen to simplify things from a software standpoint by requiring everyone to use an area code for all calls.
New York City has been an exception, so far. When the overlay of the 917 and 646 codes was made atop Manhattan's 212, the New York Public Service Commission and the Consumer Federation of America took the Federal Communications Commission to court rather than force people with 212 numbers to add the area code when calling other 212 numbers. Pending the case's outcome, Manhattanites with 212-code numbers still dial only seven digits when calling one another.
The proliferation of area codes and 10-digit local dialing has made its way into popular culture.
In a recent episode of the Fox cartoon TV series "The Simpsons," the local town, Springfield, was riven culturally and politically by the introduction of a second area code. Homer Simpson became mayor of New Springfield on a campaign promise to build a wall between the two towns.
The three-digit area code traces to 1947, when the North American Numbering Plan was created by AT&T, seeking to update a hodge-podge system that had included four- and five-digit phone numbers.
Ever since, a 10-digit number has permitted automated routing of long-distance calls, gradually endingthe need for operators. Like the national highway system, the numbering scheme's uniformity made communication easier between states. It worked so well that Canada and nearly 20 small countries in the Caribbean adopted the plan.
Over the years, the numbering system received several technological face lifts, notably the transition to computerized digital switching that began in the 1980's.
There are 684 combinations assignable as area codes, according to NeuStar. Because 344 have already been assigned, only 340 remain available. And so at some point, perhaps a decade out, it may be necessary for the telephone industry to move to an 11- or 12-digit numbering system. The move is likely to entail all the costs and overhauls that the industry has been trying to defer by saturating the land with area codes.
Some experts complain that the bank of area codes would have stayed solvent much longer, if local telephone numbers had not been handed out so profligately in the past. For decades after the national numbering scheme was created in 1947, the administrator doled out phone numbers in lots of 10,000 -- whether telephone companies needed that many numbers or not.
With the formation of many new telephone companies in pursuit of the competition promised by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the handing out and stockpiling of numbers only increased.
The F.C.C. has recently sought to add some safeguards by reducing number allocation blocks to only 1,000 rather than 10,000. It has also required carriers to meet a utilization threshold of at least 60 percent before they could receive additional numbers in their area.
But it is up to each state to choose whether to adopt the F.C.C.'s 1,000-number plan, and so far only 12 states have done so. Some experts say any change in the allocation system will be too little, too late to curb area code proliferation.
"We need to face the idea that our lives are becoming more complicated number-wise," said James Katz, professor of communication at Rutgers University.
The current concern is reminiscent of the early 1960's, when lettered prefixes like YUkon, TRafalgar and PEnnsylvania were being replaced in phone numbers and groups like the Anti-Digit Dialing League and the Committee of Ten Million to Oppose All-Number Calling were formed. They knew that 736-5000 just did not have the ring of the "Pennsylvania 6-5000" that Glenn Miller made famous.
Lemuel Gordon is one who remembers the phase-out of the PEnnsylvanias and the YUkons. And he rues the latest numerical wrinkles.
"I recognize the telephone is a convenience, but all of these new numbers are such a damn nuisance," said Mr. Gordon, an 81-year-old former accountant in Poway, Calif., who recently discovered he had to add an area code for the first time to call nearby San Diego. "It's enough to make you feel like a victim of the numbers age."

A14) Chart/Map: "Digital Diversity"The rise of fax machines, cell phones and Internet access lines is depleting the supply of local telephone numbers, forcing phone companies to add many new area codes since 1995 -- particularly in populous metropolitan regions like New York and Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: MOST CITIES IN U.S. EXPANDED RAPIDLY OVER LAST DECADE 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
The nation's largest cities grew nearly twice as fast in the 1990's as in the 1980's, with three out of every four urban centers gaining population, analyses of the latest census figures show. 
 But the urban renaissance was uneven in the bigger cities, those with more than 100,000 people. Reversing a 50-year trend, Chicago grew by 112,000 people. New York exceeded eight million people for the first time, its highest population ever. But Philadelphia and Detroit lost population. 
 Western and Southern cities, like Las Vegas and Charlotte, N.C., grew the fastest, fueled by booming economies and an influx of immigrants. Urban industrial centers in the Rust Belt like Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Middle Atlantic and Northeastern cities like Hartford and Baltimore generally declined as jobs and people migrated elsewhere. 
Demographers have noticed intriguing trends among the nation's urban population winners and losers. Cities with highly educated residents, like Madison, Wis., and Columbus, Ohio, two university towns, gained population. Cities with large numbers of poor people, like St. Louis, typically declined. Cities with big public transit systems, like Philadelphia, generally shrank, while cities where residents rely more on their cars, like Phoenix, now the nation's sixth-largest city, typically grew.
With faster-growing suburbs siphoning people away from neighboring cities, these and other findings carry wide-ranging implications for civic leaders seeking to keep their residents from leaving and to lure others back. Even as whites fled cities, they were replaced in many instances by immigrants, mainly Hispanics, as well as by young professionals and older adults with grown children. 
"What all this says is that consumer preferences are important," said Edward L. Glaeser, an economics professor at Harvard University and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied urban demographics. "City officials need to worry about what makes their city an attractive place to live in. They need to make streets safe and schools solid." 
In Cleveland, the trends that sink or save cities seem to collide. All of Ohio's largest 15 cities except Columbus shrank in the 1990's. The region's core economy, including steel, auto assembly and chemicals, has been battered. Cleveland's population dropped 5 percent, to 478,403 people, continuing a slide that started in 1950 when about 915,000 people lived in Cleveland.
But the drop-off in Cleveland, as in Midwestern cities like Milwaukee, was slighter compared with earlier decades. In the 1970's, 177,000 people, or nearly a quarter of Cleveland, left. Walk around downtown Cleveland today, with its two new stadiums, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and chic restaurants sprouting in converted warehouses, or drive through the city's diverse neighborhoods, where more than 300 new homes are springing up each year, and a spirit of revival fills the air. 
Crime rates plummeted in the 1990's. A new management school building for Case Western Reserve University, designed by the architect Frank Gehry, is rising in the fashionable University Circle district.
On the edge of the Hough neighborhood, where riots broke out in 1966, two native Clevelanders, Mike Evarts, 31, a medical sales representative who is white, and Elaine Price-Harris, 56, a nurse who is black, have moved in to Beacon Place, a 93-unit development of single-family homes and town houses. Both can walk to work at the Cleveland Clinic just down the street. "The area is up-and-coming, and I like being near the city, as well as to the arts and theatre," said Mr. Evarts, who like Ms. Price-Harris moved from the suburbs. 
 The days when the Cuyahoga River was so polluted it caught fire and when Cleveland went into default on bank loans seem ages ago to many longtime residents. 
"People don't feel that Cleveland's a national joke anymore," said Eric Hodderson, president of Neighborhood Progress Inc., a citywide housing development and financing organization. "There's more hope than in the past, but it's still a fight." 
Indeed, the city is still largely segregated. Its public schools are crumbling. Clevelanders go to the polls on Tuesday to vote on a $356 million school construction and renovation bond measure that civic leaders say is crucial for the city's recovery. 
 "Cleveland still has a very serious problem of a very large population of poorly educated, low-income people," said Thomas Bier, director of Cleveland State University's housing policy research program. "They survive, but I'm not sure the world is getting better for them." 
Midwestern cities that lost population, like Detroit, fell at slower rates than in past decades. The overall population in Detroit dropped by 7.5 percent, but the number of whites fell by 53 percent to 100,000. The black middle class has been fleeing to the suburbs, too. And now, the city has only one movie theater, which opened last month. 
"The city is not ready to admit that what's happening is that blacks with the wherewithal are leaving," said Kurt R. Metzger, an urban affairs expert at Wayne State University in Detroit. "A lot of the folks who are left are those who can't afford to leave." 
Most cities continued growth patterns from the 1980's and earlier decades but in more pronounced ways. Only five cities experienced a true recovery in the 1990's by turning a population loss in the 1980's into a population gain a decade later: Chicago, Memphis, Denver, Atlanta and Yonkers, in Westchester County, a suburb of New York City.
In Denver's case, the city was hurt in the 1980's by a recession in the oil industry. But city leaders, under Mayors Federico F. Pena and Wellington E. Webb, developed a master plan to revive downtown. A bond measure passed, pouring money into libraries and parks. The city offered tax credits to encourage new housing. A new baseball stadium downtown drew people to shops and restaurants. When the economy rebounded, city officials say, Denver was poised to grow again.
"Activity generates more activity," said Jennifer T. Moulton, Denver's director of community planning and development. "People saw downtown as clean and safe." 
There is no simple formula for cities to succeed in the 21st century. Mr. Glaeser and another Harvard researcher, Jesse M. Shapiro, found that the median growth rate for the nearly 200 cities that started the 1990's with at least 100,000 people was 8.7 percent, more than double the median growth rate in the 1980's. 
Other researchers at the Brookings Institution have found that 72 of the nation's top 100 cities gained population in the last 10 years. In the 1980's, they said, 62 of these cities increased. 
Mr. Glaeser talks about the rise of the consumer city, as opposed to production or manufacturing cities that dominated much of the 20th century. In these consumer cities, weather counts. Warm, dry places, like Austin, Tex., grew. Cold, wet places shrank, with notable exceptions like Seattle and Portland, Ore. 
Traffic jams correlate with growth, but not the way one might think, Mr. Glaeser said. Of the 28 cities that grew by more than 25 percent in the 1990's, an average of only 2.5 percent of the people in those cities used mass transit. But on average, the 11 cities where more than 20 percent of residents use subways and buses had flat growth. Of these cities, New York grew the fastest, at 9 percent. 
"This makes public transportation a double-edged sword for cities," Mr. Glaeser said. "One the one hand, it takes care of poor residents, which is admirable. But on the other hand, it attracts the poor who create a host of urban problems."

Google's revival of a Usenet archive opens up a wealth of possibilities but also raises some privacy issues.

BYLINE:  By Susan Stellin 

 BODY:
WITH some decent search skills, a bit of free time and a degree of skepticism about what one ultimately finds, a person can learn a lot by trolling through an archive of Internet bulletin boards that has once again become available online.
 In February, the Internet search service Google bought from the failed information site Deja.com an archive of more than 650 million messages posted on electronic bulletin boards, known as Usenet newsgroups, that dates to 1995. 
 Started in 1979 as a tool for computer programmers, Usenet became more accessible in the mid-1990's when Deja developed software that made posting messages on the public system easier and began to archive the postings. Usenet blossomed into a vibrant, chaotic community of users communicating about almost every imaginable subject -- from arcane technical topics like data compression to more general interests like ham radio, parenthood or motorcycles. 
But with the e-commerce explosion, Deja shifted its focus toward online retailing and scaled back its public Usenet archive a year ago, before the company drowned in the market undertow earlier this year.
Google bought Deja's Usenet archive in February, with the intention of restoring the full archive and improving the message posting and searching capabilities. The company refers to its new Usenet search service, available at http://groups.google .com, as an "archive of human conversation." To tap in is to experience something similar to old-fashioned eavesdropping: long stretches of dull discussion interspersed with juicy tidbits of gossip and the occasional confession that makes the listener squirm.
Among the mundane postings, noteworthy primarily for their name power: a 1996 message by Marc Andreessen, who at that time was busy building Netscape, seeking tips for making sure his year-old bulldog played nicely with another bulldog soon to join the family; a message, around the same time, apparently from MacKenzie Bezos, the wife of Amazon's founder, inquiring about a good dog obedience school in Seattle.
Beyond the issues of canine behavior in the households of busy Internet executives, such postings raise questions about the implications of increasingly sophisticated search technology. To read about pet queries is innocuous enough. But a message posted by another Internet professional, responding to a posting that suggested he had left his previous position because of inappropriate behavior with female staff members, moves into different territory.
As Google's chief executive and co-founder, Larry Page, noted, "When you search Google, you're searching the equivalent of a stack of paper that's 110 miles high -- in half a second." And he acknowledged that such an awe-inspiring information tool had social and cultural repercussions: "You have more access to information, but that means you have access to bad things, as well."
With respect to most of the Web pages that Google searches with its 8,000 server computers, it is fair to say that the people who publish those pages understand they are putting information into the public domain. But the history of Usenet is somewhat more complicated.
In Usenet's original incarnation, messages posted to newsgroups disappeared within weeks, replaced by other comments on the same topic in what was perceived as an ongoing electronic conversation. When Deja.com, then called Deja News, began archiving messages in 1995 and making them searchable, there were protests by those who felt the bulletin boards were never intended to be permanent.
In response, Deja made it possible for users to exclude their postings from its archive by typing the phrase "X-No-archive: yes" at the beginning of a message. With that change, and as Deja subsequently shifted its business model toward consumer-written product reviews and trimmed its public Usenet archive, the privacy issue faded to the background.
Google's acquisition of the archive, however, not to mention a mass-audience popularity that Deja never achieved, may revive some of those privacy concerns. Although Google may be preserving an important historical resource -- an effort that some have lauded -- the company is also making the record of this "human conversation" accessible in ways that its participants may not have been able to anticipate.
Some of the messages on Usenet involve caustic personal attacks -- or equally vitriolic defenses against those attacks. Others display ill-conceived opinions, rash statements or embarrassing late-night rants. And all of it is now searchable by entering a key word, a date range or a name. Postings include a name and e-mail address; the text of messages can also be searched to see if someone is mentioned by name.
"Being able to search large amounts of information is something we know how to do better than anyone else," Mr. Page said. But Google is also trying to address the privacy implications of that feat, he said, by honoring the "X-No-archive" standard and allowing individuals to remove their old posts. And once Google introduces the ability to post new messages through its service, called Google Groups, the company plans to use an authentication process to make sure that people posting under a particular e-mail address are who they say they are.
Theoretically, this authentication measure will help cut down on postings falsely attributed to someone else -- like a disparaging message about Intel ostensibly posted by the Internet pioneer Vinton G. Cerf, who said via e-mail that the posting "is absolutely NOT from me." But Mr. Page said people might still find a way to fake a posting under someone else's name; users can also post messages under an alias, which he says he himself does, as long as they do so under a valid e-mail address.
Surprisingly, for all the privacy issues that Google's acquisition of the Usenet archive might seem to raise, the subject has not been taken up by the usual online privacy-rights advocates. Deborah Pierce, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the reason was Usenet's open-discussion platform. "If that's not a public forum," she said, "I don't know what is."
But she said people might have qualms if they learned that "what they thought is an ephemeral conversation is now going to be stored -- possibly forever."
As for the privacy implications of advances in search technology, Bruce Koball, a longtime organizer of the Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference, said the matter might draw more scrutiny in coming years, as the impact became clearer.
"People can be rightfully mortified when they come back five years from now and see a post that they made," Mr. Koball said. "And now it's enshrined in magnetic media for time immemorial."
He described the data trail a person now generates as a "digital doppelganger" -- a record of information about an individual's activities and behavior. In the past, that type of record might have been compiled by the government or a law enforcement agency for some deliberate purpose, he said. But now, "what we have is people essentially creating their own dossier -- just through their everyday activities."
Along with that, however, comes what some call information transparency. Google may have inadvertently created a tool for mass surveillance, but that tool is accessible to anyone, Mr. Page said. "You go to Google and you type in your name," he said, "and see exactly what we know."
And yet he acknowledged that Google's search capabilities might have opened Pandora's box.
"To be able to find things with high accuracy and high reliability really quickly has an incredible impact on the world," Mr. Page said. "Over all, I think that's going to be a net positive, but it is something we worry about."

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Acquisitions have made eVineyard the top online wine seller, but it still must show that the concept can succeed.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
THE wine industry has been a source of puzzlement ever since the repeal of Prohibition, when state legislators enacted a tangle of laws intended to keep alcohol sellers in check. But the Internet has added an entirely new chapter to the tale.
 Late last month, for instance, an obscure company called eVineyard bought the assets of the best-known company in the online wine category, Wine.com, for an amount that was undisclosed but was said to be around $10 million by people close to the deal. 
 This sale followed the merger late last year of Wine.com and its biggest competitor, Wineshopper.com, which between them had burned through about $200 million in financing from the likes of Amazon; Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and GE Capital . Wine.com already knew something about mergers, because in 1999 it joined operations with VirtualVineyard.com, which had been its chief rival before Wineshopper's debut.
That checkered genealogy now belongs to eVineyard, which because it was largely ignored by analysts and the big venture capitalists is the unlikely king of the category. Of course, the question now becomes whether eVineyard can hold onto that crown -- and whether enough consumers will warm to the idea of online wine buying to make the crown worth keeping. 
According to Alexandra McPhee, a wine industry analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, the difficulty of selling wine across state lines and the shrinking pool of online wine sites foretell slower growth than many analysts had first envisioned. "Although it'll be growing in the U.S.," she said, "I just don't see it as a meaningful distribution source in the near term."
That is a bit of a shift in philosophy at Salomon, since another analyst estimated last year that the online wine industry would garner $1.4 billion to $2.9 billion in sales by 2005, numbers that now look far-fetched. Wine.com's sales were about $30 million last year, and no competitor came close.
But eVineyard executives brook no pessimism. "For consumers, this is definitely catching on," said Brett Lauter, eVineyard's chief marketing officer. "And even before the Wine.com deal, we were on track to be profitable by the end of the year. This just makes it more doable, and probably sooner."
Mr. Lauter said eVineyard, which had sales of less than $10 million last year, would aggressively market itself to Wine.com's 210,000 customers, as well as an additional 200,000 people who had signed up for Wine.com's e-mail updates.
EVineyard has not yet begun to advertise to those people, he said, but it is already reaping the rewards of its purchase, since users who go to Wine.com are redirected to Mr. Lauter's site. On the last weekend in April, immediately after the Wine.com deal, eVineyard's sales were "six to seven times" the normal rate, Mr. Lauter said.
While eVineyard is happy to take Wine.com's customers, Mr. Lauter said it would not adopt Wine.com's business approach, which was intended to navigate the vagaries of state laws regulating alcohol sales. Often, that required securing agreements with wholesalers and retailers in the customer's state before shipping the wine, thereby shaving the profit margin of each sale.
EVineyard has avoided interstate shipping issues by obtaining retail licenses in each of the 27 states it serves. That way, it can pass along an order to a local wholesaler, who then ships the wine to the customer on eVineyard's behalf. "Our average gross margin is 32 percent," Mr. Lauter said, "which is not a bad gross margin when you're not carrying inventory, and when you don't have to split it with retailers, which our past competition did."
Among the more successful of eVineyard's remaining competitors is Geerlings & Wade, which has sold wine through the mail for 15 years, and on the Internet for the last three years (www.geerwade.com). According to the company's president, David R. Pearce, the Geerlings & Wade Web site now accounts for 15 percent, or $5.5 million, of the company's total sales.
Like eVineyard, Geerlings & Wade holds retail licenses in each of the 16 states where it does business. That number may seem paltry at first glance, Mr. Pearce acknowledged, "but we believe those states cover at least 85 percent of the wine-buying population."
Geerlings & Wade, which is publicly traded, has gross margins of more than 50 percent, Mr. Pearce said. The company achieves this operational feat by selling mostly private-label wines -- that is, wines produced by well-known makers, but packaged with names like Red Brick Cellars and Hamilton Estates. 
Mr. Pearce said that wineries that produce too much in a given year typically do not want him to sell their brands at a discount -- or even have their identities disclosed -- for fear of rankling other retailers that bought at full price. Discounting might also cheapen the perceived quality of the wine for consumers, he said.
"But they will sell it to us for a lower price, as long as we use a different brand," Mr. Pearce said. "It's like buying Coke without the label on it."
While Geerlings & Wade has done little to advertise its Web site, Mr. Pearce said that might change as Internet advertising rates continue to plummet. In the meantime, Mr. Pearce said that e-mail advertising had helped generate sales -- even if the sales themselves were not transacted over the Internet. "Our average customer is in their mid-50's," he said. "We'll send something out to 75,000 e-mail addresses, and our customers will get them and immediately call the 800 number and order that way."
Wineries themselves will also present increasing competition to online wine merchants, according to Lesley P. Berglund, chief executive of Winetasting.com. Ms. Berglund's company sells wine directly to consumers through a subsidiary site, AmbrosiaWine.com. But the company also builds e-commerce sites and fulfills orders on behalf of wineries like Chateau Montelena, in the Napa Valley of California. AmbrosiaWine.com features some 500 wines from 50 wineries.
Ms. Berglund said her company was involved in the online sale of about $16 million worth of wine last year, although its portion of the revenue was far less than that. The company earns a 3 percent commission on sales it refers to the wineries' sites, and 15 percent on sales it completes on the wineries' behalf. It also earns $25 to $50 for every case of wine it ships on their behalf.
"Selling directly to consumers is becoming incredibly important to the wineries," Ms. Berglund said. While the typical winery sells 5 to 10 percent of its product directly to consumers, she said, "their goal is to have that be 20 to 30 percent."
Given the economics, it is easy to see why. Ms. Berglund said the maker of a wine that retails in a store for $20 a bottle usually nets about $3. By acting as its own retailer, selling directly over the Internet, a maker can earn $10 to $12 a bottle.
As for the industry's recent shakeout, she said it could only benefit survivors like her company. "With the insane amount of money those companies spent, they did a lot to teach consumers to trust the Internet as a distribution channel for wine," she said. "They brought in the audience, from which all the other companies will benefit, undoubtedly."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Look out Madison Avenue, here come the search consultants. And they're growing in importance.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A START-UP and an alliance are underscoring the increasingly important role being played on Madison Avenue by search consultants, the third-party advisers who help advertisers and agencies find and keep working with each other.
 The prominence of consultants is expected to grow as the economy slows and many marketers reduce advertising budgets; such changes often lead to reviews as accounts are put into play. Downturns also generate friction and anxiety, which can worsen agency-client relations. 
 The start-up involves two industry executives, Jan Boyle and Howard Lesman, who worked at Ammirati & Puris in New York and a successor, Ammirati Puris Lintas, on accounts like BMW, Burger King and GMC. They left in 2000 after the merger that morphed the agency into Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
Mr. Lesman, 43, and Ms. Boyle, 42, are forming a consulting company named MatchWorks, which will operate two divisions from offices in Boston and New York. One division, SearchWorks, is devoted to the review process, pairing advertisers and agencies on account assignments. The other division, PartnerWorks, seeks to strengthen the bonds between clients and agencies, to prevent the disagreements that bring the former to dismiss the latter.
"Having the divisions linked to each other will help clients and agencies get the obstacles out of the way," said Mr. Lesman, president at MatchWorks, "to realize the full potential and power of partnership,"
"I spent a lot of years pitching new business and running those accounts we landed, and I saw when it worked and when it didn't," he added. "It works when there is communication and collaboration between agency and client."
That, of course, as the Essex sang in a 1963 hit, is easier said than done.
"We kicked around the idea of saying we're 'agency advocates,' " said Ms. Boyle, managing partner at MatchWorks and director at SearchWorks, because "you have to be close to the agencies and who they are to help the clients."
The director at PartnerWorks is Lyn Rosoff, who spent 18 years at the Boston agency now known as Arnold Worldwide, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas Advertising. Since 1996, she has worked as a communications trainer and coach for advertisers and agencies.
"I've had an interest in this since I taught a course on how to get the most from the agency-client relationship," Ms. Rosoff, 53, recalled, "and I realized they didn't understand each other's worlds."
"First and foremost, it has to be about trying to keep existing relationships strong," she added.
MatchWorks is already working for two clients. One is the Artisans' Guild in Naples, Fla., a consortium of crafts makers. The other is the Cunard Line division of the Carnival Corporation, which hired MatchWorks to find an agency to handle its account, with billings estimated at $4 million, after two years at Tinsley Advertising in Miami.
What recommended the principals of MatchWorks was "their experience at a shop as cutting-edge as Ammirati was," said Deborah L. Natansohn, senior vice president for worldwide sales and marketing at Cunard in Miami, "and their ability to understand our needs and the travel category."
"We have a 160-year-old brand we need to revitalize," she added, "and MatchWorks realized we need both a strategic and creative approach to do that." The review is expected to be completed in July.
The alliance involves AAR Partners in New York, the search consulting company headed by Leslie Winthrop, which is becoming the North American partner of Aprais in London, a worldwide consulting company that offers agencies and clients methods and tools to manage their relations.
AAR will represent and oversee the Aprais online product, also known as Aprais, for Agency Performance Relationship Appraisal and Improvement System. Aprais is used to set, measure and monitor the results of marketing communications campaigns for advertisers that pay their agencies through performance- or incentive-based compensation agreements rather than standard commissions. Those agreements are gaining popularity as marketers seek more efficient and effective ways to spend scarcer ad dollars.
"Research shows that if you've got a good relationship with your agency, you should get better advertising from the agency and better bottom-line results," said Gary Howells, sales and marketing director at Aprais. The company was founded in 1999 by executives from agencies like Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and J. Walter Thompson, owned by the WPP Group.
"Once performance-based or incentive-based compensation is accepted," Ms. Winthrop, managing partner at AAR, said, "you have to know how to measure it and agree to those measurements upfront, because it can all be so subjective."
"And for those advertisers who say 'our idea of measurement is sales,' you have to remind them it's not just sales off the shelf," she added. Among the less tangible results of campaigns to be measured are improving a product's or brand's image, converting consumers into customers and increasing the frequency of purchases among a product's best customers.

HEADLINE: Patents; 
Requests for new trademarks by Internet companies have fallen as the market has slowed.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
THE dot-com decline has more or less slowed the rush for Internet-related trademarks.
 After two years of sharp increases in requests for trademarks with a "dot-com" tag or an "e-" prefix, the number of those applications plummeted last year at the same time that Internet stocks began to fall. 
 "We can see a numerical confirmation of the fact that the whole dot-com trend went from very hot to very cold in a few weeks' time," said Glenn A. Gundersen, head of the intellectual property group at the Dechert, Price & Rhoads law firm in Philadelphia. Mr. Gundersen's group produces a report each year on trends in trademarks and it has tracked a decade-long surge in business prompted by the flourishing economy. The Dechert report for 2000 came out late last month. 
"This is the first time in 10 years we've seen things start to tick down," Mr. Gundersen said. "It provides continuing confirmation that trademark applications seem to follow the economy." 
Last year, companies and individuals filed so many applications for trademarks associated with Internet addresses that it looked as if the courts might have to rule on whether generic words -- like furniture, pets and garden -- with a dot-com tag could qualify. 
The Patent and Trademark Office said no, because it did not award trademarks to generic words that are simply descriptive and everyone has the right to use such terms. The agency also declared that the dot-com suffix would be interpreted the same as Inc., and other corporate descriptions: the suffix would be disregarded as part of the trademark.
So new-economy companies appeared ready to square off against trademark law -- until some of the biggest contenders for generic dot-com trademarks went out of business in 2000 and 2001 before their lawyers could get to court. 
That is not to say the requests for generic dot-com trademarks have stopped. In its report, Dechert notes that 1,000 more applications for dot-com marks were filed in 2000 than in 1999 -- including requests for Soup .com, Carparts.com, Groceries .com, Travel.com and even Generic .com (from a company hoping to sell generic goods online.) Though those Internet domain names are protected by registration, slight variations in spelling could allow competitors to claim similar brands. With a trademark, the owners of those names could theoretically stop the practice.
The Dechert report pointed out that the company that applied for a trademark on "1-888-Mattress" won an appeal of the trademark office's initial rejection. The patent office appeals board ruled that incorporating "888" into a trademark was valid because it is not a word and did not fall under the agency's generic-word rules. Mr. Gundersen theorized that proponents of generic dot-com trademarks could make the same argument. 
"It includes the 'dot,' " Mr. Gundersen said, "and is sort of there to direct you to a location the way 888 is."
It may well be a question of whether anyone thinks the issue is worth pursuing in court, given the economic condition of the dot-com business. During the Internet boom, it seemed vital to stake a claim to a Web address that would become a brand name. As a result, the trademark office was swamped with 265,000 applications in 1999 -- a 32 percent jump over 1998.
The boom lasted about as long as the Internet rush, Dechert found. The jump in applications occurred in the first half of 2000, and by April, when the Nasdaq tumbled, trademark requests began to drop. Applications in March 2000 were higher than any March in the 1990's, but they began to fall in April and declined for the rest of the year. 
"You're filing trademark applications half the time based on future intent to use the mark," Mr. Gundersen said. "So it really does give a signal about how optimistic or unoptimistic people are about new product launches."
The lack of confidence was plain in the recession of the early 1990's, when trademark applications were at a low. In 1992, they began to climb and increased sharply in 1999.
Overall totals are still up: there were 287,000 applications in 2000, an increase of more than 22,000 from 1999. So while the general economy may have turned, times are still good for trademark lawyers, prior-art researchers and the fee-based Patent and Trademark Office.
Buzz words come and go. Trademarks using "cyber," "Web" and "e-" names were popular not long ago because they lent an Internet flavor to a brand. Now, Mr. Gundersen said, the registration of Internet domain names, or addresses, has become a prerequisite for trademarks. His report says many companies abandon potential trademark ideas because they cannot register the corresponding domain name. 
To come up with names that can be trademarked and are not likely to have already been registered as domain names, people applying for trademarks have been more likely to make up names (Cingular, Accenture, Verizon and other corporate identities), use deliberate misspellings (Linx, Cheez, Phynd, Babeeezz), create unusual combinations (Brainshark, Mindquake, Glassbrain, Buzzvine, Spineuniverse) or choose personalized marks (MyPets, YourPets).

HEADLINE: Dragon Systems Sputters After Belgian Suitor Fails 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WEST NEWTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
The courtship began in the unlikely setting of the Grand Hungaria hotel in Budapest in September 1999, where a speech recognition conference was under way. Over dinner, Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, founders of the highflying speech recognition software company that bears their names, tried to persuade Janet Baker, who with her husband, James, had founded and nurtured Dragon Systems over 18 years, to combine their resources into one company.
 It was a highly reasoned proposition. The acquisition would combine some of the world's most advanced speech technologies under one company. In a field where Microsoft and I.B.M. were players, Lernout & Hauspie and Dragon would be better off working together than competing against each other. 
 Lernout & Hauspie had approached the Bakers several times over the years about acquiring Dragon, a small but highly respected technology company that had recent success. But this time the circumstances were different: in the preceding two years, Dragon had been through two failed attempts at taking the company public, and its board was strongly considering selling it to a larger company. 
Lernout & Hauspie was not, in fact, Dragon's suitor of choice. Visteon, a Ford Motor Company spinoff with $18 billion in annual revenue, seemed more attractive. But Visteon left Dragon at the corporate altar in February 2000; Visteon would later argue in court papers that it did so at the urging of Lernout & Hauspie. Mrs. Baker then picked up the phone and called Lernout & Hauspie to resume their talks. Within weeks, the deal was done; Dragon was wed to Lernout & Hauspie last June for stock then valued at about $600 million.
But within 60 days, things began to unravel. Unusual spikes in sales from Lernout & Hauspie's Asian division raised questions about the company's finances. Hundreds of millions of dollars in either missing or fictional revenues eventually forced Lernout & Hauspie to file for bankruptcy protection in Belgium and the United States.
Less than a year after the merger, Mr. Lernout and Mr. Hauspie are detained in Belgium, charged with stock manipulation and falsifying documents. The company has become the subject of numerous investigations, and its stock price has dropped more than 99 percent from its record of $72.50; it closed at 63 cents on Friday. It has been an embarrassing episode for the Belgian government and major investors like Microsoft.
The Bakers' tale has become a dramatic side plot to Lernout & Hauspie's financial travails. For the couple, it is not only about the hundreds of millions of dollars lost, but the pain of watching the disintegration of a company that represents two decades of their emotional, intellectual and financial investment. Since the acquisition, more than two-thirds of the 300 or so Dragon employees have left or have been laid off, including the vast majority of its engineers and researchers, who were considered the company's most valuable assets. 
Parts of Dragon's technology have already been sold to help pay Lernout & Hauspie's debts and settle disputes, including a sale of voice recognition technology to Visteon for $13 million -- far less than Mrs. Baker said it was worth. And two weeks ago, Lernout & Hauspie's current chief executive, Philippe Bodson, announced that the company would probably be forced to sell its assets, including the former Dragon, to pay its creditors.
"It's like being caught in the middle of a soap opera, and I've never liked soap operas," said Mrs. Baker, who, like her husband, seems more like a seasoned academic than an archetypal technology entrepreneur. "The idea of being trapped in one is very surreal."
Today, the Bakers spend 30 to 40 hours a week trying to extricate Dragon from Lernout & Hauspie. They have enlisted the law firm of David Boies, who represented the government in the Microsoft antitrust suit and Al Gore in the Florida election recount. The couple has tried to get the bankruptcy court to appoint a separate trustee for Dragon in the bankruptcy proceedings and has spent days testifying in court. The Bakers have expressed their desire to reacquire Dragon, or what is left of it.
But it may be too late to divorce Dragon from Lernout & Hauspie. "Dragon no longer exists," said John Shagoury, a former president of Dragon, who now heads a division of Lernout & Hauspie. "The Dragon technology is part of the business unit within Lernout & Hauspie."
The Bakers remain determined to reclaim their legacy. "If it was put back in the hands of the shareholders of Dragon, it could be rebuilt," Mrs. Baker said. "Surely it's a very strong setback -- you need to have more people and so forth -- but the technology is still at the top of its field."
The Lernout & Hauspie debacle is a sour patch for a 30-year-long speech technology love story. The Bakers built their marriage and lives around speech recognition, having met at Rockefeller University when they were graduate students in the early 1970's.
They worked together in a variety of speech research posts, and when they found themselves unemployed in 1982, they formed their own company in the nascent speech recognition industry, with no venture capital financing and no business plan.
What they did have were two young children, enough savings to last them about a year and a half, and a large mortgage on their white Victorian house, which also served as the company's first headquarters. The company's name came from Mrs. Baker's longtime passion for dragons, which her husband came to share. 
Today, their Victorian house is still filled with hundreds of dragons from all around the world -- ceramic, wooden, plush, metal, miniature, large, fierce and adorable. A wooden plaque that reads "Dragons' Lair" is on the front door. Even the wallpaper in the bathroom has dragons. 
It is from this house that the Bakers handle most of their legal battles. "The year of the dragon has been horrible for the company," said Mrs. Baker, referring to the Chinese zodiac designation for the year 2000.
The financial scandal that engulfed Lernout & Hauspie is a bitter irony for Dragon, a company that had followed a conservative fiscal course throughout its existence.
Speech technology is an exciting field that has always operated largely on its potential, promise and promotion. But Dragon Systems did not act like an explosive technological start-up. For its first 12 years, Dragon accepted no outside financing, subsisting on a modest diet of government contracts and special projects until a quarter of the company was sold to Seagate Technologies in 1994.
Mr. Baker immersed himself in the research, and Mrs. Baker, who has been dubbed the "Dragon Lady" by some in the industry for her ferocious negotiating, took charge of the business side.
After 15 years of modest success, the company finally had a big payoff in 1997 with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, inexpensive desktop software that recognized nearly continuous, almost natural speech. It became a top-selling software package, the salvation of bad typists and those suffering pain from the stress of keyboard use. The company won dozens of industry awards and was portrayed as a technological David battling the Goliath I.B.M. In one year, Dragon's revenues tripled.
By all accounts, the sudden growth spurt strained Dragon's ability to manage itself, which pushed it down the path of acquisition. There was a certain amount of financial naivete within the company, former and current employees say. The tight controls that helped Dragon through its early, lean years may have hindered it as it grew. For example, Janet Baker, as chief executive, personally had to authorize any purchase over $500 -- in a company with revenue that had by then reached $60 million.
Even in hindsight, the Bakers say there were no visible signs of Lernout & Hauspie's problems. For the deal, Dragon hired a premier crop of advisers -- Goldman, Sachs; Arthur Andersen; and the Boston law firm of Hale & Dorr -- all of whom approved the transaction. "We didn't cut any corners," Mrs. Baker said. "I don't know what we could have done differently."
Former executives at Dragon still defend the value of the acquisition, fraud charges aside. "The integration of the two technologies has gone even better than we hoped it would," said Jeanne McCann, a former vice president for development at Dragon who now works for Lernout & Hauspie. She pointed to the introduction of software that allows police officers to dictate their notes directly to a computer as a successful integration of the two technologies. 
In addition, other speech technology companies, like Speechworks and Nuance, have also had drops in their stock prices of more than 95 percent in the overall market downturn. "I don't know how much difference their fate would have been as shareholders, had there not been fraud," Ms. McCann said.
The speech technology industry, analysts say, will eventually recover from these setbacks. And people involved with Dragon agree that for the Bakers, the money is largely beside the point. The real tragedy for them is the loss of an innovative company's culture and the scattering of Dragon's concentration of talented engineers and researchers to other companies. 
Lernout & Hauspie's announcement that it would sell assets has created some hope for the Bakers, but it is so far unrealized. "If the Bakers found a financial backer with the right financial offer, the company and the creditors would certainly consider it," Mr. Shagoury of Lernout & Hauspie said.
But the Bakers say they have not yet received a warm reception to their overtures, although they remain upbeat as their legal battles continue. "Maybe this is the natural evolution of the dragon," Mrs. Baker said. "Dragons have a history of making themselves over."

No Epitaph Yet for Pay Phones
Charlie Sullivan, president of ComChoice, a private pay phone company in Texas, disputes the widespread notion that cell phones are pushing pay phones off the American landscape.

HEADLINE: America the Roughneck (Through Europe's Eyes) 

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 6 

 BODY:
Before becoming president, George W. Bush seemed acutely aware of the need for a country as powerful as the United States to show restraint. "If we are an arrogant nation, they will resent us," he said. "If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us."
 The words appear to have been forgotten. A torrent of hostile articles in Europe has greeted Mr. Bush's first three months in office. Their chief theme has been the arrogance of what the German weekly Der Spiegel recently called "the snarling, ugly Americans." 
 On its Web site, the respected Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung lists seven articles summing up the themes of Mr. Bush's first 100 days. They are not unrepresentative of widespread European views. 
The titles include: "Selling Weapons to Taiwan: Bush Throws His Weight Around in the Pacific"; "North Korea: Bush Irritates the Asians"; "World Court: No Support From United States"; "Iraq: Bombing Instead of Diplomacy"; and "Climate Agreement: The United States Abandons the Kyoto Protocol."
There can be little doubt that it was irritation over those and other issues that lay behind the vote last week that ousted the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission for the first time, while leaving countries like Algeria and Libya as elected members.
Speaking in Berlin today, Richard C. Holbrooke, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, described the administration's foreign policy as "unsmooth" and the handling of environmental issues as "disastrous." But he noted that the Bush team is still taking shape and that transitions always involve difficulties.
Certainly, Mr. Bush's predecessor had problems. In their current irritation, European officials appear to have forgotten that the president whose absence they now seem to rue -- Bill Clinton -- infuriated them in his first year in office by appearing to pay scant attention to the Continent, dithering over Bosnia, and long delaying his first visit.
Those officials, and particularly the French, also seem inclined to overlook the fact that discomfort or irritation with the extent of post-cold-war American power -- military, political, economic and cultural -- has been running high for some time.
Well before Mr. Bush's arrival in office, France began referring to the United States as a "hyper-power." Other countries, from Russia to China, have also made much of the need for "counterbalances" to American power. In this sense, any missteps by the Republican administration have provided ammunition for a gun already partly loaded.
But Mr. Bush's apparent insensitivity to European concerns on a broad range of issues -- he has never visited London or Paris or Berlin -- has clearly opened the way for a season of America bashing.
Celebrating the record number of votes -- 52 of a possible 53 -- won by France in the election that ousted the United States, Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United Nations, attributed his country's success to a French foreign policy "founded on dialogue and respect."
The message was clear: the embarrassing snub to the United States could be attributed to a seeming absence of "dialogue and respect" in the Bush administration's approach to the outside world.
In their glee at America's discomfort in the vote, the Chinese used language similar to that used by the French. The ousting, for China, showed that the United States had "undermined the atmosphere for dialogue."
The time has arrived for the United States "to enter into dialogue on equal footing with other countries, rich or poor, strong or weak" and to stop using "human rights issues as a tool to pursue its power politics and hegemonism," China said.
Instructions from China on human rights seem certain to raise as many eyebrows in Washington as French tips on diplomacy do. But there is little doubt that Mr. Bush's generally more confrontational stance on Russia and China, his apparently slow learning curve on how much the environment matters to Europeans and his lukewarm support for South Korea's so-called sunshine policy for improving relations with the North have reinforced a European sense that the United States is a power more inclined than before to ride roughshod over its allies.
When Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic aide to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, visited Washington earlier this year, he was surprised to find Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, telling him that he must be aware that the only way to get results from the Russians was to be tough with them.
That was one small example of the ways in which the Bush administration seems to be out of step in its thinking with a European Union disinclined to reopen divisions on the Continent and generally more concerned about the quality of food and the environment than possible security threats from Moscow or North Korea.
But Karl Kaiser, a German foreign policy analyst, said he thought that awareness of those differences was growing in the Bush administration and he questioned whether there was any deep justification for European anxieties.
He noted that Mr. Bush's recent policy speech on a possible missile defense shield was marked by extreme sensitivity to allied and Russian concerns. The antimissile project, Mr. Kaiser went on, is no longer "national" but intended to help all friendly countries; it will be built only after thorough consultation.
"Through this speech, Mr. Bush clearly differentiated himself from the Republican right wing and marked a return to the mainstream of multilateralism," Mr. Kaiser said. 
How far such a "return" will go remains to be seen; currents of unilateralism seem far stronger in this administration than in any for some time. But it does seem clear that the speech reflected the concern of Colin L. Powell's State Department -- the one office of the Bush administration that has been spared the harsh criticism reserved in Europe for the Pentagon and the White House.
One particular target of European criticism has been President Bush's policy toward China, and particularly his strong expressions of support for Taiwan that have been widely viewed as unnecessarily provocative. Europe, like Russia, has been concerned that America is throwing its weight around in a reckless manner. 
But James R. Lilley, a former United States ambassador to China, said that while it was fair to say that, "Until you get your act together, you are going to cause some concern," the Europeans had overstated the dangers.
"The fact is China and Taiwan are moving together economically," he said. "The compelling fact of making money together undercuts the notion of estrangement." No American weapons sales to Taiwan would alter that reality, he said. 
In the end, it may be style as much as substance that is causing the growing hostility to the United States. The revival of some cold war language under Mr. Bush and the emergence into clearer view of another America more concerned with itself and quite at ease with the death penalty has come as a shock to many outside the country.
In Britain the other day, The Guardian described America's position on the death penalty as "morally untenable." Of course, that position may be many things, but it is scarcely "untenable," just as America's human-rights record may have blemishes but is hardly comparable to that of Algeria.
That, however, is not the point. The fact is Mr. Bush has contrived to prove his own theory that arrogance provokes resentment for a country that, long before his arrival, was already the world's most conspicuous and convenient target.

HEADLINE: 4 Democrats Spar Cordially In Mayor Race 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The four major Democrats who are seeking to be New York's next mayor strode out on the public stage for their first televised debate yesterday, gently jousting over such subjects as cutting taxes, disciplining the four officers in the Amadou Diallo case, and whether the city should help finance the construction of stadiums for the Mets and Yankees.
 But for the most part, the four offered a fairly uniform view of where they would take the city once Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani leaves office at the end of the year, as well as similar judgments of how Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, succeeded and failed over the last eight years. 
 The hourlong debate -- with Fernando Ferrer, Mark Green, Alan G. Hevesi and Peter F. Vallone -- marked the start of a presumably more vibrant chapter in what has to date been a fairly low-flying contest for the Democratic nomination to succeed Mr. Giuliani. Excerpts, Page B3. 
That said, a viewer who stumbled across the 9 a.m. telecast on WNBC, Channel 4, which sponsored the debate with The Daily News, would find little evidence of just how close the candidates believe their competition to be.
To a person, they were cordial and deferential, and more likely to go after their questioners than their opponents. The men who would follow Mr. Giuliani, at times, even raised their hands like schoolchildren as they sought to be recognized by their questioners.
"I'm sorry, Mark, do you want to go first?" Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, inquired gently of Mr. Green, the public advocate, touching his arm as the two men sought to respond at the same time to a question. On the other side of the set at Rockefeller Center, Mr. Vallone, the City Council speaker, kept smiling and praising Mr. Hevesi as "my friend," even as he sought to diminish the importance of the job Mr. Hevesi holds as the city comptroller.
Still, the debate provided the four major candidates on the Sept. 11 Democratic primary ballot a chance to lay out their appeals to a viewing audience that was, presumably, far larger than any they had faced over months of appearances at union halls, churches, community meetings and on the steps of City Hall.
For Mr. Vallone, that meant claiming credit for what he said were the city's advances over the last eight years -- "We've made the city a lot better" -- while saying that he was the only one who would not need on-the-job training.
Mr. Ferrer lamented what he saw as the huge disparity between those who had prospered under Mr. Giuliani and those who had not, particularly when it came to public spending on education and housing.
Mr. Green presented himself as "a fighter and a problem solver," pledging to reduce class sizes in lower grades in school and to push to create new jobs in the city economy.
And Mr. Hevesi repeatedly raised concerns about the budget proposal made by Mr. Giuliani for 2002. He described it as a "time bomb that will detonate the city's fiscal health" in future years, and he repeatedly challenged his panel of questioners to raise the issue.
"Hanging in the air is the question that I posed about the attitude of all of us and the Council about the dangers of this budget in the out years," Mr. Hevesi said at one point. "Should we just leave it hanging there? Because the fiscal monitors are going to be commenting on this. This is deadly serious."
At times, the exchanges among these four longtime figures in New York government sounded a bit like an accounting seminar, particularly when Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Vallone fell into rather arcane discussions about the budget proposal.
One of the hosts, Gabe Pressman of WNBC, kept jumping in to offer definitions of such phrases as out years and debt service for an audience that might not be as well versed on the subject.
Even in this clubby atmosphere, the candidates drew some distinctions among them.
Both Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Hevesi said the four police officers who fatally shot Mr. Diallo, an unarmed immigrant, should be dismissed from the Police Department for what Mr. Ferrer described as "a demonstration of manifestly awful and tragic judgment," even though the officers had been cleared by a jury in State Supreme Court and after an internal police investigation. When one of the hosts, Michael Kramer of The Daily News, asked whether Mr. Ferrer was trying to make scapegoats of the officers, Mr. Ferrer vigorously disagreed.
"It's not about making scapegoats," Mr. Ferrer responded. "This is about, Michael, accountability."
Mr. Hevesi, who has been criticized by some Democrats for being reticent about police misconduct before he began campaigning, took a notably harsh line. "My attitude is that they have not been exonerated and shouldn't be serving as police officers now."
By contrast, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Green, who has historically been one of the Police Department's vocal critics, said they should not be fired. "The killing of Amadou Diallo was a great tragedy, but a court said it was not a crime," Mr. Green said. "As a lawyer who believes in due process, I think it is very inadvisable for a politician like the mayor or a candidate for mayor to intervene in an individual proceeding and say, 'Off with their heads,' before we know the evidence and we know the result."
Mr. Vallone said that the responsibility "is not with those four police officers, it's with the training and procedure that led to that."
All four candidates seemed surprised when Mr. Kramer asked them whom they would vote for in a hypothetical contest with Mr. Giuliani and two former Democratic mayors, David N. Dinkins and Edward I. Koch.
Mr. Vallone instantly responded, saying Mr. Koch. That drew appreciative, if slightly cynical, laughter from the other candidates, aware that Mr. Koch has endorsed Mr. Vallone. Mr. Green said Mr. Dinkins, a response that was not surprising considering that Mr. Green has been actively seeking the support of Mr. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor.
By contrast, Mr. Ferrer, who has also been seeking Mr. Dinkins's support, seemed to be caught off guard. Rather than using the opportunity to continue his courtship of Mr. Dinkins, he offered such an equivocal answer that Mr. Kramer cut him off, saying, "Right, O.K., we get it, you want to dodge it."
Mr. Hevesi did not answer the question at all. Instead, sounding like the college professor that he was, he scolded Mr. Kramer for even asking it. "That's the kind of question that's intended to get less information and more contention, which comports to a journalistic culture," Mr. Hevesi said sternly. "So I'm not sure I need to offend any of these distinguished New Yorkers by selecting one as against the other."
Of the four, Mr. Green was the only candidate who ruled out using city money to finance the construction of new sports stadiums, saying it would drain money from other city programs. Mr. Hevesi said the city should do it, if it could afford it, and Mr. Vallone argued that such an investment would spur economic growth. Mr. Ferrer said he supported only a minimal public investment in stadium building.
"This is again about choices," Mr. Ferrer said. "That mayoral plan to build a billion-dollar stadium on the West Side of Manhattan was an allegory about choices. Are we all going mad as a city when we're prepared to empty our pockets of more than a billion dollars when we need to build schools, affordable housing, libraries and health care?"
The four candidates also suggested that teacher salaries should be raised to make New York more competitive with the suburbs. Mr. Ferrer reiterated his call for a 30 percent increase, tied to concessions on work rules from teachers. That promise drew an arch response from his rivals, who suggested he should not be negotiating from the platform of a mayoral campaign.
"You don't talk about percentage increase, certainly not as a mayor or a mayoral candidate," Mr. Vallone said. Mr. Green said he supported "higher pay -- but you don't give away 30 percent on a TV show." 
Both Mr. Green and Mr. Ferrer criticized Mr. Giuliani's call for more tax cuts. Mr. Green said that given the city's economy, "neither a tax hike or cut, I think, would be prudent right now." Mr. Ferrer called the mayor's proposed cut in personal income taxes "trivial," and he said it would inevitably force cuts in education and housing spending.
By contrast, Mr. Hevesi said he was prepared, if the city's fiscal situation grew worse, to support a temporary city income tax surcharge, similar to the one that had been used to finance the hiring of police officers, to make "sure we didn't have a teacher shortage, that we had equipment in the classroom, longer school day and an extended curriculum, a core curriculum and all the other reforms that have to be made."
But Mr. Vallone, who is positioning himself to run on the final budget he negotiates with Mr. Giuliani, with at least some tax cuts, scolded Mr. Hevesi. "There's no necessity to be talking about taxes now," Mr. Vallone said. "That's an outrage."
The four candidates all declared that they would put an end to one of the more visible legacies of Mr. Giuliani's tenure: the police checkpoints that prevent New Yorkers from going near City Hall, as well as what some civic groups and journalists have complained is the difficulty of getting information from City Hall.
"I would open up the park, open up the government," Mr. Green said.
Mr. Ferrer put it more bluntly: "My answer is -- with a front-end loader. The first day I'm mayor."

HEADLINE: Dream Prize Draws Closer For Murdoch 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
As Rupert Murdoch's dream of owning a satellite television system in the United States came a big step closer to reality last week, rival media companies began bracing for Mr. Murdoch to become an even fiercer competitor in the American TV industry. 
 After months of tentative discussions, the board of General Motors agreed on Tuesday to begin negotiating in earnest to sell control of G.M.'s Hughes Electronics division to Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation. 
 Hughes contains several businesses. But the prize is DirecTV, the fast-growing satellite television service now in nearly 10 million American households. As the nation's third-largest provider of subscription TV, it ranks behind only AT&T (with more than 15 million subscribers) and Time Warner Cable (13 million), and has become a force in an arena once fully controlled by the cable industry. 
The general consensus is that DirecTV would give new leverage to the News Corporation -- already a TV power with its Fox broadcasting network, 33 local stations and cable holdings like the Fox News Channel and a clutch of regional Fox Sports networks.
Barry Diller, chairman of the cable and broadcasting company USA Networks, said he would regard a Murdoch-owned DirecTV as "the first real competition to cable."
"He will cut the prices," Mr. Diller said, "and use every competitive strategy to create a winning path for satellite."
News Corporation, citing the negotiations, said it had no official comment on the possible deal, which the companies said they hoped to complete within a few weeks. 
Despite building DirecTV's growth from a mere 1.5 million subscribers in 1996, Hughes under G.M. has not been in a position to bring the media muscle to the business that News Corporation could. 
Mr. Murdoch has said that his company could double the DirecTV subscriber base, to nearly 20 million, by significantly lowering prices and aggressively marketing the product through his Fox TV outlets. He could also eliminate Hughes's middleman status and reap the revenues directly each time a DirecTV viewer watches one of News Corporation's 20th Century Fox films on pay-per-view.
And because News Corporation already owns satellite networks serving more than 100 million households around the world -- with heavy concentrations in Britain, China and India -- Mr. Murdoch has the power to buy consumer receiving equipment in bulk. That could enable DirecTV to lower substantially the average cost -- now estimated at more than $500 a household -- of acquiring each new customer.
"The rationale for Hughes to align itself with News Corporation is to effectively drive down the cost of acquiring customers," said Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at UBS Warburg.
Analysts, meanwhile, say DirecTV would allow Mr. Murdoch to start new channels on his own without an initial reliance on cable companies.
All pieces of Hughes, though, would not be an ideal fit for News Corporation. One operation, Hughes Network Systems, which provides private business satellite networks for companies like Wal-Mart, would bring no clear synergies. Selling it might be an option, analysts said.
Hughes also owns 81 percent of PanAmSat, a major relayer of programming for networks that span the cable dial, including CNN from AOL Time Warner, ESPN from Walt Disney and MTV from Viacom. 
While control of PanAmSat might seem to give Mr. Murdoch awesome power over his media rivals, analysts note that it is primarily a common carrier already locked into long-term contracts that would be difficult to change. Besides, any attempt to coerce customers could drive them to PanAmSat's successful rival, GE Americom, and draw objections from regulators.
People inside and outside News Corporation say that if it does gain control of Hughes, the company may consider selling the PanAmSat stake, which has a current market value of $4.3 billion, to help finance the Hughes purchase, expected to cost around $7.2 billion. Finding a buyer, particularly in the current economic climate, may not be easy, though.
"There are not a lot of people looking to buy PanAmSat," said William Kidd, a satellite analyst at C. S. Unterberg, Towbin.
More complementary to the News Corporation empire is the DirecTV Latin America unit, whose only rival in the region is Mr. Murdoch's Sky Latin America. Hughes has a 78 percent stake in DirecTV Latin America, with the Cisneros Group, a Venezuelan media giant, as a minority investor. The service has slightly more than 1.4 million subscribers, compared with about 1.5 million subscribers for Sky Latin America, which News Corporation owns in a partnership with Grupo Televisa of Mexico and Rede Globo of Brazil.
Both of the Latin services are losing money. And although the losses are declining, Larry Haverty, an analyst at State Street Research, said that satellite TV was a luxury product in Latin America, and as such its market was limited. In the past, the two Latin America satellite services have explored a merger to save costs, and consolidating the operations under News Corporation could increase the likelihood of eventually turning a profit, Mr. Haverty said.
For Mr. Murdoch, though, a potentially bigger lure for the Hughes deal is the various benefits it would bring to his media operations in the United States, where News Corporation has tended to operate in the shadow of companies like AOL Time Warner.
DirecTV, for example, offers viewers an interactive programming guide that lists the schedules of the various channels. To view any program on the schedule, a user need only highlight the program's listing with the remote control, then push a button. Mr. Murdoch could replace this DirecTV guide with the Gemstar TV Guide interactive guide, a business of which News Corporation already owns 43 percent. Consumer advocates have raised concerns that television providers might use such guides to favor their own programming. The News Corporation has said it does not intend to use its guide unfairly.
One top executive at a major cable company said he was more worried that News Corporation could use DirecTV to force cable operators to pay higher rates to carry the popular regional Fox Sports networks, under the threat of otherwise distributing them only on the satellite service. But one News Corporation executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, called this an unfounded fear. It would not be in New Corporation's interests to alienate cable companies that it will have to continue to rely on for distribution of its cable channels.
Certainly, though, DirecTV could give Mr. Murdoch new leverage in persuading companies like AOL Time Warner to carry new Fox cable channel offerings in return for placing their new offerings on DirecTV.
At least one big rival said last week he had no fear of a News Corporation-DirecTV deal. Speaking at a Credit Suisse First Boston conference last week, Gerald M. Levin, AOL Time Warner's chief executive, said he believed that digital cable systems were ultimately far better positioned than satellite TV to offer high-speed Internet and interactive services like movies on demand and the ability to purchase goods through interactive TV. That is because cable allows for more efficient two-way communication, while satellite television has no built-in return path. (Satellite users are typically forced to use cumbersome phone connections to communicate with the system operator.)
But Jack Myers, chief economist of the Myers Reports, which publishes media and research newsletters, said in an interview that the News Corporation's BSkyB satellite service in Britain, which depends on phone lines for the return path, was already offering the sorts of interactive services that are still experiments for American cable companies. BSkyB has five million British customers who can use their satellite television systems to do banking, purchase Domino's pizzas and even gamble on sports events.
A News Corporation executive said the company believed it could offer similar services here in relatively short order with DirecTV -- especially with the help of Microsoft, which has agreed to be a minority partner in the Hughes deal, kicking in $3 billion. 
Of course, all this assumes a deal can be completed. On Thursday, Charles Ergen, chief executive of DirecTV's smaller rival, EchoStar Communications, said during a conference call with analysts that he thought his company would be a better partner for DirecTV. His comments prompted speculation that he might make his own bid for Hughes. EchoStar did not refute that speculation, although executives at Hughes and News Corporation said on Friday that they thought it was unlikely such a bid would succeed.
Those who have watched Mr. Murdoch closely over the years say he has a way of succeeding when he puts his mind to things, and he certainly has put his mind to controlling DirecTV.
"People have always underestimated Rupert Murdoch," said Mr. Myers, who pointed to Mr. Murdoch's earlier ventures, Fox and Fox News Channel, which have succeeded despite early skepticism. "And he continues to operate in a marketplace where expectations are low though performance is high."

HEADLINE: In Surprise, Novartis Gets A 20% Stake In Roche 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 7 

 BODY:
Novartis startled investors today by announcing that it had bought a 20 percent stake in Roche Holding for $2.8 billion in cash, raising the prospect that the two drug makers might later merge.
 Each company is a global pharmaceutical giant, and both are based in Basel, Switzerland. In recent years Novartis, with a strong crop of new drugs, has grown faster than Roche and has overtaken it in size. Sluggish sales of Xenical, Roche's flagship anti-obesity drug, and a thin pipeline of new products have diminished the prospects for the company, once the world's biggest and most profitable drug maker. 
 The announcement of the Novartis move ignited a storm of takeover speculation in the Swiss drug industry, a crucial part of the country's economy. A combination would create a company with more than $20 billion in pharmaceutical sales a year, a more formidable rival to the biggest companies in the industry, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis is itself the product of a blockbuster 1996 merger combining two Swiss drug and chemical makers, Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy. It now employs 69,000 people and operates in 142 countries; Roche has 65,000 workers in 150 countries.
Novartis said it had acquired 32 million Roche "bearer" shares, whose ownership is not registered by the company, for $87 apiece, about 5 percent more than their closing price of $83.20 a share on Friday.
"This is a long-term financial investment, which is also strategic in nature," said Daniel Vasella, chairman and chief executive of Novartis. In a telephone interview, Mr. Vasella said his company's purchase "came as a surprise" to Roche.
"No collaboration has been discussed with Roche management," he said, "although we hope over time we will be able to explore areas of collaboration, as Roche has good long-term business prospects."
Novartis has no timeline for a merger, Mr. Vasella said, adding that such a move would have to be preceded by a look at the product lines. A merger, he said, "is not a must, but it would be great."
Many analysts had thought the best way for Roche to secure its future was by buying a company with some late-stage drugs ready to bring to market. The company had been mentioned as a potential bidder for the United States pharmaceutical operations of DuPont.
Critics of the Novartis purchase questioned the wisdom of investing in a rival in relatively staid Europe when drug sales in the United States are growing at twice the pace -- 15 percent in the year ended Feb. 28.
Roche sought to dampen speculation of a merger with Novartis, saying that the two companies would merely cooperate when it made sense commercially. 
Michel Venanzi, an analyst at Darier Hentsch, agreed. While Roche's short-term prospects are wobbly, he said, "Roche has a lot of hidden value, including its stake in Genentech, which has a 25 percent sales growth on average." Roche has majority control of Genentech, an American biotechnology company. 
"This purchase clearly has a strategic touch, and is more than just an investment," said Mattias Fehr of Lombard Odier & Cie. "Once everything settles down, it may be clearer what they plan to do."
Roche's shares have slumped because its drug sales rose only 1 percent last year, while competitors were chalking up double-digit gains. Roche has said it is considering layoffs of up to 12 percent of its worldwide staff to cut costs. But Roche officials see a brighter future in the 63 drugs in its development pipeline, and in the Genentech products it markets outside the United States.
Roche management reportedly learned of the Novartis move over the weekend, ending uncertainty over what would become of the block of stock, which had been put up for sale by the Swiss financier Martin Ebner. As Roche's biggest shareholder after the Hoffman and Oeri families, who founded the company's predecessor concerns, Mr. Ebner had campaigned to open up the company's structure, and had accused Roche directors of misleading investors about the company's condition and outlook, especially in last year's annual report. Mr. Ebner wanted the company to name more independent directors and had tried unsuccessfully to win a seat of his own last year.
Unhappy with the 105-year-old company's recent performance and unable to force it to revamp itself, he and his investment company, the BZ Group, decided to sell out instead.
