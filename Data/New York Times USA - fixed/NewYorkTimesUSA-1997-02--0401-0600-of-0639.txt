HEADLINE: Telephone Pact To Alter Rates And Services

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
For Carlos Galvis in Jackson Heights, Queens, the global telecommunications trade agreement signed over the weekend in far-off Geneva may hit quite close to home.
On most evenings, thousands of New York City's Hispanic immigrants flock to travel agencies like the one managed by Mr. Galvis, which also serve as "telephone parlors" where visitors sit in cubicles to call family and friends in Latin America. Mr. Galvis buys long-distance service in bulk, parceling it out minute by minute at prices that while high, are still far lower than what individuals could obtain on their own. 
 Because of the convoluted international telephone economics that the trade pact seeks to simplify, visitors to the phone parlors think nothing of paying about 50 cents a minute for calls that actually cost long-distance carriers a nickel or so to transmit. But if the agreement, negotiated under the World Trade Organization, eventually works as intended, the price of a call from New York to the Dominican Republic may one day cost little more than one to Denver.
"If that happened it would be terrible for the business," said Mr. Galvis, visibly perturbed, as he leaned against the front counter of Biancas Travel on Roosevelt Avenue. "Why would people come here?"
Indeed, people like Mr. Galvis, who have profited from the artificially high price of telephone calls to countries where the governments -- not the marketplace -- dictate prices, would be losers under the trade agreement.
But for United States telecommunications customers -- whether multinational corporations or individual consumers -- the agreement should mean lower prices and better voice, data and video services. American long-distance companies are happy, too, at the prospect of eventually competing in more overseas markets and no longer seeing their international pricing dictated by foreign governments.
The agreement, signed on Saturday by more than 60 nations, is expected to remove many countries' barriers to foreign ownership of telecommunications companies, resulting in greater competition. Though there has been some opposition to it in Washington, Congress is not expected to block it.
"There is great potential benefit to having broad-based global competition," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "This market has such great potential for competition that openness could yield tremendous savings."
Big corporate customers agree.
The deal could be "terrific for business users," said Brian R. Moir, chief counsel for the International Communications Association, a Washington-based group that represents 500 companies and organizations that spend a total of $35 billion each year on domestic and overseas telecommunications services.
"Competition brings more choice," Mr. Moir said. "It brings higher quality and lower prices."
American consumers and companies spend about $14 billion on international telecommunications services each year. That includes private data lines for computers, as well as old-fashioned telex and even telegraph services. A vast majority of the traffic, though, is plain old telephone service -- about 16 billion minutes' worth in 1995, the last year for which figures were available from the Federal Communications Commission.
The price of those calls is determined to a great extent by what the foreign phone company -- often, owned by a government -- charges for completing them. And so, the per-minute rates vary greatly from country to country and are often artificially high. While a call to France, for instance, averages 81 cents a minute, one approximately the same distance to the West African nation of Cape Verde averages $5.64 a minute.
"There is no reason that international calls should be any higher than domestic calls that cover the same distance," said Diane Cornell, chief of the telecommunications division of the F.C.C.'s international bureau.
International calls headed from the United States cost customers an average of 91 cents a minute, while the price of domestic long-distance calls averages 16 cents a minute, Ms. Cornell said. But the trade agreement should start reducing that disparity soon, she said.
"If this deal goes through, it will have a catalyst effect within a very short time period," Ms. Cornell said, "and will result in very significant competition in other countries, which will have a very direct effect on rates here."
The deal could cause global telephone rates to fall by 15 percent in the three or four years after the pact goes into effect, estimated Tom L. Elliott, a partner at Arthur Andersen, the consulting firm. "Over a 10-to-12-year period, a trillion dollars could be saved by consumers worldwide," he said.
The most important component of international telephone pricing is the fee that carriers from different countries pay one another to connect an international call to a home or business. This fee is known as the settlement rate, or the accounting rate. For American carriers like AT&T or Sprint, those rates range from the 7 cents a minute that some Canadian carriers charge during off-peak hours to the $2.50 a minute charged by the national telephone monopoly of Myanmar, and higher.
Developing countries often defend high settlement rates as necessary to help finance the construction of telecommunications networks within their borders. But Americans tend to see higher rates as trade barriers.
"The settlement rates are not rational," said Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason, a professor of economics, information and public policy at the University of Michigan. "A lot of them are being driven by protectionist objectives rather than by competitive concerns."
The deal worked out in Geneva does not directly force a reduction in settlement rates. But it does require participating nations to open their communications networks to competition, and United States trade officials and telecommunications experts expect the resulting marketplace forces to drive rates down around the world.
Executives like Jon T. Pojednic can hardly wait.
"For a medium-capacity data line here in the United States we might be paying $300 or $400 a month," said Mr. Pojednic, a telecommunications manager for United Parcel Service of America Inc., which spends about $200 million on telecommunications services each year. "We could be paying as high as two and a half times that in some countries -- in the U.K., for example, in Spain, in France."
And increased competition could do more for his business than simply reduce prices, Mr. Pojednic said. He said that where competition exists telecommunications companies often vie with one another as fiercely to provide good customer service as they do to offer the best prices.
The time between ordering a new telecommunications service and receiving it averages about 30 days in the United States, Mr. Pojednic said, adding that "In the U.K., Spain and France it's anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks."
The deal could also give American companies more flexibility in deciding where to put overseas operations, said Richard S. Christner, a vice president at Mercer Management Consulting. He noted that Britain had already deregulated its telecommunications markets more quickly than France.
"If I'm a financial services company that spends a huge amount of money communicating all the financial transactions and supporting information, the U.K. is a more attractive place to expand and invest," Mr. Christner said. "This is much more likely to level the playing field for decisions on where businesses are going to have attractive opportunities."

But because foreign governments -- not the marketplace -- have often dictated the rates, prices vary greatly.

Ex-Trader at Sumitomo Admits Guilt in Fraud Case
Yasuo Hamanaka, the central figure in a $2.6 billion copper scandal at Sumitomo, admitted he was guilty of forgery and fraud in an arraignment held today in Tokyo, according to press reports. In an arraignment, prosecutors in Tokyo District Court charged that Mr. Hamanaka made the fraudulent transactions to cover up massive copper trading losses that extended over 10 years. When asked to respond, Mr. Hamanaka replied, "that is correct," according to the Associated Press.
Mr. Hamanaka's trial, though, was unlikely to provide answers to the larger question of whether Sumitomo management was at all involved in off-the-book trades. By indicting Mr. Hamanaka on charges of fraud, the prosecutors seemed to drop efforts to probe for misconduct at Sumitomo. [Page 42.]

Small Jets a Cause for Dispute
The bitter confrontation between American Airlines and its pilots' union has some of its roots in an innovation in air travel -- small jets -- that the company wants to use on many shorter routes, replacing turboprop aircraft. While popular with travelers, the jets are seen by many pilots as a way for American to replace larger jets and to assign those flights to much lower paid pilots at American's feeder airline. [1.]

Now that President Clinton has removed the threat of a strike for at least 60 days and started arbitration, American Airlines, which faced heavy losses from a strike, may benefit financially. But whether that help will be permanent remains in question. [48.]

HEADLINE: TV Woos Viewers With News Of Business

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
They can be found in Times Square, in Wall Street trading rooms and in Fortune 500 executive suites, in bars in business districts and in retirement homes from Florida to California. Those television screens with the ticker tape of stock market quotes sliding lazily across the bottom seem to be almost everywhere these days.
And no wonder. With stock markets booming and almost everybody over 30 worried about retirement, a growing audience of baby boomers, stock and bond traders and retired people is tuning in to programs on stocks, bonds, personal investments and every other conceivable financial topic. 
 A seemingly endless stream of analysts, executives and self-styled gurus appears on shows like "Market Wrap," "Street Signs" and "Power Lunch" on CNBC, a unit of the General Electric Company, and "Capital Ideas," "Digital Jam," "Street Sweep" and "Business Unusual" on CNNFN, which is owned by Time Warner Inc. No matter if the sound is turned off -- the screens flash subtitles showing viewers what the talking heads are saying.
Financial television has grown rapidly in the 1990's as programmers sought to attract the millions of Americans who now make more of their own financial decisions. Viewers are offered a succession of interview programs differentiated mostly by what time of the day they appear and what segment of the market they address.
Many broadcasters on these newer channels are reluctant to say much about their ratings, and Nielsen Media, the television ratings company, keeps its numbers private. CNBC, one of the few that reveals such information, says that it now reaches 61 million homes and that in the last quarter of 1996 an average of 2.3 million homes tuned in each week, up slightly from the prior year. It says, moreover, that its audience in the 25-to-54 age group, which is much sought after by advertisers, grew 24 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with a year earlier.
A race in December between CNBC and CNN to provide live ticker quotes running across the bottom of their screens highlighted the growing competition in the field. Previously, such quotes had been run only after a 15-minute delay.
CNBC is the grande dame of financial and business television, having started in 1989. CNNFN, which began broadcasting in December 1995, is trying to build on the success of its parent channel, CNN, and its popular "Moneyline" program, anchored by Lou Dobbs, which broadcasts simultaneously on both CNN and CNNFN. These channels have attracted advertisers like the Charles Schwab Corporation and other mutual fund companies that sell investments to baby boomers, the American Express Company and other credit card businesses and auto companies like the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation.
In addition, Bloomberg Business Television, a unit of Bloomberg L.P., has for years broadcast financial and business programming. And last month, Dow Jones & Company and the ITT Corporation joined forces to launch WBIS, a cable channel that broadcasts an eclectic mixture of business and sports programming.
All four channels broadcast their programming primarily in the daytime, and occasionally it can seem inescapable. "I'm struck, as everybody is, by the ubiquity of it," James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, said. "You see it everywhere."
Statistics aside, many business people have come to regard financial television as increasingly important to their professional lives, even though they often gripe about the shallowness of the insights being proffered. Perhaps that should not be surprising, some regular viewers say, since the smartest analysts are too busy making money to make television appearances.
For some investment managers, though, financial television is a great marketing tool. "I think it's a terrific way to get the word out," said Elaine Garzarelli, who runs a research and investment management firm and appears on both CNBC and CNNFN. "If you appear, at least you can get the story straight," Ms. Garzarelli said. In Florida, where Ms. Garzarelli lives, "70 percent of the neighbors watch it all day long," she said.
Some regulars on the shows maintain that appearances on financial television bolster their image with investors. "These kinds of appearances give me credibility," Wayne Angell, chief economist at Bear Stearns & Company and a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said, adding that he liked the fact that CNBC sends a television crew to his office when it wants to put him on camera.
"It's an important outlet for me to show my face to my clients," said John E. Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide Information Services, a financial consultant in New York.
Financial professionals like Mr. Keefe often consider it critical to be familiar with what is being shown on business television. "I check it many times a day," he said.
But even some who appear on the shows are skeptical about the lasting effect of appearances on financial and business television. "An appearance on a major network program such as the 'Today' program or 'Nightline' is much more important than being on these financial shows," said Harold L. Vogel, managing director at Cowen & Company, a New York investment bank.
Mr. Keefe, who worked as an analyst on Wall Street for years, has reservations about the new financial programming. "What I see as a problem, a potential problem, is having every Tom, Dick and Harry money manager come on and recommend stocks. How can some of them talk about any stock whatsoever, from I.B.M. to Pepsi?" he said. "How can any analyst really understand and comment on such very different companies? The guys who probably have the most knowledge and the most business don't go on. They can't take an hour out of their day to go on."
Some critics take an even more jaundiced view. "The problem is they have to fill up dead air," said Allan Ripp, a New York public relations consultant. "Most of the traders who have these things on have the sound turned off."
Clearly, the audience for business programming is growing, although perhaps not as fast as some think. The 2.3 million households that tuned in each week to CNBC in the fourth quarter of 1996 represented only a 4 percent increase from the year earlier, according to George H. Jamison, a company spokesman. But, he added, that number only includes households and does not include the many offices and businesses where screens show the channel. Those outlets probably bump the number up to about 3.2 million, he said.
The channel's most popular show, "Market Wrap," which is on from 4 P.M. to 5 P.M. on weekdays, has about a quarter-million viewers at any one time, Mr. Jamison said, adding, "We get our heaviest viewing in the afternoon."
The rite of passage for financial television, however, is likely to come when the financial markets' joy ride ends and the stock market takes a dive. As Mr. Grant, the newsletter publisher, put it: "People like to watch themselves getting richer. The true test of financial television will be if investors want to watch themselves get poorer."

HEADLINE: For Remote Bird Species, the Sex of Hatchlings Is No Surprise

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

 BODY:
AMONG parents, one question never fails to arouse a lively debate: Which is the preferable sex to raise, boys or girls? While nearly everyone has an opinion on this impossible-to-resolve question, it remains the uncontrollable biological reality of sperm meeting egg rather than parental preference that casts the die for a little Jack or tiny Jill.
One thousand miles off the east coast of Africa, however, on a remote island in the Seychelles, researchers have discovered a bird that is able to produce a male or a female offspring according to its changing needs with uncanny precision. 
 "I was surprised," said Dr. Jan Komdeur, a lecturer in animal behavior at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who discovered the bird's behavior. "But I thought it was a very clever thing." Dr. Komdeur and his colleagues published their study in the Feb. 6 issue of the journal Nature.
In fact, evolutionary theorists have been arguing since early in the century that ideally, parents of any species should adjust the ratio of male to female offspring that they produce, depending upon the evolutionary payoff, or how much it costs to produce a male or female relative to how many young that offspring is likely to produce. But for many years, only wasps and bees showed any indication that they could alter the ratio of male to female young.
Now new studies, including the latest and most striking one with Seychelles warblers, are beginning to show that whether they be rats, birds or bees, when it comes to producing young, parents can sexually discriminate and do.
"This is very big news," said Dr. Patricia Adair Gowaty, an evolutionary ecologist at the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia in Athens, calling the study an "instant classic."
Dr. Stephen Emlen, the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Behavioral Ecology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., called the study "awesome," saying: "It's going to raise eyebrows. There are going to be people so astonished by this that they are going to challenge it."
In the Seychelles, the only place in the world where these warblers are found, they live in pairs, each on their own territory. But on the 70 acres of tiny Cousin island, there are not always enough territories for every bird to get a mate and make a home. So many young birds, usually females, stay at home with their parents and learn the tricks of the trade by helping out. They help build nests, defend the territory, incubate eggs and feed newborn chicks.
Helpers are only beneficial when there is enough food on the territory and no more than two such assistants. With more helpers or too little food, they become a liability as they compete with parents and chicks for scarce insect meals. So, the theory goes, parents should produce females when helpers would be useful and males when they would not.
Using DNA tests to determine the sex of newly hatched chicks (both sexes look the same), researchers found that the birds produce young in their natural habitats exactly as theory would predict.
Researchers were also able to carry out an unusually convincing test. They moved pairs of warblers from territories without much food on Cousin to territories with lots of food on the neighboring islands of Aride and Cousine (not to be confused with Cousin, the island of origin) where no Seychelles warblers live. Pairs that had produced mostly or all males on Cousin when they had little food to share suddenly began producing mostly or all females to help out in the more bountiful new territories.
A huge obstacle in studying birds had been the difficulty of telling the sex of chicks. But even in those few species where researchers could tell male and female chicks apart, the deviations from a 1-to-1 sex ratio were so subtle that many doubted if parents were up to anything at all. In fact, the conventional wisdom became that birds were physiologically incapable of any precise control over what sex chick they produced.
Bees and wasps, on the other hand, have long been thought to manipulate the sex of their young.
For example, Dr. John Werren, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Rochester, studies parasitic wasps that lay their eggs on caterpillars and other insects. Large female wasps that have grown up on a big juicy caterpillar do much better than small females, as they are able to produce many more eggs. Males, on the other hand, do fine whether they are large or small. What researchers have found is that quite logically, when a mother wasp finds a nice big caterpillar, she lays a female. When she finds a puny one, she leaves behind a male.
But in wasps and bees, the method for manipulating the sex of offspring is clear. When a mother wasp wants to produce a male, she lays an unfertilized egg. To produce a female, she fertilizes the egg with her cache of sperm before laying it.
But as for the birds, "how in heaven's name are they doing it?" Dr. Emlen asked. "No one has any idea."
In birds, sex is determined, as in humans, by sex chromosomes. In humans, men carry two different sex chromosomes, an X and a Y, and women carry two X chromosomes. That means every woman's egg has an X chromosome, and the child's sex is determined by the father's sperm, which provides either a Y, for a boy, or an X, for a girl.
In contrast, in birds it is the females that carry the two different sex chromosomes, a Z and a W, while male birds carry two W chromosomes. So it is the female bird and her egg, carrying a Z or a W chromosome, that determines a chick's sex.
While noting that it remains to be seen just how these birds do it, in principle, Dr. Werren said, a bird that can watch her Z's and W's can exercise a lot of potential control over the sex of her young.
The evolution of sex ratios may appear to be an esoteric topic, but Dr. Gowaty said it might be closer to home than it seemed. "One exciting aspect is if we could select for lines of all-daughter or all-son producers, for example, in chicken or in cattle," Dr. Gowaty said. "You know it's been tried for years and years. But you haven't heard about it, right? That's because no one's been able to do it. But wouldn't that be economically wonderful?"
While the Seychelles warblers, also known as Acrocephalus sechellensis, are a far cry from an all-hen-producing chicken, they are an indication that at least some birds have the capacity to produce all or mostly one sex of young under the right conditions.
Dr. Martha K. McClintock, a biopsychologist at the University of Chicago, said the new sex ratio studies might hit close to home in quite another way.
While there is nothing quite so dramatic as the switches seen in Seychelles warblers, evidence is growing in mammals that mothers tend to produce more male offspring when males may be most successful in mating and more females when they are the better bet for producing new generations. That work, she says, speaks to humans as well.
In mammals, in general, the main method for controlling the sex of the offspring appears to be loss: loss of sperm not used in fertilization and loss of fetuses before they are born. What determines the sex ratio, for example in a litter of pups, is the pattern of loss along the way.
Referring to Dr. Leslie Hornig, also at the University of Chicago, Dr. McClintock points out that there are similar patterns of loss in humans. "We all know it's the sperm that determines the sex, but as Leslie points out, there are millions that don't make it. What determines the ones that do?" Likewise, Dr. McClintock said, the natural abortion of fetuses in women happens more often with male than female fetuses, suggesting that women's bodies may be selecting for or against fetuses of different sexes as well.
So while men's sperm have long borne the sole responsibility, women's bodies may have much more control than previously imagined over which sex is ultimately born.
Dr. McClintock summed it up, saying, "Henry the Eighth might have been more right than we give him credit for."

HEADLINE: Disney Hall: A Mirage Is Looking More Real

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
A decade after Walt Disney's widow, Lillian, donated $50 million for an architecturally imposing concert hall in downtown Los Angeles, local political, business and cultural leaders say they are finally confident that they will be able to raise enough money to prevent Los Angeles County from scrapping the long-stalled project.
Officials of the county, which owns the site for the Walt Disney Concert Hall, have demanded that another $50 million be raised by July 1. As the city's business leaders commit more wealth and prestige to the drive, organizers now expect to approach $100 million in new contributions by the deadline, said Eli Broad, chairman of Sunamerica, the financial services corporation. 
 Reviving the flagging Disney project after years of indifference has taken on the fervor of a crusade in Los Angeles. It is no longer just about the fate of an important cultural institution and showcase for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The concert hall is seen as crucial to shoring up a struggling downtown and demonstrating that the city is a world-class center for the arts.
Mr. Broad and a close friend, Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles, decided while on a trip to France in 1995 that continuing to let the Disney project languish "would mean a black eye for the city," said Mr. Broad, who took charge of the money-raising effort last June.
The Mayor has been soliciting potential donors, Mr. Broad said, and both men say they will give $5 million or more from their own pockets. (Mr. Riordan, who is up for re-election in April, is heavily favored to win.)
Other developments are reinforcing the sales pitch. Models of Disney Hall are on public display, at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, for the first time in the six years since Frank O. Gehry, the internationally known Santa Monica-based architect, completed his free-flowing design, which some have compared to a futuristic sailing ship. It helps that Mr. Gehry's new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has been drawing rave reviews and was built on time and on budget.
Even so, since Mr. Broad signed on, only two large donations have been announced: $7.5 million from an anonymous donor and $5 million from the Times Mirror Foundation, which deliberated for several months before deciding that confidence was warranted. More of the city's chief executives are joining the campaign, however, and the results of their efforts will be announced later.
"Everyone is quite disciplined and focused now on what needs to happen to make Disney Hall work," said Stephen C. Meier, a foundation spokesman.
Less than a year ago, Disney Hall's prospects seemed much dimmer. The Disney family's gifts had swelled to more than $100 million, with interest, but aside from a $2 million donation from the Parsons Foundation, no additional money had been pledged. And while agencies squabbled over the project, the price tag, originally put at $100 million, rose to $265 million.
Mr. Gehry's design was attacked as too complicated and was blamed for the cost increase. Worried about his reputation, the architect told interviewers that he hated going out in public and might even move.
The county, meanwhile, had gone ahead and spent $100 million to build a seven-story underground parking garage. But an office building and hotel that the garage was also intended to serve are no longer contemplated. And while debt service on the garage will be $4.2 million in the next fiscal year, last month the garage had fewer than 400 customers a day for its 2,334 spaces, said a county management analyst, Don Simpson.
To many people, the floundering of Disney Hall was more proof that Los Angeles is a place where "power is divided into so many subsets that it is very hard to do anything in the interests of the city at large," said Richard Weinstein, a professor of architecture at U.C.L.A. A city battered by riots and natural disasters was taking yet another blow to its pride.
But now even Mr. Gehry is upbeat. "Having Mr. Broad involved makes me feel very secure and optimistic," he said. "He's not going to screw it up."
Zev Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles County Supervisor, said that Mr. Broad, the founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art, had "tremendous credibility" in the arts and business communities.
Mr. Broad and Mr. Gehry make a curious team. They have "a history," Mr. Gehry said.
About seven years ago, Mr. Broad commissioned the architect to design his home in Brentwood, but he had the house built before the design was completed. "I was very slow," Mr. Gehry said, "and he was very impatient."
"Every time Frank would finish the design," Mr. Broad recalled, "he'd want to improve it."
Their relationship greatly improved, Mr. Gehry said, after Mr. Broad visited Mr. Gehry's new museum in Bilbao last month. "Something happened to him when he saw Bilbao," Mr. Gehry said. "The guy is turned on."
Other visitors to Bilbao from the Disney fund-raising drive, including Andrea L. Van de Kamp, chairwoman of the Music Center, have also come away impressed by the museum.
The striking use of titanium to clad the Bilbao museum has suggested to Mr. Broad that maybe Disney Hall's exterior should also be predominantly metal instead of limestone. Mr. Gehry cautioned that the building was designed with stone in mind. "If they make it metal like Bilbao," he said, "it's going to look like Son of Bilbao."
Supporters of Disney Hall are promoting it as a key component of a revitalization plan for downtown Los Angeles, including a new sports arena and a replacement for the St. Vibiana Cathedral.
A new hall, they say, would also let the Los Angeles Philharmonic sound as good at home as it does on tour. The orchestra's home is now the 33-year-old Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, which is widely considered a "second-rate acoustical environment," Mr. Yaroslavsky said.
Mr. Gehry wishes that people would pay more attention to the acoustical advantages and less to his exterior design.
But these days, at least, he is no longer afraid of going out in public. "People are smiling at me now," he said.

HEADLINE: Providence Is Reviving, Using Arts As the Fuel

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Feb. 13

 BODY:
On Weybosset Street, Teresa Level is selling works of art on consignment in a small gallery. In a loft upstairs that doubles as a home and production studio, Bob Zolli and his wife, Susan Arundale, are rehearsing songs for a musical they plan to produce in the spring. Around the corner on Empire Street, in a small room that serves as a home and art studio, Chris Horoshak is painting tedious patterns on canvas.
These are the faces of contemporary Providence, a once-gritty manufacturing town now well on the way toward reinvention. They are also the faces of the city's future. 
 These artists are among scores living in the heart of Providence, a square mile of downtown that city officials have turned into an arts and entertainment empowerment zone. Through legislation that went into effect this year, artists and performers from the district pay no state income tax on what they sell; their customers pay no sales tax on what they buy. And in what city and state officials say is the key to the economic redevelopment of the area, the city offers tax breaks to property owners who convert old, unused buildings into residential units.
"Every artist wants to live in lower Manhattan," said Mr. Horoshak, 24, a native of Philadelphia, who pays $250 a month for his cluttered apartment-studio, in a building where he and several other artists share bathrooms and a kitchen in a dormitory-style setting. "But it's difficult to leave a situation like this, where you can live and work in comfort. It's a fantastic place to get momentum."
The arts district is one of the latest projects in Providence, the capital of Rhode Island, to help revitalize a city of 160,000 people that was virtually stilled by a steady migration to the suburbs over the last two decades.
Largely through the efforts of Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., a gregarious Republican-turned-independent who has served 16 of the last 22 years, eyesores like old railroad tracks and abandoned buildings have been cleared out to make way for a spectrum of change. With financial help from the city, state and Federal Government over the last 20 years, old theaters were spruced up, restaurants opened, big hotel chains came to town, the railroad tracks were moved underground, even the rivers running through the city were rerouted to create open space linking the downtown area to two treasures, Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design, or "Risdy," as it is commonly called.
This spring, ground is to be broken for a mall near downtown that will cover 1.3 million square feet and will be the largest shopping area between Boston and New York. And city officials are trying to lure the New England Patriots football team to Providence from Foxboro, Mass., with plans to build an outdoor stadium.
But what of downtown itself? In recent years, its architecturally ornate buildings had fallen into disrepair. Grand stores that served well-dressed customers in the 1940's and 1950's had long been vacated, and only here and there had new retailers moved in. Interstate 95 cut a concrete swath through the heart of the city.
"We had to look at what resources we had and saw that because of Risdy, we found we had more artists per capita than any other city in America," Mr. Cianci said, revving up. "We had artists, so we'd get more artists. We'd become the Florence of America. Ever been to Florence? It's beautiful. You walk along the street and see glass blowers here, leather crafters there. Rehearsal halls. Painters. Ballet dancers. Everywhere. That's what we want to create here. We could be sister cities."
But Providence is counting on more than additional artists and their customers to revitalize its core. Patricia McLaughlin, the city's deputy solicitor, said city and state officials did not even calculate how much revenue the state might lose through the sales and income tax exemptions, figuring that young artists were not earning enough through sales of their works and part-time jobs to make much of a difference.
Gov. Lincoln C. Almond, a Republican whose vetoes of the tax proposals last year were overridden by the legislature, said that the potential losses were "not determinable" but that they "could be significant."
The key to the legislation, Ms. McLaughlin said, was the tax breaks for developers, which officials figured would lead to investments triggering more shops and restaurants. Buildings in the area are now in various states of rehabilitation.
Joseph R. Paolino Jr., who was mayor from 1984 through 1990 during Mr. Cianci's lone hiatus since 1974, said that his family's company, which owns more buildings in the arts district than anyone else, has plans to develop three downtown buildings to create a total of 30 loft apartments.
"And all those people are going to have to eat, right?" Mr. Cianci said. "They got to shop. They go to movies. Besides 20 movie theaters in the new mall, we're getting seven more movie theaters downtown. I made sure of that."
Mr. Zolli, a former Broadway performer and veteran of the traveling company for "Les Miserables," said artists and performers already living in Providence had "the general feeling this is a boom town." He predicted that hundreds more would respond to the city's welcome mat, the way he and his wife did -- drawn not only by tax breaks but also by the relative proximity to New York, about 180 miles southwest, and by lower costs.
"We were looking in Boston," Ms. Arundale said, "but couldn't find anything in a loft that gave us rehearsal space and living space."
For $1,000 a month, they rent 2,850 square feet that includes three bedrooms, two baths and an office in addition to 1,300 square feet of rehearsal space.
"As artists from New York," Mr. Zolli said, "we were used to doors slamming a lot. Here, everything is an open door."
Mayor Cianci acknowledged that it was more than civic pride pushing him to redesign his city.
"It's staying in office," he said. "You know, Winston Churchill once said that a politician gives people what they want and a statesman gives them what they need. This is the only time in my career I'll be able to make them converge. This distinguishes us as a city, gives us a character of our own."
"Anyway, I'm not finished yet," he continued. "The job's not done. I'm going to run again. Then I'm going to relocate I-95."

HEADLINE: Eastern Europe's Wild Capitalism

 BODY:
When asked why the Albanian Government had not stepped in to end recent pyramid schemes before they swindled Albanians out of hundreds of millions of dollars, President Sali Berisha said his inaction was a sign of the Government's commitment to the free market. Even assuming that ideology, not corruption, explains his Government's failure, Mr. Berisha's view is disturbing. Such a misreading of capitalism has caused widespread misery in former Communist countries, which are still learning that the free market works best when not completely free.
The United States learned this only after decades of scandals and crashes. The first Federal regulations came only after the stock market crash of 1929. The same thing is happening now in most of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc. Albania's wrenching experiences, which have sparked protests that now threaten to bring down Mr. Berisha's Government, followed the collapse of similar Ponzi schemes in Russia, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia. 
 Russia's experience was typical. In 1994 a gigantic pyramid scheme called MMM took $1 billion from the Russian people before it was finally closed down by the tax police, the only agency with the legal powers to do so. After its collapse, Russia began to set up the Federal Commission for the Securities Market.
That agency currently employs only 100 people, but it is growing and would probably be able to prevent a similar scheme. Regulators, however, warn that some Russian banks and private pension funds, which are not covered by the securities commission, are in danger of collapse.
People who have spent their lives under Communism are particularly susceptible to such schemes. Anyone who idealized capitalism from a distance for decades tends not to be wary of swindlers promising interest rates of 30 percent a month without explaining how such profits are possible. Many people watch in anger as those who thrived under Communism now get rich through shady deals. The pyramid scams seem like equalizers, opportunities for ordinary citizens to get something too. Few people living on $20 a month would not jump at the chance.
Poland, which has suffered no major scandals, was the only newly capitalist country that started out with regulations on investment offerings. It could do so because its economy had been less deformed by Communism than others and it did not need to restructure by essentially starting from scratch and letting anyone bid for investment.
Other nations were more stunted. Some leaders assumed capitalism was simply the opposite of Communism. They knew that overregulation can stifle the economy, but they did not know about the dangers of underregulation. Many of the countries still have little administrative law to help regulators do their jobs. Citizens are accustomed to a system in which the law is ignored and the powerful are free to make deals with their friends, habits that also flourish under unfettered capitalism.
It is urgent for governments to do everything they can to punish fraud and end the widespread practice of ignoring mounting problems. But true protection for investors will probably have to wait for more modern economies. The most important regulation comes from the market itself. Companies and brokers that want long-term business need to behave themselves. So far, few companies in the get-rich-quick climate of Eastern Europe are worrying about their reputation.

HEADLINE: New Quiz Show Brings Some Levity to All-News Channel

 BODY:
Fred Bellemore is famous on the Vassar College campus in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., for his extensive knowledge.
"I have a reputation," said Dr. Bellemore, an assistant professor of economics. "Not for anything intellectual. For trivia. Sports and television, particularly 'Gilligan's Island.' " 
 So perhaps it was only logical that Dr. Bellemore, 34, would represent the college on a new cable network game show where teams of college faculty and students compete on questions about current events and television history.
At the Columbia School of Journalism, James Carey, 62, was selected for less strategic reasons.
"I was working very late one night and happened to run into an assistant dean in the hall," Dr. Carey said. "He needed someone to compete for Columbia, so I volunteered. To be honest, I don't watch much television."
The new game show, "Remember This," which premiered in October on the all-news cable station MSNBC, is a make over of the long-running "G.E. College Bowl" of the 1960's, with Allen Ludden serving as host. The new show is seen nationally on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and Al Roker, the weatherman for the "Today" show on NBC, is the host.
Instead of questions on chemistry, geography and literature drawn from the pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica, contestants are tested on politics, journalism and pop culture culled from 250,000 hours of NBC News archival footage. The winner returns to campus with a $1,000 check for the school's scholarship fund.
"Remember This" was developed by Robert Mayer, a former CBS News producer, and Sande Stewart, the creator of "The $25,000 Pyramid" -- as a change of pace from the network's all-news schedule.
"We wanted to create a game show that was fun while also being educational," Mr. Mayer said. College campuses, he added, were good places to find contestants who would be smart enough and might be enthusiastic about trying out for an unknown game show.
Because the producers also wanted to keep down travel costs, MSNBC staff members did most of their recruiting during the fall and early winter on campuses in the Northeast. Besides Columbia and Vassar, they visited Fordham University, the University of Hartford, Swarthmore and some of the CUNY campuses, among others.
On each campus, potential contestants were given a 50-question written quiz on current events. Approximately 30 students at both Vassar and Columbia took the test, and the highest scorers (those who answered at least half the questions right) were selected. Dr. Bellemore and Dr. Carey were the only faculty members at their colleges who took the test; both scored well.
When "Remember This" premiered, the format was professors versus students. But, that soon changed because the faculty teams were winning every game. They often had too many years of television viewing to fairly compete with students born after the Watergate break-in.
Dr. Bellemore and his two teammates, Rishi Bhandari and Darcey Rakestraw, political science majors, crammed for their appearance by testing each other with a trivia book during the trip from their Poughkeepsie campus to the studio on East 106th Street, in a limousine provided by MSNBC.
Although there was also a limousine there was no practice for their Columbia opponents, Dr. Carey and his teammates, Steven Zeitchik and Danna Schoenberg, journalism graduate students.
At the recent "Remember This" taping, the two teams sat behind semicircular wood desks on the set, underneath bright spotlights, and awaited the first question from Mr. Roker.
Turning toward the 10-foot by 10-foot big-screen television to his right, Mr. Roker introduced the first video clip:
"Dateline, Jan. 31, 1968. Take a look as Howard Tucker reports on an embassy under fire. See if you remember this." Then he asked the question: What was the popular name for this attack?
Vassar's Dr. Bellemore buzzed. "Tet," he answered correctly, winning 10 points.
"Next," Mr. Roker quickly continued, "Tet celebrates the following: Vietnamese independence, Buddha's birthday or New Year's Day?"
Mr. Bhandari, 21, of Vassar correctly answered "New Year's Day" -- though he was born seven years after the incident.
"Now, who was the U.S. ambassador headquartered at the embassy? George Bush, Ellsworth Bunker or Lloyd Bucher?" Mr. Roker asked.
The third Vassar player, Ms. Rakestraw, 21, guessed George Bush (incorrect, but perhaps the choice most familiar to her generation).
Dr. Carey jumped in. "Ellsworth Bunker," he said, picking up 10 points for Columbia.
For the rest of the half-hour, news clips were viewed and follow-up questions asked -- and more often than not correctly answered -- on subjects ranging from Jackie Robinson to Dan Quayle to Superman. When the final bell sounded, Vassar was on top 280 to 240. The triumph meant both the $1,000 check for the school, and the chance to try reaching the grand prize round in March for a $20,000 scholarship. So far 16 teams, including Vassar, are in the running.
After the game, in a hallway near the set, the victorious Dr. Bellemore said he felt more relief than excitement.
"For us professors, it's less important to show how much we know, than not letting people find out how much we don't," he said.
His teammate, Mr. Bhandari, agreed: "There's much more pressure on the professors to know the right answers. Especially Dr. Bellemore, since he looks like such a kid."
To Dr. Carey of Columbia, the biggest challenge wasn't the questions themselves, but pushing the buzzer quickly enough and then not freezing up in front of the cameras. "There's very little reaction time," he said. "You know the answer, but suddenly your mind goes blank."
His quiz show appearance came 40 years after another Columbia teacher, Charles Van Doren, became enmeshed in a cheating scandal over the NBC quiz show, "Twenty-One." So Dr. Carey acknowledged the fate awaiting him back on campus.
"I'm sure I'll take a little ribbing from some of the other faculty," he said with a chuckle, before assuming a mock seriousness, "But I don't want to hear anything from them. They didn't volunteer."

HEADLINE: Russia Has Nothing to Fear

BYLINE: By Strobe Talbott; Strobe Talbott is Deputy Secretary of State.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov are scheduled to meet in Moscow on Thursday to discuss ways to strengthen ties between NATO and Russia -- despite Russian objections to the alliance's decision to bring in new members. The chances of progress will be greater if the Russians understand not just the inevitability of enlargement, but the reasons for it.
The decision to expand the alliance began with a question. After the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, should there remain, on the landscape of Europe, a military alliance or should NATO retire voluntarily to the ash heap of history? 
 When President Clinton began his first term in 1993, he concluded that an alliance was still necessary because there would continue to be threats to the security of the member states and to Europe as a whole.
He was concerned about several contingencies. One was regional conflict or instability, stemming from ethnic and other tensions arising inside or between European states. Another was an external threat from the South or from the East. Such possibilities may seem remote, but they are not unthinkable, especially in an era when missile technology and weapons of mass destruction are spreading.
Another question then arose: Is NATO itself too much identified with the cold war to cope with new challenges and to take advantage of new opportunities? Should a new alliance be created?
The President decided to adapt the existing alliance for three reasons. First, it is easier and cheaper to build on what already exists than to start from scratch. Second, NATO must remain the anchor of American commitment to the defense of Europe. Third, NATO is a proven force for peaceful integration and democratic development on the continent.
NATO has never been solely a military instrument; it has always served a political function as well. After World War II, the alliance helped Italy and Germany become part of the trans-Atlantic community. It promoted the consolidation of civilian-led democracy in Spain. It spurred reconciliation between France and Germany, laying the ground for the European Union. Its unified command removed the incentive for military competition among West European powers. It helped keep the peace between Greece and Turkey.
In the past, particularly in the 19th century, alliances not only served to wage or deter war, they also helped manage relations among their member states. Insofar as NATO follows in this tradition, the end of the cold war has actually buttressed its rationale -- and should make it easier for those who earlier regarded the alliance as a necessary but temporary evil to see it instead as a lasting good.
While retaining its military capacity and its core identity as a defense treaty, NATO can concentrate increasingly on its political function. Indeed, it can extend that mission to the former member states of the Warsaw Pact.
That consideration was in the President's mind when he faced the most difficult question: whether to enlarge the alliance. There were only two possible answers: yes or no. "Maybe," or "later but not now," would amount to "no," or at least would be taken that way by the Central Europeans.
There were several reasons why the answer had to be yes. Part of NATO's post-cold war mission is to open its doors to the new democracies that have regained their sovereignty. They aspire and deserve to be part of the trans-Atlantic community. All of Europe will be safer and more prosperous if these post-Communist lands continue to evolve toward civil society, market economics and harmonious relations with their neighbors.
The very prospect of NATO membership encourages those trends. In pursuit of their goal to join NATO, a number of Central European states have already accelerated their internal reforms and improved relations with each other.
Conversely, a decision not to enlarge NATO -- thus freezing a post-cold war NATO in its cold war configuration -- would send an unwelcome and unhelpful message to the Central Europeans. It would imply that they are consigned to a permanent buffer zone between East and West.
It would be the height of injustice and irony -- the ultimate in double jeopardy -- if these countries were, in effect, punished for the next 50 years because they had been, very much against the will of their people, part of the Warsaw Pact for the past 50. The resulting sense of isolation and vulnerability would be discouraging and potentially destabilizing.
We must, of course, face squarely the issue of Russia's opposition to NATO enlargement. But we should also recognize it for what it is -- an issue primarily of perception, of political sensitivities, not one of military reality.
The new NATO is not a threat to Russia, any more than a democratic Russia is a threat to the alliance. Enlargement has become a target of convenience for Russian fears and resentments rooted in uncertainties over Russia's post-Soviet identity and role in the world.
Many Russian reformers and democrats, along with some prominent Western experts, warn that enlargement will inflame nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic forces in Russia.
This danger, while real, is exaggerated and manageable. Alarmism about NATO has more resonance within the Russian political elite than in the population at large. Polling indicates that the average Russian worries far more about domestic issues -- salaries, pensions and crime.
This is not to dismiss the importance of perceptions as a factor in politics and diplomacy. But those Russians who are currently lashing out against an anachronistic stereotype of NATO have it within their power to bring perceptions more into line with reality.
Instead of seeing enlargement as a blow to Russian pride and as a Western vote of no-confidence in Russia's future, they should accept it as part of a larger process of evolution from which Russia itself can and should benefit. After all, Russia, too, has an interest in a stable Central Europe. The Russian people came to grief twice in this century because of wars that originated in precisely that region.
An important part of NATO's opening to the East is its willingness to take account of Russia's legitimate political and security interests. Identifying common interests, common tasks and ways to deepen and broaden confidence-building between the alliance and Russia is a major goal not only of Secretary Albright's visit to Moscow this week but of President Clinton's scheduled summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki next month.
Cooperation between NATO and Russia, of the sort now under way in the former Yugoslavia, provides a model for dealing with future Bosnias. American forces in Europe today do not spend their time preparing to fight Russian forces in Central Europe. Rather, they train for peacekeeping operations with NATO allies and other partners, including sometimes with the Russians themselves.
Today, at NATO headquarters in Brussels, there is a Russian liaison. We have suggested expanding these exchanges and including Russian officers at all the top levels of the alliance command structure. This kind of interaction with NATO can help the Russian military address its difficulties in trying to modernize.
Some have predicted that enlargement will increase the role of nuclear weapons in European security. The opposite should be true. With the end of the cold war, the alliance has already reduced the number of nuclear weapons in its arsenal by 90 percent. Moreover, if the alliance were not to enlarge, the consequent danger of renewed nationalism and military rivalry in Central Europe would carry with it the potential for nuclear-weapons proliferation.
NATO has already changed, profoundly, beneficially and lastingly. An important part of the new mission of the new NATO is to work with a new Russia in bringing about the transformation of Europe as a whole.

HEADLINE: Caribbean Seeks to Attract More Airlines

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Feb. 17

 BODY:
For the Caribbean islands that supply the kind of vacations that Americans crave in the winter, the threat of an American Airlines strike at the peak of the tourist season was a scary reminder that their reliance on one airline could prove as economically devastating as some hurricanes.
American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, controls roughly half of the market for air travel between the United States and the Caribbean. In some places, like San Juan, the concentration is even higher. 
 Moreover, the threat of the strike came at a time when tourism is growing in importance throughout the Caribbean to compensate for the erosion of manufacturing jobs resulting from increased competition under the North American Free Trade Agreement and, in Puerto Rico, the phasing out of tax exemptions for American companies. Tourism accounts for 7 percent of the economy in Puerto Rico, while the United States Virgin Islands and many other small islands rely on it more heavily or almost exclusively.
To try to protect this industry, which last year brought $13 billion to the region, Caribbean governments and tourism officials are taking steps to try to reduce their reliance on American Airlines.
Among the most aggressive efforts have been Puerto Rico's. In San Juan, American Airlines' Caribbean hub, the carrier and its American Eagle subsidiary control 70 percent of the air traffic and employ 2,500 workers. But as part of a strategy to double the economic impact of the tourism industry in the next 10 years, Puerto Rican government officials say they are identifying airlines and charter companies that would like to establish operations here, particularly to serve routes to Canada, South America and the Western and Midwestern United States.
"We're looking for new opportunities in terms of bringing in new airlines and developing new routes that would put us in contact with new markets and new investment," said Jorge L. Davila, Puerto Rico's tourism director.
In the last year, five new carriers have come to the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport here, including the new Pan Am, with flights to Miami and New York; KLM to the Netherlands and Aerolineas Argentinas to Buenos Aires. And officials are negotiating with 13 more. Puerto Rico has committed $360 million in airport expansion and renovations to increase air traffic capacity by 30 percent, port authority officials said. It has also increased hotel capacity, now at 11,200 rooms, by 40 percent in the last four years, Mr. Davila said.
Strikes are not the only concern in the push to diversify. Officials said market share dominance by one carrier also places passengers at the mercy of business decisions like American's move to use Miami as its Latin American hub. That means a flight between Sao Paulo, Brazil, and San Juan takes hours longer because of the need to connect in Miami, possibly deterring many potential visitors.
Efforts to attract more airlines are, of course, restricted by the realities of an industry that finds its best profits in hubs and by the small markets many of the Caribbean islands represent. American, in fact, rose to its current position by taking over the routes of Eastern Airlines, which dominated here until a strike crippled it and it went bankrupt in the late 1980's.
But Francisco Cimadevilla, Puerto Rico's deputy secretary of economic development and commerce, said that sometimes all it takes is aggressive promotion. "Sometimes you go into these board rooms and very knowledgeable, very worthy airline executives may have never taken a look at Puerto Rico," he said. He added that the aim was not to undercut American but to increase airport capacity.
In Puerto Rico, 26 airlines in addition to American operate at the Luis Munoz Marin airport, including major ones like Delta, TWA and USAir, but together they capture only 30 percent of the market. American carries the bulk of passengers, 5.2 million a year, and American Eagle another 1.2 million.
For smaller Caribbean islands with a tourist economy, American is a lifeline -- it controls 80 percent of the seats in nonstop flights from San Juan to other Caribbean islands and nearly half of the seats on nonstop routes from the United States to the Caribbean, according to BACK Associates Inc., a Stamford, Conn., aviation consulting firm.
Air Jamaica, American's closest competition for flights from the United States, controls only 10 percent of the seats to the Caribbean, the firm said. And on many of its Caribbean routes, American holds a monopoly, according to BACK.
These islands' lack of options is not unlike the situation faced by small cities in the United States that also feed into a hub. And tourism officials say that one alternative for the Caribbean is for a group of nine small carriers that serve the area to come together to reduce costs and expand routes. A 1993 study by the Caribbean Tourism Organization, a group based in Barbados that represents 33 member countries, found that those airlines could save about $64 million a year through joint marketing campaigns, fuel purchases and other points of cooperation.
"We're far too dependent on one carrier," said Jean Holder, secretary general of the organization.
The islands' exposure was underscored last Friday, the start of a holiday weekend during the busiest tourism season. Travelers who had planned trips on American were forced simply by the threat of the strike to rebook flights, often adding hundreds of dollars and many hours to their itineraries.
About 40 percent of 24 million visitors to the Caribbean in 1995 came in the winter months of January through April, the Caribbean Tourism Organization said, mostly from North America. With hotels at 80 or 90 percent occupancy, predictions of a catastrophe were heard throughout the archipelago.
"You should never allow yourself to be put in a position where problems with one carrier can have such an effect," said Wylie H. Whisonant, tourism commissioner for the United States Virgin Islands, which are just recovering from Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, a storm that destroyed or damaged most of the hotels in the region. "It really behooves us now to reach out to other carriers, to spread the risk."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
From Skipping Haircuts or Coffee, Some Find Unusual Means for Giving

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
At 66, Juergen R. Goldhagen has let his hair grow, tying it into a ponytail. At first it was for fun, to inject a spark of style, even some Samsonesque vigor, into his post-retirement life. But he soon recognized an added benefit: a year's savings on haircuts could be sent to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to help the poor.
Mr. Goldhagen, of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., was one of the many donors who, by unusual measures or creative calculations, came up with ways to contribute to the fund, which helps seven of the city's oldest and largest charities extend a hand to those who need one. The fund's 85th annual appeal runs through the end of next week. 
 "I started to grow it as a lark," Mr. Goldhagen wrote in a letter accompanying his contribution. "But then I realized by saving on haircuts, I could pass those savings on to you. I used to get a haircut once a month and at $12 a haircut, plus a tip, I save $144 a year, so enclosed is my check for that amount. Whenever anyone asks about the ponytail, I tell them, 'It's for the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.' "
In his letter, Mr. Goldhagen said he hoped that others might adopt such a method. "Who knows how much money you might end up getting," he wrote. But his strategy would not work for Alfred H. Lane, whose own method would suffer if he ever got hair in his eyes. Mr. Lane, 80, walks nearly everywhere he goes, always keeping his eyes peeled for spare change and stray dollar bills scattered on the ground.
"As I have done in the past, I am enclosing a check representing the amount of money I have found during this year on the streets and public places of (mainly) New York," Mr. Lane wrote in a letter with his $482.71 contribution. "Since the money was found in public areas, I would like it to be used to help those who have to live in public areas -- the homeless."
For Mr. Lane, who lives in Greenwich Village, walking is a hobby, his way of staying fit and having fun. And he is not alone in turning a hobby into a way to help the needy. "Every year the Pickwick Bridge Club has a 'charity' game when each player donates $1 to a selected charity," wrote Alice Silton, the club's president. "This year we decided to send the $130 to the Neediest Cases."
Ms. Silton, who lives in Purchase, N.Y., said in an interview that club members wanted to help a charity that benefited a broad range of people in need. The group, she said, recognized that the agencies supported by the Neediest Cases Fund have programs that help every type of needy New Yorker, including the homeless and the unemployed, the ill and disabled, children and the elderly. "We wanted something that would appeal to a lot of people," she said. "This covers everything."
Some contributors went without daily extras to give to the fund. "Although I've cut back on a lot this year," wrote Eleanor H. Watts, of Greenwich, Conn., "it seems that eliminating one 'coffee to go' a day -- or 10 indulgent lattes a month -- could benefit someone!" She sent a check for $30.
Other contributions were calculated on a somber note. "I am sending $24 for two reasons," wrote Anika Schwarzwald of Jersey City, N.J. "One, it is twice my age, and two, it is the age my sister was when she passed away last year from cancer. Last time I gave I sent $11, one for every year of my life, but this year I decided to raise the sum because it just feels good to give and know that you are helping someone."
John and Eleanor Fischer of Rockville Centre, L.I., also sent a gift in memoriam. "We send a contribution in honor of the 230 victims of T.W.A. Flight 800 who no longer have the opportunity to support this worthy cause," they wrote in a note accompanying a $230 donation.

HEADLINE: China Leaders' Return to Beijing May Mean Deng Has Worsened

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials said today that they believed that the health of China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, had deteriorated significantly in recent days and was the reason for the sudden return to Beijing this weekend of several other top Chinese leaders.
Mr. Deng, who is 92 and has not been seen in public since he visited Shanghai in 1994, has often been reported to be on the verge of death in the last few years. 
 "This could be another one of the false warnings," said one senior American official who monitored internal Government reports about Mr. Deng's health during the weekend. "But there is clearly a lot of activity on the part of the leadership, and there is clearly a belief in Beijing that a bad situation has turned worse."
Another Administration official said, "Clearly he is very sick, but it's not clear how much sicker than the usual very sick."
For years officials in Washington have debated what impact the death of Mr. Deng, whose economic reforms remade China into one of the powerhouse economies of the world, may have on China's succession struggles and its dealings with the United States.
But Mr. Deng has survived for so long that many China watchers and policy makers here routinely say they now believe that the bulk of the transition of power has already taken place. If Mr. Deng dies in the coming months, they speculate, political events in Beijing can be frozen until the next Communist Party congress, in October.
The movements of China's other leaders have long been watched with care by American intelligence officials, because their travels may be the only reliable sign of a sharp deterioration in Mr. Deng's health.
So American officials took particular interest in intelligence reports and press accounts that President Jiang Zemin, who is also the chief of the Chinese Communist Party and the head of the army, abruptly returned to Beijing during a weekend trip to Jiangxi Province, in the center of the country.
At the same time, Prime Minister Li Peng also returned to Beijing hurriedly, cutting short a visit to Guangdong, the booming southern province closest to Hong Kong. The travel by the two leaders was first reported by Reuters.
In Paris today, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said at a news conference, "I've heard some reports from Beijing, but I can't corroborate anything." Other State Department officials said the intelligence reports were sketchy.
Rumors of Mr. Deng's impending death regularly shake the Hong Kong stock market, and on Friday the Hang Seng index fell nearly 1 percent after a newspaper there reported that Mr. Deng had suffered a stroke.
But American officials said they had no independent confirmation of that report, and today investors apparently reconsidered the potential impact that his death would have on the territory's return to Chinese control in four months. Today the Hong Kong market rose fractionally.

HEADLINE: G.M. Is Speaking Out on the Dollar and Other Issues

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Just four years ago, a senior General Motors executive from Detroit appalled a roomful of diplomats and trade negotiators at an embassy dinner in Washington by loudly arguing that the nation's capital did not really matter because it did not manufacture anything.
That attitude, once common at the nation's biggest company, is now fading quickly. As the auto maker builds new factories in Poland, Thailand and Argentina, and as the rising dollar has helped propel sales of foreign cars in America, the General Motors Corporation is becoming much more active on public policy issues. 
 Indeed, the dollar's ascent has underscored G.M.'s change of heart. This winter, G.M. executives were among the first to warn about the bruising effects of the dollar's rise on American manufacturers and to lead efforts to convince Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin that the dollar is too high in currency markets. A dozen years ago, when the dollar was also soaring, G.M. was one of the last big manufacturers to push for Government relief.
At the same time, Louis R. Hughes, the president of G.M.'s international operations, has become an outspoken critic of plans for a single European currency, because he fears it could initially squeeze profits and slow economic growth. The auto maker's Washington office has stepped up its lobbying on issues like global warming, because of worries that new controls could be placed on the worldwide auto industry. And G.M.'s board has just added two directors known for their outspoken but different views on international trade.
Even John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive and a businessman who remains visibly uncomfortable discussing public policy issues, now says that the company will inevitably take more public positions as it expands overseas. There is "no doubt that will happen," he said, pointing out that G.M. strongly favored the United States's renewal last year of China's most favored nation status.
One reason is that G.M. is rapidly expanding its operations in many Asian and Latin American markets where overcoming trade restrictions and winning Government approval for factories are often crucial for success. So G.M. has been turning to Washington for the same support that foreign auto makers have long sought from their home governments.
It is impossible for G.M. to run its worldwide operations "without assuming some responsibility for being a well-informed participant in public policy debates and issues," said Harry J. Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman.
Current and former G.M. executives cite several other reasons the auto maker is no longer the corporate wallflower on policy issues that it used to be. One simple reason is that G.M. has recovered from its management crisis in the early 1990's, so its executives have more time to spend on longer-term issues.
Another reason is that G.M.'s public policy decision making has shifted away from the financial staff in New York City, where a laissez-faire ethos has long been strong. Decisions are increasingly being made instead in Detroit by Mr. Pearce, a lawyer who made his reputation handling product liability issues in Washington and in courtrooms around the country.
During the mid-1980's, the ambivalence of the New York operations on dollar policy created tensions within G.M. "Back in those days, some of the operating people felt we should have been more vocal than we were," Lloyd E. Reuss, G.M.'s retired president, said.
Marina Whitman, the vice president and group executive for public affairs during much of the 1980's, said that G.M. had lobbied the Reagan Administration vigorously for a weaker dollar after Caterpillar Inc. had begun doing so. But she added, "We may have been a little slow -- I think with 20/20 hindsight, if I had to do it all over again, we might have waded in sooner."
The question now is whether G.M.'s next step will be to seek any restrictions on auto imports. Any such move would break a long corporate tradition of support for free trade.
In the late 1970's, G.M. declined to participate in an attempt by the Ford Motor Company to win protection from Japanese imports, effectively dooming the effort. As recently as February 1993, G.M. pulled out of lawsuit preparations by Ford and the Chrysler Corporation, which wanted billions of dollars in tariffs imposed on Japanese cars allegedly being dumped at unfairly low prices in the United States. Because of G.M.'s action, the lawsuit was never filed.
G.M. has just added two directors with very different views on trade. One of the new directors, George M. C. Fisher, the chairman, chief executive and president of the Eastman Kodak Company, has made repeated use of unilateral American trade laws in trying to break open the Japanese market and restrict the sale of supposedly underpriced Japanese goods in the United States.
While cautioning that he was still learning about the auto industry and had not joined G.M.'s board to be a trade specialist, Mr. Fisher said that he saw some parallels between trade issues facing Kodak and G.M. He contended that the Japanese film market is sufficiently closed to foreign companies that producers there can collect high profits and use the money to buy market share elsewhere.
"A lot of the same arguments apply to the auto business," he said in his first interview after being named to the G.M. board.
Percy Barnevik, the chairman and chief executive of ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., a Zurich-based engineering giant, was also recently named to the G.M. board and is outspoken on trade policy, but with a different emphasis. Having spent his career as a businessman in Switzerland and Sweden, countries with small markets and little ability to threaten trade sanctions, he has strongly supported international limits on unilateral trade laws.

HEADLINE: Labor Dares Republicans To Cut Its Political Clout

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17

 BODY:
John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, issued a defiant "make my day" declaration today to Republicans in Congress who want revenge on the labor movement for its pull-out-the-stops drive to defeat them in last fall's elections.
"We're going to resist and oppose any efforts that are made toward recriminations for any of the good work we did last year," Mr. Sweeney said at a news conference on the first day of the federation's winter meeting here. "If there is going to be any attempt at retribution, we'll be as out front as we have been on any other issue." 
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. spent $25 million on its anti-Republican broadcast spots last year, in what many union leaders call their biggest campaign effort ever. Seething Republicans are talking about curbing labor unions' independent spending on elections. Several Republicans have proposed legislation that could cripple such spending by forbidding unions to use a member's dues on campaigns unless he or she had signed an authorization card.
Since the party increased its majority in the Senate and maintained control of the House in the face of the labor effort, some Republican supporters say punishment is sure.
"As is often said, when you set out to kill the king, you better succeed, and they didn't, so they had better watch out," said Paul Huard, chief lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
But A.F.L.-C.I.O. lobbyists say they are not alarmed, because numerous Republican moderates, shaken by last fall's assault, have told union leaders they intend to remain close to labor.
"They're trying to posture themselves as worker-friendly," said Peggy Taylor, the A.F.L.-C.I.O's chief lobbyist, noting that this could prevent Republican leaders from mustering a majority on anti-labor measures.
"We won't just be playing defense," she added. "There'll definitely be some offense from us."
Labor unions have a long wish list. They hope they can focus on a few issues with such widespread public support that Republicans would block the issues at their peril. Union officials point to what happened last year with labor's campaign for a higher minimum wage: The public backed it so overwhelmingly that Republicans were pushed into approving it.
Dennis Rivera, president of 1199 National Health and Human Service Employees Union, said he hopes one subject that will catch fire in the same way is labor's pet proposal to extend health coverage to the 10 million American children without medical insurance.
Douglas H. Dority, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers, wants labor to go even further this year and push for universal health coverage. "We have a situation where more and more employers are simply cutting off employer-paid health coverage to employees."
Another issue that union officials say could gain momentum would be requiring all employers to provide pensions, even small ones, to all workers. A.F.L.-C.I.O. lobbyists also say they will push for laws to insure that health maintenance organizations provide quality care.
"We want to find a way to get at financial incentives that discourage doctors from providing quality care," said Ms. Taylor.
She said the federation also backs proposals to take Federal money that labor unions say subsidizes the transfer of jobs overseas and use it to build or modernize schools. "A lot of schools are crumbling and are not wired for the Internet," she said. "Teachers like this idea. Parents like it. Construction workers like it. Telecommunications people like it."
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials said they would support President Clinton's proposals to expand the family leave act, broaden child-care coverage and provide tax credits and deductions to go to college. The federation is asking locals to send letters opposing the Republican drive to add an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget; it is also planning a campaign against replacing Social Security with a private system.
The executive council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations is refining its legislative agenda as part of a four-day meeting whose main theme is focusing the federation's energies on recruitment. The percentage of the unionized work force has been shrinking for decades, and Mr. Sweeney has vowed to concentrate on organizing to keep labor from sliding into irrelevancy.
He said workers need "a bigger and stronger labor movement, one capable of acting as a counterweight to the corporate forces now dominating our economy."
Mr. Huard, the manufacturers' lobbyist, doubted that labor would be able to take the offensive this year. "My guess is they'll pretty much be reduced to the fire brigade stuff, rushing to stop things they don't like," he said.
Labor's lobbyists are already rushing to stop two Republican proposals. One would make it easier for employers to set up groups of workers to cooperate with management. Labor says this measure will create employer-dominated worker representation, but managers say this proposal will merely foster cooperation to build more efficient companies.
The other proposal would let workers take compensatory time rather than overtime pay. Republicans call this a worker-friendly measure designed to give employees more flexibility, but labor leaders say it is a back-door attempt to force workers to take compensatory time instead of overtime pay when managers know that many workers intent on getting ahead will never take the time off.
Mr. Sweeney said, "We are not about to stand on the sidelines and see labor protections broken down under the guise of flex time or comp time."

HEADLINE: Allied Friction in Korea

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Two critical developments in the last week have once again increased the tensions between North and South Korea. But the events also threaten to deepen the friction between two longtime allies -- South Korea and the United States.
The issue is whether efforts to make peace with and provide aid to economically desperate North Korea will be delayed or halted after the request by a high-ranking North Korean official for asylum in the South and the shooting of another North Korean defector in Seoul, possibly by North Korean agents. 
 While publicly in agreement on how to deal with North Korea, Washington and Seoul have for three years been squabbling under the surface. At times it has seemed that United States relations with South Korea were worse than with North Korea.
In the last few years, the United States has been seeking to engage North Korea, to end its isolation and reduce the risk of a war.
South Korean leaders take the position that it is naive of the United States to try to appease a Communist Government that they say cannot be trusted. The South Koreans also say they believe that Pyongyang's economic woes provide leverage to drive a harder bargain.
Seoul has gone along with Washington's ideas -- like proposed peace talks involving the two Koreas, China and the United States -- but often only reluctantly.
This divergence of views is likely to surface again in the days following the defection and the shooting. It is sure to be on the agenda when Madeleine K. Albright, the new Secretary of State, arrives here on Saturday on a previously scheduled visit.
The United States is hoping that the defection and the shooting will not interfere with efforts to hold the four-party peace talks, and to provide food aid and nuclear reactors to North Korea in an effort to suppress nuclear weapons development there.
But in South Korea, North Korea's actions can provoke such fierce emotions that building a relationship becomes impossible. After North Koreans entered South Korea from a grounded submarine in September, the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, whipped up an anti-Communist frenzy, and all efforts at better relations were frozen until North Korea apologized.
North Korea, too, to be sure, also balks at reconciliation when it suffers a blow, like the defection on Wednesday of Hwang Jang Yop, the architect of Pyongyang's ideology of juche, or self-reliance.
So far, South Korean officials have taken a moderate stance in the new crisis. Although they have blamed North Korea for the attempted assassination of Lee Han Young, a defector who is being kept alive by a respirator even though his brain has ceased to function, they have not demanded an apology. That could be because the gunmen have not been caught and the police concede that there is at least an outside chance that Mr. Lee, who was known as a womanizer and who was deeply in debt, might have had other enemies who wanted to kill him.
South Korea's Foreign Minister, Yoo Chong Ha, said today that the South would continue to support peace talks to formally end the Korean War. The Hwang defection, he said in a speech at an annual meeting of South Korean diplomats, is just one of many crises that will occur as North Korea continues to deteriorate politically and economically.
"Under these circumstances, the most pressing task is to establish peace on the Korean peninsula," he said.
Still, South Korean officials say some steps, like the announcement of new relief programs for North Korea, will probably be delayed until the air clears.
And, a Foreign Ministry official said, "if something more happens, the Government may have to change the policy regarding the light-water reactors." He was referring to the nuclear plants that will be provided to North Korea in exchange for its dropping the nuclear weapons development program it is suspected of having.
Moreover, fear of North Korea is being kindled here by articles appearing in newspapers about letters that Mr. Hwang wrote or remarks he made in the months before he defected.
He is said to have told someone, for instance, that there are 50,000 North Korean agents in South Korea, including some highly placed in the Government. In one letter, he is said to have written that the North's "fundamental policy is national reunification through the invasion of South Korea" and that it "has no intention of dialogue."
It is unclear whether the statements are all genuine, although some knowledgeable observers think the letters, at least, are real, and were probably leaked by South Korean intelligence officials.
The difference in approach to North Korea between Washington and Seoul stems in part from different internal politics.
Washington favors engagement and aid to prevent a cornered Government from staging an attack on the South in a moment of desperation. Even though North Korea, short of fuel for planes and tanks and spare parts for its weapons, would lose a war, it could extract a heavy toll on the 37,000 American troops protecting the South.
Seoul, too, is officially committed to helping North Korea enough to bring about a so-called soft landing, rather than a sudden collapse that would bring millions of refugees streaming south and jeopardize the increasingly prosperous living conditions in the South.
But that is the policy of the mind. In their hearts, many South Koreans, including Government officials, would love nothing better than for the enemy that has insulted them for more than 40 years to come crashing down -- and the sooner the better.
Perhaps an even bigger reason for South Korea's reluctance is that it thinks that North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. American officials agree that Pyongyang wants to do that, though they insist that the United States would never sell its ally down the river.
Many steps, such as the 1994 nuclear agreement and recent efforts to arrange a briefing on four-party peace talks, are negotiated by North Korea and the United States, with South Korea not present. To satisfy South Korea, which will pay most of the $5 billion cost of the reactors, the nuclear agreement includes a stipulation that North Korea engage in dialogue with the South. But so far, there has been no such dialogue.
The South Korean Government might also have domestic reasons to fan the anti-North flames this time. Both the Hwang defection and Lee shooting have diverted attention from an embarrassing corruption scandal that has already resulted in the arrests of some of President Kim's close associates.
The new crisis also comes as the National Assembly begins a special session at which it will discuss legislation governing the Agency for National Security Planning, the nation's spycatcher.
President Kim's New Korea Party rammed through a new law in December giving the agency expanded powers. Opponents, saying the agency has often engaged in political repression, hope to repeal or revise the law. But the image of North Korean agents with pistols on the loose will make any weakening of the law more difficult.

Abe or Not, Few Give 2 Cents for 1

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
A PENNY lay on the floor by the cash register at Barney Greengrass, the temple to smoked fish on Amsterdam Avenue. "See that penny?" said Gary Greengrass, the latest member of his family to become a loxsmith. "Nobody's bothered to pick it up."
Nobody included Mr. Greengrass, who has as much use for a 1-cent coin as he has for a two-holed bagel. "Some people won't even take it as change," he said. "They don't want anything to do with it. Sometimes, I'll take less from customers, too, so I don't have to be bothered with it." 
 His opinion is common in New York, a place where pitching pennies at the stoop was once part of the landscape. Now, the penny commands even less respect than Rodney Dangerfield. And that raises a question, though it may seem terribly ungallant coming on the heels of Presidents' Day: Might it not be time to do away with those millions of zinc-and-copper likenesses of Abraham Lincoln dotting New York sidewalks uncollected and lining sock drawers untouched?
This is an issue that turns up every once in a while like a bad you-know-what, but goes nowhere. Nonetheless, dumping this almost useless coin -- and rounding off business transactions to the nearest nickel -- is a thought for your pennies that is not likely to go away.
"This coin's days are numbered" is how Representative Michael N. Castle, a Delaware Republican, put it several months ago. Mr. Castle, chairman of the House subcommittee that deals with monetary matters, said he had no idea what that number might be. But he predicted a time when "it will no longer make practical or economic sense to continue producing a coin that does not circulate and whose costs outweigh its benefits."
NEW YORK, one could argue, is particularly ill suited for the penny, a hardy survivor that has carried Lincoln's image since 1909. There is the obvious fact that you can buy nothing with it, unless you know of a candy store that still sells those tiny Tootsie Rolls for 1 cent. But beyond that, the penny can be a source of stress in a city that hardly needs it.
"It's annoying in these places where you have to have the 3 cents, and you don't have it," said Bob Morton, owner of Coin Dealer on West 47th Street. "So you give them another dollar. Now you're carrying around 97 cents."
Did you ever stand at the checkout line of a New York supermarket while a customer fumbled for 2 cents? Not exactly models of patience, those waiting their turn.
You may think 1-cent coins are legal tender, but try getting on a bus with them. "No pennies," fare-box signs say bluntly. The subway is slightly more accommodating. Signs at token booths advise to "avoid using pennies," suggesting that you may use them if you wish. But plunk down 150 pennies during rush hour and let us know if you make it out alive.
In a New York restaurant, leaving pennies for a tip is a sure way to insult the waiter. In food stores, owners "see the penny as a pain," said Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist who represents many of the city's small supermarkets. "It costs them money to process the coins, although there are some benefits," he said. "You can price something at $9.99 instead of $10."
BEGGARS, too, can be choosers in this city. "It's humbler than the poorest of the poor," said Theodore Faro Gross, a writer in Manhattan. "I've seen panhandlers frown on it. I feel apologetic when I accidentally put a penny in a panhandler's hand."
Still, all is not lost for the coin. Mr. Gross has proved that. Seven years ago he founded Common Cents, which collects pennies that schoolchildren have scoured from their apartments and gives the money to community groups. Though still tallying his last annual "harvest" in November, he expects to end up with more than $150,000.
In Washington, an advocacy group with a similar name, Americans for Common Cents, carries the torch for the penny. Mark Weller, the executive director, cites polls showing that Americans see no compelling reason to do away with a coin that is "so embroidered in the social and economic fabric of the country."
O.K., don't expect the penny to be banished any time soon. That much is acknowledged even by an abolitionist like Beth Deisher, who is editor of Coin World, a magazine for collectors published in Ohio.
When she last visited New York, Ms. Deisher said, "I saw pennies in the gutter for block after block." That's how little valued the coin was.
But at the same time, she said, "Americans are quite conservative when it comes to change." No pun intended, she added.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
In terms of managing mutual funds, must youth be served?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
AS the stock market has soared during the last several years, it has often seemed as if the manager of the latest hot mutual fund is barely out of college. Is that a coincidence? Or is youth an advantage when it comes to running money?
The answer, according to a new study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, appears to be that it is not a coincidence. "We find that younger managers can earn much higher returns than older managers," write Judith Chevalier and Glenn Ellison. 
 Their study, based on performance of growth and growth and income equity mutual funds from 1988 through 1994, concluded that the younger the manager, the better the performance.
"When we control for everything," said Mr. Ellison, an associate professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "we get about three basis points per year." In other words, a 29-year-old manager would be expected, on average, to show a return about three-hundredths of 1 percentage point higher than that of a 30-year-old. And that 30-year-old would do about half a percentage point better than a 48-year-old.
The instinctive reaction of many an older manager, particularly in this bull market, is that such performance may have something to do with risk. Younger managers, having never seen a bear market, may be more likely to swing for the fences. For most of the period covered in the study, that was a very good strategy.
But Mr. Ellison, who is 31, and Ms. Chevalier, a 29-year-old assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago's business school, say that they have tried to control for such risk taking, and that risk does not appear to explain the phenomenon. In fact, they say, it appears that older managers are more likely to be "momentum" investors, that is, to buy stocks largely because they are going up.
What may explain the difference, at least in part, is that the study also indicates that younger managers with poor performance are more likely to be dismissed than are older managers who do poorly. That could create a selection bias in which poorer young managers are weeded out, leaving only better ones to make it look as if young is better. But the authors say they have adjusted for that, too, and that without that adjustment the advantage of youth appears to be even greater.
It would be interesting to know what the study would have shown in 1987, when managers who took a lot of risk were severely penalized by the crash. But the data for the study came from Morningstar Inc., which was not reporting on the age of managers back then. In fact, it still does not, but it does report on the academic degrees earned by each manager. The authors estimated ages by assuming that the managers were awarded bachelor's degrees when they were about 22.
Using the data on college graduation also let the authors check to see if it matters where a manager went to college. And, they say, it does. They measure the quality of a school by using the average score of its entering freshmen on the Scholastic Assessment Test, or S.A.T., on which scores range from 400 to 1,600 points. They conclude that a manager who attended Princeton (average S.A.T. of 1,355) would be likely to outperform one from the University of Florida (average of 1,145) by about one percentage point a year.
Assuming that is true, they note that it could be explained either by a better education at the elite universities or by a higher quality of entering students. Mr. Ellison, by the way, attended Harvard, while Ms. Chevalier is a Yale graduate.
Will young people from the best schools continue to be the best managers when the market turns down, if it ever does? That is one question this study does not answer.

HEADLINE: Racial Killing Bursts a British Press Taboo

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Stephen Lawrence, 18, a promising high school student of Jamaican parentage, was stabbed to death by a group of white youths cursing him with shouts of "nigger" as he waited for a ride home at a southeast London bus stop on an April night nearly four years ago.
The notorious case, in which five haughty youths with a history of white supremacist agitation have been implicated but never convicted, set off vigils against racism and a series of investigations that proved naggingly inconclusive. 
 Now the case has burst back into public attention, provoking a new outcry about police competence and sensitivity in racial crimes, the rights of defendants to be presumed innocent and the responsibilities of the press.
Last week all five men were summoned to a reopened coroner's jury investigation into the killing, and they invoked their common-law privilege of remaining silent, refusing with defiant chuckles and winks to acknowledge even their names. Then they marched out of the quaint Victorian courthouse amid the dreary tenement blocks of Southwark and sped away in two sedans with three women companions.
After their appearance, the jury returned a verdict of "unlawful killing," saying that Mr. Lawrence had died "in a completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths."
The jury supplied no names, but the next morning the tabloid Daily Mail did. The newspaper devoted its front page to head shots and identifications of the five white men beneath the underscored headline "Murderers" and a challenge in bold letters: "The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us."
The tabloid's publication of murder accusations against unconvicted people was strikingly audacious in a country where the press is generally inhibited by official secrecy and libel laws that afford suspects greater protection than in the United States.
"What happened to Stephen Lawrence is a vile and wicked killing carried out by evil racists," said Nigel Pascoe, chairman of the Bar Council's public affairs committee. But he added that "it is not for the press to act as judge and jury."
A number of judges have denounced the newspaper's action, and a spokesman for the Attorney General's office said today that it was exploring a formal contempt of law charge.
Over the weekend, Britain's Channel 4 television station added to the furor by broadcasting a film recorded by a secretly placed Metropolitan Police camera showing one of the five men, Neil Acourt, 21, telling the others that black men should be skinned, dismembered and set on fire.
He then demonstrated a knife attack, in a way that bore a chilling resemblance to how Mr. Lawrence was murdered. Asked at one point by another member of the gang if the killers of Mr. Lawrence weren't "laughing" now, Mr. Acourt smiled knowingly and said, "They are definitely doing that, mate."
The victim's family says it now plans to bring civil proceedings against the men, citing the latest O. J. Simpson trial in California as precedent.
As in the United States, the burden of proof would be less than in a criminal case, dependent upon only "a balance of probabilities" rather than proof "beyond reasonable doubt." British law does not permit a civil case of murder so the most severe charge available to the Lawrences would be assault and battery.
All five men accused are unemployed and have no resources, and so no money damages would ever be recovered even if they were found liable for Mr. Lawrence's death.
But the family feels it is the only way to gain any satisfaction from a police and judicial system it argues is stacked against nonwhite victims. "The value that this white racist country puts on black lives is evident to see since the killing of my son," Doreen Lawrence, the young man's mother, told the coroner's inquest last week.
The inquest, which took only 30 minutes to return its verdict, provided little solace to the family and others anxious to see justice done.
Its decision was seen as symbolizing the widely perceived failure of the police and the courts to assemble evidence against five young men, who come from a racially troubled neighborhood.
In Eltham, a predominantly white middle-class neighborhood of brick semi-detached homes where the five men live and where the killing took place, the few black and Asian families have complained of racial harassment. The Asian merchants who run the newstands and candy stores in the area routinely scrub racist graffiti off their storefronts and say they are regularly taunted by young residents. Mrs. Lawrence said that a week after the killing, a white neighbor verbally accosted her in a parking lot, saying that her son would be still be alive if she had not come to this country in the first place.
Murder charges against two of the five men were dismissed in 1993. The other three were acquitted in a trial a year ago. In both cases, the police said they had found no one willing to testify, only what one high-ranking officer called a "sea of rumor."
Mrs. Lawrence, a teacher, and her husband, Neville, a plasterer and decorator, came to Britain from Jamaica in 1962 and live in Woolwich, a neighborhood with one other black family. A second son now goes to university, and Stephen, a high school senior with a record of academic honors, was planning to go to college to study architecture.
On April 22, 1993, at 10:30 P.M., Mr. Lawrence and a friend, Duwayne Brooks, also 18, were waiting for a bus home to Woolwich when they were set upon by five white men. Mr. Lawrence was stabbed in the chest and the arm and succeeded in running 130 yards before he fell. The attackers ran away, and Mr. Brooks hailed a passing off-duty policeman who summoned an ambulance. Mr. Lawrence died at the hospital from hemorrhaging.
In the hours after the crime, the police collected forensic evidence and searched for weapons but did not make any effort to locate witnesses among the large number of passing motorists, bus passengers and residents who might have seen the incident. The Lawrence family claims that the police were more interested in establishing whether their son was a member of a gang than who his killers might be. On her first visit to the precinct house, Mrs. Lawrence said she gave an officer a list of names of suspects and the officer crumpled it dismissively into a ball.
"My son was stereotyped by the police," Mrs. Lawrence told the inquest.
"He was black, then he must be a criminal, and they set about to investigate him and us. Their investigation lasted two weeks, and that allowed vital evidence to be lost."
Later the police found that potential witnesses were unwilling to speak for attribution, saying they feared retaliation. The Southwark coroner, Sir Montague Levine, characterized the community response this week as "a wall of silence and fear."
Two months after the crime, the police charged Neil Acourt's brother Jamie, 19, and David Norris, 20, with murder, but the inability to persuade any witnesses to testify caused the court to dismiss the charges a month later.
In frustration, the family resorted to an approach used only three times before this century, sponsoring a private investigation that led to murder charges against Neil Acourt, Luke Knight, 20, and Gary Dobson, 21. The principal witness was Duwayne Brooks, who had picked the three out of police lineups.
But it emerged in court that Mr. Brooks had never clearly seen their faces the night of attack and that he had heard rumors of the involvement of the three before he was asked to view the lineups. The judge ruled that his testimony was consequently "contaminated and flawed." All three men were acquitted.
The police have resisted criticism of their conduct of the case.
"The suggestion that any police officer would investigate a murder less competently because the victim was black is an absolute disgrace," said David Osland, the former deputy assistant police commissioner who was in charge of the investigation.
Sir Herman Ouseley, the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, is unconvinced.
"This case has added to the sense of mistrust that many in the ethnic minority communities have about the police and the criminal justice system," he said.
Leaders of civil rights groups greeted the action of The Daily Mail warily since the newspaper traditionally has paid little attention to minority communities and had accused civil rights advocates of having "hijacked" the Lawrence killing for their own purposes.
But one official, Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Runnymede Trust, an independent research group on race issues, said he hoped the assistance from an unexpected quarter like The Mail meant that the case was having wider repercussions.
"It gives me hope that unlike America, where two completely different nations live inside one border, it is at least possible for Middle Britain to understand Black Britain's pain and in some way identify with it," he said.

HEADLINE: Where Electronic Money Talks as Fast as It Moves;
Secaucus Corridor Emerges as Nerve Center In the Melding of Computers and Capitalism

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SECAUCUS, N.J., Feb. 17

 BODY:
You can't see it, feel it, smell it, stack it or hoard it in a vault. You can't use it to light a cigar or stuff a mattress. There are no coins to flip or to jingle.
It's electronic money, currency of the millennium, and this corner of northeast New Jersey, through a melding of capitalism, computers and quirks of fate, is emerging as a nerve center. 
 Quietly, this cluster of New Jersey towns just west of the Lincoln Tunnel has become a world hub in the lightning-speed business of switching money from one account to another.
If your checking account is programmed to make your mortgage payment or pay your health club dues, this corner of New Jersey, no matter where in the country you live, is probably where the transaction occurs. If you buy something with an A.T.M. card, the odds are great that part of the approval process will pass through the corridor. If you bank from home, the bank's home page may well have been generated here.
Since the early 1990's, the Secaucus corridor has emerged as a national center for automated teller networks. Four processors, including the NYCE Corporation in Secaucus, are within a few square miles of one another. It has become the national capital of preprogrammed transfers like automatic payroll deposits, which are processed through the New York Clearing House Association and the Federal Reserve processing center in East Rutherford.
When the Fed completes the consolidation of its $1.4 trillion-a-day national interbank transfer system, Fedwire, in March 1998, the area's national presence will rise further still, enough to rival New York City for the first time in the volume of money moved.
"It's not just a New York City market any more," said Elliott McEntee, the president and chief executive officer of the National Automated Clearinghouse Association, a Virginia trade group owned by the banking industry. "New Jersey has become a very integral part of the nation's financial system, and hardly anybody knows it."
For the New York regional economy, that represents a subtle but profound shift in the huge business of money changing, and perhaps suggests as well the emergence of a new kind of disembodied techno-money center utterly unlike New York, or any place else.
There is no monolithic architecture to inspire awe or trust or to proclaim a presence. Like the technology itself, which combines telecommunications, data processing and financial services, the atmosphere of these money-shifting centers is based on what works. At the NYCE control room, utilitarian short-weave carpet covers hollow floors, beneath which cables snake. The lights are dimmed to preclude glare against the banks of monitors.
Where there is no customer contact except through the digital Web, anonymity becomes its own security-conscious virtue. For the 3,000 or so people who work in the corridor, money has been distilled to its essence: the realm of pure numbers.
Yet there are still some human echoes measurable through the electronic flutter.
One can be witnessed every night, like a recurring fever: between 2 and 4 A.M., the percentage of people who try and fail to extract money from automated teller machines -- because they have insufficient cash in their accounts -- inches up.
The shift is small, 1 percent from the average approval rate of 90 percent, said Joseph T. Buscemi, the director of operations at NYCE, the East Coast's largest automated teller network. But given the huge volume of A.T.M. transactions, even a tiny increase in rejections is enough for a country-music jukebox worth of desperation: no money, middle of the night, New Jersey.
The Secaucus cash corridor is partly an intentional secret. The New York Clearinghouse Association, founded in New York in 1853 to handle interbank account settlements, processes $10 billion every day in electronic money. Don't ask where. For security reasons, the company has no address or telephone listing.
Citibank processes 16 million A.T.M. transfers a month nearby, all of its national business, but officials asked that the location not be printed because of security concerns. "We don't want anybody to find us," said Jill M. Considine, the clearinghouse association's president and chief executive officer.
A cultural shift is evident in that kind of talk. If this is indeed an emerging center of postmodern money, it will have its own style. Old money capitals graced themselves with symbols of power, stability and might. But where cash is merely a few flashing lines on a computer screen, edifice is irrelevant.
Dependability is measured by the quality of encryption codes and backup generators and the infrequency of bugs and crashes. The hallmark of success is invisibility.
A.T.M. network employees are not bankers. There are software writers and database analysts who work on how to insert new applications and clients into the network, and telecommunication analysts who are like firefighters, ready to jump when a phone line breaks or a processor goes down. Employees say their work is divided between keeping the transaction flow unbroken and adding to that flow with new services.
"A good day here is a very boring day," said Mr. Buscemi, who ran A.T.M.'s for Citibank before going to NYCE.
The self-deprecation belies growing influence. The Secaucus corridor now handles 85 to 90 percent of the entire national traffic in routine automatic monthly consumer payments and credit, totaling three billion transactions a year.
The corridor is one of four concentrations of A.T.M. processing clusters in the country -- tied with Cincinnati and Delaware behind only Milwaukee -- in national A.T.M. traffic volume, with more than 150 million transactions a month, according to Bank Network News, a trade publication. Elsewhere, processing centers -- banks, networks and data companies -- are more dispersed.
In addition to NYCE, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation runs A.T.M.'s across the country from its center in Rochelle Park, N.J. Citibank and Summit Bancorp, New Jersey's largest bank, run their entire electronic funds transfer businesses from the Meadowlands area.
It is also an emerging center for electronic authorizations of purchases using A.T.M. cards, known as debit transactions, in which the money is taken directly from the buyer's checking or savings account at the point of sale. The computers at E.D.S. are connected to more than 700 other computing centers, banks, and merchants around the country. As debit purchases grow in number, network traffic will also grow.
The corridor will soon approach New York, the world capital of money flow, in total dollar transactions. Experts estimate that the Secaucus corridor moves more than $600 billion a day in electronic funds. New York easily moves more than $2 trillion every day, mostly in the international transfer business, Wall Street securities transfers and the Federal Reserve's Fedwire.
By spring 1998, when Fedwire, one of the 900-pound gorillas of the digital money business, moves to New Jersey, that balance will tip. The Secaucus corridor's daily total will pass $1 trillion, while New York will slip to $1.5 trillion or less. The decision-making power of most financial institutions remains in New York. What has shifted is the electronic nexus.
How Secaucus found its groove is partly happenstance. When the New York Clearinghouse Association first came to New Jersey in the 1980's, the constraints of computer technology dictated that two mainframe computers operating on what is called a live backup system -- both processing the same information at the same time -- could be no more than five miles apart without a time lag.
New Jersey made sense because it was on a different power grid and telephone system -- both important data processing safeguards -- but also because the emerging technology of money transfer was based on telecommunications. That has long been one of the state's strengths, because of the presence of AT&T, the state's largest private employer and a longtime fount of industrial skills.
By the time E.D.S. came to the Secaucus area in 1989 with the purchase of the ADP Corporation's A.T.M. business, those labor concerns had become paramount. The new owners decided to stay because the skills were here.
NYCE built its first processing center in the early 1990's, during a recession. Space was cheap. The company, owned by a consortium of banks, most based in New York, looked at a map and decided to stay.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, was cutting costs, consolidating its operations into just three national processing centers: Dallas, Richmond and East Rutherford.
The resulting cluster of businesses and institutions is like an awkward, uncertain teen-ager. NYCE has nearly tripled its New Jersey work force during the last five years, to 120 employees from 45. But because the banks that own it are so close, and in the same line of work, the company has had to reach out beyond the region for talent.
Industry analysts also say that while the forces that created a New Jersey money center are growing in power, they are also evolving so rapidly that the outcome is unknown. Americans are using A.T.M.'s more all the time, with younger generations leading the charge. That means at least short-term growth.
"My parents would never dream of using an A.T.M., but my children would never dream of stepping inside a branch," said Lawrence W. Cohn, a banking analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
But Mr. Cohn said bank network technology also allows greater volume of traffic with fewer workers, and that with better communication links, proximity to New York becomes less relevant.
"The short run has got to be good," Mr. Cohn said. "The long run is not as clear."

HEADLINE: 5 Admit Roles With Mafia In a Trash Hauling Cartel

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
On the eve of a major racketeering trial, five more defendants have pleaded guilty to state charges that they joined what prosecutors call a Mafia cartel that controlled New York City's billion-dollar-a-year private garbage collection industry.
In plea negotiations for reduced sentences, the defendants, all owners of garbage carting and recycling companies, admitted using "economic retaliation against those who broke the cartel's rules." Another carting executive pleaded guilty to a lesser felony charge that he violated the state's antitrust laws, without admitting a role in the cartel. 
 The six guilty pleas last Thursday whittled the ranks of the defendants to 8 from an original list of 17 owners of carting companies and officials of trade associations.
By pleading guilty to the cartel charges, the five executives now face prison terms ranging from one to four and a half years when sentenced on April 17. But a defense lawyer said some of them could be released after only two months to work programs during the day and incarceration at night in halfway houses.
With the owners of several major carting companies now out of the picture, the focus of the trial, which is to begin today, shifts mainly to three reputed mobsters -- Joseph Francolino, Alphonse Malangone and Frank Giovinco -- who are accused of being the Mafia's garbage industry managers.
Prosecutors have said Mr. Francolino is a captain in the Gambino crime family, Mr. Malangone a captain in the Genovese family and Mr. Giovinco a Genovese family soldier, or member. The men were top officials in three trade associations that prosecutors asserted were used to allocate customers and exact payoffs from independent carters who competed with cartel members.
Lawyers for the three men have denied that they are mobsters. Ronald Fischetti, a lawyer for Mr. Francolino, said the pleas would help his defense because "he will not be thrown in the same pot with 16 others."
Jury selection for the remaining eight defendants is to start today in State Supreme Court in Manhattan before Acting Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder.
Those charged in the case were accused of fixing prices and rigging bids to get the major share of $1.5 billion a year in fees for removing and recycling refuse in New York City. Several of the defendants were also charged with arson and violence in a scheme that prosecutors said inflated trash collection costs for virtually every office building, store, restaurant and private hospital and school in the city.
According to District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan, the cartel operated for 40 years, and in 1995, overcharged customers by about $400 million.
In the aftermath of the indictments, the city created a commission to regulate garbage haulers, and three national carting companies that previously shunned New York began competing for business in the city. Industry experts say the increased competition and the role of the watchdog commission have led to sharp price drops for customers, including an annual $1 million cut at an office tower in lower Manhattan.
On Thursday, after admitting that the cartel flourished for years, the five executives each pleaded guilty to a single felony count of attempted enterprise corruption. They, along with the other defendants in the case, had been indicted on more serious charges of violating the state's Organized Crime Control Act. The act sets a maximum prison sentence of 25 years for people convicted of involvement in a "racketeering enterprise," including a criminal gang, an organized crime family or a business cartel.
The owners who agreed to prison terms and forfeiture of assets ranging from $375,000 to $750,000 are Frank Allocca, 68; Daniel Todisco, 42; Dominick Vulpis, 55; Henry Tamily, 69, and Joseph Virzi, 69.
Without admitting complicity in the cartel, Raymond Polidori, 49, pleaded guilty to a lesser felony of violating the state's antitrust laws. He was placed on probation for five years and agreed to forfeit $250,000 in assets.
All six were banned from holding jobs in the carting industry in New York City and accepting payments from carting companies doing business in the city.
The forfeitures were part of $268 million in assets held by the original 17 defendants and their 23 companies that were frozen under a court order in 1995 and that are subject to seizure by the state if the defendants are found guilty.
"We got a good deal from these pleas," said Daniel J. Castleman, the head of the Manhattan District Attorney's investigation division. "All but Polidori are going to state prison and are disgorging a fair amount of their criminal proceeds.
"It is another indication that the cartel is basically dead."
But Salvatore J. Marinello, a lawyer for Mr. Vulpis, said that under the plea agreements, some defendants might be eligible for work release after two months in prison. "It was a reasonable plea for my client and a good business decision to settle the matter," he said.
On Jan. 27, the former lead defendant in the case, Angelo Ponte, the owner of what was once the city's largest carting company, pleaded guilty to charges that he was a member of the cartel. He faces two to six years in prison when sentenced.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Pay New York Hospitals Not to Train Doctors, Easing Glut

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In a plan that health experts greeted as brilliant and bizarre, Federal regulators announced yesterday that for the next six years they would pay New York State hospitals not to train physicians.
Just as the Federal Government for many years paid corn farmers to let fields lie fallow, 41 of New York's teaching hospitals will be paid $400 million to not cultivate so many new doctors, their main cash crop. 
 The plan's primary purpose is to stem a growing surplus of doctors in parts of the nation, as well as to save Government money. But the payments are manna to New York's cash-starved hospitals, which are struggling to trim the size of their staffs and adapt to the world of managed care.
The plan required no Congressional action and thus was not debated by senators and representatives from other states. But hospital executives around the nation expressed concern that the Federal agency was playing favorites with New York hospitals because of their political connections and financial clout.
The plan was drawn up and proposed by officials of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a powerful industry group. New York's Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato, are among the most influential legislators in the country, especially on matters of health policy. And New York -- including its hospital union -- strongly supported President Clinton's re-election last year.
Health-care experts across the country were stunned by the plan, which is officially titled the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Project. It was approved by the Health Care Financing Administration, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
"It's an amazing treatment of health care as a commodity -- like grain or milk or meat," said Dr. Alan Hillman, a professor of health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. "I've never heard anything like this before. But I really can't find any fault with it. Maybe this is one of the first rational collaborations between hospitals and the Government."
New York trains 15 percent of the nation's doctors, making it by far the country's leading producer of new physicians. The next largest is California, at 9 percent. The Federal Government finances much of that training through its Medicare program, which pays hospitals up to about $100,000 a year for each resident they train.
Under the new program, 41 hospitals in New York State have agreed to reduce the number of residents they train by 20 to 25 percent over the next six years, resulting in 2,000 fewer residents in the state. In exchange, Medicare will initially continue to pay participating hospitals as if those young doctors were still there, slowly phasing out the payments over the next six years.
The plan is a novel approach to a sticking point in health care: the oversupply of doctors in many specialties and in many parts of the country, which health economists say results in unnecessary tests and procedures and drives up medical costs. Although health experts have been complaining for almost a decade that the country has been producing too many doctors, generous Medicare training subsidies have meant that hospitals continue to churn them out.
"I believe this will be a pathbreaking project," said Bruce C. Vladeck, the administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, who announced the program. "For the first time in 20 years our goals for graduate medical education and the financial incentives will be in line with one another."
Dr. Bruce Siegel, the president of Tampa General Hospital, admitted to envy and some resentment that hospitals in other parts of the country were not involved. "This is a real coup for New York teaching hospitals," he said. "How can we get in on it?"
Dr. Siegel, a former president of New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation, noted that many hospitals throughout the nation were reducing the number of doctors they trained, too. But without Federal help, he said, "a lot of us are having to cut back on residents and we're suffering the reimbursement implications of that immediately."
Dr. Siegel said that the increasingly powerful health maintenance organizations had pushed hospitals to rely less on residents. He added that as managed care companies were insisting on shorter hospital stays and were reducing the number of hospital procedures, many medical centers were finding they no longer had enough patients to train all the residents they employ.
Mr. Vladeck acknowledged that some Republican Congressmen had complained that the plan had been offered solely to hospitals in New York, but added that demonstration projects are intended to test the strategy and are necessarily somewhat limited in scope.
"If other people think this is a good deal, they have the power to make it more available," he said, noting that Medicare legislation could offer a similar program in other parts of the country. Mr. Vladeck was previously a health-care executive in New York.
The program is voluntary, but 41 hospitals in New York State are participating, including virtually all its major medical centers. Each hospital has agreed either to cut the number of residents by 25 percent over 6 years, or by 20 percent while improving primary care training. During the first year, the hospitals will get as much Medicare money for medical training as they would if they were educating as many doctors as they are now, Mr. Vladeck said. During the second year they would receive 95 percent of that amount, then 85 percent in the third year, and continuing to drop to zero in the seventh year. By then, the hospitals will be paid only for the residents they are actually training.
Hospitals have to decide by Friday how many training positions to offer to new residents who begin on July 1. Officials at the Greater New York Hospital Association predicted that there would be 300 to 400 fewer residency positions in New York's hospitals by next year.
"Under this voluntary demonstration project, participating hospitals will be partly cushioned from financial loss as they reduce the number of residents they train and restructure their training programs to respond to the new marketplace," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. At a news conference at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, hospital executives who had cut short their holiday weekend were glowing at the prospect of newly found Federal funds to ease the transition into the next century. Champagne toasts and thank you's for Mr. Vladeck and Mr. Raske filled the air.
The hospitals' executives said the program would allow them to wean themselves from their dependence on the cheap labor of residents rather than having to go cold turkey. Hospitals currently receive up to $100,000 a year from Medicare for each resident and pay these doctors-in-training $40,000 for a 90 hour workweek. So residents often do tasks that could be performed by less highly-trained personnel or sometimes even machines.
Hospital executives said they might use the Federal funds to hire more physicians' assistants or nurse-practitioners, for example.
"This cushion affords us a revenue base to reinvest into alternative types of service delivery and to upgrade our technology," said LaRay Brown, a vice president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Mr. Vladeck said that while the Federal Government would pay out about $400 million to the hospitals, that is $300 million less than what it would spend if the current system were continued. And in the point of the whole exercise, by the time the program ends the Government will save a substantial sum of money because New York's hospitals will be educating 25 percent fewer doctors each year.
"I think this could be a win-win-win situation," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropic group. "This produces a good outcome for H.C.F.A., a good outcome for New York hospitals and a good outcome for redesigning graduate medical education."

Youth Is Served in Market
As the stock market has soared during the last several years, it has often seemed as if the manager of the latest hot mutual fund is barely out of college. A new study supports that impression, concluding that the younger the manager, the better the performance. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D10.]
 
Interest in On-Line Sports Services
Two Internet media companies, Starwave and Sportsline USA, are attracting the interest of big corporate investors like Disney and CBS. Industry executives say the possible investments and deepening partnerships with established media companies could be a prelude to the two start-ups, known for their on-line sports services, going public.

G.M. Makes Politics Its Business
As it builds new factories in Poland, Thailand and Argentina, and as the rising dollar has helped propel sales of foreign cars in America, General Motors, which once steered clear of politics, is becoming much more active on public policy issues. [D2.]
 
The U.A.W. reached a tentative contract agreement with an important supplier to G.M., averting a strike. [D2.]
 
Caribbean Seeks More Airlines
For the Caribbean islands, the threat of an American Airlines strike at the peak of the tourist season was a scary reminder that their reliance on one airline could prove as economically devastating as some hurricanes. Caribbean officials are taking steps to try to lessen their dependence on American. [D4.]
 
First Unionized Wal-Mart
An unusual decision by an Ontario government panel has produced the first unionized store for the Wal-Mart chain, even though a majority of the department store's employees voted against joining the union. [D3.]
 
Publishers' Group to Support Show
Hoping to make peace with book publishers and restore relevance to what many publishers have come to see as an outmoded, costly event, the new owner of the nation's biggest book show -- a unit of Reed Elsevier -- will announce that the publishers trade association has agreed to serve as a co-sponsor of the convention.

The Cuban Government has invited about 100 American business leaders and celebrities to a $500-a-plate dinner in Havana next week to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the world-renowned Cohiba cigar, Reuters said, quoting a report in yesterday's Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.
As most Americans are prohibited from traveling to Cuba under a longstanding United States embargo, Cuban officials are tight-lipped about the guest list. But published reports say the movie stars JACK NICHOLSON, DANNY DE VITO, MATT DILLON and ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER may be among those invited.
"It is my understanding that everyone who is going is going legally," said John Kavulich, president of the United States-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a private business group. In the United States, where Cuban cigars are banned, a box of 25 Cohiba cigars, President Fidel Castro's favorite until he stopped smoking, is said to cost more than $800.
The dinner is to be held on Feb. 28 at Havana's famed Tropicana Club, to raise money for Cuba's health-care system, The Sun-Sentinel said. More than 600 guests worldwide have been invited. "To someone who smokes cigars it's like going to the Academy Awards," said Richard Sachs, a Boca Raton, Fla., stockbroker, who declined his invitation. ELAINE LOUIE

HEADLINE: Third World Might Not Welcome Global Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It was difficult to miss the irony of Paul Krugman's lengthy dismissal of globalization ("We Are Not the World," Op-Ed, Feb. 13) appearing in the same issue that had a front-page story on the World Trade Organization's upcoming ruling on the "legality" of the Helms-Burton Act. 
 Only a few years ago it would have been impossible to imagine the United States permitting a group of international trade technocrats to strike down an American law, much less a statute alleged to have national security implications. This appears to be exactly the sort of intrusive globalization that Mr. Krugman denies.
He seems also to have missed a number of disturbing developments in globalization technology. These include your recent report on the imminent and controversial launching of numerous spy satellites by several corporations (front page, Feb. 10). These "eyes in the sky" will now allow transnational corporations the kind of detailed global surveillance formerly available only to the superpowers.
The fact is that globalization is here, and new technologies and trade technocracies are providing it a growing political and technical infrastructure. Clearly, this globalization trend could profoundly undermine national sovereignty, as well as individual privacy. Denials like Mr. Krugman's will not make these inevitable problems of globalization disappear.

Elusive Wage Gains

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 13 front-page article "In Era of Belt-Tightening, Modest Gains for Workers" paints an overly optimistic impression of recent and future wage gains. 
 You report that "nationwide, hourly wages, in current dollars, are rising at an annual rate of 3.8 percent -- about five-tenths of 1 percent above the inflation rate." This figure is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' highly volatile survey of production and nonsupervisory workers. Other wage series, which are generally considered broader and more reliable, show less wage growth.
The B.L.S.'s Current Population Survey shows that the median weekly wage of full-time workers increased by only 3.1 percent between the last quarter of 1995 and the last quarter of 1996.
More important, the B.L.S.'s Employment Cost Index, which is widely considered the best measure of wage pressures, showed just a 2.9 percent increase in total compensation growth (wage and salary plus fringes) in 1996, barely keeping pace with inflation.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

DATELINE: RUTHERFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
FOR more than 50 years, Georges de Latour Private Reserve cabernet sauvignon from Beaulieu Vineyard has been the benchmark by which all California cabernets are judged.
But being a benchmark does not always mean being the best. Last year, Orley Ashenfelter, the Princeton University economist, who rates wines using auction prices, produced a new classification of California cabernets. He used Beaulieu Vineyard's Private Reserve as his benchmark, because, he said, it was "the most commonly sold mature premium California wine." 
 Based on auction prices alone, he rated 17 wines higher than the Private Reserve, with Caymus Vineyards' Special Selection at the top; 19 were rated lower. In his previous classification, in 1991, 11 wines commanded higher prices than the Private Reserve.
He insisted that Private Reserve had not declined. It "simply had more competition at the top end of the market," he said.
Other critics have been less circumspect. There is a general perception among them, present company included, that the Private Reserve has slipped in recent years and that the prices commanded by other cabernets reflect not just auction-market hype but also better quality.
The people at Beaulieu Vineyard, in the heart of the Napa Valley, are proceeding on that premise. Beaulieu's wine maker, Joel Aiken, and his staff have vowed to recapture the Private Reserve's pre-eminence among America's red wines.
And they have not confined their efforts to the Private Reserve. With the blessing of its parent company, Heublein Inc., a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan, Beaulieu has added new wines to its line, invested in new equipment and adopted new processing techniques in the vineyards and the cellar. Old vineyards have been replanted and new ones added.
A brochure prepared for the 1988 release of the 1986 Private Reserve, the wine's 50th vintage, noted that it had been made "using the same time-honored methods for over half a century -- fermented in open-top tanks, then clarified in century-old redwood tanks, before slow-aging in American oak barrels."
Georges de Latour Private Reserve had a distinctive taste. Andre Tchelistcheff, Beaulieu's principal enologist from 1938 to 1973 and a consultant until his death at 92 in 1994, described its distinctive taste as "Rutherford dust," referring to the soil in the vineyards around the winery in this community.
But he acknowledged, too, that the taste and smell of the wine derived in a large part from its contact with the American redwood tanks and American oak barrels.
Today, the wine goes directly from the stainless-steel fermenters -- still open-topped -- to a combination of American oak and French oak barrels. One recent morning, Beaulieu's assistant wine makers, Jeffrey Stambor and Robert Masyczek, put together a tasting of four vintages of Private Reserve: 1993 and 1994, made under the new dispensation, and 1975 and 1985, made the old way.
Both of the newer wines were made of 100 percent cabernet sauvignon, as were all of the old Private Reserves, but Mr. Aiken may add other wines for a blend if he deems it necessary. For example, a touch of merlot was added to the 1990.
Neither the 1975 nor the 1985 was at its best. The 1975 had faded, and the 1985, outstanding in its youth, seemed closed-in and somewhat harsh. The 1993 and 1994 could not help but come off well by comparison. To their credit, the newer wines clearly showed their Private Reserve lineage. But they also showed that they were of a different style.
They were lean, intense and elegant. There was always something rustic about the traditional Private Reserve, even though it could hold its own with the world's finest. Occasionally an older Private Reserve might be mistaken for a Chateau Latour, but usually it made no attempt to hide its California heritage.
The newer wines could be said to be more complex and sophisticated.
The first Private Reserve was made in 1936. Mr. de Latour, who founded Beaulieu in 1900, said it was the wine he had been trying to make all his life. After his death in 1940, his name was added to the label.
When the 1986 Private Reserve was released in 1988, Beaulieu offered a tasting of all its Private Reserves, and the 1936 turned out to be one of the stars. It showed its age but was still rich and balanced. When it was first released, it cost $1.45.
Beaulieu's Private Reserve has changed. Change involves risk. Will a more contemporary-style wine win back some of its prestige? Or will it become just another high-quality cabernet, cast from the same mold as a dozen other wines?
Beaulieu has a lot riding on its new Private Reserve. All of its other wines bask to some extent in the glory of the vineyard's principal wine. Which is not to say the company hasn't hedged its bet.
There is a new wine that Beaulieu hopes will make its name among the best reds. Called Tapestry, it is a blend of 75 percent cabernet sauvignon, 17 percent merlot, 7 percent cabernet franc and 1 percent malbec. In other words, a classic Bordeaux blend. With a proprietary name like Tapestry, the blend can be changed from year to year. Appropriately, two-thirds of it is aged in French oak, the rest in American.
Tapestry is a moderately priced wine, about $20, compared with about $40 for the Private Reserve. Beaulieu has two other cabernets: Rutherford, an excellent buy at about $12, and Beautour, at about $9.
 
TASTINGS
Chateau Prieure-Lichine 1993. Margaux (Bordeaux). About $20.
 
Rain bracketed the 1993 vintage. It came down in torrents in April and June, just when the vines were beginning to flower. Then, intermittently, it poured again in September and October. It was the perfect condition for a viticultural disaster. O.K., the 1993 vintage in Bordeaux was not great, but it has turned out to be a useful one. Some of the wines are thin, thanks to all that water, but many of the wines are surprisingly good. They are medium-bodied and have good color. And in spite of some rough tannins here and there, they are ready to drink. Prieure-Lichine, which has been getting better and better in recent years, is one of the successes of the year, with its excellent fruitiness and an attractive bouquet. It is a wine to enjoy while waiting for more highly touted vintages to mature. It also offers another example of how unfair it can be to make blanket condemnations of a middling vintage.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Eases Against Mark Amid New Doubt on the Euro

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a three-year high against the German mark yesterday before retreating as the mark recovered on new doubts about the 1999 schedule for the first stage of European monetary union.
But traders returning from a three-day weekend in the United States said that demand for the dollar remained strong and that the underlying forces pushing the currency higher still seemed in place. 
 "The dollar has gone up really fast, and you'd have to expect a bit of a pullback," said Renato Strauss, vice president for foreign-exchange trading at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York. "Generally, we're still bullish on the dollar."
While American markets were closed on Monday for Washington's Birthday, the dollar traded as high as 1.7003 marks in Europe.
In intraday dealing yesterday, the dollar rose to another three-year high, 1.7050 marks, before settling in New York at 1.6839 marks, down from 1.6885 late Friday.
The dollar also ended lower against the Japanese yen, at 123.88 yen, compared with 124.22 on Friday.
The British pound weakened on lessened expectations for higher interest rates in Britain, falling in New York to $1.6084, from $1.6221 Friday.
Traders said the main theme in currency dealings yesterday was a rebound in the mark, largely over new speculation that the European Union's plan for a single currency in less than two years would be delayed.
That speculation centered on doubts that Italy would qualify under the strict fiscal criteria for joining the initial group of countries that will use the new currency, to be known as the Euro. Although Italy has taken steps to lower its inflation rate and budget deficit, traders said there was rising doubt whether it could sustain the fiscal austerity required to help the Euro plan succeed.
Doubt about Italy's initial participation was reinforced yesterday by Deputy Finance Minister Jurgen Stark of Germany, who said after a meeting of European finance ministers that no decision had yet been made about which countries would participate first. Any doubt about the timetable for the transition to the Euro tends to benefit the mark, the strongest national currency in Europe.

HEADLINE: Spinoff From Digital to Make Software Tools

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation plans to announce today that it is setting up an independent company, Tracepoint Technology Inc. to produce software development tools. The tools will be used to produce programs for computers using the Intel Corporation's Pentium microprocessors and the Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.
Software development tools allow programmers to write more efficient applications, more rapidly, than they can using only programming languages. Tracepoint's tools are based on the C and C++ languages developed by AT&T. 
 Tracepoint, which will be based in San Jose, Calif., will be majority-owned by Digital and will initially be staffed by about 24 former Digital employees. Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm based in Menlo Park, Calif., has raised $2.5 million in financing for the entity.
Jay Zager, Digital's vice president of operations, said in a telephone interview that Tracepoint's development tools were originally created at the company's Western Research Lab in Palo Alto for use with Digital's Alpha computer chip and the Unix operating system. Though the tools were included at no cost with the Alpha Unix operating system software, Digital perceived a market opportunity for comparable tools in the Intel/Windows market, he said.
"Digital is not going to be in the business of PC software, so we created an independent entity, got some funding, and will really operate this venture as a stand-alone company," Mr. Zager said. "We believe the time is ripe and the market should be robust. We believe there are about a million C++ programmers out there who should be ripe for this product."
Mark Stevens, a general partner in Sequoia, said he believed that those programmers represented a strong potential market, because only one other company, Pure Atria Inc., produces similar tools. And even Pure Atria is not a direct competitor, Mr. Stevens said.
Donald DePalma, an analyst with Forrester Research, said the spinoff would allow Digital to reap some return on its investment in software technology, while the company concentrates on hardware. "Application development tools are pretty far removed from their core competencies," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Slip a Bit In Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices edged lower in thin trading yesterday, with many investors reluctant to buy ahead of today's report on consumer prices.
A strong dollar supported bonds early in the session, but when the dollar retreated, bond investors used the slippage as an excuse to sell. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 8/32, to 101 2/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.54 percent, from 6.53 percent on Friday. The Treasury market was closed on Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.
While recent reports have shown few signs of inflationary price pressures, market participants were taking few chances yesterday ahead of the January Consumer Price Index report, which is scheduled for release today.
The market is expecting a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in the index, with a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in the so-called core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy.
"Anything stronger at the core will be of concern to bond traders," said Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. A small amount of investor anxiety was priced in yesterday ahead of today's C.P.I. and December trade data, he said.
Still, the economic outlook for bonds has been very bright of late. "Economic growth is decelerating from the eye-popping pace of fourth quarter 1996 and inflation statistics continue to surprise us on the low side," noted Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis.
"Chairman Greenspan has been lucky, but also correct," he said, referring to Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve. "Right now the motto at the Federal Reserve is 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' "
While many in the bond market continue to weigh the direction of interest rates, others are looking to see if the dollar's rally this year has peaked. A weaker dollar would make American assets like Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors.
When the dollar came off a high against the German mark yesterday, Mr. Regan said, it caused "some market participants to think that the dollar, at least on a temporary basis, may have reached a plateau."
The results of the Treasury's regular weekly bill auction came in as expected, with the average rate for a three-month bill at 4.98 percent, down from 5.02 percent last week, with the average rate for a six-month issue at 5.03 percent, down from 5.07 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction:

HEADLINE: Marriott Aims Overseas With Acquisition

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Expanding its presence in the hotel business overseas, Marriott International said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Renaissance Hotel Group, a company based in Hong Kong that operates and franchises 150 hotels in 38 countries.
The acquisition for about $1 billion, which also involves taking over $50 million in Renaissance debt, would more than double the number of hotels run by Marriott outside the United States. The deal would help Marriott cement relationships with international travelers and make it more competitive abroad with the upscale properties of ITT Sheraton and the Hilton Hotels Corporation. 
 "We are now becoming a truly global hotel company," said J. W. Marriott Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Marriott, who added that for the first time in the company's 40-year history it would have hotels in Japan, Italy, China, Russia, India and Turkey.
Marriott operates 1,075 hotels in the United States and 75 overseas, while all but 35 of Renaissance's hotels are outside the United States. Among the hotels that would be run by Marriott after the acquisition are the Renaissance in New York, the Stanford Court in San Francisco and airport hotels in Denver, Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla. Marriott anticipates retaining the Renaissance name.
The Hong Kong company that has majority control of Renaissance, the New World Development Company, has agreed to the acquisition in which shareholders will receive $30 a share in cash, a 19 percent premium over Friday's closing price of $25.125. Renaissance shares closed at $29.75 each yesterday, up $4.625; Marriott shares closed at $56.25, up $1.
The acquisition by Marriott comes about a month after the Doubletree Corporation agreed to pay $890 million for Renaissance, or $8 a share. Doubletree said yesterday that it would not bid against Marriott, but would receive a $15 million breakup fee from Renaissance under terms of its earlier agreement. Doubletree closed at $43.125, up $2.50.
In addition to hotels under the same name, Renaissance runs properties under the New World and Ramada International names. After the acquisition, Marriott will have a total of 10 hotel brands. Current Marriott brands include the Fairfield economy properties and Ritz-Carlton, the luxury chain of which it owns 49 percent, with options to buy the remainder. Renaissance licenses the Ramada name in the United States and Canada.
Following by just a few weeks Hilton's $6.5 billion offer for the ITT Corporation, the Marriott transaction underscores the continuing consolidation of the hotel industry as it has returned to financial health. Although ITT rejected the Hilton offer last week as inadequate, that is not expected to end the matter, and at least one other large hotel chain is also widely regarded to be for sale.
Mr. Marriott said negotiations with Renaissance predated Hilton's recent offer for ITT.
Henry K. S. Cheng, chairman of Renaissance and managing director of New World, said yesterday that "a few bidders were interested in our company," but that Marriott was the most suitable. "We believe Marriott is a better hotel operator than we are. With their management, our hotel properties can perform better in the future," Dr. Cheng said.
Dr. Cheng will join Marriott International's board of directors.
Marriott will finance the acquisition largely through an existing $1 billion revolving credit line and expects to begin a tender offer for all outstanding Renaissance shares within five business days. The company anticipates completing the purchase by the end of next month.
"The acquisition makes strategic sense," said Mark Mutkoski, the senior lodging analyst BT Securities Corporation. "They get all those fee-based management contracts, and in New World, they have one of the largest hotel development companies. And they can improve Renaissance's rate and occupancy as they have Ritz-Carlton's."
Marriott estimates the acquisition will increase its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by $75 million to $85 million in the first 12 months but it will reduce 1997 fiscal year net income by between 10 and 14 cents a share. However, Mr. Marriott said the company expected strong growth in future years through aggressive hotel expansion and cost savings of at least $15 million to $20 million a year by combining marketing, reservations and administrative systems.
While Renaissance is getting out of hotel management in favor of Marriott, Dr. Cheng said it was not getting out of hotel development. "We have quite a lot of hotels in the pipeline." he said, "especially in Hong Kong and China." Marriott and Renaissance together have more than 350 hotels with 50,000 rooms under development that are expected to open within the next three years.
Asked if he considered it risky to be so involved in China and Hong Kong, which is scheduled to revert to China on July 1, Mr. Marriott deferred to Dr. Cheng.
Noting that he lives, develops and does business in Hong Kong, Dr. Cheng said he had "full confidence" in Hong Kong's future. China cannot reverse Hong Kong's economic policy, he said, because the world is watching and, "If Hong Kong is successful, China is successful." Besides, he added, "China has to make Hong Kong prosperous as a model for Taiwan."

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb; Dow at High Of 7,067.46

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Continuing to defy the predictions of even the most optimistic bulls, the stock market extended its early-year rally yesterday, rising sharply.
The Dow Jones industrial average -- which had slumbered through much of the session -- awoke in late trading and rose to close up 78.50 points, or 1.12 percent, at a record high of 7,067.46. For the year, the Dow is up 9.6 percent. 
 While much of yesterday's trading activity revolved around a number of high-profile mergers and acquisitions, the late-afternoon rally among blue-chip stocks lifted most indexes, and left many analysts perplexed.
"Today's a tough call," Warren Epstein, director of trading at Richard A. Rosenblatt & Company, said. "The market's up and there's really nothing to speak of. It must be momentum," he said of a market that rose about 80 points in the last hour. "To see the market do something that doesn't make a lot of sense really doesn't surprise me."
Among several analysts, however, there is a growing consensus that heavy cash inflows into mutual funds are driving stock prices higher. While healthy corporate earnings, low inflation and a benign bond market continue to bolster equities, some believe that the influence of hoards of cash is beginning to outstrip other fundamentals.
"There are times in the market where you're not trading statistics, but you're trading momentum," said Raymond Worseck, chief economist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "The dynamics of current money flows are overwhelming the economic statistics."
The Dow was led yesterday by Philip Morris, up 5 3/4, to 131 1/4, after Bloomberg News reported that American cigarette makers were negotiating to settle health-related lawsuits.
More than two-thirds of the Dow's gains were attributed to Philip Morris and four other companies: Procter & Gamble, J. P. Morgan, Boeing and Merck -- most of which have been among the best-performing Dow stocks this year.
Procter & Gamble was up 4 5/8 yesterday, to 129 1/2; J. P. Morgan was up 2 3/4, to 109 1/2; Boeing was up 2 1/4, to 110, and Merck was up 1 7/8, to 99 1/4.
"The story is we have been narrow, we continue to be narrow and it really doesn't matter because we've had concerted basket buying of these stocks," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "This is the continuing deployment of funds into the favorite stocks."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks also set a record yesterday, closing up 7.81 points, to 816.29. Notable among the S.& P. stocks this year have been financial services issues.
In fact, financial stocks have seen the most impressive gains this year. The S.& P. Financials Index, for example, is up 17.87 percent, far outpacing the S.& P. 500, which is up 10.2 percent.
Even better is the S.& P. Banks Composite, up 18.1 percent, partly because not one of the 27 banks listed in the index has lost ground this year. Even its worst performer, Corestates Financial, is up 6.02 percent.
Financial issues got an extra lift yesterday after H. F. Ahmanson, the nation's largest savings and loan, made an unsolicited offer to acquire Great Western Financial, a deal that would create one of the largest financial institutions in California. Shares of Great Western soared 10 5/8, to 44 7/8, and shares of Ahmanson were up 4 3/8, to 44 7/8.
Several other merger deals made news yesterday. The Evergreen Media Corporation, which owns radio stations nationwide, agreed to buy Chancellor Broadcasting. Shares of Evergreen lost 1 1/4, to 31 1/2, and shares of Chancellor rose 6.25 cents, to 28.
In health care, the HealthSouth Corporation said it would acquire Horizon/CMS Healthcare for nearly $1 billion. Shares of HealthSouth fell 2 1/8, to 41, and Horizon rose 2 1/4, to 16 1/2.

HEADLINE: Gore Informs Labor Of New Restrictions On U.S. Contractors

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore told A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders today that the Clinton Administration would soon issue regulations imposing new restrictions on Federal contracts to companies that violate laws on occupational safety, overtime and union organizing.
The labor movement has pushed for years for restrictions to punish companies that flout laws protecting workers. But it was only after the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last year undertook its largest campaign ever to elect Democrats that Mr. Gore announced the new procurement rules. 
 Under the Administration's new policy, made public by the Vice President at the federation's four-day meeting here, companies' adherence to labor laws is to be taken into account for the first time in the awarding of Federal contracts, and those that have violated such laws could be barred from receiving them.
"We're going to send a message to companies that want to do business with the Federal Government: how you treat employees and how you treat unions counts with us," said Mr. Gore, standing with the federation's president, John J. Sweeney, at a news conference. "If you want to do business with the Federal Government, you'd better maintain a safe workplace and respect civil, human and union rights."
Mr. Gore announced the new policy on a day when he and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, appeared before the federation's executive council in what was widely viewed as a beauty contest between two future Presidential candidates vying for labor's dollars and endorsement.
Mr. Gephardt, who is spending four days in Los Angeles during the labor meeting, pronounced views today opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement that were virtually identical to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s.
He and Mr. Gore appeared to be trying to outdo each other in talking about their concern for working families and their dismay that wages for most workers had lagged inflation.
"Since 1979, American workers have had a 10 percent pay cut, while their productivity has gone up 16 percent," Mr. Gephardt said at a news conference a few hours before Mr. Gore's. "This to me is the core challenge that our country faces."
The Administration's tougher rules for Federal contractors are to be spelled out in procurement regulations that it will soon propose. After that, companies, unions and the public as a whole will have 60 days to respond to the proposal before any final adoption.
Mr. Gore's announcement of those rules, welcomed by union leaders, coincides with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new crusade to unionize millions of more workers and so reverse the long-term decline in unions' membership and power. One of the overriding themes at this meeting is that hundreds of corporations have brought union organizing drives to a halt by flouting Federal law -- for example, by threatening to dismiss workers who support unionization.
Not everyone, though, expressed enthusiasm for the Administration's initiative.
"It's just pandering," Jeffrey H. Joseph, vice president for domestic policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said in a telephone interview. "This is rewarding them by saying that under the current labor laws, which have been balanced over the past 50 years, you don't win, and we want to change the rules to stack them in your favor."
Under current practice, Federal contractors are generally reimbursed for all costs incurred in fulfilling the contract. But Mr. Gore said today that as part of the Administration's new plan, contractors would no longer be able to have the Government reimburse them for money they spend fighting unionization drives. Similarly, they would not be reimbursed for money they spend fighting suits brought by Federal agencies charging them with labor law violations.
"The right to organize and the right to strike," Mr. Gore said, "are fundamental rights, and nobody's tax dollars should be spent undermining those rights."
Neither Federal officials nor labor leaders could estimate today how much Federal money was spent to repay contractors for such activities. Nor could they estimate how many companies would be excluded from Federal contracts under the new rules. But union officials did point to a recent study by the General Accounting Office listing hundreds of Federal contractors that had been found guilty of labor law violations.
Among those violations are infractions of occupational safety laws. Federal officials said that under the new rules, they would weigh a company's overall record in complying with safety and other labor laws to determine whether the employer should qualify for contracts.
This is not the first time that Mr. Gore has visited the winter meeting with a promise pleasing to organized labor. At the 1995 meeting, he announced that the Administration would bar the awarding of Federal contracts to companies that hired permanent replacements for striking workers. But a Federal appeals court later overturned that policy.
In any event, some union leaders said they were surprised by how pro-union Mr. Gore's oratory was today.
"Working men and women who are in unions earn more, get better benefits and are safer on the job than workers who are not unionized," Mr. Gore said. "You can say the state of the Union depends in part on the strength of our unions."
But the Vice President was not alone in winning high marks here. Mr. Gephardt, who has now visited the federation's winter meeting 14 years in a row, "was very good," said Arthur Coia, president of the Laborers International Union. "He says the same things we do. He takes the same positions about workers that we do."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Circling the Wagons With a Bid for Great Western

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
For a chief executive, Charles R. Rinehart has long been unusually glum about the prospects of the company he runs. His new recipe for success: buy another company that is in just as bad a position and dismiss thousands of redundant employees.
Mr. Rinehart heads H. F. Ahmanson & Company, the largest savings and loan institution in the country. Late Monday it made an unsolicited offer to buy the Great Western Financial Corporation, the country's second-largest savings institution, for stock worth $6.6 billion. 
 But there is little profit in the traditional savings and loan business of making mortgage loans with money raised from certificates of deposit, and this deal will not change those economics. Nor will it eliminate the tens of billions of dollars in loans the two companies made in the late 1980's to finance California homes now worth far less than the mortgage balances due.
Mr. Rinehart hopes that the combined companies can move more quickly toward being more like banks, expanding offerings to include checking accounts, consumer loans and business services. Most of all, he hopes to close 201 branches, primarily in California, and eliminate $400 million a year in expenses.
Ahmanson declined to say how many people would lose their jobs should the deal go through. But as a rule of thumb, analysts said, since the company declared that it would shed 45 percent of Great Western's annual expenses, the same proportion -- or 6,300 of its 14,400 jobs -- will disappear.
In a very unusual tactic, all of those job cuts would come at the expense of Great Western employees. In a voice-mail message to Ahmanson employees yesterday, Mr. Rinehart said that none of them would lose their jobs or receive reduced responsibilities as a result of the acquisition. The policy in most mergers is to choose the best person from either company for each job.
"We felt we had to dance with the ones that brung us," Mr. Rinehart said yesterday, adding that most companies do not do enough to motivate and reward their employees.
If consummated, the deal would combine two institutions that financed the construction of many of the sunny suburbs that blanketed Southern California after World War II. Ahmanson's Home Savings of America built monolithic, mural-clad bank branches amid the new developments. Great Western emphasized cowboy imagery in its ads, with John Wayne and later Dennis Weaver as spokesmen.
But as it did for the cowboy, the sun is setting on the savings and loan. Both Great Western and Ahmanson are making far fewer new mortgage loans than they used to. Perhaps the best indicator that an era has ended: Two weeks ago, Great Western said it would end its cowboy ads and dismiss Dennis Weaver so it could have a more modern image.
For most of the last two decades shares of the two savings companies have traded within about $1 of each other. But in the last year, Ahmanson has surged ahead. On Friday, Ahmanson shares closed at $40.50, 18 percent more than Great Western's share price of $34.25.
The gap reflects the rising confidence of investors in Mr. Rinehart and Ahmanson's strategy and their increasing frustration with the slow progress made by Great Western under its chief, John F. Maher.
"Ahmanson's management has shown they are very smart, very aggressive and interested in increasing shareholder value above all else," said Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst with Smith Barney. He praised Ahmanson's cost-cutting, stock buyback plan and purchase of 61 former First Interstate Bancorporation branches that were sold after that bank's acquisition by Wells Fargo & Company.
Investors have criticized Great Western for being slow to cut costs.
The increase in the relative price of Ahmanson's stock helped give it the power to make an offer that Great Western should find too good to refuse. Ahmanson offered to exchange 1.05 of its shares for each share of Great Western. Based on Ahmanson's stock price Friday, that made the offer worth $42.53 a share.
Wall Street embraced the prospects of a merger, running Ahmanson's stock up by $4.375, to $44.875. That means its offer to Great Western shareholders is now worth $47.11 a share. Great Western's stock jumped $10.625 a share, to $44.875.
The success of Ahmanson's bid will largely turn on whether other companies emerge with higher bids for Great Western.
In theory, Great Western represents the best way for a big banking company to enter California. But many analysts and investment bankers feel that the huge weight of the low-yielding mortgages on Great Western's books will ultimately scare off most big banks.
Most eyes on Wall Street turned to Washington Mutual Inc., the acquisitive savings institution based in Seattle. When the company moved into California last year by buying American Savings Bank, Washington Mutual's chairman, Kerry Killinger, said it would like to buy more California companies.
Analysts read that as a none-too-subtle reference to Great Western. Yet it would take a leap for Washington Mutual to outbid Ahmanson.
It could close some duplicate branches, but Great Western has more overlap with Ahmanson. Moreover, Mr. Killinger has said that any acquisition must raise per-share earnings by 10 percent in the first year. Analysts said that the price he would have to pay to outbid Ahmanson would not meet that target.
A spokesman for Washington Mutual said only that the company wanted to continue to grow in California and was studying its options.
Most analysts said yesterday that it was unlikely Great Western would remain independent because the pressure from shareholders to sell to someone would be too great.

HEADLINE: Moving to Insure Preservation, 2 States Sign Deal for Sterling Forest

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
New Jersey and New York signed a landmark agreement yesterday with the owner of Sterling Forest, a largely undeveloped 17,500-acre natural refuge, to acquire more than 90 percent of the land for $55 million, guaranteeing that the pristine acreage will not be developed.
The $5 million down payment for the property was provided by the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands, said Michael F. McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, who signed the agreement with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. 
 The fate of the land, which provides drinking water for the northern part of New Jersey, had been undecided for more than a decade until last October, when the Senate passed a bill that would help finance the preservation of much of the forest, which lies about 40 miles northwest of Manhattan and straddles both states. The bill allocated $17.5 million to help buy the land from a private owner who otherwise might have developed it.
The owners, the Zurich Insurance Group of Switzerland, had planned to develop office buildings, shopping centers, golf courses and a community of 13,000 homes, but agreed to sell the land to the Trust for Public Land and Open Space Institute provided the deal could be worked out by the spring of 1998.
"The preservation of Sterling Forest is finally within our grasp," Governor Pataki said in a statement. "But there is still much to be done. I remain firmly committed to complete the Sterling Forest acquisition, so we can insure that we protect and preserve this natural jewel."
Closing the deal will require an additional $21 million in public and private financing to supplement the $34 million already pledged for the purchase, including $10 million from New York and New Jersey.
This spring, Congress will consider a second appropriation of $8.5 million for the forest.
"I have always said that protecting Sterling Forest is both the right environmental choice and the best economic policy," Governor Whitman said in a statement. "We can contribute a few million dollars to help protect drinking water today and gain a magnificent new park."

HEADLINE: Casino Development Panel Tightens Its Property Rules

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
Since casino gambling started in Atlantic City two decades ago, it has been touted as the key to the city's revival. In fact, the State Legislature imposed a tax on casino revenue to pay for new housing for the city's predominantly poor residents.
But fulfilling that promise has been troublesome from the start. Critics have long insisted that the city's housing has been the loser, even though the agency created by the state to reinvest the tax money has had millions of dollars to spend. 
 That criticism has increased in recent months with the disclosure that even though the agency, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, had helped to underwrite the construction of 2,700 housing units over a decade, it had also helped to pay for the construction of 5,000 casino hotel rooms over a four-year period.
Stung by that criticism, the reinvestment agency voted overwhelmingly yesterday to tighten its rules for condemning private property for new casino-related development. But longtime critics of the agency noted that the agency also exempted the property involved in court cases, which prompted the new rules in the first place.
"This is a guilty statement and a public relations ploy by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority," said Glen Zeitz, the attorney for Vera Coking, the owner of a vacant two-story building that sits in the shadow of Trump Plaza. The authority originally condemned the building along with Sabatini's Restaurant and the Golden Isle Pawn Shop The owners of the three properties are among those now challenging condemnation actions in court. "They are trying to defuse the anger here over how they have acted toward my client and others and in the process they are discriminating against my client," Mr. Zeitz said.
James Kennedy, the executive director of the 15-member board of the authority, said that what is now explicit in the rules had been implicit all along.
Specifically, if businesses are displaced by condemnation, the new procedures require that space be provided for them in new casino-related construction or in commercial or residential space built elsewhere. The new rules will also require that the board determine that property to be condemned is "essential" to the development and that the construction would result in a more effective use of the land.
"The fight is over how do you have this kind of explosive growth in the casino sector and at the same time protect the integrity of the community," Mr. Kennedy said. "We have done a lot to redevelop the city but clearly it's not enough. There continues to be such a disparity between the wealth of the casinos and the poverty in the city but it has come light years since the 1980's."
Underlying the 1976 referendum that approved casino gambling in the state were public promises that it would also rebuild the blighted resort town., create jobs and fill state tax coffers.
Barely five years afterward, the State Legislature acknowledged that the original law had proved ineffective in producing money for new housing in the city and created the reinvestment authority. That measure also gained broad support by allowing some of the funds to be used for specific development projects in southern New Jersey after 5 years and in northern New Jersey after 10 years.
Fueled by more than $4 billion in proposed new development by casinos, Atlantic City is on the verge of its largest expansion since the first casino opened in 1978. With an eye toward capturing more overnight visitors than day trippers and more conventions than in the past, the city is building a new convention center and an adjacent hotel.
Over the years, the tension over how the reinvestment board uses its condemnation powers and how it spends the money it collects has been complicated by the fact that the 14 casinos get to chose 2 of the 15 members of the board as well as having a final say over how the agency spends the money they are assessed. Consequently, Mr. Kennedy said, the casinos' representatives on the board and the "public members" of the board do not always agree on how to spend the money.
"Our performance as a board so far is incomplete and the city is still very much a work in progress," said Atlantic City Mayor James Whelan, who also sits on the board.
Federal Census data show how the city's housing stock has changed between the dawn of casinos in 1978 and now. In 1980, Atlantic City had a population of 40,199 and 21,520 housing units, and the 1990 census said it had a population of 37,525 and 21,626 housing units. In 1980, there were 198 boarded-up buildings, and the 1990 census counted 505.
Although replacement construction has lowered the percentage of pre-1940 buildings from 55.3 in 1980 to 36.7 in 1990, the percentage of housing units classified as "overcrowded" by the Census Bureau had risen to 8.8 from 5.7.
In the Westside and Venice Park communities of neat, single-family homes, Lillian Bryant and other homeowners are in a court fight over state plans to condemn their homes to build a covered roadway to a parcel owned by Mirage Resorts. They, too, would not be covered by the proposed new regulations.
Standing on the street named after her father, Horace J. Bryant, who in 1969 became the first black member of a New Jersey governor's cabinet, Ms. Bryant called the rules "hypocritical."
"They haven't passed a law here where citizens can't vote but casino buildings can," she said. "But they are getting close to that point."

HEADLINE: Japan's Global Trade Surplus Declines

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus plunged 91.7 percent in January from the same month a year ago, the Finance Ministry said today.
Japan's global trade surplus fell to 5.2 billion yen ($41.9 million), its lowest since 1985 and the 26th consecutive monthly fall. An 81.6 percent rise in the surplus with the United States was almost offset by a sharp decline in the surplus with Asia. 
 The yen's 14 percent depreciation against the dollar between August and January drove up import prices of oil, lumber and other materials, helping to shrink the surplus, a ministry official said. It also bolstered auto exports -- including those to the United States, which rose 77.5 percent in January, accounting for much of the surplus with the United States.
Analysts said that adjusted for seasonal factors, the overall surplus was 643.36 billion yen, up 25.6 percent from the prior month.
The dollar was little changed at 124.08 yen after the release of the report, compared with 123.88 yen in late New York trading on Tuesday. Economists had forecast that the overall surplus would be 26 billion yen.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Leader Says 'Cowards' Are Welcome to Leave

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Wednesday, Feb. 18

 BODY:
In another sign that North Korea might accept the defection of a top official, that country's Communist leader, Kim Jong Il, said in an official radio broadcast on Tuesday that "cowards" were welcome to leave.
"As the revolutionary song says: 'Cowards, leave if you want to. We will defend the red flag of revolution to the end,' " Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a Radio Pyongyang broadcast that was monitored in Tokyo. 
 Meanwhile, North Korea has agreed to attend a briefing by the United States and South Korea on proposed peace talks aimed at formally ending the Korean War, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official said today. He said North Korea had informed the United States that it would propose a date for the briefing after the United States announced its package of food assistance for the North.
North Korea had agreed to attend the briefing in January but had put it off while it negotiated to get 500,000 tons of grain from Cargill, the American agribusiness giant.
The remark by Mr. Kim, the announcement about the briefing and assertions in the last few days by United States and South Korean officials that they still intend to supply food to North Korea raise the prospect that the defection, as well as the shooting here on Saturday of another North Korean defector, might not seriously derail efforts to improve relations on the Korean Peninsula.
That would represent a significant change from last fall, when the incursion into South Korea of commandos from a North Korean submarine threw all efforts at building a relationship off the track for months until North Korea expressed regrets.
"The political will on the North and South Korean side seems to be different," said a Western expert, who spoke on Tuesday on condition that he not be identified. "It seems that both are trying to prevent the same thing from happening again." But he and others cautioned that relations on the Korean Peninsula were volatile and moods could shift abruptly.
Some doubt began to emerge on Tuesday that the shooting of Lee Han Young, a prominent defector, was carried out by North Korean agents in retaliation for the defection last week of Hwang Jang Yop, the official who was the architect of North Korea's ideology of juche, or self-reliance. Mr. Lee is now brain dead and is being kept alive by a respirator.
A bullet used in the shooting of Mr. Lee might not have been fired by a Browning pistol, the type favored by North Korean agents, the authorities here said. Also, officials said the apartment in which Mr. Lee was staying had received a mysterious phone call asking his whereabouts a week before Mr. Hwang's defection.
There has been some speculation here that North Korea is preparing to accept the defection of Mr. Hwang, who is now in the South Korean Consulate in Beijing, so that the North would not jeopardize the food and other economic aid that it desperately needs. The South Korean Foreign Ministry official said today that there is no linkage between talks about food aid and peace talks and the resolution of the defection issue.
A senior American offical said on Tuesday that there was no connection between North Korea's actions involving Mr. Hwang and the provision of food aid to the North. American officals say that there is likely to be an increase in the amount of food aid from $6 million to $10 million.
North Korea, which is facing large-scale hunger, probably realizes that persuading China to prevent Mr. Hwang from leaving for South Korea or a third country would be difficult.
Still, China, which is trying to maintain good relations with both North and South Korea, has not indicated what it will do, so it is possible that Mr. Hwang, who just turned 74, will be stranded in the consulate for quite some time.
North Korea, which initially insisted that Mr. Hwang had been kidnapped by South Korea, first indicated that it might accept his defection on Monday, when the official North Korean press agency quoted an official as saying, "If he sought asylum, it means that he is a renegade and he is dismissed."
But that message was delivered only to foreigners. Kim Jong Il's statement on Tuesday was broadcast within North Korea. The statement did not mention Mr. Hwang's name or the fact that he had defected, but it could be laying the groundwork for such an announcement.
"It sounds like they are starting the process of rewriting history and casting Hwang as Judas," the Western expert said. "They are preparing their public for the news that the guy they revered for so many years is now the devil incarnate."
The police are investigating Mr. Lee's private life, because he had huge debts and many lovers, which might have provided a motive for someone to try to kill him. But South Korean officials say North Korean agents are still the primary suspects.

HEADLINE: A Market's Inner-City Success;
Pathmark and Brooklyn Group Both Profit as Partners

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
The revelation came to Roderick B. Mitchell nine Christmases ago, when his supermarket company in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn was bleeding cash. And the first clue was Engelbert Humperdinck.
At a checkout counter in the company's Pathmark on Fulton Street, in the heart of one of the city's largest black communities, were collections of Humperdinck holiday tunes, displayed in a huge but untouched cassette carousel. 
 "I went berserk," said Mr. Mitchell, who had just become chairman of the then-struggling Restoration Supermarket Corporation, a novel joint venture between a grocery chain and a neighborhood development group. "I mean he's a great singer, but it's just not relevant here. Some things were very off-center."
Today, the market is tailored to the neighborhood's African-American and Caribbean customers, the shelves stocked with West Indian spices and the produce section with mango, papaya and sugar cane.
Now, after a decade of streamlining and soul-searching, the supermarket is one of the top performers in the 144-store Pathmark chain, with reported 1996 sales of $30.5 million and record operating profits of $1 million. It is the city's seventh-largest black-owned business.
The ultimate success of the 1977 joint venture between Pathmark Stores Inc. and the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation helped lay the groundwork for the supermarket industry's slow but steady return over the last decade to the inner-city neighborhoods of New York and other major cities, economists and supermarket retailers say.
But that partnership, a national symbol of what could be done to spur economic growth in poor neighborhoods, had an impact far beyond supermarkets. It was a model for nonprofit community development groups that desperately needed private capital and, as it turned out, a profitable lesson for private companies that discovered a new entree into untapped markets.
"There is an incredible burst of movement and growth around the country and a whole new generation of people in the private sector who see how good this is for the corporations," said Bennett Harrison, a professor of urban political economy at the New School for Social Research. "They see that without the neighborhood groups, they'll get blown out of the water, lose their shirt. They've read Tom Wolfe three times and are afraid of getting off at the wrong exit."
In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Pathmark Stores, a division of the Supermarkets General Corporation, saw there was money to be made in the inner city. But it would take a different approach, and the company learned new business practices from the development group: how to stock the shelves with more relevant products, how to prevent pilfering and, perhaps most important, how to promote a white-owned corporation from Woodbridge, N.J., as a friend of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
"The issue was how can we do this transaction without squandering our shareholders' money?" said Leonard Lieberman, a former chairman and chief executive of Supermarkets General who headed its Pathmark division when the Brooklyn deal was made. "We needed to maximize the number of customers who saw this as their own store, not an interloper store."
To reduce its risk, Pathmark made the community, with Restoration as the proxy, the majority stakeholder in the company. Pathmark proposed a joint venture, giving Restoration a two-thirds share and Pathmark a third and operating control. Restoration agreed.
Restoration, which was founded in 1967 to revive the troubled central Brooklyn neighborhood and was seeking to create jobs, urged the company to hire employees from the neighborhood. Pathmark agreed, realizing that the presence of local workers in the store would raise the stakes for the residents.
"We figured that when a 15-year-old kid went to steal a box of cookies, maybe a neighbor would say: 'Don't steal that. This is our store,' " Mr. Lieberman said. "And the dream turned out to be accurate."
But it was not until 1991 that the Brooklyn supermarket, which had reported heavy losses year after year, could produce a balance sheet with no red ink. And for Restoration, the venture was an example of how a nonprofit group learned to act like a business, like a Pathmark.
After Mr. Mitchell, who became president of the development group and its supermarket company in 1988, stumbled on the Engelbert Humperdinck display that year, he ordered an overhaul of the inventory. He sent his staff to the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant to see what customers were buying at greengrocers.
When the development group discovered that teen-agers were loitering outside the store, it created jobs for them, as part of a "Pathmark courtesy crew" to assist customers. Restoration also computerized the pricing system and preached efficiency to store managers.
"We began to manage the things we owned as if we owned them," said Mr. Mitchell, who is 41 and lives in Harlem. "Before, I think we were looking at it from a standpoint of this being, how shall I phrase it, more of a social services institution."
The mission of the Bedford-Stuyvesant group, and of the nation's 2,200 other community development corporations, nonprofit associations that first emerged in the late 1960's, is to build capital from commercial enterprises, using the revenues to infuse the economy with local businesses and to finance neighborhood social services. Many of the groups have focused on supermarkets as a way to stimulate local growth and reverse a national trend of inner-city supermarket flight.
New York City's zoning rules make it difficult to open large supermarkets, so regional chains have been slow to enter. But elsewhere, chains like Vons Companies on the West Coast, Safeway and Giant Foods in Washington and Finast Supermarkets in Cleveland are advancing quickly into urban terrain, often as partners with community development groups, according to the Food Marketing Institute, a trade association in Washington.
For Pathmark, which runs 18 stores in New York City and has opened dozens of inner-city stores in New Jersey and Philadelphia since it began operating in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the Brooklyn venture was a wrenching decision. The chain had run stores in the city since 1965, but none was in what a company spokesman called the "inner, inner city."
"Everybody was very jumpy," Mr. Lieberman recalled. "There was a huge internal fight within the company between a few of us who felt strongly that this was a community that had to be served and the majority who were saying, 'What are you talking about?' "
Restoration, founded in 1967 by Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob K. Javits as the nation's first community development corporation, had started a number of businesses, primarily in real estate and mortgage lending, but none was particularly profitable, and the group was struggling to attract a national supermarket chain.
"At the time, we were not looking for a Pathmark," Mr. Mitchell said. "We were looking for anybody to come in. We couldn't convince anyone to locate here. The perception of Bed-Stuy was, and is, that of a frontier town -- you know, of shoot 'em ups and drugs and that type of thing."
Despite Pathmark's initial ambivalence, the Bedford-Stuyvesant supermarket turned out to be among the most productive in the chain and Restoration's most profitable enterprise. The volume of sales in the 20,000-square-foot supermarket, half the usual size of a Pathmark but lying in a densely populated neighborhood of 300,000 people, more than compensated for the extra costs of such things as insurance and security, a result that was similar in many other inner-city stores.
The turning point for Restoration, said Mr. Mitchell, was shedding the nonprofit mentality, learning to become obsessed with the bottom line. There was a time, he said, when Restoration was a somewhat passive partner in the supermarket venture, letting Pathmark, the minority shareholder, call the shots.
But beginning with Restoration's insistence on new inventory, it has become more aggressive and more savvy than Pathmark may have expected.
Mr. Mitchell said that in 1990, Pathmark expressed interest in opening another supermarket with Restoration in Brooklyn, but then excluded the development group from plans to open a store at Atlantic Center, a new retail center less than two miles from the Bedford-Stuyvesant store.
"Let's say that we were extremely disappointed," said Mr. Mitchell, noting that he feared that the new store, which opened last November, would take a bite out of his business. "We felt that was not the way a partnership should work."
Pathmark officials do not rule out the possibility of Restoration's getting a share in the Atlantic Center store, and they insist Pathmark will pursue future ventures with the development group. Harvey Gutman, Pathmark's senior vice president for retail development, said, "We treasure our relationship with Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation."
Mr. Mitchell did not suggest the partnership was falling apart, but, referring to the Atlantic Center supermarket, he said: "The negotiations will stay on until we get our share, even if it means legal action. Our store opened an entire market for Pathmark, and now all of the sudden, Pathmark is the darling of New York City. The logic is we want to protect our asset.
"This is strictly a business negotiation; it has nothing to do with social good. We're talking about cash."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Hewlett-Packard Profit Up 15%, Exceeding Estimates

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company said today that its fiscal first-quarter earnings rose more than 15 percent, exceeding a consensus forecast of Wall Street analysts, who had expected the company's results to be flat.
Hewlett-Packard attributed the strong results to improved cost and expense management, which allowed earnings to grow faster than revenue. But the company cautioned that growth in orders was lower than it had hoped for, partly as a result of the strong dollar and sluggish overseas markets. 
 It also said that the current quarter presents a tough comparison with the comparable period last year, when orders grew 22 percent and revenue rose 33 percent.
For the first quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, Hewlett-Packard earned $912 million, or 87 cents a share, up from $790 million, or 75 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue grew nearly 11 percent, to $10.3 million from $9.3 million.
Analysts had expected Hewlett-Packard to report earnings of 75 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call.
The computer and technology company, which is based in Palo Alto, reported its results after the stock market closed. Hewlett-Packard shares closed at $52.1875, up $1.8125, on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, the shares were as high as $51.375.
"It looks like they achieved their earnings performance by successfully resisting pressure on cost of sales and really continuing a relentless vigilance with regards to expenses," said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. "Both were apparently more than sufficient to offset the challenges to top-line growth, which were glaringly apparent this quarter with revenue growth of only 11 percent."
Hewlett-Packard said orders for the quarter were $11 billion, up 9 percent from $10.1 billion a year earlier. The company said that without the effects of currency-exchange rates, its order growth would have been roughly two percentage points higher. Orders rose 7 percent, to $4.2 billion in the United States, while foreign orders grew 9 percent, to $6.8 billion.
"Nine percent year-over-year growth was below our plan, but not by much," Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, said in a conference call. "Remember, we're comparing to a quarter last year in which orders grew by 29 percent." The previous year's period also included sales of disk-drive mechanisms, a business that Hewlett-Packard is no longer in, he noted.
Sales of personal computers and servers increased, but those of work station products declined. Laser printers saw moderate growth, and while the number of ink-jet printers sold increased, there was a shift to lower-priced models that moderated revenue growth. Test and measurement equipment, as well as medical equipment, showed moderate increases.
"Our challenge is to sustain momentum in the fast-growing parts of our business, while improving growth where it has slowed," Lewis Platt, Hewlett-Packard's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "Clearly, economic conditions in some major markets are sluggish, and we expect an extremely challenging competitive environment in the months ahead."
Mr. Kunstler of J. P. Morgan said the company faced challenges to maintain earnings growth because so much of its increase in revenue was coming from low-margin products like personal computers and printers. "H.P. is stressing product areas that are ever more subject to price erosion," he said. "And H.P.'s absolute dimensions make year-to-year comparisons ever tougher as time progresses."

HEADLINE: Report Foreign Guests? French Tempers Flare

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Even by the standards of an angry, sullen France, an unusual uprising is in the making: hundreds of French actors, film directors and cartoonists have said they are ready to go to jail if a new immigration bill is passed.
More defiant still, many Government officials have publicly announced that they would ignore the proposed law. Among them are influential groups like the national association of French mayors and a number of judges and magistrates. 
 At issue is a Government bill, due to be discussed in Parliament on Tuesday, that aims to tighten measures to prevent illegal immigration. The portion of the bill that has caused particular outrage among the intelligentsia would oblige the French to inform the authorities of the movements of visiting foreigners who are on special guest visas, staying in French homes.
Some foreigners would be exempt, including visitors from Europe and industrial countries like Japan and the United States, but visitors from a long list of countries, among them many in Africa and the Middle East, are designated as targets of the new law.
Officials have made it no secret that behind the new immigration bill lies the fear that all mainstream political parties share of the growing extreme-right position of the National Front.
The Front, with its strident anti-foreigner platform, blames immigrants for France's record unemployment, and in recent local elections it won control of a fourth town in southern France.
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, who proposed the bill, is known to see it as a means of preventing the extreme right from further using the immigration issue to gain support.
Critics have likened the proposal to the repressive policies decreed by the wartime Vichy regime that required the French to register Jewish residents with the police. Many critics of the current proposal, including more than 130 magistrates who have signed a protest, have called it a dangerous flouting of civil liberties.
"This law would transform all citizens into police informers," said Dan Franck, a writer and a coordinator of a protest demonstration planned for Saturday.
The bill has in fact been before Parliament since mid-December, but it only turned into a major political issue in the last week when nearly 60 film makers demanded to be prosecuted.
"We are guilty, every one of us, of harboring illegal foreign residents recently," they said in a statement. "We ask to be investigated and put on trial."
This stand has since mushroomed into a campaign encompassing thousands of actors, writers, musicians, scientists, lawyers and members of other professions who are signing petitions and calling on others to disobey the law if it passes Parliament. Others are offering to take in illegal immigrants or say they have already done so in defiance of the Government's plan.
More than 50 cartoonists signed a statement demanding that they be investigated and tried for "harboring illegal aliens." The cartoonists contributed to a special supplement filled with protest cartoons published this week by the liberal daily newspaper Liberation.
The issue in recent days has dominated public debate, filling newspapers and magazines and leading to lengthy and fiery arguments on television.
In keeping with French tradition, a countermovement is already on the way, accusing the protesters of grandstanding.
In an article headlined "The Petitioning Intelligentsia," the conservative newspaper Le Figaro said today that members of the intellectual and social elite, who had no special answer to anything, signed petitions because they would hate it if their name did not appear, because they want to please some friend or because they want to seem plugged in.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe has said that the bill on one hand would provide proper residence papers to some categories of undocumented foreigners but that it would also give the Government the means to "tackle the very real network of illegal immigration that exists in France."
These networks, a Government official said, make use of a 1982 decree that requires foreigners who apply for a visitor's visa but have no proof that they possess money or hotel reservations to get an officially stamped affidavit, a so-called certificate of accommodation, from a French host.
The official said some hosts had asked for such certificates 40 or 50 times a year, because they were involved in immigrant smuggling. One host, for example, asked 42 times last year for affidavits for guests from Romania, he said.
The new bill proposes that French hosts who have foreign guests on such special visas must inform the town hall when their guests leave the host's home.
This apparently small change in the law would permit the Government to compile computer records on the movements of foreigners from developing countries, who are considered the most likely to stay behind when their visitor's visa expires.
It is this minor change that has caused the outcry. Mr. Juppe, apparently most taken aback by the calls for civil disobedience, has said he is willing to accept amendments, as long as the objective "to fight fraud" remains intact. Some amendments are already being discussed.
"We say we want to fight the far right, and we end up using their tactics," said Jean-Pierre Boucher, a judge who is circulating a petition being signed by magistrates.
National Front leaders appear to be rubbing their hands over the melee. The Front issued a statement today saying it was calling for a national referendum on immigration, something it apparently sees as a fair gamble.
Results published today by one independent opinion poll said 59 percent of those questioned were in favor of the Government's immigration bill and 58 percent opposed the calls for civil disobedience.

HEADLINE: Township Looks Warily at Energy Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: LACEY TOWNSHIP, N.J.

 BODY:
For a generation, the gray Oyster Creek nuclear power plant, with its towering needle of an exhaust stack, has dominated the forest of scrub pines at the southern end of town.
More important for homeowners, Oyster Creek has been a tax bonanza since it was built in 1969, producing millions in energy tax revenues and guaranteeing modest property taxes for the ranches and bungalows packed along the salt-water inlets and lagoons of Barnegat Bay. 
 In 1997, Lacey Township will get about $9.5 million for Oyster Creek, nearly 60 percent of its town budget of $16.1 million. But that aid is already down -- $1.3 million less than in 1996 -- and the town administrator, Jorge A. Rod, is concerned that the aid will decline still more in coming years if Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's plan to cut New Jersey's energy tax rate by nearly 50 percent is adopted by the Legislature.
Nor is Mr. Rod alone in his sour mood. Lacey Township is one of the biggest beneficiaries of about $1 billion in taxes that New Jersey charges electrical and natural gas companies for all the poles, wires, pipelines, generating stations and other equipment in the state's 567 communities. For years, Trenton has annually returned the bulk of these revenues to the communities, and they have become the second-largest pot of money available for municipal budgets, after local property taxes.
For Mrs. Whitman, a champion of state income tax cuts and property tax stability, the plan is a tricky high-stakes juggling act. She wants the energy tax cut for two primary reasons. She says that the existing tax is one of the nation's highest, impeding the state's ability to attract new industries and their jobs.
In addition, when the state starts deregulating sales of electricity in 1998, she wants the same tax rate applied to in-state utilities and out-of-state suppliers. The out-of-state suppliers are exempt from the current tax, the Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax.
In place of the current tax, which has a rate of about 13.5 percent, she has proposed extending the state's 6 percent sales and use tax to retail sales of electricity and natural gas and creating a new 1 percent corporate net income tax on all companies making retail sales of power in the state after deregulation.
Cutting the rate to 7 percent could reduce overall annual tax revenues by $361 million, the Whitman administration has estimated. But to prevent major cuts in aid to the towns and to eliminate the corresponding political risk of causing major increases in property taxes, Governor Whitman has proposed an additional temporary energy tax of 6 percent in the first two years of the new tax.
Starting in the third year, the temporary tax would be phased out over five years. Whitman administration officials say the interim tax will not be needed after seven years because the lower energy tax will spur economic growth, thereby increasing energy sales and offsetting the revenue lost from cutting the existing tax.
Municipal officials say their economic forecasts are not so rosy. They want a guaranteed amount written into new legislation for the Governor's package.
For many state residents, the proposed changes probably seem arcane. The energy tax is largely invisible to them, tucked into the welter of numbers in their monthly utility bills.
In a sense, Mr. Rod's complaints are an opening move in a campaign by New Jersey towns to emerge unscathed from Mrs. Whitman's proposed changes. The $1.3 million cut that Lacey Township now faces is linked to the tax system's complex distribution formula and not to Mrs. Whitman's plan.
But the towns have already started lobbying for guarantees against any big losses in coming years.
For Lacey Township, Mr. Rod says the cut this year leaves him with two bitter options: a 2-cent increase in the town's minuscule property tax of 11 1/2 cents for each $100 of property value, or dropping plans for new police cars and town trucks, ending the town's $500,000 payment to the school system, paving fewer dirt roads around town and maybe laying off some workers.
"We'll have barely enough money to operate," Mr. Rod complained. "We have this atomic plant, and people will never understand how we get stuck with this cut."
The tax stakes for Lacey are greater than for any other town in the state because the aid represents a far higher share of its town budget, even though some communities, like Newark and Jersey City, get far more in total dollars. Since 1950, Lacey has grown from a sleepy coastal fishing village of about 1,000 people in Ocean County to a middle-class community of about 24,000.
The state's Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax has existed since the early 1900's, and in the last couple of years it has produced more than $1 billion annually. Until the early 1980's, the state returned all the money to the towns because state law prohibits them from imposing property taxes on state-regulated utilities. But then the state began skimming some of the proceeds for its own budget. By the early 1990's, the state was taking $232 million a year.
After the towns complained, the Legislature in 1992 guaranteed them $685 million a year, plus what was called "surplus" revenue. In 1995, the surplus was $97 million and the towns got $782 million. But for 1996 and 1997, the surplus has dropped to $45 million, leaving the towns with $730 million each year.
The State League of Municipalities, which represents New Jersey's 567 towns, has already started talks with the Whitman administration and legislative leaders about whether the state should guarantee the $685 million or $730 million in aid.
"It's the highest legislative priority for the league," said its assistant executive director, William G. Dressel Jr. "We need assurances the money's going to be there."
The league's goal "will be to keep the municipalities as whole as possible," Mr. Dressel said.
The anxieties in New Jersey are singular in the metropolitan region. Municipalities in New York can impose their own property, sales and gross receipts taxes on utilities. Connecticut's municipalities can levy property taxes on them.
But the local taxes have risks. In November, a New York state judge ruled that the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island had been overtaxed from 1982 to 1994 and ordered that Suffolk County, the town of Brookhaven and a local school district refund up to $1.1 billion to the Long Island Lighting Company. The ruling has been appealed.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Names Campaign Chief

 BODY:
Fran Reiter, who has become one of the most loyal and trusted members of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's inner circle, was named yesterday as the manager of Mr. Giuliani's re-election campaign.
Ms. Reiter, who has served as Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Planning since last April, will relinquish her post in the next two weeks and run the day-to-day operations of the Mayor's as-yet unannounced candidacy. She had previously held the job of Deputy Mayor for Community Development. 
 Mr. Giuliani had earlier said that the job of running the campaign would go to Peter J. Powers, the Mayor's closest friend and former first deputy mayor, who had run Mr. Giuliani's first two campaigns. But Mr. Powers, who joined a money-management company last fall, now says he is too busy in his new position to deal with daily operations and will instead become campaign chairman, an advisory post.
Mr. Giuliani has not yet settled on a replacement for Ms. Reiter.

HEADLINE: Real Estate Dynasty Is Nearing the End

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A real estate dynasty that was founded on a handshake by Benjamin Swig and Jack Weiler during the Depression and that grew into a $1 billion empire, including some of the finest hotels and office buildings in New York and elsewhere, is expected to end this week with the sale of its most prestigious properties.
The descendants of the late Mr. Weiler -- who have recently engaged in a bitter courtroom battle with the Swig family -- are selling their stake in three of the partnership's best Manhattan properties, including the swooping, 50-story W. R. Grace Building on 42d Street at Avenue of the Americas. 
 The buildings are being sold to TrizecHahn Office Properties for about $220 million, according to executives and real estate brokers familiar with the deal.
The sale marks the first foray into a now vibrant real estate market in Manhattan for TrizecHahn, the second-largest real estate company in North America.
But the sale also signals the Weilers' exit from an industry in which the family's patriarch was a leading figure and a major philanthropist until his death in 1995.
The Weilers are also selling two buildings in San Francisco and another property in Houston to the Swigs, for an undisclosed price.
The Swig family's company is based in San Francisco, where it co-owns the Fairmont Hotel chain and operates about 11 million square feet of property. The Swigs would own the buildings in Manhattan in partnership with TrizecHahn, which will take over management and leasing.
Six months ago, the descendents of Jack Weiler and Benjamin Swig, who worked together for decades without benefit of a written partnership agreement, were embroiled in a fight for control of the dynasty. Now, the Swigs will continue as a real estate owner and operator, while the Weilers leave the business.
Shifra Bronznick, executive vice president of Swig, Weiler & Arnow Management Company and a spokeswoman for the Weilers, confirmed that the Weiler family expected to complete the sale of their interests to TrizecHahn by the end of this week, though she declined to name the price.
"It is a win-win-win for all the parties involved," Ms. Bronznick said. "The members of the Weiler family will enjoy the liquidity that will allow them to pursue their independent interests. The Swig family will have an excellent new partner."
The upbeat talk contrasts sharply with the language of a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court last year by the Weilers that sought to dissolve the 60-year partnership. The suit said that the Swig family's "precarious financial situation" jeopardized the financial health of the properties.
In a counterclaim, the Swigs said that the Weilers had refused to distribute millions in profits and attempted to sabotage the Swigs' efforts to obtain a $35 million loan.
Benjamin Swig and Jack Weiler, who met and formed their partnership in 1936, had no such problems as they jointly bought a string of properties across the country, with Mr. Weiler managing the buildings in Manhattan, while Mr. Swig oversaw the rest.
"The whole thing ran on a handshake," said one real estate executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it got to the point where the handshakes didn't mean as much to the kids and it broke down."
Laurie Ludwick, a spokeswoman for TrizecHahn in Toronto, said the company had a purchase agreement with the Weilers, although the transaction had not closed. "It's a good step forward in our plans to acquire office properties in the United States," she said. "We see lots of opportunities for growth."
When the deal is finally completed, TrizecHahn will have nearly 50 percent of these properties: the Grace Building, a 1.5-million-square-foot tower that is known as a "trophy" property because of its prestigious tenants and spectacular views of the city; the World Apparel Center at 1411 Broadway, at 38th Street, one of the most desirable buildings in the Garment District and a center for the women's sportswear industry, and a smaller building at 1460 Broadway, at 41st Street.
The transaction takes place as the real estate market in Manhattan is recovering from a deep recession in the early 1990s, when property values plummeted and vacancy rates soared. But the price for midtown office buildings jumped to $168 per square foot last year, up 53 percent from $110 in 1994, according to CB Commercial Real Estate Group. Suddenly, buyers who had fled the New York market a few years ago are wrestling for the best properties.
TrizecHahn, which has a $1.4 billion war chest for acquisitions, won out in the bidding for the Weiler interests over PaineWebber Properties and developer Bernard Mendik, working with investor Robert Bass, according to real estate brokers.
"The universe of investors seeking properties in midtown has increased by over 100 percent in the last 12 months, with the most notable interest coming from offshore investors and real estate trusts," said Scott Latham, a broker with CB Commercial.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
German Views and U.S. Data Fail to Cut the Dollar's Value

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly higher yesterday, overcoming efforts by German central bank officials to slow its rise, and taking in stride a larger-than-expected United States trade deficit.
Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president, said in a newspaper interview that he hoped the dollar's rise against the mark was at an end. His comments came after the bank's monthly report for February said the dollar had fully recovered from the lows it suffered in 1995. 
 The report and remarks weighed on the dollar in early trading. But a later report quoting a Bundesbank council member, Ernst Welteke, as saying that a dollar level between 1.70 and 1.75 marks would not risk importing inflation into Germany lifted the dollar later in the day.
Confusion over the dollar's near-term direction made trading choppy. "There's a fear it's not going to go much higher in the short term because of Bundesbank comments, but nobody's willing to short it because they feel in the medium term, dollar- mark can push higher," said Ian Gunner, a Chase economist.
The dollar was hurt late in the day by news that the trade deficit rose to $10.29 billion in December from a revised $7.94 billion in November. The market expectation had been $9.9 billion, but the figures were considered within the range of forecasts. The Consumer Price Index rose just one-tenth of a percent.
The dollar settled at 1.6963 marks late in New York yesterday, off a low in Europe of 1.6806 and up from 1.6839 marks late Wednesday. It fetched 124.46 Japanese yen, up from 123.88. The British pound rose to $1.6161 from $1.6084.
The dollar, a haven in times of instability, was also driven higher by the announcement of the death of China's leader, Deng Xiaoping.
Neither set of United States economic data was seen as good news for the dollar, with soft inflation figures taking pressure off the Fed to raise interest rates. But analysts said sentiment remained bullish. "The U.S. data showed a largely-as-expected deterioration in the trade position and further evidence of the subdued nature of inflation," Jeremy Hawkins, of the Bank of America in London, said. "This should tend to support the asset markets and leave the dollar little changed."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Ease, Ignoring Good Price Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday, despite a report of consumer prices that showed inflation under control.
The bulk of the selling came from continuing fear that a robust economy and low inflation would eventually push prices and rates higher, traders and analysts said. Despite recent data showing inflationary pressures at bay, traders said they expected limited gains over the near term unless there is more evidence that job and wage growth is slowing. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 13/32, to 100 22/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.57 percent, from 6.54 percent Tuesday.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that consumer prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in January, below estimates of three-tenths of 1 percent. Such a report would typically drive prices higher, but yesterday's bullish news had largely been priced in following last week's producer prices report, which showed an unexpected drop.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that "on a monthly year-over-year basis, the C.P.I. actually declined to 3.0 percent from 3.3 percent, an unusually large drop in this statistical measure for this stage of the economic cycle, though it is likely temporary."
The report, he said, "gives the Fed considerable latitude to keep monetary policy on hold at its March 25 policy meeting should upcoming statistical data prior to that date continue in the most recent mode, although the Federal Open Market Committee is highly likely to maintain its current bias toward tightening."
Today the market turns its attention to reports on housing starts and initial jobless claims and a survey of regional business conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Housing starts in January are expected to bounce back from the weather-depressed December level, although the gain is expected to be only about half of the previous month's decline. But the attention, he says, will be equally, if not more riveted, on initial claims, which plunged to a conspicuously low 309,000 last week. An increase is expected, but the four- week average will be scrutinized to see if the declining trend continues.
And the market is now beginning to cast a wary eye toward Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony next week, in which he is likely to provide some clues as to his and the Federal Open Market Committee's current thinking on the economy.
"With the good inflation news now behind them, and the uncertainty of Greenspan's testimony in front of them," Mr. Fine said, "market participants have begun to pare positions in preparation for any eventuality," which is what some people think was the primary reason behind the selloff after the favorable price data. "After all, few would want to carry a significant position into the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and subject themselves to tape bombs."
The Treasury, meanwhile, announced yesterday the size of its two-year and five-year note auctions next week, which consist of the sale of $17.5 billion of two-year maturity notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion of a new five-year note on Wednesday. In when-issued trading, the two-year was offered at a price to yield 5.81 percent and the five-year at 6.10 percent.

HEADLINE: Union Chiefs Vote to Oppose Expansion of Free-Trade Pact Unless It Is Modified

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Putting the labor movement on a potential collision course with President Clinton, A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders voted today to oppose extending the North American Free Trade Agreement to other countries unless it includes protections on labor and the environment that the Administration has previously rejected.
The labor leaders approved a resolution saying that Nafta has hurt American, Mexican and Canadian workers and that other countries should not be added to the accord unless strong labor and environmental guarantees are included in the main agreement, rather than in a side agreement that Congress could dilute. 
 "The labor movement's strongest disagreement with the Clinton Administration in the first term was over Nafta," John J. Sweeney, the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said. "Our position has not changed in terms of what we are fighting for in the Nafta agreement. We will continue to fight over labor standards, human rights and environmental protection."
The combative stand by the 54-member executive council, at the federation's winter meeting here, recalled the battles when Mr. Clinton pushed the accord with Canada and Mexico through Congress despite labor's fervent lobbying.
"American, Mexican and Canadian workers have all suffered because of Nafta," said Jay Mazur, chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s trade subcommittee and president of the Union of Needletrade, Industrial and Textile Employees. "We should rethink Nafta and adjust it so that at the very least no future trade agreement should be signed without incorporating strong worker rights and strong enforcement mechanisms for such rights."
One of labor's complaints is that stronger enforcement mechanisms come into play under Nafta when Mexico violates commercial laws, on trademarks, for instance, than when it violates labor laws.
The resolution was approved a day after two possible Presidential candidates in 2000 -- Vice President Al Gore and Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader -- staked out contrary positions on trade while appearing before the labor leaders.
Striving to show that there was no ideological daylight between him and labor, Mr. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said he would oppose extending Nafta to other nations unless there were stronger worker and environmental protections.
"We should not simply extend a treaty that in my view is not working properly," Mr. Gephardt said. "In a way, Nafta has validated a governmental and business system that does not allow workers to have the ability to get paid and compensated for their hard work."
Praising Nafta, Mr. Gore voiced confidence that the Administration and the labor movement could work out their differences.
Mr. Gore said that wages in Mexico were hurt not by Nafta, but by the economic downturn caused by the peso's devaluation.
He said that "the impact of Nafta has been quite positive" in all three countries if the effects of the devaluation are separated out.
He said any accord adding other countries to the agreement should include labor and environmental protections, but added, "The precise form that it takes will have to be worked out over time." In the past, the Administration has rejected labor's demand that labor and environmental guarantees be included in the main agreement.
The Administration's trade policy came under heavy criticism while Mr. Gore appeared here. According to labor leaders, Stephen P. Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, put Mr. Gore on the defensive at Tuesday's meeting by asserting that last year's $165 billion merchandise trade deficit showed that Mr. Clinton's trade policy was a failure. Not only that, he asserted that the President's trade policies were wiping out American jobs and bleeding some unions to death.
The debate over Nafta comes shortly before Congress is expected to take up legislation that would give Mr. Clinton fast-track authority to negotiate with other countries to join the trade agreement. With such authority, he can negotiate an agreement, and Congress then has to vote it up or down, without being able to pick it apart with amendments.
In approving a series of resolutions, A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders reiterated their endorsement of Mr. Clinton's embattled nominee for Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman. The federation called for immediate hearings on her nomination, praising her "commitment to a working families agenda and her superb ability to advance such an agenda."
Their resolution said, "It is unfair to working families to have the principal Federal department responsible for worker protections to be singled out and held hostage."

HEADLINE: Two Reports Show Inflation Is in Check

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Two more economic reports showed that inflationary pressures remained at bay last month.
The Labor Department said today that consumer prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in January, below the consensus forecast of three-tenths of 1 percent, as food prices fell and price increases for energy moderated despite a 4.8 percent jump in the cost of natural gas -- the largest monthly rise since record-keeping began in 1952. 
 Consumer prices at the core level, which excludes food and energy, also rose one-tenth of 1 percent, below expectations of an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent.
In December, consumer prices grew three-tenths of 1 percent. The increase in December's core rate was revised upward, to two-tenths of 1 percent from the gain of one-tenth of 1 percent reported originally.
During all of 1996, prices rose 3.3 percent, up from 2.5 percent in 1995. The core rate increased 2.6 percent, slower than its increase of 3 percent during 1995.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that Americans' weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, fell 2 percent in January -- the largest decline since August 1973. Earnings had risen eight-tenths of 1 percent in December. The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.
Average weekly hours worked decreased 2 percent in January, while average hourly earnings rose one-tenth of 1 percent.
The two sets of data followed other recent indications that inflation was under control. The Government said last week that producer prices decreased three-tenths of 1 percent in January -- the first monthly decline in more than two years.
Another report issued a week before that showed that average hourly earnings, calculated as part of the monthly employment report, rose only 1 cent in January, to $12.06.
"We're in a sweet spot," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. "The economy is growing moderately with little sign of inflation."
The reports suggested that the Federal Reserve has little reason to raise interest rates. John Silvia, chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments, said before today's reports that "we've had wage increases and some productivity increases, but we haven't had overall price increases."
Last week, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Gary Stern, acknowledged that policy makers at the Fed "haven't seen an uptick in core inflation."
Still, he said in a speech, with the economy near what the Fed defines as full employment, employers are finding it "increasingly difficult to hire and retain" workers, making it "hardly surprising" that wages are creeping up.
Despite the favorable price data, bond prices fell today. The statistics for January were outweighed by concern about the future impact on inflation of the low jobless rate and continued economic growth.
By category in January, energy prices, which account for about 7 percent of the Consumer Price Index over all, increased eight-tenths of 1 percent, including the 4.8 percent jump in natural gas prices.
Elsewhere in the energy sector, the American Automobile Association said on Tuesday that retail gasoline prices fell during the last month, the first decline in five months. A 16 percent drop in the price of crude oil since Jan. 8 helped spur the decline.
Food prices, which account for about 16 percent of the index, decreased three-tenths of 1 percent, the largest drop since June 1993, as prices of fruits, vegetables, dairy products and beef fell.
Recent reports from the Agriculture Department suggest Americans are not likely to pay more for beef in coming months. Ranchers shipped a record number of cattle to feedlots in January, Government figures showed, a sign that plentiful beef supplies and favorable prices await consumers this spring.
The increase, the sixth in the last seven months, has come as corn prices have fallen more than 50 percent from last summer. That allows feedlot operators to make a profit on cattle, which are fed a protein-rich diet of corn for four months before they are sent to market.
The Commodity Research Bureau index, a gauge of inflation, has risen about 2.5 percent since Jan. 31. However, the Goldman, Sachs & Company industrial-metals commodity index has declined 1.7 percent since Jan. 31.
Today's consumer price data also showed that transportation costs fell two-tenths of 1 percent in January, as airline fares dropped. Entertainment costs were unchanged, the cost of medical care grew two-tenths of 1 percent, housing costs rose three-tenths of 1 percent and apparel costs increased four-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall As Volatility Continues

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices held steady for much of the day yesterday before slipping in late-afternoon trading in yet another demonstration of how a big bull market can swing wildly.
The volatility of the last couple of days -- in which the market has seen two 60-point swings in the last hour of trading -- is characteristic for a stock market that is bulging beyond belief, analysts said. 
 "You're going to have volatility like you've never seen before," Ralph Acampora, a market analyst with Prudential Securities, said. "There's a lot of nervousness out there. People are trigger happy. There's a lot of program trading and a lot of rotation out there."
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 47.33 points, or nearly seven-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 7,020.13. And the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost 3.80 points, about five-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 812.49.
Part of the market's downturn was attributed to a weak bond market, which shrugged off a report from the Labor Department that showed the Consumer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent last month, after a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in December, another indication that inflationary pressures are tame. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.57 percent, from 6.54 percent on Tuesday.
"We had some good inflation news and the bond market went down, not up," Hugh Johnson, an investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation, said. "That led me to believe that long-term interest rates had declined as much as they are going to decline. I think that more than anything was noticed by portfolio managers."
Analysts said that stock prices might have also been affected by Government figures that showed that the United States trade defecit surged 29.6 percent in December. Weaker exports, caused in part by a stronger dollar, might be some indication that the economy could grow slower than anticipated in the future.
Still, stock prices were stable until late in the day, when the Dow plummeted 60 points, before recovering some of its loss. Among the losers were: Procter & Gamble, American Express and I.B.M. Procter & Gamble was down 2 3/8, to 127 1/8; American Express lost 1 7/8, to 67 7/8, and I.B.M. fell 1 5/8, to 143 5/8. Philip Morris was one of just six gainers, up 1 7/8, to 133 1/8.
While several other large-capitalization stocks were hit -- First Union was down 3 1/8, to 92 1/2, and BankAmerica fell 1 3/4, to 120 7/8 -- analysts noted that the market held up well yesterday, recovering from what could have become a rout after the market slipped.
Technology stocks were buoyed early in the session by Hewlett-Packard, which released better-than-expected earnings after the market closed on Tuesday. Shares of Hewlett-Packard, the most actively traded issue yesterday, rose 4 9/16, to 56 3/4.
The rise in the technology sector bolstered the Nasdaq market, before it retreated to end down 0.21 point at 1,365.58. One indication of the market's strength yesterday was the advance-decline line on the New York Stock Exchange, where winners just barely edged losers, 1,293 to 1,285. Volume on the Big Board was 520.9 million shares.
Yet with the S.& P. up nearly 10 percent this year and Dow up almost 9 percent, analysts said that they expect this year's rapid pace to slow considerably.
"Common sense says we're in for a spell, either a correction or an extended period of consolidation," Mr. Johnson at First Albany said. "You don't have to be a market analyst to know that."

HEADLINE: Europe's Rail Freight on New Path;
Revamping With Technology, Competition and U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Feb. 19

 BODY:
You wouldn't think Europe could learn anything about running railroads from the United States. Europe has the bullet-like TGV's and tilting trains; the United States has Amtrak.
But while it is true that European passenger service is a heavily used showcase of comfort and speed, freight shipping is another world entirely. Borders are bottlenecks where shipments must be hauled off one train and put on another to accommodate changes in track gauge; there are three widths in Europe, not to mention seven electrical standards and a jumble of signal systems. Featherbedding is still common. And customers can be few and far between: rail's share of total freight movement in Britain has slipped to just 6 percent, measured by tonnage and distance, compared with 41 percent in the United States. 
 In short, the painful shakeout that reshaped the American freight industry in the 1980's has not yet happened in Europe.
"It's like the United States 10 years ago," said Matty Vanderbroek, a rail specialist in the London office of Mercer Management Consulting, a transport consulting firm.
But now that Europe is preparing for economic unification, its planners and government leaders are playing catch-up in a big way, taking more than a page or two from across the Atlantic. They are introducing new rail technology, such as so-called intermodal systems that move containers by road and rail. They are breaking up old inefficient state rail monopolies into commercially viable pieces. And in an increasing number of cases, they are even opening the door to outside competition -- including American companies.
The early arrivals include the Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation, a specialist in turning around troubled freight companies, which joined several partners to snap up Britain's freight system in 1994, when the Government sold off its nationalized rail service. Also here are the CSX Corporation, the giant Richmond-based rail and shipping company, and its Sea-Land subsidiary, which are in joint ventures with the Europeans to introduce American-style freight shuttles. And Mercer Management, which is based in Boston and is a unit of Marsh & McLennan, was sought out by the European Union for its advice on rail freight deregulation.
Indeed, the Americans are bringing not only a new infusion of capital but also a rich trove of expertise.
Asked about the contribution of American partners like CSX, Rene Holdert, a spokesman for NS Cargo, a Dutch freight company, could only marvel. "The whole administration has changed," he said. "It's now all computerized: the trading and tracing of rail cars, for example, so you can always find a car for a client, even if it's very late. Under the old-fashioned national systems, with phones and faxes, you relied on offices, and they were often empty late at night."
Because of all the changes, both imported and home grown, "the whole system, beginning with the infrastructure, is starting to move," said Maria Lahaye-Geusen, an economist at Kombiverkehr, a company in Frankfurt set up by the German trucking industry to develop combined rail and road services.
For all this, that movement is not going to come smoothly. Europe's powerful labor unions are fighting a rear-guard action that guarantees many tense moments and more than a few costly disruptions. Earlier this month, for example, rail workers in France staged a daylong strike to protest Government plans to restructure the unprofitable state-owned SNCF line.
The underlying catalyst for change is the realization that Europe simply cannot afford any longer to have such a costly and inefficient freight system.
In 1994, according to European Commission figures, the cumulative debt of Europe's railways came to $135 billion, an amount that has grown since. In France and Italy, railway debt was equivalent, respectively, to 2.6 percent and 5 percent of gross domestic product.
To be sure, much of that debt came from the generous financing of passenger service, which has benefited disproportionately from upgrades to the rail system. But at least the passenger lines attracted more and more customers.
With the decline of European heavy industries like coal and steel, however, major bulk freight customers were lost to the railroads. At the same time, European manufacturers of everything from cars to computers have been desperate for lower transport costs, to remain competitive in an increasingly global economy. Many turned to the army of new trucking companies from formerly Communist Eastern Europe that flooded the West, offering dirt-cheap rates, particularly in Germany and Austria.
Meanwhile, as governments scramble to cut spending to meet the requirements for a single European currency, the days of endless rail subsidies are fast dwindling.
"Subsidies have to be stopped and rail operators have to keep up their own socks," said Mr. Vanderbroek at Mercer Management.
Late last year, the European Commission's senior transport official, Neil Kinnock, the former head of Britain's Labor Party, warned the 15 member governments that future rail assistance would be subject to commission approval, as subsidies to airlines and other industries already are, and that restrictions would affect freight and passenger lines equally. Beginning in 1998, Mr. Kinnock said, railway subsidies would be authorized only if accompanied by strict cost reduction proposals.
Anticipating such an end game, several countries, including Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, have cut up their national rail systems into divisions for passengers, freight and the maintenance of infrastructure like tracks and signal systems. France plans similar steps, despite the union resistance.
Railway executives and government planners acknowledge that much remains to be done. But already the first fruits of change are evident. After watching rail's share of total freight movement in the region slump by half in 20 years, to 16 percent, the railways have stanched the hemorrhaging of freight to trucking. (They have been helped by growing public concern over the trucking industry's contribution to highway congestion. To curb environmental damage, some countries have imposed weight restrictions on trucks.)
In some cases, the railroads are even clawing back business, most notably in the intermodal sector.
Britain is ahead of the curve in not only dividing up its national rail freight service into regional companies, but in then selling the lot off to the investor group led by Wisconsin Central. In December, the Government named Wisconsin Central the preferred bidder in the proposed privatization of Rail Freight Distribution, the company on the British end that operates freight deliveries through the English Channel tunnel.
"In total, what we purchased was profitable; it wasn't a basket case," said Tom Power, Wisconsin Central's chief financial officer, who helped engineer the deal for the regional companies, now known as the English, Welsh and Scottish Railway.
Lack of investment in recent years, Mr. Power said, helped cause rail's share of the freight market to slip. Also to blame were sluggish marketing and rates that he said were roughly double those in America.
Wisconsin Central, which is based in Rosemont, Ill., hung on to most of its British management, but added several American marketing experts to instill more aggressive selling techniques. To bring prices down, it made big equipment investments, including the purchase of 250 locomotives that the General Motors Corporation will deliver over the next 10 years. In placing the $407 million order, it snubbed expensive European suppliers.
"You've got to get the costs out," Mr. Power said.
The Europeans are still trying to get the costs out when it comes to incompatible operating systems, particularly differences in track sizes.
Thus, when Adam Opel, the G.M. unit in Germany, ships components to its plants in Spain, the trains must halt at the French-Spanish border while the rail car bodies are shifted to different undercarriages.
To gradually overcome national boundaries, Mr. Kinnock of the European Commission recently appealed for the establishment of international "freight freeways," which would be as open to international freight traffic as Europe's highways are to trucking. Some rail companies and shippers are already seizing the initiative.
In 1994, Sea-Land joined partners in Germany and the Netherlands in a joint venture called European Rail Shuttle that operates freight service between the port of Rotterdam and industrial regions of Germany and northern Italy. Such shuttles, which are cheaper to operate because they transfer trains back and forth between two destinations without having to shuffle the rail cars, also allow the railroads to drop costly branch lines that generate little traffic and make better use of main lines.
Six days a week now, hundreds of truck-size containers filled with products for export are hauled from Milan to huge docks in Rotterdam, while similar mountains of containers ride 50-car shuttle trains back across the Alps to Milan.
Last year, Sea-Land's parent company, CSX, teamed up with NS Cargo, the Dutch freight company, and the freight division of Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway, in a similar joint venture called NDX to establish rival shuttle services. In January, NDX started a Rotterdam-to-Munich shuttle, and in April it will inaugurate a line from Hamburg to Milan.
Cees Van Elk, the marketing director for NDX, said the shuttle's rates were "certainly competitive with trucks," and from 10 to 20 percent lower than the cost of delivering individual containers by rail.
European competitors are quickly following suit. In Germany, Kombiverkehr, the trucking cooperative, operates shuttles between German cities and industrial belts around Milan and Barcelona, Spain.
"We're using intermodal wherever it's expedient, and price isn't everything," said Heino Bultmann, director of railway freight for the giant German shipping group, Danzas.
Big customers with a choice of carriers agree. Benetton, the apparel company that ships clothing from factories in northern Italy to outlets in about 120 countries, has been gradually increasing the amount of products shipped by rail and truck combination. By last year, that method accounted for about 52 percent of the 700 containers Benetton ships every day.
Intermodal costs are "more or less those of trucking," said Giancarlo Chiodini, Benetton's director of logistics, adding that rail freight had the additional advantage of being less subject to weather conditions and traffic jams. "It's become a philosophy with us," he said.
That philosophy is bound to spread as the changes brought by the private sector filter through Europe, said Mr. Power of Wisconsin Central.
"The customers will be so much better off," he said. "Governments don't know how to run railroads."

Chart/Maps: "Getting Up to Speed"
 For years, Europe's freight rail systems have been poorly run, state-owned enterprises whose incompatible systems have made it difficult for them to play a major role in transporting goods internationally. Now, with help from American railroad companies, Europe's rail freight industry is starting to be modernized.
 
PRIVATIZATION -- Britain has privatized its rail system. Among the owners of the English, Welsh and Scottish Railway, above, is Wisconsin Central.
 
SHUTTLES -- European and American joint ventures have created dedicated rail routes to shuttle goods between key cities.
 
FREIGHT FREEWAYS -- The European Union has proposed international rail routes that would run on a common standard, with few customs restrictions.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Campaign Against Youth Crime

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Signaling the new emphasis of his anti-crime measures in a second term, President Clinton today visited a city that has seen an impressive reduction in juvenile crime statistics and declared that the battle against youth crime "has got to become our top law-enforcement priority."
Pointing to population trends, Mr. Clinton said United States school enrollment had swelled to 52 million and was running above baby boom levels, numbers that he said could hold the potential for a youth crime epidemic. 
 "So we know we've got about six years to turn this juvenile crime thing around or our country is going to be living with chaos," he said in an address at the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts. "And my successors will not be giving speeches about the wonderful opportunities of the global economy; they'll be trying to keep body and soul together for people on the streets of these cities."
Mr. Clinton also urged Congress to approve a $495 million two-year campaign against youth crime. The program would include $200 million in grants to allow localities to hire new prosecutors for juvenile crime and develop task forces to fight gangs, $60 million to finance 1,000 new after-school programs and $75 million for anti-truancy and crime prevention programs.
The President called for expanding controls on handguns so that youths who turn 18 and have juvenile records of violent crime are blocked from buying handguns. Adults who commit felonies are prohibited from possessing firearms, but juvenile records are not scrutinized in such purchases.
And he proposed changes in law to make it easier for prosecutors to fight gangs through increased penalties, new authority to seize property in crimes of violence, racketeering and obstruction of justice and an easing of the burden of proof in certain car-jacking cases and Federal racketeering cases.
Mr. Clinton highlighted his proposals in a city that has had marked success in fighting juvenile violence. From 1990 to 1995 juvenile homicides in Boston fell by 80 percent and no juvenile has been killed by gunfire here since July 1995. From 1993 to 1995, the juvenile arrest rate for aggravated assault and battery with a firearm dropped 65 percent.
Police and public officials attribute the improvement to innovative and inexpensive strategies like one in which probation officers team with police officers to visit the homes of youths on probation to insure that they abide by their curfew and probation terms. Like New York, Boston has also focused on enforcing statutes against graffiti, truancy, noise and other so-called quality-of-life crimes in cutting the crime rate.
City officials also intensified their focus on gangs and guns after computer-aided research from Harvard University found that three-quarters of juvenile killers and their victims had been involved with gangs and that the authorities could identify firearms dealers who made significant numbers of illegal gun sales to young people.
"We know that if this can be done in Boston, "Mr. Clinton said, "it can be done in every community, in every neighborhood of every size in the United States. And we ask the United States Congress to do what you've done here in Massachusetts: cross all party lines, throw politics away, throw the speeches in the trash can, join hands. Let's do what works and make America the safe place it has to be."
Congressional Republicans have proposed a three-year program against youth crime, a $1.5 billion plan that would give grants to state and local governments for applying adult penalties to the most dangerous, violent juveniles. The grants could be used to build or expand juvenile detention centers to develop alternative sanction programs.
But Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said Boston's experience showed that youth crime could be attacked through community policing and other community-based programs.
"It's not just about building more prisons or toughening law enforcement or providing more cops," Mr. McCurry said. "It's also about a strategy of engagement in the community so that young people understand that adults care about their lives and are holding them accountable to more civil norms of behavior."

Menino of Boston at a juvenile crime and justice seminar at the University of Massachusetts after a participant used a metaphor, then hastened to say he was not referring to Mr. Clinton in saying it was easier to lose the first 20 pounds when dieting than the second 20.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Grew Sharply Last Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened substantially in December, bringing the imbalance for the full year to $114.2 billion, the largest gap since 1988, the Commerce Department reported today.
Lower exports and higher imports contributed about equally to the December expansion, which analysts said partly reflected the sharp rise in the international value of the dollar. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the finance ministers of other major countries began an effort earlier this month to restrain the dollar's rise. 
 The strong dollar makes foreign goods more affordable for American consumers but makes this country's products less competitive abroad. Detroit's auto makers have been complaining about inroads into their markets made by Japanese producers who are taking advantage of the cheaper yen to keep prices down.
Today's report, though unlikely to prompt even a subtle policy response, nevertheless did put a fresh focus on the question of how the trade sector will affect the economy's performance this year. Exports, though accounting for only about an eighth of United States economic activity, have long been a big contributor. But growth in exports slowed to 6.2 percent last year, half the 1994 advance.
"This is probably the biggest wild card," William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, said. "When the gap is widening, it's a drain on incomes" that has a dampening effect similar to a tax increase.
Largely reflecting a swing in the trade account, magnified by statistical deficiencies, Goldman, Sachs projects a 1.8 percent increase in economic growth for the current quarter, compared with 4.7 percent in the final three months of 1996.
The research department at Merrill Lynch said trade was currently having a negative impact on the economy and its impact would be "neutral at best through the rest of 1997."
Mr. Rubin, after publicly supporting a stronger dollar for months, announced earlier this month that he felt the dollar had risen far enough. The latest trade deficit figures were unlikely to affect that position, analysts said.
The Government tally showed the December deficit swelled to nearly $10.3 billion from a November total that was revised downward to $7.9 billion, or $500 million less than the department initially reported.
Imports of goods and services surged to a record $81.7 billion, $1.2 billion higher than in November, the bulk of the increase going for crude oil and petroleum products. This reflected both greater volumes and higher prices, the latter, at least, subsequently subsiding.
Exports, which hit a record in November, eased $1.1 billion, much of the decline reflecting lower foreign sales of soybeans and corn at the end of a year when early prospects of tight supplies gave way to bountiful harvests.
But even as the overall deficit widened by nearly 30 percent in December, there was a narrowing with both China and Japan, the sources of much of this country's trade friction.
The gap with China shrank $400 million, to $2.6 billion, in December, while surging 16.9 percent for the year, to $39.5 billion, or slightly higher than with Canada and Mexico combined. The United States buys more than four times as much from China as it sells there and exported slightly less last year to China than to Australia.
In June, Congress will be called upon to extend China's trading rights for another year, a process not now expected to prove difficult but that is nevertheless likely to at least be deferred until after China's takeover of Hong Kong at midyear.
As for Japan, the American deficit edged down a slight $50 million, to $4.3 billion, in December but shrank markedly for the year. The 1996 deficit was $47.7 billion, or 19.4 percent below the 1995 total. This was the second consecutive decline, and the smallest gap since 1991.
Unlike the aggregate statistics, those for individual countries are not adjusted for seasonal variation, nor do they include services, which generally offset a large part of the deficit in merchandise.
The Coalition of Service Industries estimated that travel, transportation, royalties and other services generated a United States surplus last year equal to about 40 percent of this country's goods deficit with Japan but only about 2 percent of the goods deficit with China.
The overall deficit with Canada widened in December by $600 million, to $2.3 billion, while the deficit with Mexico was halved, to $700 million.
For the full year, however, the shortfall with Mexico climbed to a record $16.2 billion, a development seen by critics as a failure of the North American Free Trade Agreement and by the Clinton Administration as temporary fallout from unrelated Mexican economic problems, including peso devaluation in late 1994. The devaluation spurred a severe recession, which drastically cut the market for American imports.
Michael Strauss, chief economist for Sanwa Securities in New York, was not bothered by today's report, declaring that the dollar's strength "has not had a dramatic impact" on trade flows and contending that a resurgence of exports would risk excessive demand pressures in this country.
But Lawrence Chimerine, managing director and chief economist for the Economic Strategy Institute, took a dim view of what he called a "largely structural" trade deficit that is likely to rise another $10 billion to $15 billion this year.
He said that the deficit with Japan had bottomed out, that the gap with China was still rising rapidly, that European growth remained sluggish and that the nation's oil bill would keep rising.
He concluded that 1997 looked "awfully bad on trade."

HEADLINE: Unions Woo Business District Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
As business improvement districts multiply around New York City, they have become a target of union organizers, who complain that the workers hired by some districts to sweep sidewalks and empty trash cans are underpaid and unfairly treated.
Employees of one of the largest and most visible districts, the Grand Central Partnership, are to vote tomorrow on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has mounted a campaign to woo workers at two-thirds of the 34 districts in the city. 
 Officials of the districts, which use assessments collected from businesses to finance cleanup efforts and security, say they pay the going rate for their unskilled workers. If union efforts succeed in pushing up wages, they say, some districts will probably cut back or even shut down.
Labor leaders want street sweepers to receive at least $12 an hour, asserting that many get only $6 or $7 and cannot support their families on that. They are particularly angry over the wages because they believe much of the work done by the improvement districts should be performed by unionized city sanitation workers, who earn two or three times as much.
The union battle is not the first controversy to arise from the proliferation of business improvement districts in the city. Some community leaders have questioned whether the districts in effect create two classes of neighborhoods, with wealthier areas paying for private services while poorer neighborhoods must rely on city government. And two years ago, the Grand Central Partnership lost a Federal grant after being accused of having its workers harass and intimidate homeless people.
While wages appear to be the overriding issue in the union fight, some of the more than 500 workers at improvement districts in the city complain that they are exploited and accorded little respect. They say that, even on frigid days, they are prohibited from wearing coats over their sweatshirt uniforms. And though they often have to pick up syringes or handle trash bags holding chemicals, they say the gloves they are given are too thin to protect them.
"They treat us like children," said Sean Dancy, who has been a sweeper for the Grand Central Partnership for five years. "They yell at you if they think you haven't cleaned your route properly. They made promises that they'd buy us boots, and then we had to buy boots ourselves. They told us they'd give us raises, and then the raises often didn't come through."
So far, the teamsters drive has met with limited success. The union has won only one vote at a BID, gaining a 44-to-6 majority at the 34th Street Partnership in December 1995. The teamsters have lost unionization votes in BID's that cover Fifth Avenue, Eighth Street, 14th Street, 125th Street, the Fashion Center and Metrotech in Brooklyn.
Workers who voted against the union cited a variety of reasons: they did not want to pay union dues, they disliked the teamsters' reputation or they feared that their business district might contract out their jobs if a union was voted in.
But labor organizers complain bitterly that management has often acted illegally to keep the union out, dismissing workers who support the teamsters, interrogating workers about whether they back the union and threatening workers that they might lose their jobs if the teamsters were voted in.
Workers at the Grand Central Partnership, a BID surrounding the rail terminal, voted 25 to 24 last winter against the union. But the partnership agreed to allow a new union vote this week after the teamsters complained to the National Labor Relations Board that management had repeatedly threatened workers.
The board has charged several BID's with illegal dismissals and intimidation, and the cases are pending before administrative law judges.
For their part, executives at the improvement districts contend that the union's wage demands are unreasonable. Dan Biederman, president of the Grand Central Partnership, which has a budget of more than $10 million a year, said: "Property owners have voluntarily set up BID's and want to make their contribution to improve the quality of life in New York. But they do not want to pay for an effort that will cost two or three times as much."
The teamsters have not made organizing the Times Square BID a priority because the district's workers are recovering alcoholics and drug addicts in a rehabilitation program.
Rob Hill, the teamsters official heading the organizing drive, holds out the contract won at 34th Street as a model for what business improvement district workers can achieve by unionizing. In July 1998, the contract will lift all 34th Street workers with two years' experience to $11.50 an hour, almost doubling the wages of workers who started six months ago at $6 an hour.
"The union has made a big difference," said Allan Simpson, a Jamaican immigrant and sweeper who voted in favor of the teamsters at 34th Street. "Before, they often said they didn't have money in the budget for a raise, but that has changed. We won a better medical plan and an education plan."
Mr. Biederman, who heads not just the Grand Central BID but also the 34th Street and Bryant Park districts, denies that the 34th Street workers have gained a better deal than those at Grand Central. He said the Grand Central workers start at $6 an hour, jumping to about $8.50 after two years and $10 or more after five. They also receive a $500 Christmas bonus, about $300 a year in subway tokens and contributions to a pension fund.
"We know what the market is because every day, we have guys begging us to work at $6 an hour," Mr. Biederman said.
Teamsters union officials acknowledge that sweepers in Mr. Biederman's districts are better off than some others. For example, workers in the 125th Street, the 14th Street and the Eighth districts often earn less than $7.50 an hour after two years.
Those three districts, along with 15 others, including Metrotech and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, have hired the same contractor, Atlantic Maintenance, to do their cleaning. In December, workers at all 18 Atlantic Maintenance districts voted together and rejected the teamsters.
The teamsters are challenging the results, contending that the management systematically intimidated workers.

HEADLINE: Leo Rosten, a Writer Who Helped Yiddish Make Its Way Into English, Is Dead at 88

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX 

 BODY:
Leo Rosten, the writer, scholar and language maven who introduced millions of Americans to the deep lexical pleasures of chutzpah and shlemiel and kibitz and nosh, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
Mr. Rosten, who wrote dozens of works of fiction and nonfiction in a career that spanned more than six decades, was best known for his books celebrating Jewish language, humor and culture, including "The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N" (1937) and "The Joys of Yiddish" (1968). 
 "The Joys of Yiddish" was a fat lexicon of expressions that had elbowed their way into ordinary English idioms, endearments, epithets and jokes. As Mr. Rosten described the book's purpose in his introduction: "It illustrates how beautifully a language reflects the variety and vitality of life itself; and how the special culture of the Jews, their distinctive style of thought, their subtleties of feeling, are reflected in Yiddish; and how this in turn has enhanced and enriched the English we use today."
Over the years, "The Joys of Yiddish" has become the de facto standard reference work on the language, serving as a bridge between the world of Mr. Rosten's forebears and that of the more assimilated readers of our own age. Although the book quickly became a best seller, the critic Irving Howe kibitzed Mr. Rosten in The New York Times Book Review for uprooting Yiddishisms from their larger cultural context and for shlepping out Borscht Belt humor that was already old in his grandparents' day.
"Let Howe write 10 jokes and let me write 10 jokes, and you'll see the difference," Mr. Rosten countered.
But in the end, it was Mr. Rosten's mother -- who then? -- who had the last word. When "The Joys of Yiddish" was published, she telephoned her son the writer. "You have saved Yiddish," she told him. "A leben auf dein keppeleh" -- a benediction that translates literally as "a life on your little head."
What united Mr. Rosten's output was his finely tuned ear for language in all its richness. In his books, he guided readers through the nuanced worlds of meaning that lie hidden beneath a joke, an idiom or a vocal inflection. And what he revealed was nearly always good for a laugh.
"Humor is an indication of a wholeness of character structure," Mr. Rosten said in a 1981 interview. "Indeed, I would say that one of the requirements for sanity is a sense of humor -- and its absence is crippling."
Mr. Rosten's delight in the comic possibilities of language was nowhere more evident than on the lips of his most famous creation, Hyman Kaplan, whom critics have compared to the comic characters of Dickens and Shakespeare. Inspired by a former night-school student from Mr. Rosten's own teaching days, Kaplan, a Mr. Malaprop by way of Ellis Island, embodied both the perils and the pride of the immigrant experience. Hyman Kaplan made his debut in 1935 in a series of New Yorker stories; the stories were later published in book form under the pseudonym Leonard Q. Ross.
Plump, middle-aged and possessed of a warped linguistic brilliance, the pompous Hyman Kaplan sat front and center in the beginners' class of the American Night Preparatory School for Adults, where he signed his name in a barrage of asterisks and ritually tortured his long-suffering teacher, Mr. Parkhill, with his compound fractures of English. The most famous "tree American wriders," Kaplan announced proudly in class, were "Jeck Laundon," "Valt Viterman" and "Mocktvain" (the author, for the unenlightened, of "Hawk L. Barry-Feen").
Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review in 1937, Robert Van Gelder noted that Kaplan "overrides all conventions and even the laughter of enemies, twisting the language of Shakespeare and Milton to his will as casually as we might twist the language of Confucius -- if we knew enough about it to catch hold of it at all."
Leo Calvin Rosten was born on April 11, 1908, in Lodz, Poland, the son of Samuel and Ida Freundlich Rosten, and immigrated with his family to the United States in 1911. Reared in Chicago, he was the product of the immigrant, working-class Jewish milieu that was home to a generation of Hyman Kaplans. A voracious reader with a wide-ranging intellect, the young Mr. Rosten set out to be a political scientist. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1930 and his doctorate from the same institution in 1937, followed by postgraduate study at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
In a 1981 interview, Mr. Rosten recalled the "passion for clarity" that first attracted him to the social sciences: "Sooner or later I would have been driven by the need to find out something . . . about how people act, why they do what they do, how society is organized, why there are wars and depressions, murders and prejudice and fanaticism." He added: "It wasn't enough to say, 'These are things I don't understand.' I had to try, at least, to understand them."
As a young doctorate in the teeth of the Depression, Mr. Rosten was forced to abandon his scholarly career temporarily and take a night job teaching English to new immigrants. There, he encountered a student -- a man named Kaplan -- who would inspire one of the most memorable comic figures of 20th-century fiction.
"I walked out of that first night's class in a daze," Mr. Rosten said in 1937. "That man Kaplan had taught me a great deal. I thought the conjugation of verbs meant saying, 'Drink, drank, drunk.' I asked Kaplan to conjugate 'fail,' and he said, 'Fail, failed, bankrupt.' I was stunned."
The indomitable Kaplan reappeared for two sequels, "The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N" (1959) and "O K*A*P*L*A*N! My K*A*P*L*A*N!" (1976). In 1968, "The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N" was briefly reincarnated as a Broadway musical, staged by George Abbott and starring Tom Bosley, which opened to pleasant if unspectacular notices.
Mr. Rosten's other books include "The Washington Correspondents" (1937), a study of the Capitol press corps; "Hollywood: The Movie Colony, the Movie Makers" (1941), one of the first sociological examinations of the film industry; the mystery novels "Silky" (1979) and "King Silky" (1980), and "The Joys of Yinglish" (1989). Mr. Rosten was also the author of numerous screenplays, including "All Through the Night" and "Sleep, My Love."
During World War II, Mr. Rosten held a variety of Government positions, including deputy director of the Office of War Information and chief of the Office of War Information's motion pictures division, and in the late 1940's worked for the Rand Corporation. He also taught at Yale, Columbia and the New School for Social Research, and in 1960 was a Ford visiting professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley.
Mr. Rosten's first marriage, to Priscilla Ann Mead, ended in divorce. He is survived by two daughters from that marriage, Margaret Muir of Bowdoinham, Me., and Madeline Lee of New York City, and six grandchildren. Mr. Rosten's second wife, the former Gertrude Zimi, died in 1995; a son from his first marriage, Philip, died last year.
Surveying his career in 1981, Mr. Rosten seemed untroubled by the inability of critics to find a single literary pigeonhole that would contain his ecumenical interests: "I remember a literary agent once scolding me, saying that I was foolish to spread myself over so many fields. He said, 'The critics don't know what to call you: a novelist, a social scientist, an essayist, a humorist, a social commentator.' I said, 'That's their problem.' "
 
From a Language Maven, the Wry Wisdom of a Culture
Leo Rosten described "The Joys of Yiddish" (McGraw-Hill) as "A relaxed lexicon of Yiddish, Hebrew and Yinglish words often encountered in English, plus dozens that ought to be, with serendipitous excursions into Jewish humor, habits, holidays, history, religion, ceremonies, folklore and cuisine; the whole generously garnished with stories, anecdotes, epigrams, Talmudic quotations, folk sayings and jokes -- from the days of the Bible to those of the beatnik." Some abbreviated entries follow:
 
GOTTENYU! "Dear God," "Oh dear God" or "How-else-can-I-describe my feelings!" Gottenyu! is an exclamation that is uttered with affection, despair or irony, to lend force to a sentence by adding fervor to sentiment.
It is a warm, informal, personal way of enlisting God's attention, not invoking his aid. Nor does it describe the Lord in any way.
It is a colloquial epithet used, for the most part, without really meaning God, per Se (I guess I must capitalize Se here). "Were we happy! Gottenyu!" "Gottenyu! -- you never saw such a mess!" "Was I scared? Miserable? Oh, Gottenyu!" A common phrase is "Zeeser Gottenyu," "Sweet God."
A charming dictum has it that, under stress, Jews explain, 'Oy, Mamanyu!" When stress becomes fear they cry, "Oy, Tatenyu!" ("tata" being father). And when things really get tough, Jews cry, "Oy, Gottenyu!" Note the realistic stratification of power.

SHLEP 1. To drag or pull or lag behind. "Don't shlep all those packages; let the store deliver them." Pick up your feet; don't shlep."
2. To stall, drag one's heels, delay; to move or perform slowly, lazily, inefficiently. "At the rate you're shlepping along, we'll never finish."
Mrs. Hoffenstein, visiting London, went shopping at the famous confectioners, Fortnum & Mason. She brought jars of marmalade, biscuits, tins of cookies and candies, to take back to her hotel.
"And where," asked the striped-trousered salesman, "shall we deliver these, madam?"
"Don't bother. I'll carry them."
"But madam, we'll be happy to deliver this order --"
"I know, but I don't mind, I'm from the Bronx."
"I understand, madam," said the clerk, "but still -- why shlep?"

YENTA Pronounced YEN-ta, to rhyme with "bent a." Yenta, I am told, was a perfectly acceptable name for a lady, derived from the Italian gentile -- until some ungracious yenta gave it a bad name.
1. A woman of low origins or vulgar manners; a shrew; a shallow, coarse termagant. "She is the biggest yenta on the block."
2. A gossipy woman, a scandal-spreader; a rumormonger; one unable to keep a secret or respect a confidence. In this sense, men are sometimes described as yentas.
Two yentas meet in Miami.
"So tell me, Molly, have you been through the menopause?"
"The menopause? I haven't even been through the Fontainebleau yet."
One of the more amusing buttons worn by the button-happy hippie young reads: MARCEL PROUST IS A YENTA.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Japan Rewards Borrowing, And the Yen Keeps Falling

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
There's a reason the Japanese yen comes across as the weakling of the currency markets these days: Japan, with its struggling economy, frail stock market and cheap funds, has become a place to borrow, not invest.
"Here in Japan you are in an extraordinary situation, and that extraordinary factor is that money is free," said Jesper Koll, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia. With rock-bottom interest rates essentially offset by inflation, money has been a free commodity, Mr. Koll said, quickly adding: "As a result, it is flowing out of the country. Are we not now just witnessing the making of another bubble?" 
 So while some in the United States are preoccupied with how strong the dollar should be, here in Japan the headache of the moment is how weak the yen will get.
Every few days, a Japanese official frets over the decline of the yen, which, in percentage terms, traveled twice as far against the dollar in January as it had moved on average each month last year.
Yet, Japanese officials might be relieved that investors have only recently acted on an increasingly legitimate reason for a weaker yen: the gap in interest rates between their country and the United States.
People are pumping money out of Japan in search of higher yields, fueling stock and bond markets in New York and elsewhere, several economists here say. Investors come to Japan to raise funds, then convert their yen borrowings into dollars. When such activity turns into a flood, the yen's value slides.
Investments from Japan in dollar assets more than tripled last year, to about $43 billion. But many economists and analysts say that those figures dwarf the amount of yen borrowing, much of which cannot be traced when funds are raised in yen in Europe.
Such borrowing could run as high as $40 billion to $60 billion a month, Mr. Koll said. Partly as a result, he said, the yen could plummet to 160 against the dollar or beyond. The yen settled here today at 123.64 to the dollar.
Of course, there have been fears of a yen collapse before. Early last summer, a pattern of deterioration in Japanese trade figures alarmed some central bank officials, who worried that investors might react rashly, dumping yen and bringing about a collapse of the currency.
The yen certainly weakened, along with a decline in Japan's current-account surplus, the broadest measure of trade, but there was no free fall.
Some economists now suggest that given the state of the economy the yen may be headed toward a resistance level of 130 to the dollar. [In New York late Wednesday, the yen declined to 124.46 to the dollar.]
The role of interest rates becomes crucial. Japan's official discount rate, the interest rate the central bank charges commercial banks for overnight funds, stands at a record low one-half of 1 percent, and the rate for overnight funds secured with bonds has often hovered below that level. Factor in an inflation rate in Japan of one-half of 1 percent, and borrowed funds here are in theory not merely free, but offer a dividend.
By comparison, 10-year United States Treasury instruments have been yielding 6.25 to 6.5 percent, so that over the last year, a cross-border investor borrowing under long-term arrangements with Japanese banks has made a nice profit, not even counting foreign-exchange gains when switching back from dollars to yen to repay the loan.
When rates in Japan were lowered in September 1995, economists expected the easy monetary policy to be temporary, lasting just long enough to help the ailing Japanese banks pull themselves out of a morass of bad debt.
But the policy has largely persisted, and now, any rise in interest rates could crush the chance of economic recovery. So economists say that in the near future they do not expect a rate increase, which would be one of the few effective ways to begin stemming the yen's decline. If interest rates remain low, investors are more likely to turn to Japan as a steady source of cheap funds.
Asset prices in Japan remain remarkably high by international standards. Still, certain prices may be equalizing a bit between what is charged in New York and in Tokyo. Take, for instance, the Big Mac index, an idea introduced by The Economist magazine and that has caught on somewhat with practicing economists.
The equilibrium exchange rate, known as purchasing-power parity, is the rate that in theory makes the price of a Big Mac, McDonald's namesake hamburger, the same in the United States as in Japan. These days, a Big Mac in Tokyo costs 280 yen. At today's exchange rate, that makes its dollar cost $2.26, well below the price of a Big Mac in mid-Manhattan, which can run $2.89. So as far as the Big Mac is concerned, the yen has fallen far enough.
Yet some economists say that if Japanese policy makers want to stimulate the economy, they have few options but to let the yen slide.
"The only thing they can do is push the yen weaker," said Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute.
The problem is that a weaker yen increases exports, crimps imports and could ultimately raise the current-account surplus, the bounty earned when a country exports more than it imports. While the increase in Japan's trade surplus plummeted in January, exports were strong, suggesting that the surplus may soon widen again. That would probably lead to a stronger yen and risk new trade friction with the United States.
"We've been on this route before," Mr. Koo remarked. "Now, Japanese Government officials realize how dangerous all this can get."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Europe Talks as Cuba Deadline Nears

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
With only hours to go before before a legal deadline, Clinton Administration officials said today that they were engaged in last-minute negotiations with the European Community to find a diplomatic solution to an increasingly bitter argument over America's trade embargo on Cuba.
The Europeans agreed last week to delay until Thursday the appointment of a panel of judges at the World Trade Organization to hear their challenge to American efforts to penalize foreign companies that do business with Cuba. 
 In response, the United States has threatened to invoke a "national security exemption" to short-circuit the European Union's effort to have the Helms-Burton Act declared a violation of international trade law.
The exemption would declare that Cuba is a threat to the security of the United States, and as a result the economic sanctions against Cuba are not trade actions that the trade group is competent to judge.
It could come as early as Thursday, a senior Administration official said today, but it may be delayed if negotiations with Europe make considerable progress.

HEADLINE: With Polite Nod to One Another, Democratic Field Uses Forum to Attack Mayor

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Seeking to stand out in a blurred and crowded field, the four Democratic mayoral prospects used a campaign forum yesterday to pummel Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- but not each other. They disparaged his personal ethics, the decline of city schools and Mr. Giuliani's efforts to cut the welfare rolls.
For 90 minutes, before a breakfast audience of business executives and political leaders, the candidates, Fernando Ferrer, Ruth W. Messinger, Al Sharpton and Sal F. Albanese, tried to outdo one another with at times caustic attacks on the Mayor. Counseled by party leaders not to criticize one another, each asserted that he or she was the best candidate the Democrats could field against the Republican Mayor. 
 Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, contended that Mr. Giuliani "as a prosecutor would not tolerate Rudolph Giuliani the Mayor." Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said the Mayor has "ignored the needs of New Yorkers and followed his own whims and the wishes of a powerful few."
Mr. Albanese, a Councilman from Brooklyn, said Mr. Giuliani had "long ago gone over to the dark side" in accommodating the needs of campaign contributors. And Mr. Sharpton, a minister and civil rights leader, said Mr. Giuliani was Mayor only of "a part of the city."
The debate, sponsored by The New York Post, was unusually early in the political cycle -- the primary is in September -- and presented the candidates a welcome opportunity for attention. Given that the audience members at the Sheraton New York in Manhattan were mostly reporters and politicians, all the candidates came exceptionally well prepared. Mr. Ferrer read from notes as he offered detailed answers to questions. And an aide to Ms. Messinger gave reporters in the audience a handout on Mr. Giuliani's crime record the moment Ms. Messinger answered a question on the subject.
But the forum also served again to illustrate the difficulties facing the field as a whole, as well as the individual candidates. Most strikingly, each of the candidates found their effort to stand out complicated by pressure from Democratic leaders to avoid a cantankerous primary that might lead to Mr. Giuliani's re-election. As a result, by the end of the debate, the leading contenders made no obvious progress in distinguishing themselves.
Mr. Ferrer, Ms. Messinger and Mr. Albanese watched with evident frustration as the lively Mr. Sharpton grabbed the spotlight with comical, if pointed, rejoinders. Mr. Sharpton's competitors, all career elected officials, tended to speak in jargon little known beyond governmental circles. Thus, while Mr. Ferrer spoke about "Tier 2" housing and Ms. Messinger recounted visits to "E.A.U.'s" -- the Emergency Assistance Units that are part of the city's homeless system -- Mr. Sharpton spoke to the unseen television audience, such as when he delivered a description of the racial makeup of the Giuliani administration. "This administration is like the Rocky Mountains," he said. "The higher up you get, the whiter it gets."
At City Hall, Mr. Giuliani asserted that the debate demonstrated the weaknesses of his challengers. "It was notoriously absent with regard to new ideas, new thoughts, new proposals," he said.
In an obvious effort to further muddle the Democratic contest, Mr. Giuliani, who did not watch the forum but had it described to him, proclaimed Mr. Sharpton "far and away the winner." His remarks seemed intended to keep attention on the long-shot Mr. Sharpton, while obscuring Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Messinger.
The debate had several memorable moments. At the prodding of one of The New York Post questioners, all four candidates said they supported the official recognition of marriages between homosexuals.
Further, if history is any guide and civility goes by the wayside as the primary approaches, there was a strong indication of how the campaign might unravel. That came when Mr. Ferrer discussed how the murder of a police officer last year prompted him to abandon his life-long opposition to the death penalty.
"Politicians are, as you know, not made of wood," Mr. Ferrer said, explaining the shift. "You react and respond to things as they come."
Ms. Messinger responded with a clear if implicit criticism of Mr. Ferrer. "I'm an opponent of capital punishment and a supporter of a woman's right to choose," she said. "Those are moral positions. And I don't change my moral positions."
It was clear that Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Messinger were more than ready to do what they could to score points at Mr. Giuliani's expense. Mr. Ferrer invoked newspaper reports about the influence of two lobbyists who are among Mr. Giuliani's closest advisers, Raymond L. Harding, the Liberal Party leader, and Herman Badillo. "As Mayor," Mr. Ferrer said, "Rudolph Giuliani has failed New York as a moral leader."

Chart: "IN THEIR OWN WORDS"
Following are excerpts of remarks by the four Democratic mayoral candidates at a forum yesterday sponsored by The New York Post.
 
RUTH W. MESSINGER
"Every morning in Rudy Giuliani's New York, 90,000 children wake up knowing there isn't even a seat waiting for them at school. Our neighborhood cops are vanishing from the streets. New York's unemployment rate is 41 percent above the national average.
"That is Rudy Giuliani's New York. And it is a disgrace. He has ignored the needs of New York and followed his own whims and the wishes of a powerful few. Let me be specific: Rudy Giuliani was ready to hand George Steinbrenner $1 billion he didn't need for a stadium we don't need. But he didn't hesitate to cut $1 billion desperately needed by the schoolchildren of this city."
 
FERNANDO FERRER
"Rudolph Giuliani as a prosecutor would not tolerate Rudolph Giuliani the Mayor. As Mayor, he has permitted his closest advisers to lobby the very agencies that they are advising him about.
"As mayor, I will not permit any person that appears before any city agency as a lawyer or lobbyist to take part in any governmental decisions or participate as an adviser to me. Why hasn't Rudy Giuliani closed these loopholes? Because he is beholden to Ray Harding, whose Liberal line made him the Mayor in the first place."
 
AL SHARPTON
"Rudy Giuliani is the Mayor of part of the city. I'm running because we need a mayor who understands and will service the entire city. I'm running because there are students who went to school in September of last year, and 91,000 of them could not find classroom space.
 "We must have sane limits, but we should never turn away a homeless person if we can provide them with a bed and a plate. We should try to build them more affordable housing."
 
SAL F. ALBANESE
"It's time to reform the way political campaigns are financed and end the corrupting influence of big money on democracy. The way campaigns are financed at best blunts, and at worst corrupts, the will of officeholders, to serve at the interest of all the people, and not in favor of the interest of few people who are large campaign donors. This is the dark side of democracy -- where words are graciously given to all, but most access is reserved for a few. The present Mayor has long ago gone over to the dark side. I don't merely talk about campaign reform. I work at it."

HEADLINE: In Move Aimed at Helping Defector, North Korea to Get Food Aid

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, Feb. 20

 BODY:
South Korea and the United States say they will provide $6 million and $10 million of food aid to North Korea, respectively, in actions that could help lead to a resolution of the impasse over a high-ranking North Korean defector.
Some people familiar with the situation say that prospects are brightening that the defector, Hwang Jang Yop, will be able to come to Seoul from Beijing, where he has been holed up in the South Korean Consulate seeking asylum since Feb. 12. 
 But South Korean officials said progress in the negotiations was slow.
"We are neither pessimistic or optimistic," said a senior Government official. He also expressed concern that the death on Wednesday of the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, will delay or otherwise affect the negotiations over Mr. Hwang.
South Korea has said it will not publicly discuss details of its negotiations with China, for fear of angering Beijing. But officials here described as "groundless" a report by Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, that China and South Korea had already reached an agreement "in principle" to let Mr. Hwang leave.
China, which wants to maintain good relations with North and South Korea, has been in a delicate position regarding Mr. Hwang and has said that resolving the problem would take time.
After first insisting that Mr. Hwang had been kidnapped, though, North Korea has now made statements saying he is a "renegade" and implying he could leave. If those public statements truly reflect North Korea's stance, then China will have found an opening and could move swiftly, some officials said.
South Korean officials insist the question of food aid is not linked to that of Mr. Hwang and was under discussion well before his defection. But South Korea's decision to go ahead with its aid could hasten North Korea's acceptance of Mr. Hwang's defection, the senior official said. "We think it will help create a favorable atmosphere for North Korea," the official said.
The food aid appears to be part of a general effort by the North and South to quickly resume programs aimed at improving relations that had been in danger of derailment after Mr. Hwang's request for asylum and the shooting here last Saturday of another prominent defector, Lee Han Young, which South Korean officials suspect was carried out by North Korean agents in retaliation for the Hwang defection.
This morning South Korea announced that it would provide $6 million in assistance to North Korea through the United Nations, up from the $3.2 million it gave last year. The announcement followed one by the United States in Washington on Wednesday that it would donate $10 million, up from $6.2 million last year.
Both aid packages will go toward helping relieve widespread starvation in the Communist nation that has been brought about by severe floods, the loss of aid after the Soviet Union collapsed and a general economic breakdown.
North Korea has also agreed once again to attend a briefing by South Korea and Washington on proposed peace talks aimed at formally ending the Korean war, American and South Korean officials said.
Moreover, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official said a team would be sent to North Korea about March 1, one week later than initially planned, to survey the site where two modern nuclear plants will be built in exchange for Pyongyang's abandonment of the nuclear weapons program it is suspected of having but has not acknowledged.

HEADLINE: CHINA AFTER DENG: IN WASHINGTON;
U.S. Sees Few Changes in Chinese Relations

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The death of Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, had been expected for so long that officials in the Clinton Administration said today that it would prompt few drastic changes, if any, in how America handles one of its more important and difficult diplomatic relationships.
At the same time, the death of Mr. Deng and the possibility of political uncertainty in its aftermath raised concerns here about the direction China will take -- even as American policy enters a new phase of potential confrontations, from China's takeover of Hong Kong to its entry into the World Trade Organization to its selling of nuclear technology. 
 It was a measure of underlying concerns that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who was in London discussing China and Hong Kong with the British Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, when the announcement of Mr. Deng's death came, expressed hope for a smooth transition of power. She did so even though Mr. Deng had, by all appearances, already passed most of his vast powers to China's President, Jiang Zemin.
"It would obviously be a great advantage to the Chinese, as well as all of us, if there were a smooth transition," Ms. Albright said.
President Clinton expressed sadness at the death of Mr. Deng and joined other world leaders in paying tribute to the Chinese leader's efforts to open China's economic system and thus its diplomacy to the rest of the world, including the United States.
"China today plays an important role in world affairs in no small part because of Mr. Deng's decision to open his country to the outside world," he said in a statement released as he visited Boston.
While Mr. Clinton's first term in office was marked by an uneven and awkward relationship with China, his second term was just beginning to show signs of improving relations. He used his statement to reassert the importance his Administration attaches to its efforts to encourage China to continue to open up.
"The continued emergence of China as a great power that is stable politically and open economically, that respects human rights and the rule of law and that becomes a full partner in building a secure international order is profoundly in America's interest," the President said.
Had Mr. Deng's death come a few years ago, when his control within China's Communist Government remained supreme, there would most certainly have been greater anxiety over the possibility of a convulsive transition. But as his health waned and he retreated from the public eye in the early 1990's, Mr. Deng anointed Mr. Jiang, who now holds the titles of General Secretary of the Communist Party, state president and leader of China's armed forces.
In that sense, Mr. Deng's death did not signal any immediate changes in China and thus automatically trigger a review of American policy, Administration officials and academic experts said today. As word of Mr. Deng's death spread, officials at the White House and the State Department sought to play down its potential ramifications on American policy.
One Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "the significance of this is very easy to overstate."
As if to make the point, Mr. Clinton kept to his plans to play some golf this afternoon after returning to Washington from Boston.
But other officials and experts on China said Mr. Deng's definitive removal from the political scene could result in internal jockeying. It could also freeze progress on a number of issues until the Communist Party's 15th Congress in the fall, where Mr. Jiang is expected to consolidate his power by recasting the leaders around him in new roles.
Some of the officials and experts said that Mr. Jiang could soon have the freedom to act more boldly, perhaps even making gestures to the United States as he and President Clinton prepare to exchange state visits starting this year.
Others said Mr. Deng's death could prompt a reassessment, including one of Mr. Deng's record itself. Still others said it could strengthen the hand of China's hard-liners opposed to the relative openness and moderation of Mr. Deng's years at the helm.
The United States has expressed hope that some of the issues facing relations with China -- including an agreement by China to open its markets enough to the join the World Trade Organization and a warming in relations with Washington through, say, a gesture on the human rights front -- will be resolved sooner rather than later. Progress in these areas would bolster the Administration's efforts to engage China with what Ms. Albright has called a "multi-faceted" policy.
The President's statement reflected, indirectly at least, some of the tensions inherent in that approach. Mr. Clinton made only passing reference to human rights, one of the most contentious disputes with China, and did not take on Mr. Deng's darkest legacy: the violent crackdown on pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Ms. Albright only addressed the human rights issue after it was brought up in questioning by reporters. "For many people, it will be a mixed assessment," she said of Mr. Deng's legacy.
At least for now, Ms. Albright still plans to visit Beijing on Monday on the last stop of her first foray overseas as Secretary of State. In keeping with past practice when its leaders died, the Government in Beijing announced that it would not not invite foreign dignitaries to Mr. Deng's funeral. That at least spared the Clinton Administration any potential handwringing over whom to send.

HEADLINE: Detroit Papers' Rehiring Policy Angers Unions

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
The Detroit newspapers held out an olive branch yesterday to the six newspaper unions that proposed over the weekend to end their 19-month strike. But the papers did not offer the only thing the unions wanted, an assurance that the strikers could go directly back to work.
Instead, Detroit Newspapers Inc., the management arm of The Detroit Free Press, a Knight-Ridder newspaper, and The Detroit News, a subsidiary of the Gannett Company, said that former strikers would get their old jobs back only as vacancies occurred at the two newspapers, which have continued to publish with replacement workers since the strike began in July 1995. 
 Although the papers' position on returning workers had been well known, the unions reacted angrily yesterday, and said they would continue the advertising and readership boycotts that they conducted throughout the strike.
In a statement, Detroit Newspapers said strikers wanting to go back to work would be placed on a preferential hiring list, and would be rehired on a seniority basis according to their pre-strike job classifications.
In addition, a job retraining and relocation fund of about $2 million would be created to help former strikers whose old jobs have been eliminated or who want to seek employment at other newspapers.
"This is clearly an offer made with reconciliation in mind," said Robert H. Giles, publisher of The News. "We believe it represents the kind of creative solution that many community leaders have called for, and our genuine hope is that the unions will want to work with us in this endeavor."
In the absence of an immediate offer of employment for all 2,000 strikers, however, the unions were in no mood for reconciliation.
"My reaction is that this is a kind of artful effort to put a nice face on a response that says 'drop dead' to the workers," said Samuel C. McKnight, the lawyer for the Detroit Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions. "If what they are doing looks like, walks like, talks like, feels like and sounds like a lockout, that's what it is, and I'm disappointed that they didn't accept our effort at reconciliation."
About 2,500 reporters, editors, press operators, drivers and other newspaper workers struck over job cuts, wages and work rules on July 19, 1995, and about 2,000 remained on strike until Friday, when the first of the six unions announced the back-to-work decision.
The move was described at a strategic shift aimed at making the papers liable for back wages and benefits for each day the strikers' old jobs are denied them. The papers would be liable for back pay if a National Labor Relations Board ruling, expected later this year, supports a union contention that the strike was prompted by unfair labor practices. If the board agrees with the employers that the strike was over economic issues, no back pay will be due.
Mr. McKnight said yesterday that the unions would "do everything in our power" to force the papers to accept a blanket recall of all strikers. "If we can't have jobs with dignity and jobs that we consider our own," he said, "we are going to do everything we can to hurt these papers -- and frankly, we don't think this community wants these papers."
The unions can point to a 30 percent decline in the weekday circulation of the two papers, along with reduced advertising sales and millions of dollars in losses for both companies since the strike began.
But The News and The Free Press showed a profit in the last quarter of 1996, Mr. Giles said, and still had a strong readership base, particularly on Sunday, when the two papers publish a combined edition.
"If you look at our Sunday circulation of about 825,000, that translates into about two million readers who have cast their votes with us in this community," Mr. Giles said.
The publisher appealed to the unions to end economic warfare against the papers, saying, "We believe that the end of the strike, which is effective today, is the signal that the community is looking for to put this ordeal behind them."

HEADLINE: New York Jury Convicts Three Venezuelan Bankers of Defrauding Depositors

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
A Manhattan jury convicted three Venezuelan bankers yesterday of defrauding South American depositors, supporting the District Attorney's contention that international banking cases can be tried in New York even when the primary crime is committed outside the country.
Orlando Castro Llanes, once the head of a Venezuelan financial empire, was convicted of engineering a scheme to steal millions of dollars from Venezuelan depositors to prop up his failing businesses. His son, Orlando Castro Castro, and grandson, Jorge Castro Barredo, were also convicted of bank fraud and grand larceny. 
 The case, which was closely watched in Venezuela, drew attention in New York mainly because of the questions it raised about whether the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, should be prosecuting crimes that were committed outside the United States.
Defense attorneys repeatedly argued that New York prosecutors had no legal right to try foreign citizens for acts that took place outside the United States. But Mr. Morgenthau said the defendants had used New York banks as part of an elaborate scheme to defraud depositors. Arguing that the New York banks were an important element of the fraud, Mr. Morgenthau said his office had a responsibility to protect the integrity of the city's banking system.
"This case once again demonstrates our commitment to safeguard the city's role as the financial capital of the world," Mr. Morgenthau said after the verdict. "Individuals who perpetrate fraud through financial transactions in New York will be held accountable."
Mr. Morgenthau has said that he charged the three bankers after receiving information about their activities from the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He also said the Venezuelan government had asked for his assistance when the Castros left their country after the collapse of their banks.
Richard Preiss, the prosecutor who tried the case, charged that the Castros misled Venezuelan depositors into believing their money would be safely invested in a United States-regulated bank in Puerto Rico. Instead, prosecutors said, the bankers lost the money through risky trading and stole to support their failing businesses and extravagant lifestyle. The Castros used New York banks to transfer their depositors' funds from Venezuelan bolivars into dollars.
The scheme cost depositors more than $15 million, prosecutors said.
The defense lawyers said after yesterday's verdict that they would appeal the case.

Deng Xiaoping, 92, Dies; Leader Transformed China
Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader and the architect of economic reforms that transformed the world's most populous nation, died in Beijing. He was 92. Mr. Deng, a wily pragmatist and unyielding authoritarian, was the last of a generation of leaders who shared the hardships of forging the Chinese Revolution. He is succeeded by Jiang Zemin, 70, China's President and General Secretary of the Communist Party. A1
 
United States officials said they doubted that the death of Mr. Deng would lead to any drastic change in the relations between the United States and China. A1 

Mr. Deng's death raised uncertainties in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He was seen as a defender of Hong Kong's autonomy against the harder wing of the Communist Party. Many Asian experts said the Chinese nationalists would put Taiwan at the center of any power struggle in the era after Mr. Deng. A11
 
Mexican Arrest Shocks U.S.
United States officials were surprised by the arrest of the head of Mexico's antinarcotics program, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, on charges of collaborating with drug traffickers. Just days earlier, he had been given a detailed briefing on what the United States knows about Mexico's cocaine cartels. A1
 
'Eurocrats' Just Can't Win
The European Court of Human Rights declined to overturn prison sentences imposed by Britain on three people for causing bodily harm through consensual sado-masochistic activities. Hours later, the European Parliament, an elected body, blamed the European Union's bureaucratic laxity for the outbreak and spread of mad cow disease. The "Eurocrats" were criticized both for meddling too much and for not doing enough. A3
 
Extradition Alternative Sought
Israeli and American officials are looking for ways not to extradite Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook to Israel. Lawyers for Mr. Abu Marzook, a leader of the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas who is being held in a New York jail, said they had heard rumors of such discussions but had not been contacted directly. Israelis fear that trying him in Israel might provoke terror attacks. A14
 
Food Aid for North Korea
South Korea and the United States said they would provide $6 million and $10 million of food aid to North Korea respectively in moves that could lead to a resolution of an impasse over a high-ranking North Korean defector. Officials familiar with the situation said prospects that the defector would be able to go to Seoul had improved. A8
 
Mudslide Buries Peru Villages
A vast mudslide swept off an Andean mountainside over two remote Peruvian villages and buried between 250 and 300 people, President Alberto K. Fujimori said. He said 41 bodies had been recovered so far, and there were few survivors. (Reuters)

Supreme Court Reaffirms Broad Protection of Clinics
The Supreme Court reaffirmed its approach of broadly protecting access to abortion clinics with a ruling that upheld a lower court's order keeping demonstrators at least 15 feet away from the doorways and driveways of clinics in upstate New York. But it struck down a separate provision that ordered demonstrators to keep 15 feet away from people entering or leaving the clinics. A1
 
The Court also ruled that police officers may order passengers out of the cars they stop for routine traffic violations, calling it a reasonable measure for the officers' safety. B10
 
Espionage Episode Is Emerging
An Army engineer in Michigan has said he gave classified military information over the last 10 years to Israeli officials on such weapons as Patriot missiles and armored vehicles, the authorities said. The engineer, David A. Tenenbaum, said he had supplied the information inadvertently, according to an affidavit filed in United States District Court in Detroit. He has not been charged with a crime. A16
 
Clinton Warning on Youth Crime
President Clinton visited Boston, a city that has seen an impressive reduction in juvenile crime statistics, to signal the new emphasis of his anti-crime measures in a second term. He said a new baby boom could produce a wave of juvenile crime in six years if nothing is done. B9
 
Detroit Newspapers Make Offer
The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News said members of six formerly striking unions would be rehired as vacancies occurred among the replacement workers who have been producing the newspapers. The unions, which had been on strike since July 1995, offered over the weekend to return to work unconditionally but had been seeking an assurance that members could immediately return to their jobs. A16
 
Prosecutor Says Case Goes On
The Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, said his decision to resign his post was purely a personal matter. He also said the investigation was being handled by veteran prosecutors and would not be affected by his departure. B9
 
California Rapist Rearrested
A man convicted of raping and cutting off the arms of a girl in California in 1978 and whose release from prison caused an uproar has been arrested in Tampa, Fla., in connection with the death of a woman whose body was found in her home. A16
 
Harriman Divides Her Estate
The will of Pamela Harriman, who died while serving as Ambassador to France, leaves the bulk of her estate to her only son, Winston S. Churchill, and his estranged wife. There was no provision for Mrs. Harriman's assistant of 16 years; friends of Mrs. Harriman said the two had quarreled. B9

Schools Fail to Track The Chronically Absent
The city school system's chief investigator issued a stinging report about a Manhattan school district's failure to track chronically absent students. There are 4,600 children who were once enrolled in city schools but whose current situation is not known, the investigator said. B6
 
Lining Up for Marriage
Hundreds of people waited in line for hours at municipal offices to get marriage licenses, an outpouring that the City Clerk, Carlos Cuevas, said he had never seen before. Officials suspect that the surge was partly caused by immigrants' mistaken belief that if they marry United States citizens by April 1, they can avoid deportation under the new Federal immigration law.

Rebutting Secession in Suffolk
The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, transformed his state-of-the-county address into a call for unity, responding to calls for secession from the eastern, most rural end of the county. Leaders of the movement to create a new county in the east said they were not impressed. B1

HEADLINE: X-Rated Fraud Uses Internet To Bilk Users

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
In what law enforcement officials describe as a fraudulent new high-technology scheme, telephone and Internet marketers are joining with telecommunications companies in emerging nations to bilk unsuspecting consumers around the world.
In the latest operation, officials say, three Long Island-based companies enticed on-line computer browsers with a promise of free pornography and then subjected users to exorbitant telephone charges billed from a number in Moldova, the former Soviet republic. 
 A Federal judge in New York shut down the operation last week after the Federal Trade Commission accused the defendants of running "one of the most insidious scams" the agency had ever seen.
Federal officials uncovered a similar operation in November involving an Iowa company that lured telephone customers to place lengthy calls for free travel offers to numbers in Guyana and the Caribbean.
Officials said they expected such schemes to proliferate as sophisticated operators of World Wide Web sites employed the growing telephone systems of underdeveloped nations to defraud naive Internet users.
"There are phone companies all over the world that have tried to attract business from information providers using pay-per-call services," said Eileen Harrington, an F.T.C. specialist in telecommunications fraud.
Ms. Harrington said that phone companies in several countries were aggressively soliciting business from Internet and long-distance information service providers by apparently agreeing to pay them a portion of the telephone billing revenue.
She said that these countries had invested in advanced telephone systems but did not have sufficient local business to support them and were looking abroad for income.
Ms. Harrington said that she did not know whether the foreign telephone companies were active participants in the schemes or merely conduits for fraudulent activity beyond their borders.
In the current case, the F.T.C. sought a permanent injunction against three individuals and three companies they controlled who the agency says offered free pornography on three Internet sites: www.sexygirls.com, www.beavisbutthead.com and www. 1adult.com.
Users who wished to enter the sites were told they must download an electronic "viewer" to receive the images. The viewer contained a software program that clicked off the user's telephone connection to his local Internet service provider and reconnected the computer to a phone number in Moldova that generated charges of $2 to $3 a minute.
"Their modems were basically hijacked," Ms. Harrington said.
The program shut off the speaker in the computer dialing device so that the users could not hear their Internet connection being broken and the new number in Moldova being dialed.
"It gets worse," Ms. Bernstein said. "Once the program is activated, it does not disconnect the international call when consumers leave the defendants' Web sites to visit other Web sites, or even when they sign off the Internet and turn to other computer activities such as word processing."
The charges stopped accruing only when the computer was turned off. And consumers' first notice of the cost was on their monthly long-distance telephone bill.
An official of the Moldovan Embassy in Washington said that his Government was looking into the alleged fraud.
"I have called people at the Federal Trade Commission to give me more information so that the Ministry of Telecommunication can begin the investigation," said Vlad Spanu, economic counselor at the Moldovan mission here.
He speculated that the alleged scheme could involve "some private people in Moldova" but said it was not yet clear that the calls ever reached Moldova.
Named in the F.T.C. complaint were Anna M. Grella, William Gannon and David Zeng, who operated three companies: Audiotex Connection Inc., of Rockville Centre, L.I.; Promo Line Inc., of Dix Hills, L.I., and Electronic Forms Management, of no known address.
Jodie Bernstein, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that the complex scheme threatened the integrity of the Internet and posed a formidable law enforcement and regulatory challenge.
"This scam has generated numerous complaints, many from parents with Internet-savvy children, who have incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal phone charges," Ms. Bernstein said.
Judge Denis R. Hurley of Federal District Court in Hauppauge, L.I., issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants on Feb. 13. The order was kept under seal until midnight yesterday to give the authorities time to locate and freeze their assets to help recover consumers' costs in the alleged fraud.
Joel R. Dichter of New York, the defendants' lawyer, said that the Web sites contained disclosures that the material was for adults only and notified users that they would be connected to a telephone number in Moldova. He said that his clients shut down the sites before the F.T.C. action and noted that there were no regulations to govern behavior on the Internet.
"One learns as one goes," Mr. Dichter said.
He also denied that his clients had a kickback arrangement with the Moldovan phone company, as the F.T.C. alleged. And he insisted that they "are not pornographers."
The three Internet sites were described in accompanying promotional material as providing "All Nude All Free pictures" with no membership fees or credit card charges, according to the F.T.C. complaint.
AT&T, which has a contractual arrangement to handle all calls from the United States to Moldova, was alerted to the operation in December when it noticed it was billing United States customers for thousands of calls to the same numbers in Moldova.
Richard Petillo, AT&T's security manager, said the alleged fraud operated from mid-December through early February and affected Internet users from as far away as New Zealand.
He said that AT&T was trying to recover some charges from the Moldovan telephone company and from the operators of the Web sites.
But he said that customers were liable for the charges, even if they were not aware that they were incurring them.
"Ultimately we expect all consumers to pay their bills to keep their accounts current," the phone company official said.

HEADLINE: CHINA AFTER DENG;
Deng Xiaoping: A Political Wizard Who Put China on the Capitalist Road

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

 BODY:
Like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai before him, Deng Xiaoping was among the small group of revolutionary elders who fought as guerrillas for the Communist cause and then dominated the leadership of the People's Republic they proclaimed on Oct. 1, 1949.
Few if any figures in this century matched Mr. Deng for political longevity. 
 Nearly half a century has passed since Mao first installed Mr. Deng in the upper-reaches of power in China, making him general secretary of the world's largest Communist Party in 1954.
Twice he was to be dragged down from those heights -- purged as a "capitalist roader" in 1967 during the Cultural Revolution and again -- after a remarkable comeback -- following the death of Mao in 1976.
Only with his second resurrection did Mr. Deng begin to consolidate his power, becoming China's paramount leader in 1978. He was then 74, seemingly too old to be anything but a transitional figure. Instead, he reigned for a generation.
Even after his formal retirement in 1989, Mr. Deng remained an all-powerful patriarch, ordering a purge of the military leadership in 1992 and rescuing his economic reform program from a conservative backlash. As his health slipped precipitously -- his last public appearance was during the Lunar New Year festivities in early 1994 -- he seemed further removed from daily decision-making. But still he was consulted to resolve major policy and personnel issues.
In the 18 years since he became China's undisputed leader, Mr. Deng nourished an economic boom that radically improved the lives of China's 1.2 billion citizens. By early in the next decade, the reforms Mr. Deng ignited may well propel China's economy to the position of third largest, after the United States and Japan, but China's prosperity will be diluted by the increasing number of Chinese. Nearly 270 million will not have jobs at the turn of the century.
At the end of his life, Mr. Deng seemed unable to chart a clear path to economic success his economic reforms still faced daunting challenges. China's rise as a great economic power was becoming a race against time as population growth and incomplete reform were adding to the siege of China's straining foundations. Shortages of water and arable land mounted, and unchecked industrial pollution contributed to an overall degradation of the environmental landscape.
Still, in cities and in villages, real incomes more than doubled in the Deng era. Most Chinese who have watched a television or used a washing machine or dialed a telephone have done so only since Mr. Deng came to power. The struggle to survive in the Chinese countryside has greatly eased.
A former American Ambassador to China, J. Stapleton Roy, who as a young man in Nanjing witnessed the Communist takeover in 1949, said once in an interview, "If you look at the 150 years of modern China's history since the Opium Wars, then you can't avoid the conclusion that the last 15 years are the best 15 years in China's modern history."
During most of those years, Mr. Deng symbolized the Chinese aspiration to move beyond the ideological extremism that had marked the Maoist era and reclaim for the Chinese a long-denied prosperity.
But in doing so, he also came to symbolize a stubborn and inflexible resistance to democratic stirrings. For Mr. Deng, China's economic reform could only occur under the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party.
China's security forces, often harsh and brutal under Mao, continued to be so under Mr. Deng. China today remains perennially criticized as a nation whose rulers seem to respect human rights only grudgingly.

A Small Figure, A Towering Presence
Mr. Deng's early reputation as a visionary who delivered the Chinese from suffering was blackened most notably by his leading role in ordering the June 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. The tank and machine-gun assault on students and bystanders that came to be known as the Tiananmen massacre diminished his prestige as a world leader and isolated China politically for years afterward.
A generation of students and intellectuals, many of whom had fled the country, held Mr. Deng responsible and scorned his image. But much of the country, particularly the peasantry, seemed grateful to Mr. Deng for providing them with the first prolonged period of peace and stability in this century. If intellectuals could not forgive the brutality at Tiananmen, peasants could not forget that he had ended a long chapter of deprivation.
In foreign policy, Mr. Deng negotiated an end to the last vestige of British colonial power in China with an agreement to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty later this year. Reunification with Taiwan eluded him, but he worked to settle China's border disputes, normalize relations with the United States and repair the 30-year rift with the Soviet Union.
His goal was to focus the totality of national energy on China's economic development. Even the Chinese military had to serve the new national priority by accepting deep budget cuts through the 1980's.
As a leader, Mr. Deng cut a most unusual figure in the Chinese pantheon.
He was emperor-like in a century in which the Chinese overthrew their last emperor after three millenniums of imperial rule. Mr. Deng was first among equals in the small circle of revolutionary elders who survived Mao. The posts and titles Mr. Deng held in the Communist Party hierarchy never quite equaled or conveyed his stature as paramount leader, a term that seemed invented for Mr. Deng, who was still arguably the most powerful citizen of China when he died.
Yet his physical presence offered no clue to his storied abilities to manipulate events "much like a puppeteer," as the political scientist Lucian W. Pye put it. The conventional wisdom was that Mr. Deng was five feet tall but, as one scholar observed, "that was surely an exaggeration."
In an essay in 1993, Professor Pye described an audience with Mr. Deng:
"As he settles into an overstuffed chair, his sandaled feet barely touch the floor, and indeed hang free every time he leans forward to use the spittoon. He has an atrocious Sichuan accent, which makes his words slur together like a gargle. There are few signs of liveliness of mind, of wit or humor, and no sustained, systematic pursuit of ideas."
Xiao Rong, the youngest of Mr. Deng's three daughters, said in a biography of her father: "In the eyes of his children, Father is a man of introverted character and few words. Only with old colleagues and old friends does he like to talk, and carries on in a loud voice."
Henry A. Kissinger, who helped to engineer the normalization of relations with China during the Nixon Administration, once pronounced Mr. Deng a "nasty little man." But others found a certain charm.
When Queen Elizabeth II paid a visit in October 1986, she was warmed by his self-effacing greeting: "Thank you for coming all this way to meet an old Chinese man."
Although he picked his political heirs carefully, Mr. Deng was plagued by the problem of succession. In May 1989 he worried aloud to the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev: "The only thing that can't be brought to pass is the abolition from the system of lifelong positions for leaders."
That same year, Mr. Deng named Jiang Zemin, the current President and Communist Party chief, as the "core" of the "third generation" leadership, after him and Mao. But many Chinese say Mr. Jiang could face trouble managing the party now without Mr. Deng behind him and could be swept aside, much as Mao's nominal successor, Hua Guofeng, was swept aside by Mr. Deng.
Neither intellectual nor poet, Mr. Deng was best known as a pragmatist who focused on the problems of the day, unencumbered by history or ideology. His years as a military strategist and political commissar, balancing real military capabilities against the expectations of politicians, gave him a keen sense of what was possible.
He is best remembered for his simple maxims rather than for coherent policies: To defeat ideological attacks from the Maoists, he often quoted the Maoist dictum, "Seek truth from facts." To emphasize that there was no road map for economic reform, he said the Chinese must "cross the river by feeling out the stones with our feet." His most famous aphorism was an old proverb from his native Sichuan: "It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice."

Fear of Disorder, Grounded in History
In this century China has been a land of warlords, invading armies, floods, famines and revolution. Tens of millions have died violently, or wretchedly from starvation. Mr. Deng's inherent fear of disorder and the violence it has wrought explains his deep opposition to political pluralism.
"If all one billion of us undertake multiparty elections, we will certainly run into a full-scale civil war," he told President Bush in February 1989. "Taking precedence over all China's problems is stability."
There was a time when Mr. Deng appeared briefly to embrace democratic ideals: As he struggled to regain power in 1978, he identified with the goals of the Democracy Wall movement in Beijing. But in early 1979, after he had gained the upper hand politically, he crushed the movement and sent its leader, Wei Jingsheng, to prison for 15 years.
When Mr. Wei, once an electrician at the Beijing Zoo, emerged in September 1993 after serving 14 1/2 years, he was still Mr. Deng's fiercest and most fearless critic, and found himself returned to prison seven months after his release.

The Dark Shadow Of Tiananmen
In 1984, on the 35th anniversary of Communist rule, students at Beijing University hoisted a banner saying, "Hello, Xiaoping!" showing their affection through the familiarity of their greeting. At the outset of 1987, Beijing University students marching for democracy chanted, "Xiaoping, hear our voice!" still hoping that Mr. Deng would embrace their goal.
Instead he turned on them, crushed their movement and sacked the Communist Party general secretary, Hu Yaobang, for encouraging the democratic cause.
The more Mr. Deng resisted political reform, the more he seemed a guardian of a party elite that was doing little to bring corruption under control as China's economy gained speed. The party leaders, including Mr. Deng, were being chauffeured around in black Mercedes sedans. Some of their children became known as the princelings of conspicuous new wealth. And the leaders all seemed oblivious to their hypocrisy as they admonished the masses to guard against "bourgeois liberalization."
The death of Mr. Hu in April 1989 unleashed pro-democracy forces for a third time in Mr. Deng's first decade as leader, but he was no longer a figure of hope.
One Beijing University poster mourning Mr. Hu captured the antipathy toward Mr. Deng. "The Wrong Man Died," it said.
Zhao Ziyang, the party chief tapped by Mr. Deng as a possible successor, showed sympathy for the Tiananmen demonstrators and was removed on the eve of the crackdown. Mr. Zhao's liberal tone in economic reform and political tolerance was buried by new edicts from the hard-line faction led by Prime Minister Li Peng.
In the aftermath of Tiananmen, Mr. Deng and his family took care to disguise his precise role in ordering the tanks and machine-gunners into Beijing, where they killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of demonstrators and bystanders.
Mr. Evans, the former British Ambassador, says in his biography that Mr. Deng was angry when he learned of the bloodshed around Tiananmen and told the President, Yang Shangkun, and Prime Minister Li that they had "bungled the military operation appallingly."
The sensitivity of fixing historic responsibility for the massacre was never lost on Mr. Deng, who understood that after his death, the harsh verdict with which he branded the Tiananmen demonstrators as counterrevolutionaries could be reversed and he could become history's villain.
Mr. Deng's rule brought China nearly to the end of a century that opened with the Qing Dynasty still ensconced in the Forbidden City, the vermilion-walled palace compound at the center of Beijing.
In the eight decades since the last Emperor, Pu Yi, was deposed in 1911, tens of millions of Chinese have died in war, invasion and famine. Mr. Deng grew to manhood in the midst of chaos and became a revolutionary after spending five years in France on a work-study program, where he toiled in filthy factories that paid subsistence wages to Chinese.
His own family members were victims of a violent century: His father, Deng Wenming, was set upon by bandits near his home and killed in 1938.
During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, when Mao sought to tear down the Communist Party leadership, Mr. Deng was branded a public enemy, humiliated in "struggle sessions" and sent to work in a tractor factory. His younger brother, Deng Shuping, was driven to suicide in 1967 after weeks of abuse by Red Guards.
Mr. Deng's eldest son, Deng Pufang, was terrorized on the campus of Beijing University and, according to his sister Xiao Rong, attempted suicide by jumping from a fourth-floor physics laboratory window in September 1968. The fall broke his back and he suffered for months without adequate medical attention; he remains paralyzed.
Deng Xiaoping, like many of the emperors, combined the pursuit of a better life for the Chinese people with a studied ruthlessness to preserve the institution of power.
As a young revolutionary, he exhorted peasants to kill landowners because, he is said to have reasoned, once the masses had blood on their hands, they would be more committed to the Communist cause.
Mr. Deng would later earn a reputation as a pragmatist, but in the late 1950's he was an exponent of political repression and accelerated socialism. After intellectuals responded to Mao's invitation to "let a hundred flowers bloom" -- to express freely their criticisms of the Communist Party -- Mr. Deng helped lead a witch hunt against those who had taken the invitation in full measure.
In 1980, Mr. Deng acknowledged that the Anti-Rightist Campaign had been excessive, but he asserted that the essence of the struggle had been "necessary and correct."
Ever since Emperor Qinshi united China more than 2,200 years ago, the Chinese have looked to an imperial figure to rule them with the "mandate of heaven," a feudal concept that was used to buttress the absolute right of the sovereign, but later evolved under Confucian traditions of benevolence and wisdom.
The Communist revolution that raised the flag of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949, aimed at crushing this past and creating a perfect egalitarian society. But neither Mao nor Mr. Deng seemed able or, indeed, willing to completely bury the imperial tradition.
Mao created a cult of personality so broad and pervasive that he had the whole nation mimicking his style of drab clothing, memorizing his quotations from little red books and living under the gaze of his ubiquitous portraits.
Under Mr. Deng, China broke out of the monochromatic Mao era to life in full color. A walk down Nanjing Road in Shanghai today reveals the new Chinese glitz under the sparkle of a thousand boutique windows. In the throng of new consumers, the hairdos bounce with the latest styles from Hong Kong above leather jackets trimmed in fur.
In contrast to Mao, Mr. Deng was no cultist. Mr. Deng preferred to maneuver on the sidelines, out of the public eye, to exhort policies with occasional pronouncements.
Each time that Mr. Deng was purged from power, he fought his way back. Rehabilitated in 1973 after the worst of the Cultural Revolution, he was purged again as Mao lay on his deathbed in 1976. Denounced as an "unrepentant capitalist-roader," it appeared that the notorious Gang of Four, the radicals led by Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, had defeated him. Mao himself decreed that Mr. Deng should be relieved of all his posts
Mr. Deng lived under house arrest for nearly a year until one of his old military cohorts, Marshal Ye Jian-ying, intervened after Mao's death, insisting that Mr. Deng's voice be heard in the leadership.
The Chinese rejoiced at Mr. Deng's comeback and at the fall of the Gang of Four. To Mao's successor, Hua Guofeng, Mr. Deng pledged his support "with all my heart." But in less than two years, Mr. Deng had rendered Mr. Hua a harmless figurehead and had set about steering China on a new economic course.
As the economy soared, Mr. Deng acknowledged that he was as much a witness to history as he was its architect.
"I am a layman in the field of economics," he said in 1984. "I proposed China's economic policy of opening to the outside world, but as for the details or specifics of how to implement it, I know very little indeed."
Where Mao had preached "Communes are good," Mr. Deng simply preached "Markets are good."
The Chinese did the rest.

From Sichuan Village To French Factories
Deng Xiaoping was born Deng Xixian to a landlord family in the heart of China's most populous province, Sichuan, on Aug. 22, 1904.
The Deng household was the wealthiest in the village of Paifang. Mr. Deng's father, Deng Wenming, controlled about 25 acres of land with an annual output of about 10 tons of grain. When his wife could not bear children, he took a second wife, or concubine, whose family name was Dan. Her dowry in 1901 included the red-lacquered bed in which the future Chinese leader was born three years later.
Mr. Deng was just entering primary school in 1911 when the last Qing Emperor was overthrown by an amalgam of forces led by Sun Yat-sen.
Revolution was gathering throughout China and Mr. Deng would soon be part of it.
By 1919, Mr. Deng's father, joining the nation-building spirit of the times, decided to send his son to France for a work-study program. When Mr. Deng, age 16, and 200 other students boarded a steamer at Shanghai on Sept. 11, 1920, he was never to see his parents again.
Mr. Deng arrived in Marseilles, and found Europe a seething, ideological vortex of the Industrial and Bolshevik revolutions. He was quickly pulled into its currents.
In Paris he befriended the articulate and dashing Zhou Enlai, an "elder brother" to Mr. Deng. By 1922, Mr. Deng had joined the Communist Party of Chinese Youth in Europe.
To escape the French police, Mr. Deng plotted his departure from France in 1926. His route took him to Moscow, where his revolutionary training continued.
During five years in France, Mr. Deng learned few industrial skills that could be transplanted back to China, but he saw the power of Western technology. He seemed unmarked by France's high culture or by its philosophers of democracy and human rights. His daughter Xiao Rong says the reason is that Mr. Deng was part of an under-class in France, exploited as a foreign laborer and persecuted as a Communist.
"What he came in contact with was not democratic," Ms. Deng said.

Political Conversion, And Return to China
 After 11 months of ideological and military training in Moscow, Mr. Deng began taking orders from the Communist International. He returned to China as the chief political adviser to one of the powerful warlords who had carved up northern China.
But the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek was determined to eradicate the Communists. Mr. Deng fled south where he was reunited with Zhou Enlai at Wuhan in 1927. There, Mr. Deng was named secretary to the Communist Party Central Committee. He adopted the name Deng Xiaoping, whose origin he has never publicly explained.
Civil war was raging. Communists were rounded up and executed, particularly in Shanghai, where the party headquarters and Mr. Deng had moved by the end of 1927.
In the chaos, Mr. Deng suffered the first of many personal tragedies when his first wife, Zhang Xiyuan, another young revolutionary whom he had met in Moscow, died after a miscarriage in early 1930. Mr. Deng, a widower at 26, did not attend the funeral, his daughter wrote, because, "Revolution came first."
In 1929, Mr. Deng led his first successful Communist uprising, in southwestern Guangxi province. But his campaign toward Guangzhou proved a disaster. His Seventh Red Army in tatters, Mr. Deng reached Mao Zedong's base in 1931. His loyalty to Mao's vision of the revolution briefly cost him his freedom during the internal party struggles of the early 1930's.
Mr. Deng married Jin Weiying, another party member, in 1932, but when he came under political attack, she left him to marry his chief accuser, Li Weihan.
In October 1933, Chiang Kai-shek marshaled one million men to crush Mao's Communist base in Jiangxi province by building a chain of block houses across the countryside. Thus began in 1934 a yearlong, 6,000-mile retreat known as the Long March. Death from exposure, suffering and frequent attacks thinned the Communist Army from 70,000 to 10,000 as it passed through treacherous and hostile country.
Rehabilitated after his first purge, Mr. Deng set out on the Long March as the editor of Red Star, the party paper. By the time the routed army reached the caves of Yanan in remote Shaanxi province, Mr. Deng had nearly died of typhoid fever. And Mao had reversed his own political fortunes and never again lost his command of the revolution. Mr. Deng was one of his closest lieutenants.
Japan's invasion of China in 1937 provided Mr. Deng and the Communists the opportunity to defend the nation. It was the period of their greatest exploits as they competed with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists for the affection of the masses.
During eight years of war, Communist forces grew from 50,000 to 900,000 in strength and party membership swelled from 40,000 members to 1.2 million. Mr. Deng was appointed top political officer of the 129th Division.
By the time Mr. Deng was in his early 30's, he had traveled extensively and commanded armies in the field, experiences giving him a keen sense of the limits of military power and the importance of political discipline in marshaling it. The battlefield hardships Mr. Deng endured created many lasting bonds with China's top field commanders. These bonds also served his rise in the party and may have saved his life when he was later purged.
Absorbed with his war duties in 1938, Mr. Deng had little time to react when he received word that his father had been murdered by bandits back in Sichuan. He did not return home.
But the next year, during a visit to Yanan, Mr. Deng married for the third and last time. Pu Zhuolin, the daughter of a merchant from Yunnan province, had came to Yanan from Beijing University, where she had studied physics. Mao attended the wedding in September 1939.
Never active in politics, Zhuo Lin, the name she adopted in Yanan, bore five children between 1940 and 1952 and stood by her husband through a series of crises.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Deng's survivors are his five children: the oldest, Deng Lin, an artist who has exhibited her work in New York and Paris; Deng Pufang, the paraplegic son, who for the last decade has worked on behalf of the handicapped in China; a second daughter, Deng Nan, a vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission; the youngest daughter, Xiao Rong, who has served her father as a personal aide since 1989, and the youngest son, Deng Zhifang, who studied physics in the United States before returning in 1988 to enter high-profile business ventures.

Victory in War, And in Revolution
 Victory over the Japanese and then over the Nationalists brought the Communists to power with the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949. Mr. Deng was dispatched to pacify southwest China and Tibet before returning to Beijing in 1952.
Reunited with Zhou Enlai, he served his mentor and the economist Chen Yun on the Economic Commission before taking over the Finance Ministry. But Mr. Deng's administrative skills and wartime connections propelled him upward. He was appointed secretary general of the Central Committee in June 1954 and, by 1956, secretary general of the Communist Party. With Yang Shangkun as his deputy, Mr. Deng virtually controlled the party personnel apparatus, placing thousands of cadres in jobs and building a party network that became the foundation of his power.
Beginning in January 1955, one of his most secret tasks was to help Mao and Zhou create and finance the scientific organization that would build and detonate China's first atomic bomb. With the detonation of a fission bomb weighing 3,410 pounds on Oct. 16, 1964, China became a nuclear power.
Mr. Deng's rise to the top of the party in the 1950's coincided with Mao's growing disaffection with those who would succeed him. When the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev attacked Stalin in a secret speech in 1956, Mao was appalled that his putative heirs seemed to identify with the attack. If Stalin's position was not sacred in Soviet history, Mao reasoned, neither was Mao's in Chinese history.

Great Leap Forward, And Many Setbacks
With a series of internal political campaigns, Mao began assaulting what he perceived as his many enemies. The Anti-Rightist movement of 1957 led into the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The rupture in relations with the Soviet Union soon followed, becoming apparent in 1960 with the abrupt withdrawal of Soviet aid. In July 1963, a final effort was made to patch up the ideological split when Mr. Deng was dispatched to Moscow in what proved to be the last formal contact between leaders of the two Communist parties for 26 years.
In the early stages of the political campaigns, Mr. Deng was the instrument of Mao's revenge, sending thousands of Chinese intellectuals to manual labor camps and prisons.
Mao was not satisfied. He wanted to propel China forward with agricultural communes and steel production. His Great Leap Forward was perhaps the largest policy-induced economic disaster in history. Backyard furnaces turned the peasantry's tools and cookware into useless molten globs. China's harvest rotted in the fields. No one dared tell Mao of the failure; grain exports continued. Then famine struck.
As many as 30 million Chinese died of starvation in the next four years.
The catastrophe seemed to remold Mr. Deng, and he thereafter placed more emphasis on practical measures for economic growth, especially those that contained incentives for China's peasantry to increase individual production.
As Mr. Deng worked more closely with Yang Shangkun and President Liu Shaoqi, Mao began to suspect they were plotting against him. He complained the party leadership was treating him like a "dead ancestor" and he singled out Mr. Deng for making decisions like an "emperor."
Luckily for Mr. Deng, he slipped and broke his leg in 1958, thus avoiding the worst confrontation over Mao's policies at the Lushan conference of 1959.
Mao mounted a withering counterattack and Mr. Deng did not escape for long. Mao unleashed the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to destroy his adversaries in the party. He exhorted the masses to "bombard the party headquarters" and thrust China into the decade of chaos that fostered civil conflict in every school, factory and municipality.
Thousands of young Red Guards were allowed into Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound in central Beijing. They rampaged through the homes of President Liu, Mr. Deng and other leaders. Mr. Deng was branded the "No. 2 capitalist-roader" in the party after President Liu.
Mr. Deng's mordant self-criticism had failed to appease the Red Guards. They continued to attack him as a "capitalist despot."
Mr. Deng's penitence and the patronage of Zhou Enlai may have saved his life, but he was stripped of all offices except his party membership. The Deng family was ordered to the countryside. The children were dispersed. Mr. Deng and his wife were sent to Jiangxi province, where they worked in a tractor factory and gardened.
By the early 1970's, China seemed to be falling apart. Mao's chosen successor, Lin Biao, was discovered plotting a coup and was killed in a plane crash; Mao feared nuclear war was imminent with the Soviet Union; the economy was in chaos, and Prime Minister Zhou had cancer.
After President Nixon's 1972 visit to China, reporters covering a state banquet in April 1973 for the Cambodian leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, were surprised to see a small man in a gray Mao suit, white socks and black oxfords. It was Mr. Deng, recalled a month earlier to help heal the country and perhaps succeed Zhou.
Mao threw Mr. Deng into a Politburo dominated by radicals, and they soon turned on him. When Zhou died in January 1976, thousands of Chinese swarmed into Tiananmen Square to praise Zhou and to express their opposition to the radicals. Mr. Deng was blamed for the revolt and Mao, near death, agreed to purge him for a final time. Mr. Deng was placed under house arrest.
Mao died in September that year, and the Gang of Four was arrested the following month. Mr. Deng pressed to return to his duties and crucial military allies like Marshal Ye Jianying rallied behind him.
Mao's last chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, delayed on releasing Mr. Deng, but Mr. Deng's allies prevailed. Mr. Deng's political comeback gathered momentum through 1977 until December 1978, when he was able to establish himself as the country's paramount leader.

Eye for Strategy, In War and Peace
Mr. Deng moved quickly to get China back on the road to economic modernization.
In agriculture, he allowed the provinces to dismantle communes and collective farms, but the peasants moved even faster, dividing up plots of land for private tilling. Output soared. So did profits.
Mr. Deng told the military that the threat of world war was receding and, therefore, the military would have to serve the civilian economy. Arms production stopped in many factories and military modernization was deferred, except for strategic weapons to maintain China's nuclear deterrent.
Because he had seen what modernization had done for the West, Mr. Deng's strategic vision was broader than Mao's.
He told President Carter in January 1979, "The Chinese need a long period of peace to realize their full modernization." And to American businessmen, he said China needed their money and technology.

HEADLINE: Compaq Takes a Gamble With Its New PC

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Compaq Computer Corporation plans to announce today that it is entering the market for personal computers priced less than $1,000 with a machine based on a new chip produced by the Cyrix Corporation.
While the new machine represents a coup for Cyrix, which has lacked major name brand customers, it also represents a gamble for Compaq in using a chip other than the Intel Corporation's dominant Pentium microprocessor. 
 The Cyrix Media GX chip, which incorporates some multimedia functions in the same chip as the processor, is not a Pentium-equivalent chip. But Cyrix, of Richardson, Tex., contends that it offers similar performance to comparable-speed Pentiums.
"It will be interesting to see if Compaq's name carries the day or if 'Intel Inside' is a must," said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest. "The point is, it's a 486 processor," he said, referring to an older-generation Intel chip. "If it was a 686 from Cyrix or a K-5 from A.M.D. it would probably do O.K.," he said, referring to more powerful chips from Cyrix and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
But because Compaq cannot market it as a Pentium-based or Pentium-equivalent chip, consumers may be less willing to buy the machine, he said.
Steve Tobak, Cyrix's vice president for corporate marketing, said that the chip was not a 486 equivalent, but that it was not exactly a Pentium equivalent either. "It's a unique microprocessor technology," he said. "It's certainly equivalent in performance to a Pentium at equivalent clock speeds using recognized industry benchmarks." Clock speed is a measure of the internal speed of a chip; the Media GX is available in 120-megahertz and 132-megahertz configurations.
What makes the Cyrix processor different is that it integrates sound, graphics and logic functions that Intel places on separate chips, Mr. Tobak said. "We've basically incorporated all of the expensive functions of the motherboard into a single chip and priced it aggressively."
"The technology itself is capable of delivering far more aggressive price points than $1,000, and you can look forward to that in the not-distant future," Mr. Tobak added. "I call it the $500 to $1,000 category."
But for now, the Compaq Presario 2000, at a suggested retail price of $999, is the only announced product using the new chip. Compaq turned to the Cyrix chip because its high degree of integration allowed the company to sell a machine with more features than competitors were offering at the same price, said Sean Burke, director of entry systems for Compaq's consumer group. Compaq, based in Houston, has previously used some Advanced Micro processors in lower-priced products.
"We needed to do something that hadn't been available from our competitors," Mr. Burke said. "It wasn't a status quo effort. You just couldn't get a processor cheap enough that would allow a product that would be sustainable for us and our retailers.
"We are presenting the latest and greatest technology, not close-out stuff," he added. "Just because consumers want an affordable computer doesn't mean they want garbage."
The new machines will be manufactured for Compaq in Austin, Tex., by Taiwan's First International Computer, Mr. Burke said, and they will be in computer and consumer electronics retail stores today.
The Presario 2000 comes with a 132-megahertz microprocessor, a relatively high-resolution 15-inch monitor, 24 megabytes of memory, a 2-gigabyte hard disk drive, a 33.6-baud modem, an 8-speed CD-ROM drive and preloaded software programs.
These features compare favorably with offerings under $1,000 from the Packard Bell Corporation, which has a Pentium-based machine but with an inferior monitor, and AST Research Inc., which has used various non-Pentium chips. Compaq's least expensive Intel-based Presario uses a 150-megahertz Pentium and also includes a number of features not on the Presario 2000. Its suggested retail price is $1,299. 
After establishing full diplomatic relations with Washington on Jan. 1, 1979, Mr. Deng made a whirlwind tour of the United States that was full of extraordinary images, from Mr. Deng kissing the children who sang in Chinese at the Kennedy Center to wearing a white 10-gallon hat in Texas.
Back home, it seemed for a time that Mr. Deng's openness to economic reform would lead him to support significant democratic reforms.
He told party leaders that he endorsed the spirit of China's new democracy movement. "Democracy has to be institutionalized and written into law," he said.
But when Wei Jingsheng and his Democracy Wall colleagues turned their criticism on Mr. Deng, the Chinese leader smashed the movement and persecuted its intellectual leaders. Mr. Deng began to equate democracy with the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. "Our people have just gone through a decade of suffering" and "cannot afford further chaos," he said.
Mr. Deng wanted the energy of the economic reformers, but could not tolerate their political challenge.

The Focus of It All: Economic Change
Of the changes that Mr. Deng oversaw, economic restructuring was central. And the Chinese often did not wait for new policies as they "dove into the sea," the metaphor for going into business.
Farmers began raising fish, shrimp and fruit for new markets that sprang up in every township. Private and collective enterprises multiplied as former peasants began manufacturing toys, fireworks, bricks, clothing -- all manner of everyday items.
The agricultural changes were easily accomplished and the farmers, by any previous standard, were getting rich. The first thing many did was to build a new houses, creating a huge demand in the construction industry.
In industrial reforms, Mr. Deng started cautiously, creating special economic zones in China's coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, where tax subsidies attracted Hong Kong's manufacturing tycoons. Mr. Deng said the coastal provinces could get rich first, but the real strategy was incrementalism because Mr. Deng feared failure and discredit at the hands of the party's Marxist conservatives.
The economic zones ignited an export explosion that continues today, with China dominating the world market in toys, shoes and textiles. The zones multiplied, forming a rimland of coastal wealth, but extending inland only to major cities like Beijing.
Along with the wealth came scourges. Child labor and sweat shops appeared as parents sent their children to work, not to school. Shoddy and unsafe factories became firetraps where thousands died in accidents or fires. Fly-by-night companies produced dangerous or useless products, including one ubiquitous contraption that promised to make people taller.
Criminal gangs, prostitution and the sale of women into bondage spread from rural to urban areas. Old Communist cadres who wiped out narcotics trafficking in the 1950's were repulsed at its return. Heroin and opium were back.
Grafting the success of the coastal provinces onto the larger Chinese economy proved beyond Mr. Deng's capabilities. Today the core of China's economy, the state-owned industrial sector, remains largely unreformed, mired in debt, a slave to party apparatchiks, many of whom are corrupt or incompetent.
Over 18 years, Mr. Deng's attempts to restructure this monolithic sector, the source of the Communist Party's power and revenue, have led to a series of "boom and bust" inflationary cycles that continue today.
Mr. Deng wanted the party to reform the state factories, to make the managers responsible for their profits and losses, and to raise worker productivity.
Bankruptcy, as a concept, entered the Communist lexicon for the first time. But the political consequences of widespread layoffs always prevented Mr. Deng's reformers from acting boldly.
When they did act, there were no macroeconomic levers to adjust the money supply, only blunt instruments of jawboning from Beijing.
When inflation got out of control after the price reform drives of mid-1988, panic buying added to the unrest that sent hundreds of thousands of workers into the streets in support of democracy, but also to protest corruption and mismanagement.
The military crackdown at Tiananmen Square and martial law brought the hard-liners back to pre-eminence in economic policy and Mr. Deng had to go along. After the removal of Zhao Ziyang in 1989, Mr. Deng and the other revolutionary leaders could not agree on who should rule. Their compromise was Jiang Zemin, the Shanghai party boss whose strongest suit was consensus-building.
The economic bubble that had expanded in the late 1980's finally burst, the economy fell in on itself, production ground to a halt in many industries, foreign investors fled and credit dried up.
In November 1989, Mr. Deng announced his retirement from his last formal post, head of the Central Military Commission. But the emphasis in Chinese culture on seniority made it impossible for him to leave politics, or for politics to function without his intervention.
The failed Soviet coup in August 1991 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Communist Party seemed to convince Mr. Deng that the most powerful antidote to such a fate for Chinese Communism would be economic growth. He began to criticize conservatives who obsessed over Western "plots" to topple Communism through "peaceful evolution."
"Say less and do more," he admonished them, trying to return their focus to practical steps to promote economic growth.
The reforms were turning loose forces that eventually would challenge the party, whose ideology had lost its moral sway. Millions of Chinese were turning to religion and Confucianism, seeking a moral structure to replace the void left by the party.
Mr. Deng understood that economic reform and the forces that it unleashed in Chinese society would eventually challenge the Leninist rule of the party.
Thus began a period in which the Communist Party's legitimacy arose from its ability to deliver economic growth and rising incomes.
"In the end, convincing those who do not believe in socialism will depend on our nation's development," Mr. Deng said in late 1991. "If we can reach a comfortable standard of living by the end of this century, then that will wake them up a bit. And in the next century when we, as a socialist country, join the middle ranks of the developed nations, that will help to convince them. Most of these people will genuinely see that they were mistaken."

One Last Battle Against Conservatives
But even as Mr. Deng spoke, the hard-liners in Beijing refused to act and Jiang Zemin was paralyzed by the lack of consensus.
At the beginning of 1992, Mr. Deng was rampant against his old adversaries, principally the hard-line faction led by the conservative patriarch Chen Yun. Mr. Chen and many other elders retired as Mr. Deng dominated the 14th Party Congress, which enshrined a new national goal of creating a "socialist market economy" by 2000.
Mr. Deng also moved against Yang Shangkun and his younger half-brother, Gen. Yang Baibing, who had created a power base in the military that was threatening the post-Deng political order.
But the pace of reform was too fast for Mr. Deng's successors, who craved social stability above all to consolidate their rule. Unemployment, sagging state industries and labor unrest bedeviled the leadership up to the moment of Mr. Deng's death.
And the pro-democracy forces have gradually been suppressed. Instead of charting a clear path, Mr. Deng's successors stumbled politically, seeking concessions from the world on trade and human rights but offering little in return.
A Clinton Administration review of human rights reported that by the end of last year, public dissent had been "effectively silenced," by intimidation, prison or exile.
As long as Mr. Deng drew breath, it seemed that China could cope with its contradictions. But as his health inexorably declined, the Chinese seemed to pause and to wonder about the future.
 An article yesterday about exiled Chinese dissidents' views of Mr. Deng's death misstated the year that the purged reformer Hu Yaobang died. It was 1989, not 1988.

HEADLINE: CHINA AFTER DENG: THE OVERVIEW;
DENG XIAOPING IS DEAD AT 92; ARCHITECT OF MODERN CHINA

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Thursday, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Deng Xiaoping, one of the founding revolutionaries of Communist China and the architect of economic modernizations that transformed the world's most populous nation, died Wednesday night in Beijing. He was 92.
The official New China News Agency reported that Mr. Deng, who for the last 18 years was referred to as the paramount leader, died at 9:08 P.M., Beijing time (8:08 A.M Eastern standard time). He suffered from Parkinson's disease, the agency said, and died from "complications of lung infections." 
 As the sun rose on Beijing this chilly morning, many residents learned the news on radio and television broadcasts before they set off for work and school, and the reaction of those on the street at dawn was restrained and, in some cases, nonchalant. It is part of Mr. Deng's legacy that ordinary people no longer hang on daily reminders of their leaders' every pronouncement.
Mr. Deng leaves behind his designated successor, Jiang Zemin, 70, China's President and general secretary of the Communist Party. He was chosen by Mr. Deng and other senior leaders in late June 1989, in the weeks after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators near Tiananmen Square, one of the darkest episodes of Mr. Deng's legacy, and yet one in keeping with his deep-seated reliance on authoritarian measures.
Early today, Mr. Jiang was quickly named chairman of a funeral committee, made up of 459 leaders of China's Government, evidently formed long in advance of last night's news. No announcement was made about the timing or scope of a funeral.
A wily pragmatist, Mr. Deng led China to economic growth few Chinese had dreamed of, making the country much less prone to unrest than it might have been if Mr. Deng had died a few years earlier.
An unyielding authoritarian, he left behind a Communist Party that still has absolute political authority and crushes all dissent, even though its ideology has lost its legitimacy with most Chinese.
While many Chinese were prepared to some degree for Mr. Deng's death, it still leaves a void.
"I think for the steady development of our nation we can't be without him," said Yang Xiaoping, 39, a hotel attendant who was heading off to work in the early morning hours here. "I am not totally shocked. In earlier years when Mao died, we all thought it impossible, and were shocked, and could not accept it."
Others were divided over the changes Mr. Deng helped unleash.
"In the past everyone was equal, " said Gao Yilun, a 64-year-old retired worker who repairs bicycles by the road. "Now even college graduates can't get a job." But he added, almost reflexively, "It is not for us little people to talk about."
Mr. Deng was the last of a generation of leaders who shared the hardships of forging a revolution, proclaimed the People's Republic of China in 1949, and presided over decades of drastic political upheaval.
The convulsions culminated in the Cultural Revolution, a movement that was initially endorsed by Mr. Deng but then toppled him as one of its chief victims. Only after he survived his political exile and brought the ideas of the market to a China founded on rejecting them did his policies help bring China a measure of prosperity and stability.
A charismatic, chain-smoking man who stood barely 5 feet tall, Mr. Deng was known for a personality as peppery as the cuisine of his native Sichuan province, and was given to punchy political pronouncements, like his well-known maxim for pragmatic economics: "It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice."
Mr. Deng formally retired from his last important post, chairman of China's central military commission, in 1989. Yet he continued to wield immeasurable influence, reserving final say in all important political matters for several years afterward, and finally relinquishing power only as he grew frail and disoriented.
In his final public appearance in February 1994, Mr. Deng was visibly weak, walking only with assistance and badly hard of hearing. Since then, while outsiders speculated about his steadily deteriorating health, Mr. Deng's slow retreat from political power allowed his successors to achieve an almost seamless transition.
Mr. Jiang, first seen as a transitional figure when he was named as Mr. Deng's heir apparent in 1989, has steadily asserted his authority in recent years, consolidating his influence over the military and China's enormous political bureaucracy.
Although Chinese long feared that Mr. Deng's death would leave the country prone to political chaos or even civil war, those worries receded noticeably in recent years. Mr. Deng's gradual disappearance, coupled with steadily growing standards of living, seem to have lulled ordinary people and Beijing's political elite into the belief that China's leadership would proceed without a major change in direction.
Yet the danger of unrest always lurks at times of transition in China. It was the death of a lesser senior leader of China in April 1989, the former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang that unleashed vast demonstrations for a more open and accountable political system, as pro-democracy students used Mr. Hu's memorial services as an opening to air their grievances.
Extraordinary political circumstances -- a gaping split between Mr. Deng and the the party chief at the time, Zhao Ziyang, once Mr. Deng's expected successor -- allowed the demonstrations to swell. The crackdown that left hundreds dead on the streets and tarnished the image of China and Mr. Deng followed on June 4, 1989.
This year, public expressions of grief for Mr. Deng are likely to be closely guarded, and any attempt to organize independent memorial services is likely to be suppressed with force, if necessary.
Mr. Deng's death also comes at a political moment strikingly different from that of September 1976, when Mao Zedong died at the age of 82. At that time, there was a sharp division between political radicals led by Mao's widow, Jiang Qing, and moderates, led by Mr. Deng.
Mr. Deng was not able to seize power right away, though, and Mao was replaced by Hua Guofeng, a middle-of-the-road compromiser, who was eventually edged aside by Mr. Deng in December 1978.
While once analysts thought that the same disorder and jockeying for power that followed Mao's death would occur after Mr. Deng died, Mr. Deng's long illness gave Mr. Jiang time to establish himself.
"The transition has been in place probably for three years," said James Lilley, a former United States Ambassador to China. "Jiang Zemin is a Deng selection."
One of Mr. Deng's great achievements was to open China to the outside world, encouraging young Chinese to study overseas, urging foreign businesses to invest in China, and insuring that China joined the international community.
Mr. Deng oversaw the negotiations that led Britain to agree in 1984 to return its colony of Hong Kong to the sovereignty of China on July 1, 1997, and took many opportunities to proclaim that "one country, two systems" would guide a hands-off approach that would allow Hong Kong to preserve its capitalist economic system.
Mr. Deng often expressed his determination to visit Hong Kong for the handover, when meeting with visiting foreign leaders, some of whom were unsure whether to take him seriously. Not everyone expected him to live until 1997, and his death comes a little more than four months before one of the last colonies is handed back to China, an event that symbolized China's triumph over the humiliations that helped unleash the revolution Mr. Deng helped incite.
Mr. Deng's death comes at the beginning of a year of great political sensitivity in China. The handover of Hong Kong on July 1 will require careful attention of Beijing's leaders, and it will be followed a few months later by the Communist Party's 15th Party Congress.
Hong Kong, in addition to being closely watched for any rolling back of economic and political freedom, is widely seen as a test of Beijing's promises of autonomy, the same assurances it wants to extend to Taiwan some day.
Taiwan is one of the largest looming issues for Mr. Jiang, who brought China to a tense military standoff a year ago when President Lee Teng-hui held Taiwan's first presidential election, and increasingly asserted diplomatic independence, to which Beijing's leaders strongly object.
The Communist Party's congress in October will endorse a political platform and anoint a leader.
China's official appraisal of Mr. Deng, issued by the New China News Agency in the hours after his death was announced, eulogized Mr. Deng in solemn tones.
"The death of Comrade Deng Xiaoping is an immeasurable loss to our Party, our army and the people of various ethnic groups throughout the country, and will certainly cause tremendous grief among the Chinese people," the official obituary said.
"We must conscientiously study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, learn from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's revolutionary style and his scientific attitude and creative spirit in applying a Marxist stand, viewpoints and methods to studying new problems and solving new problems.
"Without Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, there would not be the new situation of reform and opening up in China today, and there would not be the bright future of China's socialist modernization."
The official obituary made no direct mention of the June 4 Tiananmen Square massacre, referring only to "the domestic and international political disturbances in the late 1980's and early 1990's."
The official appraisal did refer to Mr. Deng's trip to southern China in 1992, which was his last major political stand. Facing opposition to his view that China should fuel fast economic growth no matter the risks of inflation and social instability, Mr. Deng toured several cities in southern China and made a key speech in Shenzhen, the fast-growing, modern city that abuts Hong Kong, that became a political touchstone in national policy of fast growth.
That speech, in today's official description "profoundly answered many key questions for understanding, which had been perplexing and binding people's minds for a long time, especially the questions concerning the relationship between socialism and market economy."
Huang Yasheng, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that Mr. Deng's death would have less immediate effect on politics in China than might be expected, precisely because of the change that Mr. Deng helped engineer.
"Deng Xiaoping will mainly be remembered for his economic achievements, but people don't always realize that his enduring contribution also lies in politics," said Mr. Huang. "He restored a sense of normalcy to China. One of the reasons that his death won't make much difference is that power is now shared among leaders and among different institutions. He made sure that the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution would not happen again."
Mr. Deng generally discouraged efforts to create a cult around himself, as his predecessor Mao had done. But then Mao was a man of considerable charisma and megalomania, and Mr. Deng was stronger at organizing and consensus-building.
As Mao remarked about Mr. Deng to Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, in 1957: "Do you see that little man over there? He is very intelligent and has a great future ahead of him."
Only in Mr. Deng's final years did the party authorities start to elevate "Deng Xiaoping Thought" to the level of national catechism.
In 1992, Mr. Deng said boldly that reform "must be insisted on for 100 years." He continued, "Whoever wants to change this will be overthrown."
Mr. Jiang, not known for the kind of political daring that characterized Mr. Deng's long career, nonetheless appropriated Mr. Deng's fast-growth policy and has benefited from it.
"He looks very secure," said Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science at Columbia University, referring to Mr. Jiang. "He has put a lot of his people in power. On the face of it, he is much more secure than Hua Guofeng was, but history says that there is no such thing as secure power in a system like this."
Mr. Hua's name, long forgotten by so many, appeared again today, way down toward the bottom of the list of the 479 members of Mr. Deng's funeral committee, a virtual who's who of China's political elite. Zhao Ziyang, the former party chief who unlike Mr. Hua did not go quietly, was not on the list.
The official appraisal of Mr. Deng concluded in traditional, Communist Party-style language:
"Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the whole party, the whole army and the people of various ethnic groups all over the country, holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, firm and unshakable and full of confidence, will certainly be able to carry out the great cause of socialist reform, opening up and modernization drive pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and triumphantly reach our destination. Eternal Glory to Comrade Deng Xiaoping!"

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Soul of Croatia Is Bared in Its Teeth

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

CAFE EUROPA
Life After Communism
By Slavenka Drakulic
213 pages. W.W. Norton & Company. $21.
 It is a very simple image: a nation of bad teeth. Upon returning home to Croatia, after spending some time in the United States, the Croatian journalist Slavenka Drakulic noticed something she had never noticed before: she looked into the mouths of friends, relatives, acquaintances and neighbors, and she noticed that they all had terrible teeth.
In this image, Ms. Drakulic sees a metaphor for what is wrong with so much of post-Communist Eastern Europe, a metaphor for the failure of people to develop a sense of individual responsibility and seize control of their lives, a failure she believes may ultimately affect these countries' ability to become true working democracies with involved citizens. 
 "Bad teeth are the result of bad dentists and bad food," she writes, "but also of a specific culture of thinking, of not seeing yourself as an individual. What we need here is a revolution of self-perception. Not only will that not come automatically with the new political changes, but I am afraid that it will also take longer than any political or economic developments. We need to accept our responsibilities toward both others and ourselves."
"Cafe Europa," Ms. Drakulic's insightful new collection of essays, is studded with such everyday observations that open out, like windows, to reveal wide-angled historical vistas. The difficulty of buying a new vacuum cleaner becomes a lesson in the absurdities of Croatian bureaucracy and the resignation evinced by Croatian citizens. A glimpse of a young man selling some bananas in an Albanian city prompts a meditation on post-Communist dreams of capitalist riches. And a question about a recipe for Bosnian sarma (minced meat and seasoning wrapped in sauerkraut) turns into a lament for the shattered dream of pluralism, destroyed by the war.
Some of the essays in "Cafe Europa" -- like a piece on Ms. Drakulic's father -- are acutely personal; others -- like a report on what would have been the 75th birthday of the late Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu -- are more reportorial. In all of them, however, the voice is conversational; the tone, impassioned; the point of view, unabashedly subjective. The book not only helps to illuminate the political and social problems facing much of Eastern Europe, but also sheds new light on the daily life of its residents, their emotional habits, fears and dreams.
A central theme -- which will be familiar to readers of Ms. Drakulic's earlier books, "How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed" and "Balkan Express" -- concerns the aftermath of Communism and the challenges of making the transition to democracy. For Ms. Drakulic, it means learning to say "I" instead of "we," to embrace the idea of individual responsibility, be it demanding higher standards of cleanliness in public toilets or protesting arbitrary Government decisions. It also means learning not to live in an eternal present: learning to save money instead of immediately spending it, learning to build consumer trust instead of trying to make a quick buck.
"It is a paradox," she writes, "that what people today miss the most is the security they have lost with the fall of Communism: jobs, pensions, social and medical security, maternity leave, sick leave. As a result, you don't invest, build or save in the name of the future. You just grab what there is today, because it might not be there tomorrow."
Nostalgia for the security of the old Communist days, Ms. Drakulic goes on, also helps explain why some Romanians actually mourn the death of Ceausescu and why royalists in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania have "appeared in growing numbers and with visible aspirations." "One needs to understand," she writes, "that we, the people from the Communist world, are still children in the political sense. We need a daddy, somebody who will look after us, so that we don't have to look after ourselves."
To truly grow up, Ms. Drakulic argues, the people of Eastern Europe must learn to stop treating history as "a washing machine" in which historical guilt can be laundered and absolved. She observes that the new Government of Croatia has begun to erase its Communist past, while re-embracing the 1941-45 period of independence, without coming to terms with the fascist crimes committed during that era. The Square of Victims of Fascism has been renamed the Square of Croatia's Great Men, she reports, and a couple years ago the Commission for the Renaming of Streets even considered changing a square named after Tito to one named after the wartime pro-Nazi leader Ante Pavelic. As Ms. Drakulic puts it: "We are falsifying the past, just as the Communists did when they came to power."
Running throughout "Cafe Europa" are Ms. Drakulic's observations on what she sees as the Eastern European mindset, a mindset shaped by years of Communist rule. She contends that the paucity of smiles among shopkeepers stems from the tendency to see serving other people as an act of humiliation. She argues that the reluctance of consumers to invest in quality products stems from an inability to think about the future in any practical way. And she suggests that the eagerness of taxi drivers and hotel-keepers to rip off tourists with exorbitant rates stems from the desire to make money quickly (to compensate for the deprivations of the Communist years) and the belief that "there must be a trick" to getting rich.
For years, she adds, the residents of Eastern Europe dreamed about the West, dreamed about becoming a part of the Europe that enjoyed freedom and democracy and consumer goods. For Ms. Drakulic, however, the failure of Western Europe to prevent or intervene in the Bosnian war has demonstrated that the dream of Europe is just that: a dream.
"Europe was built by those of us living on the edges," she writes, "because it is only from there that you would have the need to imagine something like 'Europe' to save you from your complexes, insecurities and fears. Because for us, the people from the Balkans, the biggest fear is to be left alone with each other. We have learned better than others what you do to your own brother."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Hints of Growth in Germany Help Push the Dollar Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly yesterday, dragged lower by a slide in United States stocks, signs of economic strength in Europe and more attempts by German central bankers to stem its rise of recent months.
"The dollar's drop is a combination of profit taking along with uncertainty about the future," said Hans Boman, chief spot-currency dealer at Swedbank in New York, alluding to a 92.75-point fall in the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday. "It's difficult to tell what is going to happen from here, and the dollar's flying up and down." 
 A robust January, as reflected in German business activity, as well as solid German money-supply growth bolstered the mark at the dollar's expense. The index of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich rose to 93.3 last month from 90.0 in December, and Germany's M-3 money supply grew by an annualized 11.7 percent.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to its lowest level since Feb. 10 against the Japanese yen, settling at 122.55, nearly two yen below its level of 124.46 late Wednesday. Against the mark, the dollar fell to 1.6840 from 1.6963.
The dollar suffered from another call by the Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, for an end to the dollar's rise against the mark. Mr. Tietmeyer has been trying to slow the dollar's rise all week, currency dealers noted.
The German central bank chief, in a taped interview for Hungarian radio, referred to the dollar's gains as a correction, adding, "We are not interested in a correction process that would go beyond tolerable limits." Mr. Tietmeyer also said that a German interest rate cut was not likely in the short run.
The mark benefited, as well, from a further easing in the British pound's value, after word that the Confederation of British Industry, the nation's employer federation, had cut its economic-growth forecast, citing the pound's strength. In New York, sterling fell to $1.6107 from $1.6161.
The Japanese yen strengthened on speculation, later denied by a Finance Ministry official, that the Government was considering allocating new funds to buy collateralized land formerly owned by troubled Japanese financial companies.

HEADLINE: Amendment To Ban Deficit Is Less Likely

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The prospects dimmed further today for Congressional approval of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget.
Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, one of three Senators whose stance had not been declared, announced at a news conference that he would vote against the measure. 
 As a result of Mr. Johnson's decision, the outcome now rests on two other freshman Democrats, Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana.
Leaders of both parties agree that the number of declared opponents is 33, counting Mr. Johnson. Republican sponsors believe that they have 65 sure supporters, all 55 Republicans and 10 Democrats.
Mr. Torricelli and Ms. Landrieu would both have to vote for the measure to bring the number of supporters to 67, the minimum for the two-thirds majority needed in both houses for a constitutional amendment to be sent to the state legislatures for approval. Both Senators told constituents during the Congressional recess this week that they were undecided about how to vote.
At his news conference in South Dakota and in a statement released by his office here, Mr. Johnson said that he had come to believe that the amendment might jeopardize Social Security benefits and the Government's ability to meet the cost of natural disasters, recessions and other crises.
He voted for an almost identical amendment two years ago when he was in the House of Representatives.
The amendment would require the Federal budget to be balanced two years after three-quarters of the states ratified the measure to make it part of the Constitution, but no earlier than 2002.
Measures like this one have been a central part of Republican doctrine for years, but they have never had two-thirds majorities in both houses. Two years ago, the last time the issue was fully debated, the amendment was approved by the House, but it failed by one vote in the Senate.
Approval in the House this year is also problematic. Last week, the Republican House leadership postponed action on the measure indefinitely, saying it hoped Senate approval would build momentum in the House.

HEADLINE: In America;
Get Real On Food Stamps

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The litany of pointless cruelties in the new welfare law includes a provision that cuts off food stamps after just 90 days in any three-year period for desperately needy men and women between 18 and 50 who are temporarily jobless, are not raising minor children and are not eligible for Federal welfare benefits.
Even Republican governors are recoiling from the harshness of this provision. An analysis of food stamp data for 1995 showed that nearly 60 percent of the people in this category had no income whatsoever during the period in which they received food stamps. 
 The stamps, a blessing, allowed them to purchase about $25 worth of food a week. They would not be able to eat like a President or a member of Congress, but they could have some soup, maybe a little pasta, some tuna, some beans -- whatever. They wouldn't starve, and they would have enough energy to continue looking for a job.
Now comes the Federal Government with all of its might to declare that even this pittance will not be permitted. After 90 days, the following notice is to be disseminated: Put down that soup spoon, poor person, the Clinton Administration and the Republican-led Congress are clearing the table.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has studied this issue, has found that few of the people who will be affected by the time limits remain on food stamps for long periods. Most of them work. But a majority, because of their lack of education and job skills, and in some cases their minor physical or mental impairments, take more than three months to land a new job whenever they find themselves unemployed.
The food stamps help them through these periodic episodes of economic distress.
When the welfare bill was debated in Congress, Republican leaders characterized the food stamp cutoff as a way of goading people to work. Honestly looking for a job -- even enrolling in a rigorous job search program -- would not be enough to avert the cutoff. To continue getting food stamps after three months, an able-bodied recipient would have to work at least 20 hours a week, or participate in a workfare program.
"It is no more complicated than that," said John Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the Budget Committee. "If you cannot get a job, you go to a workfare program -- 45 out of 50 states have a workfare program."
There was a small problem. The Budget Committee chairman didn't know what he was talking about. If he had checked with the Department of Agriculture, which administers the food stamp program, he would have learned that most states do not have workfare programs for food stamp recipients who are not on welfare, and the few that do have such programs operate them, for the most part, on a very small scale.
As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put it: "The data demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of food stamp recipients do not have workfare programs available to them."
So now we have the beginnings of a retreat from yet another gratuitous and mean-spirited attack on the poor. Governors are lining up to secure Federal waivers -- exemptions from the cutoff provision -- for so-called "labor surplus" areas. These are localities in which the average unemployment rate over two years is at least 20 percent higher than the national rate.
Welcome to the real world. The waiver requests are nothing more than an acknowledgment that it can take more than three months for a low-skilled person to find a job.
Republican governors who have requested waivers for extensive areas of their states include George W. Bush of Texas, Mike Foster of Louisiana, Jim Edgar of Illinois, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, David Beasley of South Carolina, Don Sundquist of Tennessee and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.
Gov. George Pataki of New York will announce today that he is seeking a "transitional waiver" that would allow localities that meet the Federal criteria to determine for themselves if they wish to avoid the food stamp cutoff.
Meanwhile, President Clinton, who knew when he signed the welfare bill that this provision was especially egregious, is seeking to have it modified in Congress so that individuals making a good-faith effort to work will not be forced to go hungry simply because they cannot find a job.

Reports of Mild Economic Advances Raise Inflation Jitters

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The release of moderately favorable economic reports by the Government yesterday raised investor concern about inflation, and the prices of Treasury securities dropped for the third day in a row. A decline in the dollar and a selloff in Treasury futures contributed to the steep drop in bonds in the afternoon.
The price of the 30-year bond plunged 31/32 , to 99 23/32 , and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.65 percent, from 6.57 percent on Wednesday. In the last three sessions, bond investors have lost nearly $16.25 for every $1,000. 
 Investors wasted little time selling some of their securities after reports of a smaller-than-expected increase in weekly claims for unemployment benefits and of a small rise in housing starts. Those reports indicated that the economy was still growing at a solid clip, and while inflation remains under control, market participants are aware that the Federal Reserve, in debating interest-rate policy, has shown concern about the strength of the labor market.
In the futures market, where investors buy contracts based on what they think the future value of Treasury securities will be, traders said late selling sent the March bond contract down to a price of 113 before buyers who were looking for value emerged and kept the contract from breaching that key support level.
But the drop in the futures market, along with the slide in the dollar, hurt trading of the current Treasury issue, as the markets seemed to be feeding off each other's weakness.
Last week the number of first-time applicants for unemployment insurance rose by 1,000, to 309,000, according to the Labor Department; that was a much smaller increase than the 14,000 gain that analysts had predicted. Housing starts, meanwhile, increased 2 percent last month to an annual rate of 1.35 million units, which was lower than the 6.1 percent increase that had been expected.
"Over all, the data continue to indicate moderate economic growth and low inflation, a trend we expect to continue well into 1997," Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, said.
But bond investors apparently interpreted those numbers as potentially inflationary, and the market's losses were extended after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported surprising strength in an index of general business conditions.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch, said that while there was a window of opportunity for the bond market to rise this month, "we think the window is closing fast, as we expect upcoming economic data to come in strong."
Mr. Palash said he also expected to see strength next week in the report on orders for durable goods and in two weeks in the report on February employment.
He said bond investors also might be on edge next week waiting for Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to speak before Congress about economic conditions.
In "when issued" trading before next week's Treasury auctions, a two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.86 percent, up from 5.81 percent on Wednesday, while a five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.17 percent, up from 6.10 percent the day before.

HEADLINE: A Telling Birthmark For Businesses;
Researcher Says How C.E.O.'s Act Is Linked To Order in the Family

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
It is a classic management problem. A company is rolling along, unaware that the bumps it is hitting signal the need to change the way it does business. It isn't really broke, the chief executive thinks, so there's no need to fix it. A little tinkering will do the trick.
But as company after company -- from Eastman Kodak to General Motors to I.B.M. -- has shown, that way lies disaster. 
 The mystery is why so few smart, worldly wise chief executives see the need to foment a corporate revolution before disaster hits.
Frank J. Sulloway has a theory: Too many first-born men rule the nation's corporations. First-born children, he thinks, based on 26 years of research, are authoritarian conformists, assiduously interested in preserving the status quo. Later-borns are more adventurous and receptive to innovation.
"Whenever something really drastic is required, it's always more difficult for a first-born to do it," said Mr. Sulloway, a science historian and research scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has amassed a huge data base that he says proves his point statistically. "That means they'll be doing it later than they should."
"Strategy," he said, "is something that later-borns ought to be superior at compared with first-borns, who are in turn more adept at managing than at strategic overhauls."
Mr. Sulloway, who -- no surprise -- is the third of four children, ignited something of his own revolution last fall when he published "Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family Dynamics, and Creative Lives" (Pantheon). In it, he argued that birth order was the most reliable predictor of openness to innovation and social change.
That conclusion was based on Mr. Sulloway's analysis of a data base he built of 6,566 people who participated in 121 political and scientific upheavals, including the French Revolution, the emergence of Darwin's theory of evolution and the Protestant Reformation.
To determine who is most likely, in any era, to challenge the established wisdom, he studied as many as 256 characteristics, like age, religion, class, education and travel experience.
"Birth order was the best predictor," he discovered.
While he has not systematically studied business executives, Mr. Sulloway said the message for companies was clear.
People who select chief executives, he contends, would do well to consider candidates' birth order, among other variables, especially if radical change is required. And he thinks corporate boards probably have too high a proportion of first-borns, too, adding to the chief executive's tendency to delay needed change.
To later-borns who are tired of seeing their older siblings rule so many roosts, meanwhile, Mr. Sulloway's work offers an encouraging note -- if, as some management experts think, the authoritarian management model has had its day.
"If command-and-control management is out, it's great news for later-borns," Mr. Sulloway predicted. "They'll move up in the corporation." And that would be good, he said, because later-borns in general are more agreeable than their eldest siblings, less defensive about errors, less territorial and more sympathetic to underdogs and underlings.
His notion that birth order -- and the ensuing dynamics among parents and children -- shapes personalities, who then shape history, is a variation on previous birth-order research, which some social scientists consider dubious.
Mr. Sulloway offers his own cautions. His research showed that two characteristics other than birth order were nearly as important as predictors of the propensity to rebel: "Age and the social attitude of the family, and hence your own social attitude." Younger people tend to be more open to the new because they have less stake in the established, Mr. Sulloway said, and children tend to draw social attitudes from their parents.
Even so, one key factor can disrupt the pattern, he said -- a bad relationship between a child and his parents. Nor is his analytical framework fail-safe: the behavior of 15 percent of the population defies explanation.
Mr. Sulloway's caveats, however, did not stop the potshots. Writing in The New Republic, Alan Wolfe, a sociology professor at Boston University, credited Mr. Sulloway for "establishing the importance of birth order," but questioned his objectivity and criticized him for relying on the assumption that family dynamics have been stable throughout history. Mr. Wolfe's scorching review branded the book "powerful rhetoric" and "bad science."
In any case, people are buying the 653-page tome. It is in its fourth printing, with 56,000 copies in circulation.
Despite the limits of his research, Mr. Sulloway thinks his work has relevance for spheres he has not studied closely, including business. "I can say a lot about people I don't know personally," he said. His analyses take off from a person's position as a first-born or later-born but go deeper into family dynamics, considering variables like sex, the number and sex of siblings and the age spacing between them.
At the recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the panel Mr. Sulloway led on his work was standing room only, packed with believers and skeptics alike. Lester Thurow, the M.I.T. economist and former dean of its Sloan School of Management, was on the panel. "It's all very fascinating," Mr. Thurow said later, "and, like 'survival of the fittest,' on some level it just seems right. But there are always exceptions, so it's too conditional. You can't use it to make decisions."
Besides, Mr. Thurow pointed out, just because later-borns tend to rebel does not mean that they discriminate between good and bad revolutions.
Until the forum meeting, Mr. Sulloway's work had hardly registered in the business world. He has not heard from any corporations. "I'm quite surprised, because of the implications of the book regarding the adaptability to change," he said.
But that itself may change. Nan-b de Gaspe Beaubien, president of the Institute for Family Enterprise in Canada, is exploring additional research with Mr. Sulloway. John O'Neil, another forum panelist who is president of the Center for Leadership Renewal, a consulting and training firm in San Francisco, said he would help Mr. Sulloway determine whether his work could have practical use in corporations.
Meantime, between media interviews, Mr. Sulloway is starting on the task unsystematically, mainly in response to inquiries. At the request of The New York Times, he examined biographical material and news reports about three executives -- Louis V. Gerstner, the chairman of I.B.M.; Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner Inc., and Albert J. Dunlap, the chairman of the Sunbeam Corporation.
Fittingly, Mr. Gerstner, the second of four sons, has overseen dramatic changes at both RJR Nabisco and I.B.M. Both involved cultural revolutions, but with distinctly different characters. At RJR, he reined in a free-wheeling corporate culture and managed to pay down a stupendous debt load without selling many assets. At I.B.M., he freed a stodgy bureaucracy.
The contrast showed his adaptability, Mr. Sulloway said, a trait of later-borns that pops up many times in Mr. Gerstner's career. The linchpin of Mr. Gerstner's prescription for I.B.M. -- customer focus -- is a distinct turnaround from I.B.M.'s recent past and equally telling. "By making an effort to learn about his customers' needs, rather than dictating to them from a position of technological superiority, he emphasized the later-born's ability to identify with their peers," Mr. Sulloway said. "Later-borns like to get out there -- to find out what employees think and what customers think."
Mr. Levin, the third of three children, also fits the mold. "Typical of later-borns, he is soft-spoken -- an ordinary guy with a relative absence of charisma," Mr. Sulloway said. "He combines an easygoing personal style with surprising tenacity and a marked penchant for risk-taking." Some recent evidence: Time Warner's purchase of the Turner Broadcasting Company, even while Mr. Levin struggles to get Time Warner's existing fiefs to act as one company.
Also predictable for a later-born, Mr. Sulloway said, is Mr. Levin's record as a contrarian, a man of ideas and strategy. Those traits came to light in the mid-1970's, when he put Home Box Office on satellite, a breakthrough at the time. More recently, it is reflected in his commitment to cable television, no matter the potential for near-term losses and pressures to sell cable properties to pay down the company's gargantuan debt.
Mr. Dunlap is a more complicated case. Renowned for his ambition, aggression and arrogance, Mr. Dunlap in many ways epitomizes a first-born, which he is. In masterminding his corporate restructurings, most recently at Scott Paper and Sunbeam, he has decimated the work force. Proud of being tough-minded -- he called his book "Mean Business" -- he makes huge demands on minions.
But he is also an iconoclast, caring little about the established order, which seems out of step with his family position.
Mr. Sulloway is quick to explain. "In many ways, Mr. Dunlap's brash temperament -- which is extreme even for a first-born -- makes him something of a nonconformist, one who cares little for corporate authority precisely because he is so taken with himself," Mr. Sulloway said. "If Dunlap is a rebel, it is out of arrogance rather than empathy for the underdog, and hence a result of love of domination rather than a liberating resentment against it." He chalks up Mr. Dunlap's behavior to his troubled relationship with his family, which has been widely chronicled.
Despite its ring of generalization or pop psychology, detailed birth-order analyses could help boards choose chief executives, once they have blocked out the characteristics needed to do the job, Mr. Sulloway suggests. And board nominating committees, too, might do well to include people who vary by birth order, not just industry background and expertise, he said.
The idea is not so crazy. "When I interview candidates, I ask questions that get at their early background, including the number of their brothers and sisters," said Michael A. Wellman, managing director of the New York office of Korn/Ferry International, an executive recruitment firm. "It's another part of the subjective information we use to get a handle on them." However, he said it, like body language, was less important than things like industry knowledge, experience, management style and reputation.
Mr. O'Neil, the leadership consultant, has a less grand view of how Mr. Sulloway's research may help.
"Family is a place where a lot of people get stuck," he said. "We get stuck with family stories, and they get embedded in our behavior. Sometimes that can hurt us. This may help us think through how we view our roles and how we write our next chapters."

Photo Chart: "Born to Be Wild?"
In "Born to Rebel,' Frank J. Sulloway, an M.I.T. research scholar, argues that later-born children are more innovative and adventurous than first-borns. Though his stucdies have focused on political and scientific revolutions, Mr. Sulloway thinks the hypothesis say he makes too many generalizations to support his premise.

HEADLINE: Friend and Foe in Korea

 BODY:
It is worrisome when American diplomats complain that dealing with South Korea, a traditional ally, has grown more frustrating than dealing with North Korea, a dangerous and unpredictable foe. Such complaints are not meant literally. But only North Korea can profit from the tensions Seoul has recently been introducing into its relations with the United States. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to South Korea this weekend provides a timely opportunity to set matters straight.
It now looks as if Seoul's on-again, off-again cooperation with Washington will survive the latest crisis in the peninsula, which was set off by last week's defection of a high-level North Korean official to the South Korean Embassy in Beijing. With North Korea apparently heeding Chinese advice to tone down its threatening rhetoric over this humiliating incident, the South has decided to continue its recently resumed participation in American-sponsored nuclear conversion and famine relief efforts. On Thursday, Seoul promised a new installment of food aid through the United Nations. 
 But South Korean officials have seized upon the incident to question, yet again, the premise that the safest way to deal with North Korea is to encourage a modicum of stability and greater interchange between the North and the outside world. Instead some southern policy makers seem to prefer pushing the wobbly northern regime toward total breakdown, a course filled with danger. A sudden collapse of North Korea could be accompanied by a huge outpouring of desperate refugees and military adventurism, including possible attacks against the 37,000 American troops based in South Korea.
To guard against such an eventuality, Washington has designed a prudent policy that combines military preparedness with efforts to reach out to the North diplomatically and economically. Those efforts include a program designed to replace the North's current nuclear power reactors, whose byproducts can potentially be diverted to bomb-making, with a safer design, along with offers of famine relief and efforts to negotiate a formal peace treaty ending the Korean War.
Unfortunately, South Korea, which claims to support Washington's approach, has often thwarted its application. Seoul has repeatedly suspended its participation in the nuclear, anti-famine and diplomatic efforts to protest northern actions it characterizes as intolerable provocations. Washington suspects that the South has been deliberately inflaming North-South relations for domestic political ends, fanning manageable incidents into major crises to distract attention from the financial scandals and political problems afflicting the Seoul Government.
Ms. Albright arrives in Seoul tomorrow at a time when increasing signs of instability in the North make it vital and urgent for the United States and South Korea to coordinate their policies closely. In previous stops of this, her first foreign journey as Secretary of State, she has been admirably straightforward about raising sensitive diplomatic issues. She should make clear to her South Korean hosts that Washington now expects them to keep domestic political concerns from disrupting the only realistic approach to the northern danger.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Inched Up 2% For January

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Construction starts on homes and apartments rose 2 percent last month, the Commerce Department said today, a smaller-than-expected increase that could signal that the real estate market is cooling after its strongest year in two decades.
Housing starts rose in the West, partly reflecting a recovery from December's harsh weather. They increased in the Northeast but declined in the South and the Midwest. 
 Analysts had expected the January report to show an increase of 6.1 percent. The 2 percent increase brought the annual rate of housing starts to nearly 1.4 million units.
In December, starts had declined sharply, although the Commerce Department today revised the data to show a slightly smaller decrease, of 11 percent instead of the 12.2 percent reported originally.
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the number of American workers applying for state unemployment benefits edged up last week, rising by 1,000, which was lower than expected, to a seasonally adjusted 309,000. The four-week moving average of claims, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, fell to 318,250, from 325,500 the previous week, the lowest level since Aug. 17.
The report was another indication of labor market strength. Some economists and participants in the financial markets have expressed concern that robust job creation may accelerate inflation.
"We will have to watch claims in the coming weeks to see if this is one of the first signs of overheating in the labor market," Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc., said.
Taken together, said Arthur Qua, an analyst at Daiwa Securities America Inc., today's figures on the labor and housing markets showed "the economy is still growing at a pretty good pace, though inflation remains under control."
As for the housing report, some analysts warned against trying to glean much insight from the January data, which tend to be more volatile than those of other months because of winter weather and the start of the year. "It's hard to give the data much credibility," Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates, an investment firm in St. Petersburg, Fla., said.
Looking at the year as a whole, Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said that "we expect housing to be a drag." She added, "It'll be hard to best '96," when sales of new single-family homes were the strongest since 1978.
 Nevertheless, builders are increasingly optimistic, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders. The trade group's housing market index gained 2 points in February, rising to 54 from 52 the month before and higher than the readings in December and November, meaning the number of positive responses from builders slightly exceeds negative responses.
Today's Commerce Department report showed that permits for new housing construction, a gauge of future building activity, fell 1.9 percent in January to an annual rate of nearly 1.4 million units after having increased three-tenths of 1 percent in December.
Housing starts totaled 1.35 million. By category, starts of single-family homes increased 10.2 percent in January while those of multifamily homes fell 23.9 percent.
Starts rose 29.9 percent in the West, to 344,000 units, and 22.2 percent in the Northeast, to 165,000 units, the highest level since November 1994. They declined 13.2 percent in the Midwest, to 256,000 units, the lowest in two years, and 6.8 percent in the South, to 585,000 units.
After exceeding 8 percent last year, the average rate on a 30-year fixed loan has settled down. It averaged 7.82 percent in January, compared with 7.60 percent in December, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News. That put the average principal and interest payment on a $100,000 loan at $721.26 last month. Those figures do not include tax, fire insurance or escrow costs.
Last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 7.65 percent from 7.74 percent.

HEADLINE: Those Who Left Recall Deng With Gratitude

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
When Sue Ann Jung's family left China 18 years ago, they were among the first to benefit directly from the open-door policies of Deng Xiaoping after he consolidated his power in 1978. So yesterday, a day after Mr. Deng's long-anticipated death, Ms. Jung, 30, recalled what her parents used to tell her as she grew up in New York City.
"I remember what my mom said: 'Only because of Deng we could leave China,' " said Ms. Jung, a manager of the Eighth Avenue Auto Store in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. "We thank him. He did a lot over the years he was ruling." 
 But she added: "You know, that thing, Tiananmen Square. They were wrong. They went too fast."
Her thoughts were echoed yesterday throughout the city's Chinese communities, some of which were created or have prospered as a direct result of Mr. Deng's policies. From Manhattan's Chinatown to Flushing in Queens, to Sunset Park in Brooklyn, many acknowledged that while they abhorred the Tiananmen crackdown, they credited Deng with bringing China into the 20th century.
The similar reaction among those from China -- from the elite students who left after Tiananmen in 1989 to those eking out a living in sweatshops and restaurants -- perhaps reflected something fundamental that the immigrants have in common: many of them owe their presence in this country to Mr. Deng, either directly because of his policies or indirectly because of the conditions his policies created in China.
Had it not been for Deng, New York City might not have the booming Chinese communities that have fueled the economic growth of several areas of the city. Historically, Hong Kong and Taiwan were the source of New York's Chinese immigrants. But between 1990 and 1994, mainland China accounted for 79 percent of the Chinese immigrants to New York City, according to the Department of City Planning.
Many students who left China after the crackdown in Tiananmen, which Mr. Deng is said to have ordered, have settled in northeast Queens, said Paul Lo, a Taiwanese real estate agent and the owner of A. O. Realty in Queens. After saving money, many have begun buying houses in the area because it has the highest-ranking public schools in the city, he said.
A banker in his late 20's, who bought a house in the area but works in Manhattan, said he left China two months after the killings at Tiananmen to pursue graduate studies in the United States. He said yesterday that he learned of Mr. Deng's death while listening to National Public Radio on Wednesday afternoon.
"When I was in China, he actually opened the door to the outside world," said the banker, who asked that his name not be used because he still has relatives in China. "Without Deng, I don't know what China would be economically."
But he said that Tiananmen was a blot on the leader's career. "That was a big mistake he made, to use force to crack down. I really like the system here -- the Congress, the President.
"There is no such thing as a paramount leader," he added, using Deng's title toward the end of his career.
In 1979, only a few years after President Richard M. Nixon and Mao established relations between the United States and China, Mr. Deng started sending students to this country. Many, like Zai Liang, now a sociology professor at Queens College, chose to stay.
"Clearly, the educated group, without Deng, would not have come here," Mr. Liang said. "The other group, it's very hard to say."
Mr. Liang was referring to the recent waves of poor, uneducated Chinese, many from the province of Fujian, who have come to New York in recent years, some illegally. It is not completely clear what drew them to the United States, Mr. Liang said, but one factor may be Mr. Deng's economic reforms, which have made many rich but driven out others to seek their fortune outside China. The rising cascade of such immigrants has given birth to new Chinatowns in Sunset Park and another Brooklyn neighborhood, Homecrest.
In Sunset Park yesterday afternoon, in three-story brick buildings along Eighth Avenue between 51st and 60th Streets, many Chinese immigrants could be seen reading about Mr. Deng's death in Chinese-language newspapers, or talking to one another in restaurants, fish stores and green grocers.
"Deng was a good guy," said Jimmy Hu, a salesman at Lee's Furniture Store. "I came here 15 years ago when I was 30. I've no interest in going back to China. My family is here. Why would I want to go there? Deng was a nice guy. China is very good."
Xi Bo Chen, 81, who said he was a farmer in China, merely laughed when he was asked what he thought of Mr. Deng's legacy. But he volunteered, "Can't go back." Because Mr. Deng had left the political spotlight a few years ago and groomed a successor, Jiang Zemin, Mr. Liang, like others interviewed yesterday, said they were optimistic about China's future.
"I wasn't particularly upset by the news because China is not going to change so much, in my opinion, because the structure is there," Mr. Liang said. "Deng's death will make China's political reforms a little bit easier."

HEADLINE: 'Bit Actor' to Star in a New Role: Mr. Chairman

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
As the senator for sale in the 1993 film remake of the Broadway classic, "Born Yesterday," Fred Dalton Thompson warned an influence-peddling tycoon, "You are making a terrible mistake treating me this way."
Now, as an authentic Republican senator from Tennessee, the lawyer turned lobbyist turned actor turned politician may get to deliver the same sort of line for real. 
 As the new chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Thompson has the White House on the defensive as he prepares for what could become the most expensive investigation in Congressional history: an inquiry into fund-raising illegalities in the 1996 Presidential campaign and beyond.
But even before Mr. Thompson appears front-and-center on national television when the hearings begin, he is embroiled in a political fight in which even the support of some in his own party is suspect. And although he says, "I don't think people are treating me badly," he does not seem to like it one bit.
The man who has promised to be fair to both parties in uncovering the seamiest side of American politics and who has seduced the media with his powerful presence and melt-in-your mouth charm has been attacked by Democrats for wanting too much money, too long an investigation and too much focus on President Clinton's fund raising.
Even some Republicans are grumbling that Mr. Thompson's $6.5 million budget request is too high and that his accommodation to Democrats' demands to include possible transgressions by Republicans is taking things, well, a bit too far.
"I'm concerned about the direction this is going in," Mr. Thompson said in a conversation in the Capitol. "Maybe we've just gotten off to a little rocky start and things will settle down."
But with all the hype and the hand wringing over the still-unscheduled hearings, the man who once dressed up as Superman in the movie "Barbarians at the Gate" understands just how fickle his audiences can be.
"You know how it is in this country, and especially in this town," Mr. Thompson said. "There are tremendous quick buildups and tremendous quick takedowns. There are going to be good days and bad days. There are going to be missteps and mistakes and misquotes. There's nothing you can do about it, so you might as well relax and not enjoy it."
Of the Republicans who are not keen to see their own campaign finances investigated, the Senator said, "There are some, I'd say a few, who are very concerned and who are not bashful about making their concerns known."
 
Political Savvy And Determination
Mr. Thompson's fans describe the 6-foot, 6-inch, 240-pound Senator as a larger-than-life good ol' boy whose ribs-and-cornbread vernacular masks political savvy and a determination to forge a serious overhaul of campaign spending laws if the investigation succeeds.
"He's tough, straightforward, methodical," said Howard H. Baker Jr., the godfather of Tennessee Republicans who first brought Mr. Thompson to Washington in 1973 as the minority counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee. "The last thing on earth he is is naive."
But Mr. Baker concedes that Senator Thompson might be getting a bit too independent for his own good.
"He's way out on a limb," Mr. Baker said of his protege. "I've had some passing experience with that. There were times when I walked through the cloakroom and people would barely speak to me."
Mr. Thompson's political foes consider him a partisan grandstander who votes with the conservative wing of his party most of the time, who spent years in Washington as a well-connected lawyer and lobbyist for the teamsters union pension fund and companies like Westinghouse and Toyota and who may use the investigation as a springboard for a Presidential bid.
Democrats also may try to exploit the fact that he has been a very successful fund-raiser, raising large amounts of money from tobacco, pharmaceutical and chemical interests.
"If there's one thing I've learned since coming to Congress, it's never to make assumptions about the good ol' boys," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat. "I have a great respect for the Senator, but the soft approach and the easy talk is designed to put you at rest before the attack begins."
Although Mr. Thompson has not said it directly, he is determined to avoid the fate of his Republican colleague from New York, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who saw his poll ratings plunge after his acerbic, partisan questioning of witnesses in last year's Whitewater hearings.
"There's simply no reason to assume at this stage of the game that I am going to be dumb enough to carry on a set of hearings that are going to degenerate into rank partisanship or unfairness," Mr. Thompson said at a recent hearing of the Rules and Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over his budget.
 
Making Clinton The Top Priority
Despite the Senator's nonpartisan patina, patches of partisanship show through.
Shortly before the President gave the first news conference of his second term last month, Mr. Thompson upstaged him with a much-advertised speech on the Senate floor about the investigation, forcing Mr. Clinton a few hours later to answer questions about Mr. Thompson's remarks.
At one point in his speech, when Mr. Thompson was discussing President Richard M. Nixon's fight for executive privilege in the Watergate scandal, he slipped -- inadvertently or not -- and said "Clinton" when he should have said "Nixon."
Mr. Thompson has made clear that his top priority is uncovering possible wrongdoing by Mr. Clinton, not the Republicans.
"I make no apologies for listing that first," he said at a meeting of the Governmental Affairs Committee last month. "If we have a murder and a jaywalking, we maybe ought to look at the murder."
Mr. Thompson arrived at his initial budget request of $6.5 million for the investigation without consulting a number of powerful Republicans, including Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee.
Mr. Warner declined to discuss the matter, and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, smoothed over Mr. Warner's displeasure, saying only, "It's a much larger request than what John Warner has seen in the past."
Even when adjusted for inflation, the Watergate inquiry cost $6.9 million, Whitewater $1.8 million.
 
Mixing Praise With Caution
While praising Mr. Thompson, a 54-year-old onetime prosecutor, some Republicans also note his relatively junior status.
"I haven't heard anyone suggest he step aside and a more senior figure or a better prosecutor take over," said Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana. "There is confidence he's a good man. But that doesn't mean the Republicans are going to give him carte blanche."
And Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said, "I don't think either side has done the necessary things to determine how long it's going to take, how many witnesses will be called and what we are going to look for."
Undaunted, Mr. Thompson has not backed down from his agenda.
"I will not relent," he vowed when a handful of Democrats asked him at a Rules Committee hearing earlier this month to accept a more modest initial budget of $1.8 million and a one-year deadline.
 
Dueling Images: Lawyer or Farmer?
After Watergate, Mr. Thompson once said about Washington, "I never wanted to go there again." But that was before he decided to move here to set up shop as a lawyer with a heavy lobbying practice.
Still, in his 1994 campaign for Vice President Al Gore's Senate seat, Mr. Thompson had no problem casting aside his late-model Lincoln and his lawyer suits, leasing a red pickup truck and donning jeans, work shirts, cowboy boots and a belt with a silver buckle the size of a salad plate.
His opponent, former Representative Jim Cooper, portrayed him as a "a Gucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey-Poupon-spreading millionaire Washington special-interest lobbyist." But it did not stick. Mr. Thompson won with 60 percent of the vote, and was re-elected last year with 61 percent.
"I still am who I was," he said when asked about doubts about his authenticity. "It's not incongruous for me to be comfortable with a tobacco farmer or a diplomat."
Mr. Thompson will also be well-served in the hearings by his experience in the movies, in which he has played all sorts of authority figures, including an F.B.I. agent, a White House chief of staff, a university president, a Navy admiral and, not surprisingly, a lawyer.
The only time he played the President was opposite Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, during his preparation for the debates with Mr. Clinton last year.
Mr. Thompson calls himself "a bit actor" who took a few weeks off from his law-and-lobbying practice to do something that was fun. "It's like hundreds of thousands of average people who once a month go out to their community theater and get up on stage and play a little part," he said. "I got to do it, you know, with Paul Newman."
 
The Successor To Ronald Reagan?
As for the future, Mr. Thompson, whose Senate victory celebration in Tennessee last November was filled with "Fred for Prez" signs, has not discouraged speculation about a bid for the Presidency. He is even mentioned as the logical successor to another former actor-turned politician: Ronald Reagan.
"It's interesting that someone just having gotten re-elected after a Presidential campaign is immediately called upon to forswear forever that he would never run for President or denounce his candidacy," he said. "I'm not thinking about it and I'm not talking about it."
A divorced father of three grown children and the grandfather of five, Mr. Thompson has been romantically linked to a number of women, but keeps his personal life to himself. When asked who sent a dozen long-stemmed roses to his office on Valentine's Day, he demurred.
"Why, it was Tom Daschle!" he joked, referring to the South Dakota Democrat and Senate minority leader who is fighting to limit the budget and duration of the investigation. "Now wasn't that a nice surprise?"

HEADLINE: World Bank Chief Asks Slimmer Staffs and Better Lending

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, has proposed a sweeping reorganization costing up to $400 million that is intended to shake up the institution's vast bureaucracy and improve its performance in promoting the economic development of poor nations, bank officials said today.
Mr. Wolfensohn has been goading the bank's staff to become more nimble and aggressive since he took over 20 months ago after a lucrative career on Wall Street, saying that the bank cannot tolerate its current failure rate of one-third of its lending programs. 
 After months of study and debate, Mr. Wolfensohn laid out a detailed program to the bank's board last week for accomplishing that change. Officials said he had told the board and top managers that the World Bank would need to show improved results or risk an irreversible loss of public support, not least in the United States, where foreign-aid programs have come increasingly under attack in Congress for both ideological and fiscal reasons.
World Bank officials said the plan was an attempt by Mr. Wolfensohn to put his stamp on an institution that had resisted change in the past. And they said that while it primarily involved changes involving the bank's 10,100-member bureaucracy, the intent was to signal a more fundamental shift in the approach to development.
"We are not satisfied that we are getting maximum development impact from our projects," a briefing paper circulated among the bank's managers said. "Demand for our lending is flat. There are complaints about our slowness and bureaucracy. There has been under-investment in our staff and technical expertise, and we have not been active enough in building partnerships."
The World Bank's board, made up of representatives from member nations, is to discuss the proposals at a meeting next month. Although officials anticipate eventual board approval, they said they expected some opposition to Mr. Wolfensohn's call for as much as $400 million in increased spending over the next two years.
The funds would come from the bank's operating profit, and while officials said it would not require any cutback in lending, they said it could restrict the bank's ability to take on additional unplanned programs like the current effort to rebuild Bosnia.
Clinton Administration officials said they had not yet decided whether to support the plan. Last year, Congress cut the Administration's request for World Bank funds, leading the United States to pay only $700 million of the $934.5 million it had pledged to the bank's division that makes loans to the poorest countries.
Mr. Wolfensohn's plan would shift some of the $1.1 billion annual operating budget away from legal, financial and other back-office and support divisions to the institution's front-line lending and development programs.
In addition to the internal shift, amounting to $170 million over the next two years, the plan calls for $125 million in new spending in each of the next two years to spur what Mr. Wolfensohn views as his primary goal: nudging the bank away from a traditional emphasis on the construction of power plants, bridges, roads and the like, a role being increasingly played by private companies and investors.
Instead, Mr. Wolfensohn wants to focus more on jobs that private industry does not take on, or that will help attract investment, including establishing banking systems and social welfare, health and education programs. At the same time, he wants the bank to encourage more private investment and to engage in more partnerships with investors.
Much of the additional $250 million in spending the next two years would go to hiring people with skill in those areas, officials said. The bank would also invest in improving its technology to make it easier for experts working in various countries to share information and advice.
The plan calls for spending a further $100 million to $150 million over the next two years to pay the costs of laying off as many as 700 people from those sections of the bank that will face budget cuts.
After the two-year period of increased spending, the bank's budget would drop again, to slightly above its current $1.1 billion level, adjusted for inflation.
The World Bank -- by far the largest of the international development agencies -- has a long history of reorganizations and new strategies, four in the last decade. These, however, have done little to address the risk of its becoming inconsequential in a world where private investment in developing nations dwarfs the $13 billion it lends each year.
Mr. Wolfensohn has attacked the bureaucracy and the institution's approach more directly than his predecessors, generating unease within the bank along with support for his efforts.
Internal studies in recent years have found that about two-thirds of its lending programs to developing nations meet the bank's standards for success. Those include not just repayment of the loan, but a continued economic benefit to the nation from the project without adverse environmental or social consequences.
Environmental and other development groups have complained that the bank puts too much money into building hydroelectric dams and other big projects that poor nations cannot afford to maintain or operate for long.
But economists say that a two-thirds success rate is not terribly low -- and is probably higher than that of any other international development institution, given the risks of operating in developing countries with little money or technical expertise and often substantial corruption.
Mr. Wolfensohn has often spoken of raising the bank's success rate to around 75 percent, suggesting that would be a level that balances the need to take some risks against the need to show results. He has broadly supported the findings of an internal study released three months ago that said the bank should direct more of its lending to those nations that have relatively stable economies and that have shown they are capable of using financial assistance effectively.

HEADLINE: CHINA AFTER DENG: THE OVERVIEW;
China Plans Deliberately Simple Funeral for Deng

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 20

 BODY:
China today announced a spare and modest memorial ceremony for Deng Xiaoping, apparently reflecting the leadership's desire to impart a message of calm and continuity and perhaps to avoid risking any spontaneous displays of discontent.
The funeral committee headed by President Jiang Zemin said 10,000 party loyalists, friends and family members would be invited to the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday to view a closed coffin bearing a simple portrait of the last man who is likely to be called paramount leader of China. As has been customary in past funerals of major Chinese figures, no foreigners are to be invited. 
 But Mr. Deng's body will not lie in state, as Mao's did for one week in September 1976. And no one will be allowed to bow three times before the coffin in the traditional Chinese manner of paying respect to a departed elder.
And in an unusual demonstration that business continues uninterrupted by the period of mourning, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is to visit Beijing as planned on Monday.
The simple sendoff for the revolutionary giant was attributed to the wishes of the man himself, but it was loaded with political meaning.
Mr. Jiang and other political heirs of Mr. Deng clearly wish to portray his death not as an unsettling occasion but as the passing of a retired leader who had already handed over the reins of power.
The leaders may also have feared that a more public event would give rise to recriminations over Mr. Deng's role in ordering the military assault against unarmed student protesters during the 1989 pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. The demonstrations at the time began with wreath-layings in honor of Hu Yaobang, a former general secretary who died.
Moreover, for millions of Chinese, politics has simply been out of mind since democratic reform became a futile, if not dangerous, pursuit in the years since.
Even as the funeral plans went forward, so did plans for China's top leaders to receive their first visit from Ms. Albright on the day before Mr. Deng's memorial. Ms. Albright's schedule in Beijing is likely to include blunt exchanges on the failure by Chinese and American diplomats to find a formula to avoid confrontation next month in Geneva, where the United Nations Human Rights Commission takes up its annual debate on China's human rights record.
In Washington, President Clinton said he expected "continuity" in China. "We will continue to engage strongly with China," he told reporters, adding, "The policy we are following of engaging with China, to work where we agree and to honestly air our disagreements and work through them, is the right policy for the people of the United States and indeed for the world in the 21st century."
"If you imagine what the world will look like 30 years from now, 40 years from now, we can do nothing other than what we are doing," Mr. Clinton said. "It is the right thing to do."
As if to reinforce the point that the torch has already passed, Li Lanqing, China's Deputy Prime Minister and a contender to become Prime Minister next year, said on a visit to Israel that the continued expansion of China's economy since Mr. Deng's official retirement "fully demonstrates the competence and abilities of the current Chinese leadership with Mr. Jiang Zemin at the core."
With flags at half-staff across China during a five-day period of mourning declared after Mr. Deng's death on Wednesday night, the official funeral committee, comprising 459 Chinese luminaries and top party leaders, announced that the memorial services would be attended by "representatives of the central party, Government, military and people's organizations, and people from all walks of life in the capital, his friends, and representatives from his hometown" of Paifang in Sichuan province.
The committee made public a letter dated last Saturday from Mr. Deng's wife, Zhuo Lin, and their five children, calling for minimal funeral arrangements. "Comrade Xiaoping always has a philosophical view of life and death, and has talked many times with us about his own funeral affairs," it said.
"There should be no farewell ceremony for his remains," the family said, adding that "the memorial meeting should be held after cremation" and the "coffin should be covered by a party flag" with "a color photo that displays the superb mental outlook of Comrade Xiaoping above it."
Mr. Deng's remains will be cremated before the memorial service and his "ashes cast into the sea" in accordance with his and his family's wishes, said the announcement by the official funeral committee.
Mr. Deng's corneas will be donated to an eye bank, the announcement said, and his body will be "dissected for the purpose of medical research" before cremation. Mr. Deng died of complications associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. He was 92 by Western reckoning, since official records give his birth date as Aug. 22, 1904. Chinese state-run news organizations gave his age as 93. Traditionally, Chinese infants are declared 1 year old if they live beyond the first month. Other Chinese add a year to their age at the start of the Lunar New Year, which this year fell on Feb. 7.
The family letter said that since Mr. Deng had "devoted his entire life to the motherland and the people without any reservation, we hope that the last thing we do for him will reflect the essence of his mental outlook, and express our grief in an utterly plain and solemn way."
Mr. Jiang's decision to appoint himself the "chairman" of the funeral committee echoed his efforts to elevate his stature by being appointed Chairman of the Communist Party, of which he is already General Secretary. But the elevation would put him on the same leadership plane as Mao, with whom the title of chairman has been associated since it was retired in the early 1980's.
The huge roster of funeral committee members was also a sign of Mr. Jiang's desire to galvanize the party under his nominal leadership even as he shares power with Prime Minister Li Peng and the other five members of the standing committee of the Politburo.
The roster was conspicuous for its inclusion of both Yang Shangkun and Yang Baibing, who were poised to challenge Mr. Jiang's leadership in 1992. Also on the committee is Hua Guofeng, Mao's hand-picked successor who was pushed aside by Mr. Deng in 1978. Conspicuous for his absence from the committee roster was Zhao Ziyang, the former party secretary who lost his job over his refusal to send troops against the student protesters in 1989. Mr. Zhao remains a party member.
The utterly plain funeral for Mr. Deng contrasts with the great pageantry that attended the passing of Mao, or even of Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, whose death in January 1976 led to the first large-scale pro-democracy demonstrations of the Communist era. Mr. Deng was blamed for those demonstrations and was purged for the second time in his career as a national leader.
By making public the Deng family letter today, President Jiang and the collective leadership that succeeds Mr. Deng were able to sidestep the difficulty of mandating the kind of minimalism that suits their craving for maximum tranquillity in the capital.
And the timing of Mr. Deng's death, coming as it did during the long recess on China's university campuses for the Lunar New Year, spares the Politburo for now from the unseemly act of strengthening the police presence there to prevent any spontaneous student demonstrations in memory of -- or vilification of -- Mr. Deng's rule and his Tiananmen legacy.
Much like Zhou Enlai, Mr. Deng discouraged the kind of personality cult that surrounded Mao, whose huge portrait that stares out over Tiananmen Square is the emblem of the Chinese capital and whose cavernous mausoleum towers over the 100-acre parade ground in front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace where millions have lined up to view the well-preserved body of the Chairman.
China virtually stood still for days after the deaths of Mao and Zhou Enlai in 1976, but today the streets of the city bustled at their usual frenetic pace, with rush-hour crowds seemingly oblivious to the historic moment that had passed.
"I came to work at 9:30 this morning," said Wang Shuzhen, a 50-year-old soda salesman on Tiananmen Square. "I am not surprised -- everybody dies. It's a pity a leader is gone." Wang Rong, a high school student, added, "The impact of his death should be very small because these days the country is developing very fast."
But others expressed sadness and grief.
"I cried when I heard the news," said a 30-year-old businessman dressed in fashionable denim on the chilly winter morning. "When Mao and Zhou died, I was young and at that time our feelings were imposed on us. Now if someone mourns for Deng it is from their heart, not from politics."
But the young man had to admit that the capital did not seem as seized by Mr. Deng's passing. "I saw a lot of people on the street showing little response, going on with their business or talking about it in a light way," he said. "I just feel that they are numb."

HEADLINE: CHINA AFTER DENG: THE DISSIDENTS;
Chinese Exiles Wonder How Wind Will Blow

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Inside the world of China's exiled dissidents where they talk about the future, the shape of China after the death of Deng Xiaoping has been the main topic for years, with nearly as many opinions as dissidents.
But now that Mr. Deng has actually passed from the scene, there is something different in the atmosphere, a sense that at least the things that could not change as long as Mr. Deng was alive have some chance of changing now. 
 "The general feeling is that Deng's death opens up some chances," said Xiao Qiang, a former physics student who is director of Human Rights in China, a monitoring organization in New York.
"Deng allowed an economic opening but no political liberalization, and nobody could challenge that as long as he was alive," he said. "In the post-Deng era at least you will be able to question the policy, the timetable of liberalization, and whether liberalization should be on the timetable."
In all, according to Mr. Xiao, some 40,000 Chinese received residency permits in the United States after the violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Another 2,000 to 4,000 came to this country after the crackdown and were granted political asylum. Of these, a few hundred have remained active in organizations that study events in China or provide information on human rights abuses there or campaign for greater freedoms.
Virtually all of the exiles are officially unpersons in China, and it appears that they have little if any influence there.
Among dissidents themselves, the exiles may not enjoy the prestige of some democracy activists, like Wei Jingsheng or Wang Dan, who remained in the country and are serving long prison terms. But they are untainted by any involvement in the suppression of the Tiananmen demonstrations and conceivably could return to positions of influence should a more liberal faction come to power in Beijing, or even if the current Government of President Jiang Zemin decides to make a gesture of reconciliation to the many officials who lost their posts after 1989.
The large and varied community of exiles includes many aides or advisers to the two leading purged reformers, Hu Yaobang, who died in 1988, and Zhao Ziyang, the former General Secretary of China's Communist party, who was pushed from his post by Mr. Deng when he showed a too sympathetic attitude toward the student demonstrators.
In addition there are many students, now in their 20's and early 30's, who were active in the Tiananmen demonstrations, including some who served prison terms and have now been released.
Some of the exiles, interviewed the day after Mr. Deng's death, seemed pessimistic about the immediate future, saying China's leaders will feel insecure now that Mr. Deng has passed from the scene and will therefore govern more repressively than ever before.
Others take a very different view, saying Mr. Deng's death will open the way for an official reassessment of the military crackdown at Tiananmen, possibly a re-emergence for Mr. Zhao, and even a future role in a democratic China for the exiles now in the United States.
"The day of going back is closer," said Liu Binyan, the editor of China Focus, a magazine published in Princeton, N.J. In the relatively open China of the 1980's, Mr. Liu enjoyed national fame as his country's chief investigative journalist.
"The death of Deng marks the end of the old era, the era when everything was decided by a few politicians," he said. "Even though Deng didn't interfere in politics in the last few years, he was like a stone weighing on the country, and the removal of the stone will make people more courageous in raising demands and expressing dissatisfaction with the status quo."
Mr. Liu, who was visiting the United States when the Tiananmen crackdown took place and remained in this country afterwards, said President Jiang is likely to respond to popular pressure by formally reassessing the Tiananmen demonstrations so that they will no longer be designated counterrevolutionary but a legal and even patriotic movement.
As long as Mr. Deng was alive, any such re-evaluation would have been considered an indirect criticism of him and therefore impossible. Now, however, a re-examination of the events of 1989 could bring Mr. Zhao back into favor, Mr. Liu said, not as a senior official but as a consultant to a government favoring political reforms as well as economic ones.
Having been away from China for several years now, often struggling with a new language, receiving news from back home via the press and telephone conversations, the exiled dissidents are often eager to return home and may be prone to excessive optimism about the pace of change in China in the future.
Appearing on the Charlie Rose program on public television Wednesday night, Chai Ling, a Tiananmen student leader who fled the country after the crackdown, spoke emotionally about her expectation that great changes will soon sweep over China in the direction of the rule of law, a free press and other elements of democratic government.
"Jiang Zemin could be China's George Washington," Ms. Chai said. "Or he could be another Deng Xiaoping."
Liu Gang, a former physics student from Beijing University who spent six years in prison after the Tiananmen crackdown, said, "Things will get better because there's an opportunity for China to change."
Mr. Liu, who is now studying computers at Columbia University, says, like many other exiles, that there may be a power struggle in China during which challenges to the old order will be made. "After Deng, nobody will be able to be a powerful dictator again," Mr. Liu said.
Some exiles, by contrast, say change for the better, if it comes at all, will be slow. They argue that Mr. Jiang will be cautious about moving away from the Deng legacy, in part because he himself owes his power as General Secretary of the Communist Party to Mr. Deng. Mr. Jiang also has to contend with conservative factions in China that would like to see greater political controls and even a curtailment of some economic freedoms.
"In the short term, the Government is going to be more repressive," said Mr. Xiao, of Human Rights in China. "The leaders now have fewer credentials than Deng did and no legitimacy of their own. So they will feel insecure."
One of the highest party officials now among the exiles is Su Shaozhi, who was the director of the Institute for Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought at the Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.
Mr. Su, who left China four days after the Tiananmen crackdown, lost his post when his patron, Hu Yaobang, was purged. He is now president of the Princeton-China Initiative, an institute that monitors developments in China.
"With Deng's death, different factions or different forces might challenge the Jiang Zemin regime," Mr. Su said. "The first group is the people who remember the June 4 massacre, though they didn't dare mention it while Deng was alive. This is the force that can unite the reformists both inside and outside the party and press for a reassessment of Tiananmen.
"The second force," he said, "are the Marxist-Leninist fundamentalists, who have already challenged Deng's reforms and might apply pressure to Jiang Zemin to turn left."
Mr. Su said that Mr. Jiang is by nature a Marxist-Leninist himself, though when Mr. Deng repudiated that wing of the party in 1992, Mr. Jiang supported his patron. Now that Mr. Deng is dead, Mr. Su said, Mr. Jiang might be tempted to move toward tighter political controls even as he continues to promote a more open economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. WON'T OFFER TRADE TESTIMONY ON CUBA EMBARGO

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Just hours after the World Trade Organization appointed a panel of judges to hear a European challenge to Washington's embargo of Cuba, the United States said today that it would refuse to take part in the legal proceedings. It declared that the new body, which was intended to be the arbiter of world trade rules, "has no competence to proceed" in an issue of American national security.
"We will not show up," a senior Administration official said today when asked what Washington would do when the panel convened. 
 The American action, which falls short of a formal legal step, followed six months of negotiations with Europe over the Helms-Burton Act that failed to produce a compromise. The Helms-Burton Act is intended to punish companies that trade with Cuba.
In the hope that the announcement today would force the European Union to back down and reach an out-of-court settlement, the Administration said that it would not formally invoke its "national security exemption" for several weeks.
American officials insist that if they formally declare the issue a matter of national security, that move would abort the hearings. But European officials may ask for a judgment against the United States in absentia, even though an Administration official briefing reporters today said, "We do not believe anything the W.T.O. says or does can force the U.S. to change its laws."
The central issue in the increasingly bitter dispute is Europe's claim that the United States has violated international law by imposing penalties on foreign companies that conduct business in Cuba using properties or assets that once belonged to American companies. Those properties, which include Cuba's telephone system, were expropriated by Havana four decades ago.
The penalties, which include barring executives of those companies from entering the United States, are intended to force foreign governments to support the American effort to isolate Fidel Castro.
But the European action and the American response raise a deeper issue: how this highly charged case could damage the authority of the W.T.O., which was created by a global trade accord that went into effect two years ago. The case is the first to test the scope of the organization's authority, in an age when trade issues and broader political and security questions often merge.
Today officials on both sides of the Atlantic accused each other of undermining the organization.
European officials described as arrogant the American effort to declare the law outside of the World Trade Organization's jurisdiction. They argued that if the United States did not want the issue dealt with as a trade matter, it should not have employed trade sanctions.
"It is not credible to suggest that protection of U.S. national security requires interference in the legitimate trade of European companies with Cuba," Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's top official for foreign trade, said this week.
The United States insisted that the embargo has nothing to do with trade because it is not intended to protect American products or American industry. "By bringing noncommercial matters into the W.T.O., the E.U. may well jeopardize what we and others have worked so hard to achieve," Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of Commerce and the President's special envoy on the Cuba issue, said today.
For many in the Administration, however, the confrontation poses particularly difficult problems. Several of Mr. Clinton's advisers counseled him against signing Helms-Burton, though the fact that Cuba shot down two American planes flown by members of a Cuban exile group led Mr. Clinton to conclude that he had no choice. Other advisers urged him to sign the bill, arguing that it was important to Cuban-Americans in Florida and New Jersey, which at the time were considered potential swing states in the Presidential election.
The signing of the bill led to outrage in Canada, Mexico and Europe, all of which do extensive business with Cuba. They all passed laws countering with sanctions on behalf of their own companies if Washington sought to invoke its sanctions.
Since then, however, President Clinton has twice suspended a crucial element of the law, which would allow Americans to sue foreign companies -- in American courts -- for the use of expropriated American property in Cuba. Europe was not satisfied. "We cannot have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads," Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, said during a visit here two months ago.
Under the provision barring executives of foreign companies that run afoul of Helms-Burton, only executives from Canada and Mexico have been barred so far, though it is likely that officials of Italy's telecommunications company will soon be prohibited as well, American officials say.
The most disputed aspect of today's action was the American insistence that it could stop the case by simply declaring that Helms-Burton was not a question of trade, but one of national security and foreign policy -- and that the W.T.O. did not have the power to come to its own judgment on that question.
"I think the U.S. is way off base," said Prof. John H. Jackson, a leading expert on the treaty that created the World Trade Organization. Professor Jackson, who teaches at the University of Michigan, added in a telephone interview: "The U.S. might be right that this is an issue of national security. But I don't think there is any basis for saying that it can take a walk, without allowing the panel to consider the issue."
Within the Administration, that decision was the subject of considerable debate. The United States files far more complaints about foreign trade practices than are filed against it, and some Administration officials have argued inside the White House that the precedent in this case could soon be turned against American interests. Japan, for example, claims that its prohibition on rice imports is a matter of "food security," not trade; South Korea has made a similar argument about protecting its car industry.
American officials disputed this argument. Mr. Eizenstat argued that Europe is challenging "three decades of American Cuba policy that goes back to the Kennedy Administration," and is aimed entirely at forcing a change of government in Havana.
European officials said they hoped that a settlement could be reached, and both sides are looking for a way out. But late today one senior American official said: "What the Europeans want us to do is agree not to enforce the law. We can't do that. If there was an easy way out we would have found it by now."

HEADLINE: Attack Is Waged on Plan to Pay for Fewer Doctors

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Hospital executives around the nation and powerful members of Congress are reacting with rage to the Federal Government's highly unusual plan to award special payments to hospitals in New York State that agree to train fewer doctors.
They say that at a time when hospitals everywhere are struggling to hold down costs in an era of managed care, the program amounts to a multimillion-dollar sweetheart deal for hospitals with powerful political ties. 
 "The chairmen of this committee are asking why did New York get this special goody before Congress got to their orderly process of developing a national policy on medical education?" said Ari Fleischer, the spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, which provides money for Medicare.
Under an experiment announced earlier this week, the Health Care Financing Administration will pay New York hospitals $400 million in exchange for the hospitals' agreement to reduce the number of doctors they train by 20 to 25 percent over the next six years.
Proposed by the Greater New York Hospital Association as a demonstration project last fall, the plan received an unusually quick approval from the Health Care Financing Administration and does not need Congressional approval.
But Republican Congressmen on the Ways and Means Committee were furious that they were barely consulted about so large a deal. And though the committee cannot alter the New York program, Mr. Fleischer predicted that the coming health care debates could take on a newly acrimonious tone and cause problems for the Clinton Administration's attempts to change Medicare.
"The deal may have merit," he said. "But in offering a special deal to New York, the administration may have created for themselves some non-New York headaches."
The project's goal is to create a financial incentive for hospitals to produce fewer doctors and to save the Medicare program money. Some health care experts contend that the nation has too many doctors, who drive up costs by ordering unnecessary tests and expensive procedures.
Medicare now pays hospitals up to about $100,000 each year in "training subsidies" for each resident they employ; critics say those payments have led to a swelling number of residents. The new program gives hospitals that have relied on residents as a source of cheap labor money to find alternate ways to dispense care.
Hospital executives across the nation have praised the idea behind the program, but say they too should receive the compensation that New York hospitals will be getting. They say that the pressures of managed care have forced them to cut training programs, too, and that no Federal program has cushioned their financial losses.
Dr. H. Richard Neeson, president of the Partners Health Care System in Boston, said that he is already well into a five-year plan to reduce the number of residents by 20 percent. "We're doing this anyway, and as of now we're not getting paid for it," he said. "I see no reason why we shouldn't be helped."
But New York hospital executives, Health Care Financing Administration officials and New York politicians defended the plan and dismissed the complaints as sour grapes. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who last month wrote a letter supporting the plan to some members of the Ways and Means Committee, said that people in other parts of the nation should view the program as an interesting experiment that they will someday join in if it proves to save the Government money.
"If this is just a case of 'I want everything you have at the same time,' it won't work," Mr. D'Amato said. "We don't have as many defense bases as people in other states, because you look at national security needs. We don't get money from farm bills because we're not a state that participates in many of those programs. We don't have big water project like dams. But hospitals and teaching hospitals we have provided."
Bruce C. Vladeck, the administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, has a simple answer for why the demonstration project was awarded to New York: "The reason we went to New York is because New York came to us with the idea and asked."
Last summer, officials from the Greater New York Hospital Association sent an unsolicited and radical proposal to Federal regulators: why not see what would happen if the Government paid hospitals in New York not to train so many doctors?
Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the New York hospitals group, said many member hospitals had complained to him that while they wanted to cut the size of their resident staffs, they could not afford to lose the generous Federal training funds that came with each resident.
In just six months, the association's proposal moved through the normal bureaucratic hurdles of theGovernment with surprising ease.
Mr. Raske said the quick approval was partly due to the Hospital Association's clever plan and hard work -- as well as to the fact that 15 percent of the nation's doctors train in New York. But some health experts give equal credit to a host of powerful New Yorkers, in Congress and in health care, who used their connections to smooth the way.
"New York is clearly a leader in medical education in the United States," Mr. Raske said. "And anyway, we designed it and we had the technical expertise to carry it out."
He added that the member hospitals were forced to make major concessions to the Health Care Financing Administration to be allowed to join the program, like accepting restrictions on how to deploy their residents.
He said that the terms that the association negotiated with H.C.F.A. last December were so restrictive that he anticipated that at most 12 hospitals would participate in the voluntary plan. Three weeks later, he was shocked when 41 signed up, including all of New York City's major medical centers.
The many ties between New York's hospitals, politicians and the top officials at the Health Care Financing Administration probably helped pave the way for this highly unusual plan, health experts say.
For example, Mr. Vladeck, who approved the project, is a former health care executive from New York City who has said he expects to return there. Because of his connections, he has previously recused himself from deliberations involving projects in New York, but chose not to in this case.
Mr. Vladeck said that he "worried about being involved in this decision a little bit," but decided that there was no direct conflict of interest and that "there were enough external checks and balances."
The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Office of Management and Budget both had to approve the proposal.
Although the project did not need Congressional approval, Senator D'Amato -- who last year won the annual award of the Greater New York Hospital Association -- ran interference on the House floor, firing off calming letters to Representatives Bill Archer of Texas and Bill Thomas of California, powerful Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee.
But since the plan's release this week, it has become clear those misgivings remained. Mr. Fleischer, the spokesman for the committee, said that Mr. Archer and Mr. Thomas were upset that the administration had announced the program before even consulting the House committee. And they disagreed that New York was a natural testing place for the plan.
"When you pick for a demonstration project the nation's biggest market," Mr. Fleischer said, "you cross the line from demonstration to special deal for big player on block."
Some health care experts worried that the poltical fireworks would obscure what they saw as the overwhelming merits of the plan.
"Hospitals are a major part of the New York economy, like Grumman fighters, so of course the New York delegation would not let graduate medical education shrink without exacting something," said Dr. Ed O'Neil, director of the Center for the Health Professions at the University of California of San Francisco. "But this is really a great first step for teaching hospitals. And if it took $400 million in grease to make it happen -- it's better than doing nothing, which is what the New York delegation was willing to give in the past."

Dow Loses 92.75 Points, Falling Below 7,000
Stocks tumbled in what some analysts saw as a natural retreat for an increasingly expensive market. The Dow industrials fell 92.75 points, to 6,927.38, after being down by 114 points at one point late in the session. 
 Since crossing the 7,000-point level last week, the Dow has swung sharply, and many analysts have said it will be difficult for stocks to maintain their rapid growth, though few say they expect the market to give up its gains. [Page D6.]
 
Treasury securities prices were lower for the third consecutive session, hurt by a decline in the dollar and a selloff in Treasury futures. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.65 percent from 6.57. [D13.]
 
The drop in the dollar came amid signs of economic strength in Europe and more attempts by German central bankers to stem the American currency's recent rise. [D5.]
 
China's Economy After Deng
Deng Xiaoping seemed to have a magic touch in China's rocky transition to a mixed economy. Though the death of Mr. Deng, China's paramount leader, is not expected to stop the free-market forces he helped release, the big question now seems to be at what pace the nation's economic shift will proceed. [A15.]
 
Compuserve Reports a Loss
Compuserve, whose chief executive resigned this week, reported a quarterly loss that was slightly smaller than expected. The company also reported a decline in subscriptions for its flagship computer on-line business but said membership rose in other areas. [D2.]
 
Borland to Cut 300 Jobs
Borland International, the struggling software company, said that it would lay off about 30 percent of its work force. [D2.]
 
Mixed Signs in Economic Data
Reports showed a possible cooling off in housing and continued strength in the labor market. Construction starts on homes and apartments rose 2 percent last month, less than expected, while initial claims for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week. [D2.]
 
Tandy: On the Road Back?
Tandy reported stronger-than-expected operating earnings for the fourth quarter, though the gains were wiped out by charges from a revamping of its retail chains. Still, the results hint that Tandy may be starting to turn itself around. Market Place. [D6.]
 
U.S. to Boycott Review of Embargo
Hours after the World Trade Organization appointed a panel of judges to hear a European challenge to Washington's embargo of Cuba, the United States said it would refuse to take part in the proceedings. It declared that the body "has no competence to proceed" in an issue of American national security. [A1.]
 
Boeing 737 Is Called Less Safe
The Boeing 737, the most widely used passenger jet, is less safe than other airliners because the failure of a single valve, the one that controls the rudder, can cause it to crash, the National Transportation Safety Board said. But the board did not ground the planes or even declare them unsafe, and Boeing and the F.A.A. disagreed that the plane was less airworthy than others. [A1.]
 
Earnings Decline at Penney
J. C. Penney said that operating earnings declined in the fourth quarter despite a 23 percent increase in sales. The period was disappointing for many retailers. [D6.]
 
Protection for Medicaid Patients
President Clinton prohibited health maintenance organizations from limiting what doctors may tell Medicaid patients about treatment options. And he urged Congress to guarantee similar protections for more than 100 million Americans with private insurance, declaring that changes revolutionizing the health insurance and health care industries must not be allowed to erode the quality of medical care.

HEADLINE: A Figure of Infamy Is Held in a 2d Outrage

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
Some of his neighbors here say they believed Lawrence Singleton when he claimed to have been framed for the rape and mutilation of a California teen-ager nearly two decades ago, a crime that had made him a figure of nationwide infamy. Others, who have known him from childhood, believed that whether he had been framed or not, a man could always change.
So when Mr. Singleton made his way back here to his hometown in 1988 after his release from a California prison, and then settled last year in his old neighborhood, he was eventually accepted, although some mothers watched their children more closely and some husbands kept closer track of their wives. 
 "We were scared of him at first," said his next-door neighbor, Tom Bennett. "But every day he'd talk to you; he'd cook steaks and bring them to you. He fixed up his property really good. He was the neighbor you dream of. I started to believe him: 'maybe he was framed.' "
But on Wednesday night, Mr. Singleton, now 69, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of a prostitute inside his renovated single-story wooden home, the house that had made his neighborhood proud.
And now Mr. Bennett, like others on Mr. Singleton's street in that working-class neighborhood, are saying that the California authorities should never have released him to live in their midst.
Mr. Singleton was convicted in 1979 of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker near Modesto, using an ax to chop off her forearms and leaving her to die at the side of a road. The girl, Mary Vincent, survived, and testified at his trial.
Sentenced to 14 years 4 months in prison, then the maximum punishment, Mr. Singleton was freed on parole after 8 years because of good behavior and his participation in a work-study program. That was in 1987, and the national notoriety he had acquired a decade earlier resurfaced as one California community after another protested parole officials' efforts to relocate him there. Mr. Singleton was finally forced to live in a mobile home on the grounds of San Quentin prison until the end of his parole, in 1988, when he returned to Tampa and, as required, registered with the State of Florida as a convicted felon.
The arrest on Wednesday night came barely three weeks after neighbors had pulled Mr. Singleton from his van as he attempted suicide in his driveway. On that afternoon, the neighbors said, he was found breathing the van's exhaust through a dryer hose that he had attached to the tailpipe. He spent about a week in psychiatric custody before returning home.
"He told me he was feeling sorry for himself," Mr. Bennett said, adding that Mr. Singleton had offered nothing more by way of explanation.
About 6 P.M. on Wednesday, Hillsborough County sheriff's officials said, a man who had done some renovation work for Mr. Singleton dropped by his house and heard a commotion inside. Peering in, the officials said, the man saw Mr. Singleton, naked, in the living room, choking and punching a woman, who was also nude, as she cried for help.
A deputy who responded to the man's 911 call says Mr. Singleton had blood on his shirt when he came to the door. The woman was dead.
The victim was identified as Roxanne Hayes, 31, a Tampa resident and mother of three children. She had a record of 99 arrests since 1986, more than a third of them for prostitution but some on charges of grand theft and cocaine possession.
The precise cause of death has not been determined, but Ms. Hayes suffered multiple knife wounds in the upper body, said Lieut. David Gee, a spokesman for the sheriff's office.
Exactly why Ms. Hayes was at Mr. Singleton's home -- whether he was a prostitution client of hers, or whether there was another reason for her being there -- remains unclear. The police said they did not know the answer, and Ms. Hayes's common-law husband, Clifford Tyson, a 40-year-old unemployed truck driver and cook, said in a tearful interview that he knew only that she had left their home to shop for groceries not long before Mr. Singleton's visitor found him attacking her.
That the dream neighbor has seemingly turned into a nightmare is no surprise to the California prosecutor who sent Mr. Singleton to prison for attempted murder, kidnapping, rape, sodomy, oral copulation, aggravated mayhem and the use of an ax to cause great bodily harm.
"I'm not going to say he's Hannibal Lecter, but once a guy like that has a certain bent he follows it the rest of his life," said the prosecutor, Donald N. Stahl, who retired last year as Stanislaus County District Attorney. "This guy has a personality that's bent in the direction of going after women."
The case that Mr. Stahl prosecuted helped galvanize the movement for tougher sentences in many states. In California, for instance, the Legislature has increased the mandatory terms for most violent crimes, and as a result Mr. Singleton would now face a life sentence for the kind of attack he inflicted on Miss Vincent, said Katie Corso, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Corrections.
Some sex-crime experts caution that Mr. Singleton is in ways an anomaly. They maintain that sex offenders as a whole are very much in need of treatment, not harsher punishment, and note that only a small minority go on to commit murder. The passions stirred by the crime of which Mr. Singleton was convicted and another with which he has now been charged should not be grounds for advocating the kind of penalties that would be unfair to most other sex offenders, these experts contend.
"This is a major public health issue in this country, and people need to look at it as such instead of trying to enact all these bizarre laws like public notification and chemical castration," said Robert Freeman-Longo, founder of the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, a treatment and prevention group.
But the Tampa murder sent shudders through the string of Northern California towns that, one by one, fought to keep Mr. Singleton out after his release on parole 10 years ago.
The killing of Ms. Hayes "could have happened here," said Dale Vassey, 27, a lifelong resident of one of those towns, Rodeo, about 20 miles northeast of San Francisco. "It just goes to show it's a good thing they did run him out of town."
Mr. Singleton, who was one of eight children reared in Tampa, also met with scorn when he first returned to the city, where most of his siblings still live. At first he moved into a brother's home, which soon became the target of a firebomb tossed into the front yard. A car dealer offered him $5,000 to leave the state.
In addition, protesters showed up at court hearings where he appeared as a result of his subsequent minor brushes with the law. Sheriff's officials say that in 1990 and 1991, he was arrested three times on shoplifting charges. At one hearing, he described himself as "a confused, muddle-headed old man."
But in Orient Park, the Tampa community where he had spent part of his childhood, and where he returned last year, his neighbors let him be. In fact, some say they did not learn of his record until his recent suicide attempt rekindled gossip about his criminal past.
"We never knew all that," David Sales, a neighbor who rescued him from the van, told The Associated Press today. "But when I found out, the first thing I thought was, 'Should I have left that man in there?' If I had known, I probably would have at least given it a second thought."
But many other neighbors did know, and say any concerns they had were assuaged by Mr. Singleton's conduct. He lived alone and on Social Security, they say, and spent most of his time remodeling and landscaping his property -- owned not by him, the neighbors say, but by his family. Several of his brothers and their wives visited often. And he loved his dog, a Rottweiler named Kala. He was also solicitous, offering to repair a neighbor's broken mailbox one day, going the next to the bar where another neighbor played in a band.
"We didn't like the idea that something had happened," said Georgia Polston, 78, who remembers Mr. Singleton as a 9-year-old and whose son went to school with one of his brothers. "But you can't make a big thing about it if you want to give people a chance."

TENTATIVE AGREEMENT REACHED IN AUTO WORKERS' STRIKE

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Johnson Controls Inc. reached a tentative contract agreement yesterday with the United Auto Workers union, bringing an end to a 24-day strike that disrupted production at the Ford Motor Company. The contract covers about 500 workers at seat assembly plants in Plymouth and Oberlin, Ohio. Workers at the plants will be asked to ratify the contracts within two days. The Plymouth plant employs about 300 hourly workers and produces seats for the Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle. The Oberlin plant employs about 200 hourly workers and produces seats for the Econoline and Club Wagon vans. Ford refused to accept seats made by nonunion replacements and shut the lines down for a time.

HEADLINE: Pataki to Seek Waiver on Requiring Work for Food Stamps

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki plans to seek a waiver from new Federal welfare rules requiring adults to work in exchange for food stamps, sparing tens of thousands of the neediest New Yorkers from the prospect of losing their benefits.
The decision by Mr. Pataki, whose administration had been reluctant to pursue the waiver, came as he faced growing criticism from Democratic legislators and advocates for the poor who argued that recipients living in areas where jobs are scarce would otherwise lose their food stamp benefits. 
 In seeking the waiver, the Governor, who has trumpeted his record on economic growth, is acknowledging that there are not enough jobs in the state to absorb food stamp recipients.
The tightened food stamp rules are scheduled to go into effect on Saturday and will provide no more than three months of food stamps a year for able-bodied, childless adults under age 50 who are not working at least 20 hours a week.
The waiver the Governor will apply for is only temporary, lasting at least through the end of this year, said an aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. The aide said the decision to apply for it was made to give counties the time they need to do two things: place recipients in jobs, or establish systems for tracking the number of hours recipients work each week.
"No one should be penalized because they're able-bodied and willing to work," the Governor said last night during a radio interview on WCBS-AM.
The Governor's decision came after a rising chorus of criticism by religious groups who argued that tens of thousands of people would be harmed by the new rules. So far, 11 other states, including Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio, have applied for similar waivers by declaring that there are certain pockets in those states where the labor market is too weak to absorb welfare recipients.
But until now the Pataki administration has refused to apply for such a waiver, arguing that with the right mix of sanctions and incentives, it can coax beneficiaries into the job market.
Instead, it has sought a narrower waiver that would apply only to areas where unemployment rates are above 10 percent. In New York, only two such areas exist: the Bronx and Hamilton County, in the southern Adirondacks.
Another reason for the administration's reluctance to seek the broader waiver has been that in doing so, it would have to acknowledge there are regions in the state where job opportunities are scarce. That admission would be at odds with Mr. Pataki's contention that the state's economy has improved enough to provide jobs to most people who want them. Indeed, the basic premise of the Governor's plan to overhaul the state's welfare system is that most of its 500,000 recipients will be able to find work with the right combination of incentives and punishments.
But advocates for the poor and religious leaders have urged Mr. Pataki to apply for the broader waiver for the entire state, arguing that there are not enough low-skilled jobs for welfare recipients. They estimate that 100,000 able-bodied adults receive food stamps now and that many of them will lose their benefits in the next three months unless Mr. Pataki applies for the waiver.
They further argue that poor communities will be hurt economically if the Governor does not seek the waiver, because thousands of small grocery stores depend heavily on food stamp business. The advocates noted that seeking the waiver would not cost the state any additional money because food stamps are paid for entirely by the Federal Government.
This afternoon, a group of Democratic legislators and ministers held a press conference in the Capitol imploring the Governor to apply for the waiver before the deadline.
"There are not enough jobs," said Arleon L. Kelly, the executive steward of the New York State Community of Churches. "The waiver would benefit hungry people, neighborhood businesses, and the state economy. All would be winners."
Tonight, aides to the Governor continued to contend that their critics have exaggerated the effects of not getting a waiver. They say most of the people affected by the new Federal law are already required by state rules to work or to enroll in workfare programs and, as a result, will remain eligible for food stamps.
The aides also estimate that at most, 17,000 people might lose their benefits, and that they would eventually be placed into volunteer or other jobs created by local governments.
The aide said that counties do not have to take advantage of the waiver Mr. Pataki has applied for if they believe they are in the position to place their food stamp recipients into jobs. By contrast, the aide added, counties that do not have programs to place people in jobs or track the number of hours they have worked can use the waiver.
"This is not a jobs issue," said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "This is about giving counties additional time."

HEADLINE: CHINA AFTER DENG: THE ECONOMY;
Deng's Legacy: Finishing Long March to Capitalism

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's policy of economic openness, seemed to possess a magic touch with China's economy in its rocky transition from Communism to capitalism.
But Mr. Deng has left his successors facing even tougher challenges, ones that he may not have been brave enough to take on. 
 Jiang Zemin, Mr. Deng's designated successor, and his circle of colleagues and adversaries have far less political legitimacy and influence than Mr. Deng. That may be crucial in pushing ahead with the next era of restructuring -- tackling the cumbersome state-run sector and adopting unpopular but necessary economic policies, like raising taxes, hiking prices or allowing large-scale layoffs.
This leaves one pressing question: will Mr. Deng's death threaten to derail the pace of China's progress on economic restructuring? Or is it possible his death might pave the way for even swifter change?
Today, business leaders in the United States expressed an almost stubborn optimism that China would remain on its current course of economic modernization. And markets around Asia seemed to take his death in stride, with stock indexes in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei and Shenzhen edging higher.
Trading in the Hong Kong stock market opened smartly Thursday, as the Hang Seng Index jumped more than 200 points. The market finished the day up more than 300 points to close at 13,411.3, for a 2.3 percent gain. That would have been inconceivable a few years ago, when people were talking about a drop of 30 percent after Mr. Deng's death, and it is a sign that more and more people accept that a leadership transition has taken place.
Mr. Deng's death was not only anticipated, but Mr. Deng had already set in motion an economic revolution in China that stretched far beyond what any one man could control.
"It is still a market of taxicabs and chauffeur-driven vehicles," said John F. Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, which has a sizable business in China. "The roads are currently missing, so that has to come first."
Mr. Deng's death does not change the fundamental strength of the economy, which grew nearly 10 percent last year. Savings rates are still high, labor remains cheap. China's public works and legal systems both remain weak but they are improving.
"Nobody in China has really lost from economic reform, and in the beginning that was very important," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "But somehow along the line, you've got to start making some tough choices."
Those tough choices loomed while Mr. Deng was still alive, and they remain China's greatest challenge for the future. And yet, Mr. Deng's presence was so pivotal to China's economic restructuring that his own gradualist approach suggests how difficult it must have been at times to bring China this far.
It will certainly be hard to match the magic of China's former patriarch. When Mr. Deng made what has become known as his imperial journey to the south in 1992, a time when economic restructuring was stalling, he was nominally just a retired old man.
But in fact, his trip paved the way for remarkable changes in national economic policy. A "socialist market economy was in favor;" central planning was out. And suddenly, a new economic vitality spread rapidly throughout the country.
Mr. Deng was a decisive leader, and when problems arose or critics swooped down on him, he forged ahead steadily and determinedly. That is exactly the opposite of the approach taken by Jiang Zemin, China's cautious Communist leader.
Mr. Deng had the influence to override conservatives who thought economic modernization should proceed much more slowly. China still has a clutch of elderly leaders, some of whom are ardent, revolutionary purists, and they may now press for a slower pace of economic restructuring. It is unlikely they will win, but there may at least be a tortuous, protracted battle that itself could delay economic change.
Finally, Mr. Deng had the political capital to make dramatic and painful changes in China. He did not always exercise it, but he did begin to allow companies to lay off workers and he gingerly began to accept the concept that companies could go bankrupt.
Still, in a sense, one of Mr. Deng's critical economic contributions survives him: economic restructuring is no longer an ideological question. It is more of a technical one.
When the Chinese leadership debates how to introduce capital markets or dissolve inefficiencies in the state sector, the debate is not over whether these steps are allowable. Instead, they are about the concrete process of how to go about orchestrating the change.
For example, how can welfare benefits be taken away from people? How can workers be laid off, and how can new jobs be found for them, to keep them from protesting in the streets? They are issues that are as much a headache for any capitalist leader.
In some ways, China's younger, more technocratic and worldly crop of leaders are better equipped than their elderly predecessors to handle the next stage of economic challenges. Mr. Jiang and Mr. Li probably understand the technical issues about the economy better than did Mr. Deng, and they are acutely aware that a vibrant, flourishing and progressing economy is the core of their legitimacy.
But they may not have a strong enough political will, the discipline or the mandate to carry out unpopular measures. Moreover, if the Chinese leadership is divided, neither Mr. Jiang nor Mr. Li may have the ability to break the impasse.
There are a cast of characters surrounding Mr. Jiang and Mr. Li in the collective leadership, and one or another of them may be potentially daring and shrewd enough to emerge as a kingmaker.
One leader who sometimes has demonstrated a flair for the bold is Zhu Rongji, a Deputy Prime Minister who is often considered China's new economic czar. He helped steer China's overheated economy to a soft landing in recent years, curbing inflation without choking growth.
Some even see him as China's Gorbachev, or a future emperor, though, those who do are mostly foreigners. Indeed, with Mr. Deng gone, some economists like Mr. Lardy say there may be possibilities for faster or more substantial progress to be made if well-informed, better-trained technocrats are allowed to proceed with restructuring.
China's economic successes have been phenomenal. But along with this wealth has come signs of the evils of 19th century industrial capitalism in the West. Fly-by-night companies in China often produce dangerous products, families send their children to sweatshops instead of schools, inequalities are expanding, and the get-rich-quick mentality creates its own excesses.
Mr. Deng was perhaps not courageous enough to confront the most troublesome remnant of Communism: the inefficient state sector and the circle of financial and systemic problems surrounding it.
"I think there were some things that it was harder to raise and debate openly while he was still alive," said Robert A. Knapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
China's state sector used to be the core of its economy, but now it is draining the economy dry, Mr. Knapp added. Loans to inefficient state-owned enterprises have doubled as a percentage of gross national product, according to Mr. Lardy.
"When we look back in 5 to 10 years, I think his legacy will not look so strong," said Mr. Lardy. "Because it will be more readily apparent that part of the success of Deng's strategy has been one of deferring reform. So he has left it to the next generation of leaders to make some of the tough choices."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 1997, MondayFebruary 25, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about China's economic prospects after Deng Xiaoping's death misspelled the surname of the president of the U.S.-China Business Council. He is Robert A. Kapp, not Knapp.
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about China's economic prospects after Deng Xiaoping's death misstated initial activity on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday. The Hang Seng Index opened down, not up, in the first minutes of trading, falling nearly 1 percent from Wednesday's close before rallying to close up 2.3 percent for the day.

HEADLINE: Columbus Circle Arts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I applaud Michael Kimmelman's recommendation (Critic's Notebook, Feb. 15) that New York City should guarantee a place for the visual arts at the redeveloped Columbus Circle site.
Rather than support the visual arts and its resident artists who add to the city's cultural hegemony and economic vigor, New York City closed its own gallery at 2 Columbus Circle in the early 1990's. 
 Mr. Kimmelman reports that the Dahesh Museum is interested in relocating to Columbus Circle. That might increase the visibility of 19th-century art, but it would do nothing to increase the visibility of the city's underrepresented and talented living artists.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Recovers to End Day Up Against Mark and Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar recovered somewhat yesterday, ending higher against the Japanese yen and the German mark after a broad decline on Thursday.
The dollar continues to be bolstered by expectations that robust growth and attractive interest rates will keep drawing foreign investors to United States markets. 
 "It's a no-brainer," said Paul Spirgel, senior currency dealer at Royal Bank of Scotland in New York. "The U.S. economy is doing all the right things. Interest rates are high and the stock market is going nutty."
For the week, however, the dollar's rally sputtered, as Germany's economy showed signs of life, and as monetary officials there and in Japan spoke out against further gains. The dollar ended the week lower versus the yen for the first time in six weeks, and was little changed against the mark.
Currency traders were also reluctant to buy too many dollars before Congressional testimony next week by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, which could provide clues to the outlook for interest rates.
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 123.28 yen, up from 122.55 Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.6887 marks from 1.6840. But the dollar lost ground against the British pound, which fetched $1.6172, compared with $1.6107.
Most of the dollar's gains came in late morning trading in New York, when it shot up about 1 yen and almost 1 pfennig in a brief rush to sell yen for marks, traders said. Many mark-yen transactions go through the dollar, so traders were buying dollars for yen and then selling the dollars for marks. Traders also sold yen for Swiss francs.
The dollar retreated from its highs when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said that it had "fully corrected" against the mark, the Reuters news service reported, echoing the statement made by leaders of the world's leading industrial countries at the close of their meeting in Berlin at the beginning of the month.
Earlier, Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official, said the yen had stabilized against the dollar. Those kinds of statements are leading traders to speculate that too rapid a rise in the dollar may prompt central bankers in Japan and Germany to buy their own currencies to strengthen them.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bond Prices Stage a Cautious Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds staged a mild rally yesterday, as buyers emerged to take advantage of the lower prices and higher yields after three days of selling in the bond market. But even though there appeared to be interest at these higher yield levels, traders said investors remained cautious.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 7/32 , to 99 28/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.64 percent from 6.65 percent. 
 Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the price rise was hurt by comments by the Federal Reserve's vice chairwoman, Alice M. Rivlin, who said tight labor markets could force higher interest rates.
"It's important to note that this warning raised a significant number of eyebrows within the credit markets, primarily because many market bears had been whipsawed into believing that their fears of inflation due to the tight labor markets have been mostly unjustified," Mr. Chan said.
The dollar rebounded from its previous day's decline to give added support to the bond market, and so did futures trading, where the expiration of options yesterday kept the March bond contract near a key price level of 113.
"Although Rivlin indicated that the stronger dollar helps mitigate some of the economy's inflationary pressures," Mr. Chan said, "she indicated that one of the side effects of a stronger dollar was to hurt exports, which in turn could worsen our inflationary environment."
Analysts said that next week bond market investors would have to absorb fresh supply, several pieces of economic news and testimony by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. before the Senate and the House.
Mr. Chan does not think Mr. Greenspan's testimony in the Senate on Wednesday and in the House on Thursday will cause too much nervousness among investors "because everyone knows that he is going into those sessions with a favorable set of Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index numbers in his pocket," Mr. Chan said. "As a result, even if we get a strong nonfarm payroll report in early March, most investors expect the Fed will be able to keep policy unchanged a bit longer."
Still, enough uncertainty exists to keep investors from taking any large positions over the near future. Mr. Chan figures investors are more likely to focus on the forward-looking information like unemployment claims and durable goods data, both to be released on Thursday.
Michael Krauss, chief technical strategist at Chase Securities Inc., said Treasuries were stuck in a trading range, with the yield on the long bond trapped between 6.50 percent and 6.75 percent.
Yesterday's session was quiet as the market basically moved sideways, Mr. Krauss said. "In fact, this year could see a lot of sideways action and not a big trending year," he said. "This will be a good year for singles hitters as opposed to the home run hitters, where market participants will be looking for smaller trades, trying to profit from 10-to-20-basis-point movements. Speculators will have to lower their sights and take profits quicker."
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's Treasury note auctions, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.85 percent and the five-year issue at a price to yield 6.16 percent.
David Ader, managing analyst at Technical Data of Boston, said that based on recent volume data of when-issued trading "we would look at those auctions with a defensive posture."
He noted that through yesterday afternoon, the market had traded 60 percent of the typical when-issued volume for the two-year notes, while for the five-year notes, the market had traded 58 percent of when-issued volume.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Delayed, but Good Deeds Get Done

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
With only six days days left in The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund's 85th annual appeal, donations have slowed and the fund remains about $140,000 behind the total collected last year. The appeal, which began after Thanksgiving, runs until Friday.
Last year's appeal, the second-best in the fund's history, raised $4,815,609.76. The record of $5,083,520.81 was set in 1992. 
 February is typically the fund's slowest month and, as donations have waned in recent days, the mail accompanying readers' contributions has become a stream of confessions from procrastinators across the New York metropolitan region. For one reason or another, they delayed. But they did not forget.
"After reading almost every daily installment of your touching stories, I am moved to tears, to contemplation, and to donation -- but I procrastinate," wrote Marina L. Myhre of Tenafly, N.J. "I'll send the check tomorrow. Oh, I was going to send that last week. Well, finally today I made the move." She sent $100, adding, "Go break $5 million."
Frann L. Goldstein of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, also rallied against the forces of delay. "Finally," she proclaimed in a note with her contribution of $118. "I don't even remember how many years of thinking and intending to . . . I am a long-time reader of The New York Times, and so, a long-time admirer of the fund. I have been moved, humbled and sometimes scared by the stories you print, by the life circumstances some have to meet. I have had moments of true thankfulness -- on the subway, on my way to work -- because of all that I have. Thank you for the example and the reminder of the fund."
Founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, the former publisher of the newspaper, the Neediest Cases Fund extends a helping hand to New Yorkers who need one by supporting seven of the city's oldest and largest private charities. Mr. Ochs believed that stories of the city's poor would move readers to give.
The newspaper pays all administrative expenses so donations go directly to cash assistance and services for poor people in the five boroughs, including the hungry and the homeless, the sick and the disabled, many of them children and the elderly.
William Perez, a second grader at Public School 21 in Queens whose class raised $17.18 for the fund, wrote: "My class has collected money for the neediest cases. I would like the money to be used to help the people that are poor and the people that don't have clothes and people that don't have money and people that don't have a place to live and people that don't have food to eat, people that don't have a car and a TV."
The readers who contribute represent a rainbow of generosity. Donations arrive from around the world, from the famous and the modest. They are young and old, some are rich, some are just getting by. But all feel fortunate to be able to give, to help those who have less, even if they wait until the last minute.
"I regret that I have procrastinated all these years," wrote Nancy Crawford Sutcliffe of Northport, L.I., who sent $20. "I am currently unemployed and thus cannot give much. Hopefully that will soon change. Please add this money to your fund."
Many people associate the fund's appeal with the holiday season but donations are accepted all year, just as the aid to the poor is given all year. Contributions postmarked after Feb. 28 will be applied to next year's campaign.
"I have been procrastinating sending this donation to you since Christmas-time," wrote Tricia Cotthaus Brown of the Upper West Side, who sent $50. "Everyday I read about others in New York who endure difficult circumstances and I realize how lucky I am."
There are six days left. To delay may mean to forget.

HEADLINE: World Forestry Talks End in Division on Whether to Curb Logging

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 21

 BODY:
With the world's forests continuing to shrink, more than 70 governments ended two years of talks today deeply divided over whether to propose binding steps to curb overlogging.
Senior environmental ministers meeting in April might yet breathe life into the proposal when discussions continue at a commission monitoring pledges made at the the Rio de Janeiro environmental summit meeting of 1992. 
But if opponents of a forestry convention -- including the Clinton Administration and Brazil -- stand their ground, firm action is unlikely to be taken on forestry when world leaders gather in June for the fifth anniversary of the Rio meeting.
After holding 10 meetings on five continents since 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests today drew up a wish-list for preserving dwindling forest reserves. It set no specific targets and left compliance voluntary and unmonitored.
The 15 European Union countries and Canada pressed hard for the forestry panel to recommend an immediate start to talks on a binding convention. They had the support of several developing countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Uganda and Papua New Guinea. Such a proposal would then have become the centerpiece of the June meeting.
But they failed to overcome the opposition of an unusual coalition of the United States, Australia, Brazil and some other developing nations, united with several environmental groups, including the Worldwide Fund for Nature, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth.
The Clinton Administration appears as reluctant to accept a forestry convention as the Bush Administration was at Rio five years ago. But many environmental groups, after lobbying unsuccessfully for an agreement then, are having second thoughts today.
At Rio, world leaders adopted three conventions: to protect the climate, to protect plants and wildlife (which the United States refused to sign), and to stop the encroachment of desert onto fertile land.
But a planned fourth convention -- now often called "the missing Rio convention" -- was blocked by the United States, fearful of restrictions on its lumber industry. It acted in alliance with much of the developing world, which feared that an agreement might limit economic growth. Instead, the summit meeting settled for a nonbinding declaration of principles that countries should follow.
Today, many environmental groups have concluded that the record has been so dismal that in the six to 10 years it would take to negotiate and ratify a convention, governments would only relax their protection of forests.
And given the depth of disagreement over the shape of a convention, they also despair that the actual text would be geared to anything but the lowest common denominator, amounting to little more than "a loggers' charter."
A better approach, they now argue, is to build on the many voluntary initiatives that have begun, including a plan to declare 10 percent of the world's forests protected areas by 2000.
At their closing news conference today, the two co-chairmen of the governmental panel, Sir Martin Holdgate, who is scientific adviser to the British Environmental Ministry, and Prof. Manuel Rodriguez-Becerra of Colombia, put the best face on their group's inability to agree on a forestry convention.
They argued that their deliberations had led to a better understanding of the dangers facing forests and to a shared determination. "At Rio the two sides were shouting past each other," Sir Martin said. "Now we have a real dialogue."
But he acknowledged that the world had not lived up to the lip service paid to forest conservation at the Earth Summit. "Some trends in the misuse of forests have not been reversed, and in some parts of the world they are accelerating," he said.

HEADLINE: Too Many Lawyers? Wait Until 2005

BYLINE: By Richard Dooling; Richard Dooling, a lawyer and novelist, is author of "Blue Streak: Swearing, Free Speech and Sexual Harassment."

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently predicted that we will have 28 percent more lawyers by the year 2005. That means 839,000 working lawyers, compared with the 656,000 practicing law in 1994. From another perspective: Job growth in the legal profession will be twice the average projected for all occupations. Pretty promising stats for the most hated profession in the America.
Everybody detests lawyers, but we can't seem to make them fast enough. The same people who nod approvingly when it is reported that the number of sexual harassment cases has increased by 300 percent, or that environmental litigation has doubled, draw another breath and vent their spleen on the profession charged with drafting, enforcing, interpreting and litigating their beloved regulations. 
 We despise lawyers, but we seem to like laws, especially when they provide us with federally mandated extra maternity days in the hospital, federally guaranteed unpaid leaves from our jobs and, perhaps in the near future, federally guaranteed rights to coffee brewed at federally regulated temperatures.
Passing more comprehensive and more intrusive laws every year and then blaming the growing number of lawyers for the ensuing litigation is a little like starting a war and then blaming the casualties on the growing number of morticians.
In the first 70 years of this century, 25 laws regulating employment were adopted. Between 1970 and 1993, Congress passed 72 more, including such Gordian knots of legal obfuscation as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Small wonder that one growth area is employment law, with the hottest segment being sexual harassment litigation.
We've also passed new and better laws governing the environment and health care. No surprise that a bumper crop of environmental litigators and joint-degree lawyer-hospital administrators are projected to arrive on schedule.
The angels of our better natures were no doubt in charge when we passed most of these important, popular laws. But even an angel can use a smart lawyer. New laws or expanded interpretations of old ones are often widely supported because they confer rights or attack perceived vices. But laws spawn litigation, and litigation brings its own costs, including huge bills from teams of lawyers who are simply doing their jobs and resolving disputes authorized by the laws we have passed.
They are no more reprehensible than any other free agent in a free market economy. They can be for or against rights or vices, depending on whose ox is being gored and whether the fee is being paid by the cattlemen or the slaughterhouse. But without laws to fight over, they are out of work. Even the most carefully drafted Family Leave Act, for example, will throng the docket with lawyers paid by the hour to argue over the statutory definitions of "family" and "leave."
Then, of course, committees of lawyers must write and read the inevitable accompanying voluminous regulations detailing record-keeping, administrative procedures, filing requirements and other stuporifics so unspeakably dense, tedious and prolix that no lawyers in their right minds would invest the time and effort required to read and understand them, unless they were getting paid $200 an hour for their trouble -- present company included.
Is all of this worth the mandatory leave heretofore denied by a small percentage of hard-hearted employers? "Yes! Definitely," scream the lawyers. Now go ask your barber if you need a haircut.
 The old Latin proverb put it best: We labored first with vices, now with laws. How much of our hostility toward lawyers is displaced frustration with the limits of laws and lawsuits? And if those dreaded lawyers keep popping up everywhere, maybe it's because we have an irrational faith in litigation.
Maybe we legislate to express our compassion for our fellow citizens and then blame lawyers when our statutory works of art go into the meat grinder of litigation. We have not yet absorbed the lesson learned by Voltaire, who said: "I was never ruined but twice: Once when I lost a lawsuit, and once when I won one."

HEADLINE: Condolence Calls Put Rare Light on Deng's Family

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Just north of the Forbidden City, where China's emperors once lived, a maze of dusty lanes and grubby back alleys are punctuated by simple red doorways befitting ramshackle homes. Behind some of these doorways, however, lie the elegant and spacious courtyard dwellings of the families of China's Communist Party leaders, a new kind of Forbidden City.
In one dirt-and-cobblestone lane, one black limousine after another came to call this week to see the elderly widow and five middle-aged children of Deng Xiaoping. 
 The visitors were classmates and colleagues, relatives and friends, fellow members of a select club: the sons and daughters to China's senior leaders, also known as princelings, or taizi, as they are called in Chinese.
The five Deng children have enjoyed being at the pinnacle of this club for years, but one question that looms over Beijing since Mr. Deng's death is exactly how it will affect them.
Mr. Deng's death has not led to any repudiation of his rule, at least not yet, so there is no sudden movement to purge his relatives. Their wealth, though it causes resentment among more ordinary folk, is partly protected by the deep sense of fraternity among the politically privileged.
"None of the Deng children have any money problems, but the problem lies right there," said the daughter of a senior official, suggesting that they had taken advantage of their positions to make large sums of money. "They are all vulnerable, but I don't think anything will happen to them unless they look as if they're getting excessive." She spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Translating superior connections into lucrative business, the class of princelings has profited enormously from the economic freedom the previous generation introduced.
The myth of Communist China was that everyone would be equal, if poor; today's version is that a socialist-market economy gives everyone a chance to grow rich. But the rules are stacked, it turns out, in favor of the families of the leaders who make the rules.
While the Deng family's position at the top of this club has receded slightly with Mr. Deng's health in the last year or two, the brothers and sisters are so entrenched in the network that purging one or more would require serious political effort by Jiang Zemin, China's President.
Last year he had a chance. The younger of Mr. Deng's sons, Deng Zhifang, was at the top of a state-run corporation whose leaders were prosecuted for corruption.
Deng Zhifang returned to China in 1990 after studying physics at the University of Rochester for seven years. A socially awkward man, he was fascinated by the challenge of adapting computer software to Chinese characters, but, apparently unable to resist the lure, he turned to business.
He accepted some of the deals offered by the many Hong Kong businessmen looking for "iron connections" within China, including a partnership with Li Ka-shing, a billionaire real estate developer. But the young Mr. Deng became most closely allied with Zhou Beifang, who headed the Hong Kong subsidiary of China's leading steel producer, Shougang Corporation, and whose father, Zhou Guanwu, the head of the corporation, was close to Deng Xiaoping.
Last November, when the younger Mr. Zhou was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes of more than $1 million, it was unclear whether Deng Zhifang would also be investigated, a decision so sensitive that it could be made only with the approval of President Jiang. Since then, Mr. Deng has resigned his position as a managing director at the Hong Kong company, but remains a consultant.
"Deng Zhifang has probably set it up so he can go overseas if he needs to," a member of a prominent political family said. "It's hard to imagine Jiang Zemin moving against him."
Deng Xiaoping's youngest daughter, Xiao Rong, angered senior leaders when she gave The New York Times an interview in January 1995 without their prior permission, and discussed her father's failing health.
Deng Pufang, her older brother, made a speech last summer that ostensibly defended his father's aggressive economic reform policies, but which apparently was interpreted by some senior officials as a defense of the Deng family's influence, and their right to wield it.
Family members are said to have frequently quarreled with the Communist Party staff over how to care for Mr. Deng as his health deteriorated. These instances may be a normal part of the push-and-pull tension that always exists between a political family and the government with which it is intertwined.
Yet such clashes often required the intervention of Wang Ruilin, a top aide to Mr. Deng for decades, and head of Mr. Deng's personal office until it was formally disbanded a few months ago.
"The importance of his role in assisting Jiang Zemin has been in getting the Deng family out of politics," said Michael D. Swaine, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Policy at the Rand Corporation.
Zhuo Lin, Mr. Deng's wife of 58 years, is 80 and has suffered from a nerve disease that became so painful, acquaintances said, that one day last year she took so many painkillers that she almost died. The panic that ensued among doctors set off a round of rumors that Mr. Deng was close to death, before word gradually spread that it was his wife.
The leader's widow is said to eschew the kind of ostentatious luxury her children enjoy, keeping with the tradition of the elder generation of China's leaders, who extolled Communism and simple living.
But the sons and daughters of senior leaders are highly secretive and almost tribal in the way they keep to insulated circles of friends, It is often difficult to uncover even the most basic information about them, including where they work or live or invest their money, except in unusual cases like Deng Zhifang's.
Yet some information is available:
*Deng Lin, the eldest daughter, 55, was once a painter of traditional Chinese watercolors who more recently started dabbling in abstract expressionism. Critics have not been as enthusiastic about her work as have Japanese businessmen, particularly ones with operations in China.
*Deng Pufang, the eldest son, 52, is chairman of China's Federation for the Disabled. He has used a wheelchair since he fell from a fourth-story window after being harassed by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.
*Deng Nan, a second daughter, 51, is a deputy minister in the State Commission for Science and Technology.
*Xiao Rong, 46, who for years accompanied her father and yelled in his ear to compensate for his poor hearing, has two positions listed on her business card: deputy chairwoman of the China Association for International Friendly Contact, and deputy to the National People's Congress, the rough equivalent of a Congresswoman.
Also a consultant to many Hong Kong companies, Xiao Rong has said she still draws a $125-a-month salary from the army, where she once worked full time.
Her husband, He Ping, is president of the Poly Group, one of China's leading arms sellers.
Deng Xiaoping had four grandchildren, and at least one is enrolled in a secondary school in the United States.
Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, when a breakdown in social and political order meant that the families of leaders were divided, persecuted and often sent to internal exile, the system has deemed that party families maintain discipline; consequently, few are actually prosecuted except in extreme and unusual cases, like Zhou Beifang's.
Nor do they like to talk to, or at times even be seen by, outsiders.
This week, a few policemen stood at the entrance to the lane, firmly stopping any outsiders who tried to enter, saying the residential street was "a restricted military area." It is such a small and modest-looking lane, an outsider might be forgiven for thinking it an unlikely place for a home for a man who once ruled a fifth of humanity.

HEADLINE: Files Hint of Illegal Venezuelan Link to Democrats

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
The Manhattan District Attorney said yesterday that he had given Federal prosecutors evidence that a Venezuelan banking family might have illegally funneled campaign contributions to the Democratic Party during the 1992 election.
The contributions, of roughly $92,000, are listed in Federal Election Commission records as coming in 1992 from a Miami lawyer for the bankers, Charles Intriago, and a member of the banking family, Jorge Castro Barredo, who is an American citizen. 
 But in a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court last year, prosecutors said they had evidence that the Americans had been reimbursed by companies controlled by the Castro family in Venezeula. It is illegal for foreign citizens or companies to make campaign contributions to American political campaigns or for contributions to be made through surrogates.
District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau made his remarks in an interview yesterday, three days after three members of the Castro family were convicted in a bank fraud case brought by his office.
In recent months, in a widening controversy surrounding campaign fund raising, the Democratic National Committee has acknowledged that it received $1.6 million in illegal contributions from foreign companies or individuals, most of them in 1994 and 1995. The contributions described by Mr. Morgenthau would be the earliest known donations to have come under question.
Amy Weiss Tobe, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said the organization knew nothing of the contributions but would look into them.
Mr. Morgenthau said that during his inquiry into the Castro banking empire, one of the largest in Venezuela, "we came across contributions to the Democratic National Committee which may have been made illegally by offshore entities."
He provided no additional details.
Mr. Morgenthau said he had turned over the material, including evidence obtained through a Manhattan grand jury, to Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Miami. The prosecutors in Miami received the information in October, and those in Manhattan in January, he said.
A spokesman for the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, in Miami, declined to comment. "The Department of Justice's policy is to neither confirm nor deny an investigation," said the spokesman, Wilfredo Fernandez. "If there ever comes a time when there is something appropriate to say, we will say it."
Before the 1994 collapse of Venezuela's banking system, the Castro family, led by Orlando Castro Llanes, controlled banks, real estate companies and a network of radio stations. Most of the family's financial holdings were lost in the collapse, and Mr. Castro Llanes has been living in Florida.
Mr. Morgenthau said yesterday that he did not know why the contributions had been made. "That would be rank speculation on my part," he said. "We could all guess, but I don't have any information on that."
In 1991, Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn tried to seize $1 million from one of the Castros' banks, maintaining that the money had been transferred as part of a money-laundering scheme. But the matter was dismissed at the request of Federal lawyers before any of the contributions had been made.
The lawyer who represented the Castros at the time, Kenneth Kaplan, said the allegations concerned one of the bank's clients and not the Castros. "The government was not able to prove anything," Mr. Kaplan said. "It was dismissed, and that is how it ended."
In the Manhattan Supreme Court case, a jury on Wednesday convicted Mr. Castro Llanes, his son Orlando Castro Castro and Jorge Castro Barredo, a grandson of Mr. Castro Llanes, on various charges stemming from the bank collapse in Venezuela. They face sentences ranging from four years for Mr. Castro Llanes to up to 25 years for the other two.
The questions about the campaign contributions were first made public in a bail hearing for the Castros in last May. The assistant district attorney handling the case, Joseph Dawson, told a State Supreme Court judge that the men should not be allowed to go free on bail because of what he called efforts they had made to avoid prosecution.
According to a transcript of the bail hearing, Mr. Dawson said prosecutors had obtained evidence showing that Mr. Castro Barredo and Mr. Intriago had "made substantial political contributions in apparent violation of Federal law through payments made by Jorge Castro Barredo, Intriago himself, and at least one other Castro family member, which funds were later reimbursed through Castro-controlled companies."
Yesterday, Mr. Intriago vehemently denied the prosecutor's assertions.
"It is a bunch of baloney," he said in an interview. "These were my contributions. I did not get anything from anyone offshore."
Mr. Intriago said he had represented Mr. Castro Llanes as a lawyer since 1980 but had not consulted with him or dealt with him in any way regarding campaign contributions.
Andrew Lawler, a lawyer representing Mr. Intriago, said no law enforcement officials had ever approached him about the campaign contributions. Mr. Lawler said he had contacted the district attorney's office to object to the allegation made at the bail hearing.
"It damages his reputation under circumstances where he has no opportunity to respond," Mr. Lawler said. "No one has been in contact with us to indicate that there was an ongoing investigation or that there were questions to be answered."
"If there is, we will be happy to respond and provide whatever information they want."
Richard Sharpstein, the lawyer who defended Mr. Castro Llanes during his trial in Manhattan, said there was no basis for Mr. Morgenthau's accusations. Mr. Sharpstein said that not only was there no evidence that the contributions were improper but also there was nothing to suggest that the Castros had received any favors from the United States Government. In fact, Mr. Sharpstein said, Mr. Castro is the only Venezuelan banker, among many involved in the 1994 collapse of the Venezuelan banking system, who has been prosecuted in the United States and is now facing jail time.
"The suggested issue is some type of corruption and that is ridiculous and asinine," he said.
Asked about a photograph of Mr. Castro Llanes shaking hands with President Clinton that appeared in Latin American newspapers, Mr. Sharpstein said it had been taken during a large conference of Latin American business leaders at the White House. Mr. Castro Llanes at the time was one of the leading business figures in Venezuela and was attending the conference, he said.
"The President happened to be standing near Mr. Castro and he took the same picture that a million other people have," Mr. Sharpstein said.
Thousands of people in that country lost several billion dollars after the Venezuelan banking system collapsed in 1994, and the Castros were charged with fraud in Venezuela following the collapse.
In an unusual prosecution for a local district attorney's office, the Castros were charged in Manhattan with defrauding depositors at their bank in Venezuela.
Mr. Morgenthau has said he agreed to prosecute the Castros for bank fraud at the request of the Venezuelan Government and following an investigation by auditors at the New York Federal Reserve bank. As the basis for his prosecution, Mr. Morgenthau argued that New York banks had been used to transfer money between the Castros' banks in Venezuela and banks in Puerto Rico.
Mr. Sharpstein has argued that the Castros were targets of a political vendetta in Venezuela and that the case against them was fabricated by people trying to destroy their businesses there. He has said that the Manhattan prosecutors were used as tools by the Venezuelan Government, which he said had manipulated the evidence and witnesses.
Mr. Sharpstein has also repeatedly questioned the decision to prosecute the case in New York when no New Yorkers were involved in the fraud and there were no victims in United States.
But Mr. Morgenthau said the contributions "show the major U.S. interest in this case."

The Next 42d Street

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH; Russell Baker is on vacation.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Above the entrance of a grim old office building in the Loop is a plastic sign ubiquitous in American downtowns: CHECKS CASHED MONEY ORDERS. Then you walk through the door and, as if propelled by a cinematic jump-cut, stumble instead into a dusty Xanadu -- an abandoned 1926 movie palace with a balcony that stretches to Heaven and a gilt-and-camp decor that a historian described as "a cross-cultural concoction of Cambodian chimeras, Indian elephants and Thai-inspired temples."
The theater, named the Oriental, is littered with cigarette butts and scarred by graffiti. In its last theatrical incarnation, as an action-movie outlet in the late 1970's, it was home to rats, gangs and drug-dealers. Then came oblivion. "A number of Chicagoans, including some of the city's professional planners, had no idea there was a theater in that place," says Greg Longhini of Chicago's Planning Department -- even though the Oriental is but a minute's stroll from City Hall. 
 Today the Oriental is the centerpiece of the most ambitious downtown renewal effort in an American city since -- well, since New York's refurbishing of 42d Street. And the two cities' tales are in some ways uncannily similar. A tour of the Oriental and other adjacent, abandoned theaters slated for restoration here eerily recalled my visit to the slumbering playhouses of Times Square only three years ago, when Disney's arrival was still a rumor.
Some of the corporate players are also the same. Garth Drabinsky, the Canadian producer who is building a 42d Street showcase for his musical version of "Ragtime," is the savior of the Oriental. Disney has taken a long-term lease on the nearby Chicago Theater, a similar old movie palace now used for theatrical attractions. Two other 1920's North Loop theaters set for revamping -- the side-by-side Harris and Selwyn -- share the names and builders of two houses on 42d Street.
But Chicago, second to no city, is not copying New York. The dream of a revitalized Theater Row here had its own origins some 20 years ago and is far more focused on adding legitimate theaters than is the 42d Street plan. Its godfather is Lew Manilow, a prominent attorney and fund-raiser (for Democrats and cultural institutions) who has long wanted to build an expansive new complex for Chicago's premiere nonprofit theater company, the Goodman, on a lot encompassing the Harris and Selwyn. Mr. Manilow is a theater nut -- he produced an Off Broadway hit, Sean O'Casey's "Purple Dust," in 1956 -- and has pleaded his cause to five Chicago Mayors. In Richard M. Daley he says he has found a kindred spirit. Mayor Daley not only goes to the theater "but stays for the whole play," adds Roche Schulfer, the Goodman's executive director.
What the Mayor stresses, though, is the importance of culture and entertainment as an economic engine for the city; his administration regards the $160 million it has earmarked for the North Loop as an investment in future tax and tourist revenues. Chicago business leaders, exemplified by John Bryan of Sara Lee, know that culture also pays off as a magnet for attracting top executives to town. Corporate largess accounts for most of a staggering $230 million raised in recent drives for the Chicago Symphony, Lyric Opera, Art Institute and Museum of Contemporary Art, according to Mr. Manilow.
Whether the drawing power of those great high-culture institutions will rub off on the North Loop is unknown. Chicago could end up with more big theaters than shows to fill them. But like the Times Square revival, the Loop's at least raises the hope, wild though it may be, of reversing three decades of downtown entertainment-district decay prompted by white flight to the suburbs and their malls.
Outside the Harris and Selwyn -- both abandoned in the 1950's -- is a much earlier vintage of urban hope. In a 1922 "Dedicatory" poster, the theaters' impresarios declare their "unlimited faith" in Chicago's future and their "desire to give the people of this Wonder City, to their children and their children's children, two perfect temples of the seven arts of the stage." The innocence of this statement juxtaposed with the theaters' subsequent fates was only yesterday another cruel urban irony. What dramatist could have imagined that after a 40-year intermission the curtain would rise on so stunning a second act?

HEADLINE: Pataki Says Waiving of Food Stamp Rules Doesn't Signal Economic Problems

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Defying claims to the contrary, Gov. George E. Pataki said today that his decision to give 38 counties and cities with high unemployment rates the option of waiving stricter new welfare rules did not signal that the state was having economic problems.
The move is intended to prevent tens of thousands of needy New Yorkers who are willing to work from losing their food stamp benefits because they are unable to find jobs. Under the new Federal rules, adults would have to work in exchange for their food stamps. But the Government has allowed states to request a waiver of those rules. 
 The request by Mr. Pataki, whose administration had been reluctant to ask for such a waiver, came as he faced increasing attacks from the clergy, Democratic lawmakers and from advocates for the poor who warned that people would go hungry if he did not act.
In seeking the waiver, the Governor, who has hailed New York's economic revival during his administration, tacitly acknowledged that there were still regions in the state that were struggling.
But Mr. Pataki maintained today that the main reason for seeking the waiver had nothing to do with the state of the economy in those localities. Rather, he said, the waiver was intended to give counties the time they need to create workfare jobs or volunteer programs for unemployed food stamp recipients. He also noted that he never expected that all recipients would immediately find jobs with private businesses.
"It has nothing to do with private jobs or the economy," Mr. Pataki said, adding later, "It's a question of having workfare programs available."
The tightened Federal food stamp rules, which are to go into effect March 1, will provide no more than three months of food stamps a year for able-bodied, childless adults under 50 who are not working at least 20 hours a week.
Mr. Pataki is seeking a waiver that will extend only until Nov. 21. He said he intended to give localities with relatively high levels of unemployment, including New York City, the option of either waiving or enforcing the stricter food stamp rules.
Anthony P. Coles, deputy counsel to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said today that New York City had been ready to place food stamp recipients in workfare jobs if Mr. Pataki had not decided to seek a waiver from the Federal Government. "But if the state did seek a waiver," he said, "then we would make sure that food stamp recipients in the city are treated the same way as recipients elsewhere in the state."
Thirteen other states -- including Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island and Texas -- have applied for similar waivers by declaring that there are pockets in those states where the labor market is too weak to absorb welfare recipients. Such areas have generally been defined as those in which the unemployment rate is at least 20 percent above the national average of 5.4 percent.
Until today, the Pataki administration had refused to apply for such a waiver. Instead, it sought a narrower waiver that would apply only to areas where unemployment rates were above 10 percent. In New York State, only two such areas exist: the Bronx and Hamilton County, in the southern Adirondacks.
The United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal agency that administers the food stamp program, has been granting states one-year waivers from the rule, which can be renewed. But New York is the only state so far to request a waiver that would run for less than a year, said Yvette Jackson, the deputy administrator for the agency's food and consumer division.
The Pataki administration said it decided to request a waiver of nine months because it believed that was about as much time counties would need to place recipients in volunteer or workfare jobs. The administration has long argued that at most, 17,000 people might lose their benefits, and that they would eventually be placed in volunteer or other jobs created by local governments.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Governor, said a number of counties indicated that they will probably not seek the waiver. "They're saying: 'Thanks for the waiver, but we don't need it,' " he said.
Mr. Pataki's decision drew cautious praise from advocates for the poor, who had argued that many of the 100,000 able-bodied adults receiving food stamps would have lost their benefits in the next three months if the Governor had not acted.
But they expressed concern that there were not enough private jobs to absorb the recipients, and said they doubted that counties would be able to create enough workfare jobs. They said the Governor, before he allows any counties to turn down the waiver, should seek assurances that they will not deny benefits to food stamp recipients who are unable to find jobs.

Albright Tries to Assure Russians About NATO
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, visiting Moscow, tried to assure President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Russian people that NATO was "no longer a situation of you versus us." But she seemed to make little headway in easing Russian anxiety about expansion of the Western alliance. Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov said that Russia remained "negatively disposed to the expansion of NATO." 1
 
Mexico Approval Is Expected
The Clinton Administration expects to certify Mexico as an ally in the war against illegal drugs despite the arrest of Mexico's chief antidrug official for links to drug traffickers, officials in Washington said. Some American law enforcement officials said the revelation of corruption at such a high level should have prompted a serious review of what has become an almost automatic certification of Mexico. 1 

Praise for Deng's Policies
President Jiang Zemin of China, speaking publicly for the first time since the death of his mentor Deng Xiaoping, vowed to pursue the economic changes that have turned China into a rising superpower. Security forces tightened their control of the capital before Mr. Deng's memorial service next week. 3
 
Reversal by North Korea
North Korea announced that it would attend a briefing given by the United States and South Korea to explain proposed peace talks for the Korean peninsula. North Korea also named a new Acting Prime Minister, Hong Song Nam, a sign that Prime Minister Kang Song San has been replaced. 3
 
Serbian Protesters Take Over
Serbia's opposition coalition took control of the Belgrade City Council, the biggest prize so far in its fight to topple President Slobodan Milosevic and a main goal of its nearly three months of street protests. Zoran Djindjic, above, a philosopher-turned-politician and one of three leaders of the demonstrations, was elected Mayor. He is the third non-Communist to hold the post since 1945. 7
 
Forest Talks End in Division
More than 70 governments ended two years of United Nations talks deeply divided over whether to propose binding steps to curb overlogging. If foes stand their ground, no firm action on forestry is likely when world leaders gather in June for the fifth anniversary of the Rio de Janeiro environmental summit meeting. 7
 
British Prisoners Freed
A British judge freed three men who had served 18 years in prison for murder. Prosecutors conceded that their 1979 trial had been "fundamentally flawed." The judge released the three on bail, pending a hearing in April. They are expected to be exonerated and compensated, though meagerly, for their years in prison. 7

Starr Reverses Course On Quitting Whitewater
Kenneth W. Starr reversed himself and said he would, after all, stay on as the Whitewater independent counsel until the investigation was complete. He said he had come to realize that his departure to become a dean at a California university would harm the investigation. 1
 
Democrats to Return More
The Democratic Party said it would return additional contributions from sources that were either "unverifiable or improper." The contributions were identified by an internal audit commissioned after questions were posed about the party's fund-raising. One report said more than $1 million was involved. 1
 
Illegal Gifts in 1992 Are Alleged
The Manhattan District Attorney said he had given Federal prosecutors evidence that a Venezuelan banking family might have illegally funneled campaign contributions to the Democratic Party during the 1992 election. That is earlier than the illegal foreign contributions that the Democrats have admitted receiving, which came mainly in 1994 and 1995. The Democratic National Committee said it would investigate. 10
 
Little Use for Ratings System
Interviews and a poll found that most parents say they are not using the new rating system for television programs to guide their children's viewing. Nearly all said that in principle they endorse rating television programs. But some said they found the new system confusing, while others said they didn't trust it. 8
 
Concern Over Beef Processing
The Agriculture Department said a new machine for deboning beef contaminated ground beef with bits of bone and spinal cord. That could be a health issue because spinal cord tissue has been implicated in bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. No case of the disease has been found so far in the United States. 8

Jurors began deliberating in the case of a doctor who is charged in Federal court with illegally putting unapproved drugs into interstate commerce. The doctor, Stanislaw Burzynski, has said he offers the drugs to cancer victims to save lives. 9
 
Ex-Informer Faces Deportation
The Clinton Administration is seeking to deport a former Salvadoran guerrilla commander who was secretly resettled in the United States by Federal officials. The man, Pedro Antonio Andrade, is seeking political asylum; the Government says he was a terrorist who was involved in a 1985 attack in San Salvador in which six Americans were killed. 9

HEADLINE: North Korea Inches Toward Talks to Finally End '50-'53 War

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 21

 BODY:
North Korea confirmed today that it would attend a briefing by the United States and South Korea to explain proposed peace talks.
North Korea also named a new Acting Prime Minister, Hong Song Nam, a sign that Prime Minister Kang Song San has been replaced. The move set off speculation about a power struggle, but some analysts say the change was made because Mr. Kang, 66, has been ill. 
 North Korea's decision to attend the briefing, to be held on March 5 in New York, is a further sign that efforts to improve relations have not been derailed by the defection of a high-ranking North Korean ideologue or the shooting of another defector near Seoul. But attendance does not necessarily mean that the North will join full peace talks.
In the drive to improve relations, the United States and South Korea have announced food aid to North Korea, which is experiencing widespread famine. They also plan to send a team to survey a site in the North where they plan to build two nuclear power plants to replace plants that the North was suspected of using to produce bomb fuel.
North Korea appears to have accepted the defection of a senior ideologue, Hwang Jang Yop, who is in the South Korean Consulate in Beijing seeking asylum. He is expected to come to Seoul as early as next week. But news reports from China indicate that South Korea will have to agree not to use Mr. Hwang in propaganda against the North.
Last April Washington and Seoul proposed that the two Koreas, the United States and China draft a peace treaty to replace the fragile armistice that ended the Korean War. Pyongyang agreed to attend a briefing on the proposal but has twice put it off in an effort to get Washington to push Cargill, the American agribusiness giant, to provide North Korea with 500,000 tons of grain on favorable terms. The United States said it would not intervene in private negotiations.
South Korean officials say Pyongyang is agreeing to the briefing because the United States has promised to hold high-level bilateral talks with North Korea immediately afterward. Pyongyang has made little secret of its desire to improve relations with Washington, while cutting Seoul out of the picture.
Madeleine K. Albright, the Secretary of State, who is to hold talks here this weekend, is expected to send a signal to North Korea that it cannot drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. [Mrs. Albright arrived in Seoul early Saturday.]
News of the change in prime ministers came in a broadcast from Pyongyang radio announcing that Mr. Hong, in the role of Acting Prime Minister, had sent condolences to China on the death of Deng Xiaoping.
(Another radio report, quoted by Reuters, announced the death of North Korea's Defense Minister, Choe Kwang. Mr. Choe, 78, who died of a heart attack, had been Defense Minister since October 1995.)
Some reports speculated that Mr. Kang, the current Prime Minister, was being made to accept responsibility for Mr. Hwang's defection, or that both the defection and the change suggested a power struggle.
But Suh Jae Jean, director of the unification policy division at the Korea Institute for National Unification, which is affiliated with the South Korean Government, said the move was probably related to Mr. Kang's failing health.
Mr. Hong, 73, an engineer who has been a deputy prime minister, is considered an expert on China hand who can maintain good relations with China, North Korea's main ally, Dr. Suh said.
Mr. Kang was not as powerful as his No. 2 ranking in the hierarchy would indicate, Dr. Suh said. The prime minister normally deals with economics; politics and military affairs are handled by the Communist Party.

HEADLINE: Clinton Trampled Labor in Airline Dispute;
Regulation Redux?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
By invoking the 1926 Railway Labor Act, President Clinton has prevented a strike by the pilots of American Airlines in a startling way that has yet to be mentioned (news article, Feb. 15). Railroad laws were based upon the operation of regulated industries. As public utilities, the continuous operations of such industries are deemed essential to "public convenience and necessity." 
 The airlines were deregulated in 1978, yet the President is dealing with this strike as if the industry were still subject to the economic regulation of the Civil Aeronautics Board. The President's decision appears to have unusually broad ramifications.

HEADLINE: Despite Scandal, U.S. Plans To Certify Mexico Drug Fight

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Despite the shock over the recent arrest of the Mexican Government's top anti-drug official on charges that he had links to drug traffickers, the Clinton Administration plans to certify Mexico next week as an ally in the war against illegal drugs, Government officials said today.
Mexican authorities arrested the official, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, on Feb. 6, accusing him of having collaborated with a notorious Mexican drug trafficker, but did not make the news public until this week. 
 The incident, which occurred two months after General Gutierrez started the job, caused embarrassment within the Clinton Administration, which had welcomed the general on a visit here only a few weeks ago.
Administration officials are also concerned about how much information on American efforts the general might have passed on to the man reported to be his associate, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, whose criminal syndicate has smuggled tons of cocaine, heroin and marijuana across the border.
Some American law enforcement officials said the revelation of corruption at such a high level should have prompted a serious review of what has become an almost automatic certification of Mexico, which is the United States' third-largest trading partner.
But several officials here said the internal discussion that followed the disclosure of the accusations against General Gutierrez amounted to damage control.
They said it did not lead to a new discussion about whether the role of Mexico as a neighbor, free-trade partner and magnet for American business investment should outweigh the fact that it is also a transit route for as much as two-thirds of the drugs that come into the United States.
Supporters of certification said Mexico's arrest of such a high-ranking official, in fact, demonstrated President Ernesto Zedillo's commitment to the fight against drug trafficking. By contrast, Colombia seems sure to be decertified for a second successive year, despite its modest progress in destroying some coca and poppy fields and in enacting a law that permits the seizure of drug assets.
An Administration official described the situation bluntly: "Mexico is in the vital national interest, and Colombia isn't."
The State Department is expected to announce a decision on Mexico's certification at an antidrug rally next Thursday or Friday. Department officials declined requests for interviews, as did others at the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Treasury Department, saying the matter was still being discussed.
At the White House, President Clinton's senior adviser, Rahm Emanuel, said President Clinton had not yet received formal recommendations on the certification from the State Department and an inter-agency working group considering the matter. Mr. Emanuel said he could not comment on what the President would decide.
But another official, calling Mexico's certification a done deal, said, "They have no choice but to move forward."
The discussions this year have been described as a pallid echo of the spirited arguments waged up until the deadline last year, with some law enforcement officials arguing that Mexico did not deserve certification, and financial and trade officials contending that the United States' relationship with Mexico should not be jeopardized by criticism of its drug problem.
Mexico's Foreign Minister, Jose Angel Gurria, who was in Washington today, emphasized in meetings that the dismissal and arrest of General Gutierrez showed that the Mexican Government was serious about policing drug traffickers.
"This is one area in which cooperation has to be very full, and sometimes it means we have to take some risks," the Foreign Minister said at a news conference in the Mexican Embassy.
Mr. Gurria also met with Attorney General Janet Reno, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, who is the White House's director of national drug policy, and members of the National Security Council.
In other briefings this week on the Administration's new national drug strategy, officials said Mexico should be viewed in the larger context of its overall relationship with the United States.
One official said Mexico was the key to the antidrug strategy and the top-priority plan to reduce the flow of drugs across the 2,000-mile-long border. The plan is to be released on Tuesday.
Meetings on Thursday between Mexico's Foreign Minister and Thomas F. McClarty, the former White House chief of staff, who is now responsible for Presidential affairs regarding Latin America, were further evidence that the scandal over General Gutierrez has not led the Administration to reconsider its treatment of Mexico.
Mr. Gurria said his discussions with Mr. McClarty included the length and itinerary of a visit to Mexico by President Clinton planned for April 11 and 12. The visit was announced earlier this month.
President Clinton would find it diplomatically awkward, if not impossible, to visit Mexico if he added it to his Administration's short list of pariah drug-trafficking countries. Last year that list included Afghanistan, Colombia, Iran, Myanmar, Nigeria and Syria, all of which are expected to be on the list again this year.
The prospect of certifying Mexico but not Colombia highlights the inconsistency that political considerations have interjected into the certification process since it became law in 1986.
The law requires the President to inform Congress annually about any lack of cooperation among countries that produce drugs or serve as transit points for drugs. The law also set up a mechanism for imposing trade and other economic sanctions on countries that fail to meet Washington's standards for cooperation.
But while Colombia looks all but certain to be "decertified," there is talk that sanctions could be waived for three to six months to give the Colombians a deadline to come up with a more convincing plan to combat drug production and trafficking.
Some American drug agents contend that Mexican traffickers, who had the support of the national police, now pose a worse threat to the United States than Colombian traffickers.
Doug Wankel, who recently retired as chief of operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said of the scandal over General Gutierrez: "This really points at the magnitude of the problem down there. If people didn't know it before, they really are aware of it now."
Mr. Gurria said at a news conference today that the Mexican Government had "absolutely no comment" on the certification issue because it was "an internal process of the United States." He went on to say that the process inhibited cooperation between countries.
"The reason why Mexico is fighting against drugs is not to obtain any country's certification," Mr. Gurria said. "We are fighting against drugs to preserve our institutions, to protect our youth."
 Because of another editing error, the article misstated Mexico's place in United States anti-drug policy. The State Department says that while Mexico holds a high priority in Washington's efforts to reduce the flow of drugs into the United States, there is no designation of top priority.

NAZI GERMANY
 AND THE JEWS
 Volume 1: The Years of Persecution, 1933-1939.
 By Saul Friedlander.
 436 pp. New York:
 HarperCollins Publishers. $30. 
 History and memory are distant yet often confused cousins. But as the example of the Holocaust shows, they differ greatly. Individual memories made possible the recollection of the Holocaust that is now part of collective memory: images of brave and terrified victims, of helpless children, of cattle cars and crematories, of corpses. But that memory becomes unhistorical, a scene from hell, as it is stripped of context. Historians, on the other hand, search for and sift evidence, insist on sequence and chronology, seek to make as precise a reconstruction of the past as is possible. Nowadays they tend to do so in narrow monographs, but occasionally a work of synthesis appears, as is the case here.
Since the gap between collective memory and history is especially great regarding the murder of six million Jews, general knowledge of how that horror happened is appallingly primitive. We have not thought enough about how it might not have happened, how it was not inevitable.
Saul Friedlander has long been haunted by the links between memory and history. Born just before Hitler came to power, to Jewish parents in Prague, he survived in enforced disguise in Roman Catholic hands in wartime France, while his parents perished in the East. He now teaches history in Israel and the United States. Mr. Friedlander draws strength from memory, yet adheres scrupulously to the discipline of a historian's detachment. He writes history with a novelist's sense of the telling detail; he is both analytic and evocative.
In "Nazi Germany and the Jews," his purpose is to assess the causes and contexts of Nazi policies and the responses to them among victims and among Germans. He switches with deliberate abruptness from the general -- state decisions and decrees -- to the particular, to the experiences of individual men and women, of Jews entrapped, of a German caught in bureaucratic wrangling about his claim to Aryan status. Such an impressively unconventional technique enhances the great value of his carefully constructed study.
The division of this projected two-volume work has meaning: "the years of persecution," as the subtitle of this first volume calls them, 1933-1939, differ fundamentally from the years of extermination. In these early years, Hitler -- and Mr. Friedlander is right to emphasize his direct and ultimate control in planning the anti-Jewish campaign -- sought the segregation and extrusion, not the extermination, of German Jewry. Aware of competing pressures upon him, Hitler had to curb his obsessional hatreds with tactical pragmatism. Among his followers he instilled or strengthened what Mr. Friedlander calls "redemptive anti-Semitism," according to which the Jew, defined by race, is all-powerful and all-malignant; if the Aryan, or Germanic, race is to survive, it must battle the Jewish menace, free Germany of the Jewish presence. This was the "idealistic" element in the poisonous fantasy: the threat of one's perdition, the promise of one's salvation.
The radicals in Hitler's party -- including Hitler himself, if he had followed his own vicious impulses -- would have chosen extrusion by immediate violence, the kind that the Nazis instantly visited upon political enemies like the Socialists and Communists. But Hitler gauged the limits of his "conservative" ministers, whom he needed for respectability; they, in turn, though imbued with various forms of traditional anti-Semitism, understood that the Jews' presence in Germany could not be extirpated all at once without calamitous effects on the country's well-being. Hitler also had to watch foreign responses to his persecution of Jews; Germany was economically vulnerable, and he had, if anything, an exaggerated view of Jewish power abroad.
Still, as Mr. Friedlander shows, ideological obsession was swiftly translated into enacted policy. By April 1933, only months after coming to power, the Nazis organized a boycott of Jewish enterprises and offices, which, though not a success, served to satisfy the party, to harm the Jews and to show the outside world that they were hostages. In the same month, the "Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service" (Nazis were masters of euphemism) stripped practically all Jews and Christians of Jewish descent, as well as "politically unreliable" people, of their positions in the Civil Service, a category that in Germany included university professors, judges, and doctors in public hospitals. The removal of Jews from cultural life, in which they had attained great prominence and visibility, proceeded apace.
In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws decreed that citizenship was limited to "Aryans." Jews became mere subjects of the state, and in order to enforce total segregation between Germans and Jews, intermarriage and sexual relations between them were forbidden. Thereafter, the most frequent denunciations to the Gestapo concerned "race defilement" (Rassenschande). Sexual insecurities and fantasies had their place in Nazi and German consciousness, as did pornography in their propaganda.
Strangely enough, as Mr. Friedlander notes, Nuremberg created the illusion among some Germans and Jews that segregation might be not a stage in but the end of Nazi discrimination against Jews. Actually, it was a decisive step in the policy of extrusion, clamored for in vicious propaganda. There were still 450,000 people of the Jewish faith in Germany, 50,000 more who were Christian by religion but Jewish by descent and decree (defined as having four grandparents who were Jewish) and approximately 200,000 Mischlinge, offspring of the union of German and Jew. The high degree of German-Jewish assimilation is implicit in this number. By making race the determining element, the Nazis declared converted Jews were full Jews, a policy that raised countless questions for the Christian churches and for Germans who now had to prove that they were racially pure. Germans anxiously had to hide their Jewish grandmothers or great-grandmothers (only to resurrect them with some pride after 1945). Germans, for a century obsessed by the question, "What is German?," now had to ask, "Who is Aryan?"
Mr. Friedlander, in assessing the German response to the anti-Jewish measures, notes -- as others have before him -- the "moral collapse" of the German elites, including the Christian churches. With few exceptions, German academics accepted the dismissal of their Jewish colleagues. Most, indeed, pledged enthusiastic support to the new regime.
Summarizing the German response to the Nuremberg laws, Mr. Friedlander persuasively concludes that "the bulk of the population disliked acts of violence but did not object to the disenfranchisement and segregation of the Jews." Most Germans seemed relieved that the state now controlled the Jewish presence in Germany, although there were exceptions, and as late as 1942 Goebbels was enraged that German intellectuals with philo-Semitic leanings were still to be found.
The reasons for enthusiastic support of the new regime, or at least grudging submission to it, were many, and their relative importance has been endlessly debated. Mr. Friedlander certainly does not claim that anti-Semitism was the sole cause; it probably was not even the principal one. There was, of course, a tradition of antagonism, or at least reserve, toward Jews, expressed in the old Imperial Germany in various forms of discrimination despite the guarantee of civic equality. Fanatical and paranoid anti-Semitism became ever more widespread, beginning with World War I and Germany's defeat and continuing during the unloved Weimar Republic. Hitler carried out his persecution of the Jews in the shadow of his great victories: the re-establishment of "order," an end to unemployment, the resurgence of German power. Charles Lindbergh was not the only American -- or the only foreigner -- who admired the Fuhrer's achievements.
Mr. Friedlander's second subject is the victims' reactions to persecution, their varied responses to the consequent alienation and dispossession. "The Jews themselves," he observes, "were only partly aware of the increasingly shaky ground on which they stood because, like so many others, they did not perceive the depth of liberal democracy's crisis." Hope and despair mingled, with some Zionists taking satisfaction from the prospect that Jewish cohesion could now be restored, and others encouraging a vibrant, if segregated, Jewish cultural life. Anguished debates about emigration took place, though the will to leave did not suffice; it became increasingly hard to find places to emigrate to.
By early 1938 Hitler's entourage had become radicalized, the conservatives in the Government had been dismissed and the international balance of power had changed: in defiance of treaties and promises, Hitler had rearmed, reoccupied the Rhineland and stood poised for limited war. In March, Austria was annexed, and 190,000 more Jews found themselves instantly threatened. "The persecution in Austria," Mr. Friedlander writes, "outpaced that in the Reich. Public humiliation was more blatant and sadistic; expropriation better organized; forced emigration more rapid."
The year 1938 spelled disaster for all Jews under German domination. The Nazis began to think of the "Austrian model," and in a stream of decrees they ordered the Jews' total elimination from German life. Businesses were ruinously "Aryanized," lawyers and doctors deprived of their licenses, all Jews systematically impoverished and degraded. The goal remained forced emigration, with the cynical hope that penniless, humiliated Jews arriving in other countries would promote anti-Semitism and thus sympathy for the Nazis.
Perhaps Mr. Friedlander's most distinctive contribution lies in his emphasis on the full context of this unfolding horror. The countries of Eastern Europe, for example, adopted ever greater anti-Semitic measures of their own, while the Western democracies practiced appeasement and watched anti-Semitic movements grow within their borders. The Munich Agreement, epitomizing Western weakness, emboldened the Nazis in November 1938 to pounce on the assassination of a German diplomat by a Polish Jew as a pretext for the pogrom known as Kristallnacht, in which party squads destroyed 267 synagogues, vandalized 7,500 businesses and herded some 30,000 Jewish men into concentration camps, to be released only on the promise of immediate emigration.
AND what was the German response to this public, nationwide violation of every civilized norm? Protestant and Catholic clergy -- despite their presumed respect for the sanctity of places of worship -- kept silence, as did virtually all other Germans in the face of a terrorist regime. Many individual Germans disapproved, but passivity had become habitual. Mr. Friedlander concludes: "Outside party ranks, there was no massive popular agitation" to expel the Jews from Germany or "to unleash violence against them. The majority of the Germans accepted the steps taken by the regime and . . . looked the other way." This is a terrifying indictment, and one to heed: silent submission to state criminality can and does occur at any time and anywhere.
"Redemptive anti-Semitism" -- Mr. Friedlander's highly persuasive interpretation of Nazi thought -- was "an ideological trend shared at the outset by a small minority only, and, in the Third Reich, by a segment of the party and its leaders, not by the majority of the population." Assessments of popular attitudes in a totalitarian society are at best approximations, but his nuanced view seems plausible.
Even as Jews were hounded to unimaginable misery, even as Nazi anti-Semitic rhetoric soared to new heights, the German Government continued to force Jewish emigration. But a frightened, callous world had slammed most doors shut, and the escape from hell became almost impossible. We today know the worst was yet to come, but Mr. Friedlander cautions that before the war, "no program of extermination had been worked out, no clear intentions could be identified."
"Nazi Germany and the Jews" is a synthesis of recent scholarship, supplemented by adroit explorations in archives. It provides a readable, reliable, commendably unconventional overview; it is necessarily a book of idiosyncratic compression. Only rarely does Mr. Friedlander slip -- as when he states that Carl Goerdeler, the archconservative Mayor of Leipzig (and later a prominent member of the conspiracy to overthrow Hitler), ordered the removal of Felix Mendelssohn's statue in front of the concert hall. On the contrary, the local party boss ordered its removal while Goerdeler was away, and upon his return and in response, he resigned his post. Conservatives like him held various anti-Jewish prejudices, but most of them believed in the "good Jew," in the Jew of taste and accomplishment, especially in the classic Jewish masters of the past like Mendelssohn.
A great merit of this book is its implicit moral judgment on so much culpability, complicity and cowardice among not only Germans but also those not yet under the German heel. Some of France's most prominent Jews pressured their Government to limit the influx of refugees. Two weeks after Germany's absorption of Austria, Switzerland's Federal Council sought to bar Jewish immigration: "If we do not want to create a basis for an anti-Semitic movement that would be unworthy of our country, we must defend ourselves with all our strength and, if need be, with ruthlessness against the immigration of foreign Jews." Closing the book, I was reminded of a diary entry by Britain's Permanent Under Secretary of the Foreign Office, Sir Alexander Cadogan, written a week before Munich: "We must go on being cowards up to our limit, but not beyond." In that short era of Hitler triumphant, how many people exceeded that limit!
Yet there were exceptions, some of them noted in this book: righteous people, who at a time of the fiercest terror and at grave risk, instinctively reached out to the victims with a piece of bread, an offered haven, a human gesture. They need to be remembered and honored. Their example should serve as a judgment on the past and an admonition to the future.

Keeping Your Powder Dry

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
THE RETURN OF the regular, monthly Presidential news conference is a fine thing, not the least because it gives us a chance to instruct the Chief Executive -- and one another -- on the use of famous phrases.
Pleased at the prospect of bipartisan cooperation, President Clinton said, "Now both sides are keeping their powder dry enough to create the possibility we can reach a balanced budget agreement." Later, he returned to the phrase: "I would ask our friends on the Republican side and the Democrats who care as passionately as I do, just keep our powder dry." 
 His meaning in both contexts is clear: "remain calm, keep cool." But that is only half the meaning of the phrase and misses the most telling part.
Oliver Cromwell, at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642, is supposed to have told his Roundhead troops in that opening fight of the English civil war, "Put your trust in God, my boys, but mind to keep your powder dry." (Nobody wrote it down at the time, and its first report came in 1834, but I say let's give it to him.)
The Pretender wasn't talking talcum; gunpowder was his subject, and when the powder is wet, the gun does not go off and the ammunition just sits there. The attraction of the phrase was its combination of what Bergen Evans called "piety and practicality." That combination was repeated in World War II in the saying and song, "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition."
The purpose of keeping powder dry is to be able to blaze away at the proper time. Thus, the phrase keep your powder dry is not limited to "stay calm" but carries an implicit, most ominous threat: "and be prepared to blow the enemy's head off at the propitious moment."
That cannot be the message that Clinton, in his bipartisan mood, intended to convey. On the other hand, in this column I'm a lexicographer and usagist, not a mind reader.
 
Salami in a Spoon
At the annual conclave of executive heavies, political powers, scientific Nobelniks and media biggies known as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, words have historic resonance and metaphors fly. This was the year of the "network society," plugging a plugged-in world, and the netties found it easy to get hooked.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister, held a breakfast for diplomatic reporters and foreign-policy sages. He used a word that he knew would reverberate among the hypercognoscenti.
"This will come as a shock," he told the assembled power pack, "but in the case of Europe, Israel hopes for an evenhanded policy."
Netties nodded knowledgeably. Evenhanded has long been a code word in America's Middle East diplomacy. From the 50's through the 70's, State Department "Arabists" (some of us apply that term as a derogation, to mean "striped-pants pro-Arab cookie pushers," but it is borne by many diplomats with pride, to mean "those experienced in Middle Eastern affairs") felt with suave fervor that United States policy in that region was unduly influenced by political leaders eager to curry favor with American supporters of Israel.
The Arabists called for an evenhanded policy, imputing fairness and impartiality. Pro-Israel advocates, citing America's moral commitment to an island of democracy that was also a reliable strategic partner, retorted that "what Israel needs is not a broker but an ally"; to this group, evenhandedness was a code word made famous by the U.S. fact finder William Scranton in the late 60's for helping the rest of the world press Israel for concessions.
The adjective was coined by Shakespeare in "Macbeth" and carried an ironic overtone: "This even-handed justice/Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chal ice/To our own lips." In Netanyahu's use, it meant "Israel is prepared to settle for a fair shake from nations usually on the side of the Arabs." (Fair shake, an 1830 Americanism, may be a metaphoric extension of the even hand.)
Emboldened by the ready reception of this allusion, the Prime Minister -- educated in the United States and familiar with the nuances of the American political vernacular -- went overboard. Speaking of the way the previous Government had made concessions little by little, he charged that the Israeli public had been "spoon-fed withsalami slices." The press gasped at the audacity of the mangled metaphor, and Netanyahu responded, "Do something with that, Safire."
Right on. The compound verb spoon-feed began in 1615 to describe a means of feeding the infantile or feeble. By metaphoric extension, to spoon-feed means "to explain or persuade in small, understandable portions; to make easy to swallow and digest information."
Salami -- from the Italian salame, "salted pork" -- led to a more overtly political phrase, salami tactics. Coinage is attributed to Matyas Rakosi of Hungary's Communist Party in 1945; he described the way he overcame his opposition by getting it to slice off its right wing, then repudiate its centrists, until only those left in power were Communist collaborators. The specific Rakosi citation has not been found, but the phrase's popularizers were surely the columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop, who much preferred the striking image to the bloodless "gradualism." In 1971, Stewart wrote prophetically in his Newsweek column about Czech politics: "Alexander Dubcek will certainly not be the last of the liberals to fall victim to the salami knife."
Both the feeding by spoon and the slicing with a salami knife are delicious figures of speech, but both in the same sentence, as the Prime Minister belatedly realized, are a lot to swallow.

Riding the Strong Dollar For All It's Worth

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SUDDENLY, Japan is a bargain. And Germany doesn't look so pricey either. Make no mistake, it's not like the glory days, when the yen was fixed at 360 to the dollar -- where it stayed for decades after World War II -- or even like the early 80's. Anyone who dined cheaply in Tokyo or stayed at a decent hotel for $30 in Berlin during the mid-70's will be disappointed.
But in travel and in exchange rates, everything is relative. With the dollar now worth about 123 yen, Japan is nearly 50 percent less expensive, in dollar terms, than it was two years ago; with the dollar now worth about 1.68 marks, Germany is about 20 percent less, and lower than it's been in three years. So while the dollar is generally strong around the world these days -- even in France and England -- you'll notice it most when you go to spend yen and marks. 
 Travelers may have Washington to thank for this sudden change in fortunes. The most common -- but hardly the only -- explanation for the rise in the dollar in recent months is that the world has suddenly come to the conclusion that the United States is serious about balancing the Federal budget. With Japan still mired in a recession and much of Europe unable to break out of high unemployment, the dollar seems like the safe haven for the world's money. Such a safe haven, in fact, that a few weeks ago Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin started hinting that the dollar had risen too much for its own good, or the country's.
The mystery for the next few months will be whether the world's foreign exchange markets believe that Mr. Rubin and his fellow finance ministers in Europe and Japan are serious. The early evidence is that they are unimpressed. Soon after Mr. Rubin made his first stab at lowering the dollar's value, it rose anew against the Deutsche mark. But for globe-trotters, here's the bottom line: Although the dollar might get a bit stronger in coming months, it's not likely to surge the way it has in recent times. So if you are planning a trip abroad, it's probably not worth delaying much longer.
Of course, translating a strong dollar into a strong buy is not always so easy. Many package-tour operators snatch up exchange-rate gains to increase their profits rather than pass them on to customers. If you are buying a tour, it's worth asking what the same package cost a year ago. If the numbers (except for the air fare portion, which is denominated in dollars if you are leaving from the United States) sound the same, you are probably being denied the benefit of the strong dollar.
But there are bargains for independent travelers. Probably the best is the Japan Rail Pass, available from Japan National Tourist Organization offices around the United States. The rail pass allows you to tour Japan on its famous bullet trains; you can buy a one-week or two-week pass that allows for unlimited travel.
There is no purer test of the dollar's buying power than the rail pass. The Japanese Government sets its price in yen, at 27,800 for a seven-day pass.
Two years ago, when the yen was hovering around 80 to the dollar, the economy pass ran $347. Recently it was priced around $230.
Lodgings in Japan are rarely a bargain, but the dollar's rise has removed some of the sting. The Okura Hotel, across from the American embassy in Tokyo, charges 41,000 yen for one double-occupancy room. At the yen's height, that came to an astounding $512 a night; today the same room is more like $333. For those with more modest tastes, Tokyo is filled with antiseptically clean if cramped hotel rooms, near downtown rail and subway stations, for 27,000 yen a night; at present rates that's close to $219. And the real bargains are available to those who are comfortable going off the beaten track. The wonderful 1,000-yen sushi plate I used to get at a hole in the wall behind the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo has just declined to $8.13 from $12.50 two years ago.
What works in Japan probably won't work elsewhere in Asia. The Korean won is down compared with the dollar, but the Hong Kong dollar is pegged pretty close to the American currency, meaning that the prices charged by Hong Kong hotels in advance of the city-state's transfer to China this summer are still outrageous.
But prices in Germany are on the decline, at least as measured in dollar terms. The discounts, though, are not as deep. At the Hotel Grand Esplanade, one of the leading hotels in Berlin, the weekend rate of 370 marks would have been $268 in the spring of 1995 but today is around $220.
One caution: Before leaving home, it's worth calling your credit card companies to find out what kind of exchange rate they use. There's often a bigger variance among companies than you might expect. On any trip with thousands of dollars in expenses, knowing which card to use out can make a difference when the trip is a hazy memory and the credit card bill is on your desk.

HEADLINE: A Chalet of One's Own

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH WISSNER-GROSS; ELIZABETH WISSNER-GROSS teaches journalism at Hofstra University.

 BODY:
WHILE hiking in the Swiss Alps one autumn, I passed a log chalet, smoke puffing neatly from the chimney, and children playing contentedly on the balcony in view of waterfalls, pastures, densely wooded forest and shockingly high mountains crowned with snow. Surrounded by the strong aroma of pine and the sounds of tinkling cowbells and rushing river water, I realized that my elegant room at the hotel in town was not quite what an Alpine vacation was meant to be.
What I did not know at the time was that spacious, private chalets with magnificent views were often cheaper than one-room units in a high-rise -- something I learned only last August, when I returned to the Swiss Alps with my husband, mother and two sons, determined to sample chalet living. 
 Since most Alpine hotels accommodate a maximum of two people to a room, a family of four would have to pay about $300 to $400 a night for two rooms in a modest hotel. Even youth hostels in choice locations charge about $35 a person for dormitory accommodations. Chalet prices, on the other hand, range from $420 a week for a two-bedroom chalet apartment for five people in Wengen off season to $1,600 a week and up for apartments in St. Moritz during peak season.
I began my search for a chalet by calling Switzerland Tourism's automated fax information line in New York, which within seconds sent me a one-page list of chalet rental agencies. After telephoning several I was unimpressed: each claimed to have only one chalet to meet my needs, and the rates they quoted were higher than the cost of luxury hotel rooms. So I decided to try reserving directly with chalet owners in Zermatt, in the Valais region, and Wengen, in the Jungfrau region, both car-free resort villages. Within hours of contacting the Zermatt tourism office I received a list of available chalets that would comfortably house five people.
Among the most appealing were Residence Patricia, a newly built chalet that was a rather long walk from the village, and the centrally situated Haus Monazit and Haus Memory. Unfortunately, like many chalet rentals, each required a full week's stay. Since we were only visiting Zermatt for four days, we chose an apartmentlike loft atop the Hotel Dufour. (When I explored Zermatt for future family rentals of a week or more, I learned that it's better to rent a chalet slightly beyond the main streets of this bustling resort, where the views of the Matterhorn from chalets will not be blocked by neighboring high-rises.)
Perhaps because Wengen, where we spent five days, is smaller, sleepier, and less publicized, chalet owners were more flexible. Among the listings that met my requirements -- a balcony with a view, a quiet location within 15 minutes' walk of town and children specifically welcomed -- I chose the Chalet Isabelle. It was also one of the least expensive in the five-bed category: 26 Swiss francs (about $20) a person per night in winter (about $12 a person off season).
I contacted the owner, Silvia Kaiser-Gross (no relation) by fax, and a few days later she faxed me a contract, in German. Although I speak passable German, I spent hours with a German dictionary trying to understand the rules, which included the stipulation that the stay had to be paid in full in Swiss francs at least two weeks in advance. Since we were about 10 days away from departure, we faxed back the signed contract with a photocopy of the check we would be bringing with us.
 LIKE many chalet owners, Ms. Kaiser-Gross does not live in the town where she rents out her rooms and rarely sees her guests. So as we rode the train up the mountain from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and then on to Wengen, I wondered where we would find the chalet key.
The information officer at the Wengen train station who gave us directions to the chalet quickly set me straight: "In the door, of course," he said, laughing at such a ridiculous question.
We walked down the mountain to the chalet, lined up like a family of ducks on the narrow, paved road, dragging our wheeled "carry on" luggage behind us. As I had requested, the chalet was only a 15-minute walk -- but those 15 minutes were entirely downhill at a steady 45-degree angle. The more we descended, the more we worried about the ascent back to town.
"Exactly how rustic is this going to be?" Alex, my 15-year-old son, asked. "Is this still Wengen?" 11-year-old Zach chimed in. Eventually, after a series of steep zigs and zags in the road, we reached Chalet Isabelle, a dark wooden house that turned out to be a multi-unit chalet, meaning three other apartments shared the same building (an unexpected, or perhaps untranslated, arrangement, but no real intrusion on our privacy).
No concierge was in sight but, yes, the key was in the door. As we walked through the center hallway of our upstairs apartment, we saw two large, bright rooms, and our initial disappointment began to fade. The rooms were done in light wood, with lots of storage space. One contained three comfortable beds with thick mattresses; the other, with a trundle bed and big wooden table, served as both living room and dining room. Still skeptical of what $60 a night could buy in Switzerland, the five of us inspected the facility thoroughly, opening every closet and cabinet door.
We found clean, crisp, cotton linens, fluffy down comforters and pillows, a fully equipped eat-in kitchen, a stack of board games, and French doors in the living room and bedroom that opened onto a balcony with an overwhelming view. Our panorama included the village of Lauterbrunnen below, distant valleys, gleaming snow-covered mountaintops, pastoral fields, stark cliffs, tall, ribbonlike waterfalls, and occasional tidy wooden chalets. We also had a clear view of the gravity-defying cog train to Murren across the Lauterbrunnen valley, as well as an above-the-clouds perspective on storms approaching Lauterbrunnen below.
"This isn't real. This is a Hollywood set," Alex commented as a cow ambled onto one of the carpetlike pastures below us. As if on cue, we all felt like sipping hot chocolate. But it was getting late and we did not have hot chocolate, or bread, or even a bar of soap. The only amenity in our spotless bathroom was a roll of toilet paper; we'd had no idea that chalet guests are usually expected to bring or buy their own bath linens. So we quickly made up our beds and set out on a dinner hike into town.
As expected, the straight-uphill climb required about 30 minutes for five healthy New Yorkers more accustomed to flat turf. By the time we arrived in the village, most stores had closed for the evening. Only restaurants and gift shops, where edelweiss-embroidered hand towels were selling for $40 apiece, were open. We washed up and had dinner at an eclectic Swiss-Mexican restaurant at the Bernerhof Hotel, which featured a salad bar, vegetarian chili, pasta and fondue.
The next morning my husband and I volunteered to trudge back up to town to shop for supplies at the Migros supermarket, a large national chain, where our purchases included an assortment of local cheeses and muesli cereal to be eaten Swiss style (mixed with flax seed and yogurt with exotic flavors like hazelnut, walnut, and coconut chocolate chip). We picked up warm grainy bread and croissants at a bakery across the street.
In the early morning, the village was already humming. Wengen is especially popular among British vacationers (American and Japanese tourists gravitate to Grindelwald, just over the mountain; Murren draws many Germans). It is small and flat for an Alpine resort, but its blocklong main street bustles seven days a week with wall-to-wall restaurants, gift shops and hotels -- and people occasionally congregate around an outdoor life-size chess board equipped with light, plastic pieces.
After a breakfast of croissants and hot chocolate on the balcony, the family voted unanimously not to head back uphill, but to hike down to Lauterbrunnen instead. From there we took the cog rail train up to Murren for yet another magnificent view of the Jungfrau region. From the train, we could see our chalet across the valley and quickly figured out that we could return home that evening by taking the train to Wengen, and walking down from the station once again.
We continued this pattern of downhill hiking for the next few days. One of our favorite trips entailed a 20-minute train ride down to Interlaken and then a boat ride on Lake Thun to the Caves of St. Beatus, where we dined at an outdoor cafe before embarking on a one-hour walking tour of stalagmites and stalactites. Lauterbrunnen itself offered many scenic walks along the green rushing waters of the clean, glacial Lutschine River. On one hike to Lauterbrunnen my mother discovered wild raspberries and blackberries growing in the woods along the trail.
While paths were clearly marked, we learned to ignore distances marked on direction signs, which are generally indicated in "minutes" rather than kilometers. These are Swiss minutes, not American, and do not differentiate between an uphill distance and a downhill distance. On one hike, we found a "20-minute walk" in Swiss time translated into a "40-minute hike" by American standards.
Often we stopped along the way for afternoon snacks of strudel and hot chocolate at outdoor cafes conveniently situated along our routes. In Murren, one of Switzerland's highest villages, we ate lunch at a cafe directly facing glaciers and mountain peaks. But most of our lunches were eaten picnic style: baguette, cheese, fruit, boxed juices or water, and Swiss chocolate bars. In Wengen, a favorite dinner spot was the Victoria-Lauberhorn Hotel, where the specialties included crepes and pizza. We fixed our other meals at the chalet, once attempting rosti, a potato and cheese dish we had tried and loved in Bern. The modern kitchen had everything we needed, though our first chalet dinner turned up a minor surprise. After trying to boil water for more than half an hour, we noticed that the stove had shut down. At first we thought it was broken. But after we fed a coin into the unidentified meter hidden in a kitchen cabinet, the water began to boil again. For our next meal, we collected coins in advance to keep operations running smoothly.
Gradually we became comfortable in our chalet. Simple pleasures seemed more enjoyable in full view of the Alps. At night we could see thousands of stars and even the twinkling lights from villages in distant valleys and on nearby mountains. During the day we practically had to force ourselves to set out in search of other views that might equal but never surpass our own.
At the end of our stay the concierge telephoned and arranged to come by for the check and key. He also inspected the chalet and collected the cleaning fee, which is stipulated in most chalet contracts and ranges from $50 to $100. Chalets rarely offer daily maid service, but all are cleaned between visits. Owners usually request payment of the cleaning charge up front, along with advance payment for the entire stay. Given the last-minute nature of our arrangements, we were permitted to pay after we arrived.
When the concierge heard us groaning about dragging our luggage back up the mountain to the Wengen station, he suggested that we hire a "taxi," a resort-style electric cart that would pick us up and take us to the station for about $15. Apparently this luxury is available at all mountain resorts, although sometimes it is horse-drawn rather than motorized. Buggies and sleighs have their charm, but we were relieved when a speedy electric cart arrived to take us to the Wengen station 15 minutes before our train was to leave.
As we savored the luxury of riding up the mountain, Alex informed us that next time he would prefer a luxury hotel smack in the center of town with an indoor pool, a fancy restaurant and 24-hour room service. This was not the majority opinion.
I have every intention of arranging another chalet vacation -- for a full week, perhaps in that newly built Residence Patricia in Zermatt, where a duplex chalet with three bedrooms, three baths and a view of the Matterhorn is $295 a night in peak season. We may need crampons to get to town -- but more likely it's just a very good deal.
 
How to go about arranging a rental
 
The Basics
 Chalets are very popular among Europeans, and many of the most economical and most luxurious accommodations are booked months in advance. They are usually rented by the week, Saturday to Saturday. During the slower seasons (spring and autumn) some can be rented by the day. The Switzerland Tourism office in New York, (212) 757-5944, will provide telephone and fax numbers for village tourism offices.
In many villages, accommodations are rated by the Swiss tourism industry to provide comparisons, with five stars representing the most luxurious. Once a vacationer selects a suitable chalet, reservations can be made with the owner (most have fax access). Contracts are usually in German or French or both.
For those who prefer to let someone else do their chalet hunting, the Switzerland Tourism office offers a list of agencies in the United States. The advantage of going through an agency is the comfort of being able to discuss things in English, along with a sense of quality control. Most agencies say they inspect their properties. The disadvantage is price; agency rentals are more expensive.
Although most resort towns have chalets for rent, locations within a town vary significantly. The most convenient ones are not always the most expensive. Chalet "apartments" in high-rise (sometimes five- or six-story) buildings tend to be near the center of a town, which can also make them noisier. Single-unit chalets are usually on the outskirts and may require more strenuous hikes.
At most chalets, rates include bed linens and bedding (down puffs and feather pillows are standard), a kitchen supplied with dishes and utensils (many with dishwashers), heat, electricity and firewood. Many also include amenities that luxury hotels do not offer: washing machines and dryers, living rooms with fireplaces, mud rooms and board games. Many chalets provide television or radio. Guests are usually expected to bring towels, soap, napkins, paper towels and trash bags.
 
A Sampling
Rates depend on the season and are much lower in spring and fall. Skiers should note that the winter peak season can vary from village to village. Considering the complexity of high-high, high, middle, low and lower-than-low seasons in Switzerland, the only way to know prices for sure is to let the chalet know the precise dates that interest you. Owners say every situation is different, and they are ready to adapt prices not only to the seasons but also to such things as how full they are or whether schools are in session. Here is a sampling of current prices:
In Wengen, the Chalet Isabelle, telephone and fax (41-32) 351-4061, has a ground-floor room with three single beds, a small kitchen and a long terrace for $58 a day, or $19 a person, from December to April; $27.50, or $9 a person in May, October and November; $43.50, or $11 a person, from June to September. Tourism office: (41-33) 855-1414.
In Zermatt in peak season, $295 a night (through April 4) pays for six people in the four-star Residence Patricia, (41-27) 966-3097, fax (41-27) 966-3055, a newly built house facing the Matterhorn. The apartment is a duplex, with three double bedrooms, two bathrooms and a shower room, living room and kitchen. The three-star Haus Monazit, (41-27) 967-5222, accommodates up to six in a third-floor chalet apartment with a view of the Matterhorn for about $440 a night high season, $220 low. Tourism office: (41-27) 967-0181.
In upscale St. Moritz, where a double room at the five-star Badrutt's Palace Hotel, (41-81) 837-1000, is $465 a night in March, a studio apartment for two, with balcony and view in the Derby Chalet goes for $406 a week, or $58 a night. Tourism office: (41-81) 837-3333.
The resort town of Gstaad, known to Americans as a playground for Hollywood celebrities, has a 25-page list of weekly rental apartments. Prospective vacationers need to specify dates, number in the party and length of stay to receive faxed information about vacancies from the local tourism office, (41-33) 748-8181.
Saas-Fee, a resort near Zermatt that is popular among Germans, also has an extensive list of chalet apartments. From now through April 11, weekly prices range from about $252 for a studio for two people at the Azalea chalet to $2,899 for a six-and-a-half-room chalet that accommodates up to 12 people at the Alpengluck, with a wide range of choices in the $500 to $700 range. Tourism office: (41-27) 957-1457.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Some Keep Shining, but Most Just Fade to Gray

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS 

 BODY:
ACTORS OVER 60 SEEM TO BE enjoying something of a rejuvenation on screen. At 66, Armin Mueller-Stahl has an Oscar nomination for his performance in "Shine." So does Lauren Bacall, 72, for hers in "The Mirror Has Two Faces." In "Absolute Power," Clint Eastwood, 66, is running them ragged as an older master thief. Last summer, Sean Connery, also 66, led a commando team into Alcatraz in "The Rock." Earlier this winter, Jack Lemmon, 72, and James Garner, 68, galloped cross-country in "My Fellow Americans."
And there are more: Shirley MacLaine, 62, in "The Evening Star," Debbie Reynolds, 64, in "Mother" and of course Walter Matthau, at 76 perhaps the liveliest older actor going. 
 One might even get the impression that the old have at last risen to smite their traditional oppressor: the archtypical 32-year-old studio executive whose notion of the world extends all the way to 25.
But rank-and-file older actors tell a depressingly different story. While occasional roles materialize for the Matthaus and MacLaines, most working older actors find themselves as persona non grata as ever. Some have never seen it so bad.
"Our senior performers have all but disappeared from television, and they're practically invisible in feature films," says Richard Masur, 48, president of the Screen Actors Guild and a younger older actor with dozens of credits in films and television. "And I'm not talking about people over 65," he says, "I'm talking about 50." If you're a woman, make that 40.
That state of affairs may seem surprising in an aging population whose dominant segment, the baby boom generation, is already turning 50. Nevertheless, Mr. Masur says, Hollywood feels as free as ever to pursue a young audience that tends to be satisfied with formulaic movies and characters.
It is generally left to independent films to create complex older roles like Mr. Mueller-Stahl's in "Shine." Although older actors are understandably loath to discuss the situation on the record, Mr. Masur and his counterparts in the directors' and writers' guilds say that Hollywood is creating virtually no interesting older characters for the average actor to portray. Down in the acting ranks, the aging huddle and hope. "A few men between 50 and 60 are still considered somewhat viable because they're playing heads of corporations, governments, physicians, mentors and the like," Mr. Masur says. After that they, too, find themselves obliged to shuffle off to a no-person zone, as if people of 62 or so cease to exist in any guise anybody might have any interest in.
Women between 50 and 60 are for the most part long gone. "They totally disappear in that age range," Mr. Masur says. "Then they pop up again at about 65 when they've made the transition from being women to being old ladies."
Most galling to women at that age is the fact that their male screen contemporaries can still be found in the company of young women. Witness Gene Hackman, 67, who as President of the United States in "Absolute Power" wrestles with the willowy wife of an elderly tycoon (E. G. Marshall, 86).
On screen, older women are ordinarily deprived of sex, which in the world of Hollywood hinges entirely on looks. "You occasionally see a woman showing up well who is above 50," Mr. Masur says. Goldie Hawn, for example, who is 51, plays sexually appealing women in "Everyone Says I Love You" and "The First Wives Club." So did Ann-Margret, 55, in "Grumpy Old Men" and its sequel. "But the point is that Ann-Margret didn't look 50," Mr. Masur says.
If none of this is new in Hollywood, neither has age bias been quite so pronounced in the view of many older actors. "The business has changed more radically in the last five years," says Hal Holbrook, 72. "It's all gone to youth." A four-time Emmy winner who is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Mark Twain, Mr. Holbrook found his career tailing off in the early 1980's. "My hair was turning gray," he says. "I decided not to color it any more. My former wife told me, 'Holbrook, you're making a big mistake.' "
CURRENTLY HE IS PORTRAYING an old man suffering from cancer in a television film being shot in British Columbia. It's not a bad part, he says, and it's more satisfying than the usual run of movie roles coming along. These days, he adds, he usually finds better work in theater than he does on screen.
In the seemingly endless stream of Hollywood action fodder or, for a change of pace, comedies and dramas involving younger people, he and other older actors find little that is relevant or worthwhile to do on screen. If senior performers could create fulfilling roles for themselves, the characters might resemble those played by Mr. Mueller-Stahl as the emotionally brutalizing father of the pianist David Helfgott in "Shine," or the troubled widow portrayed by Gena Rowlands, 66, in "Unhook the Stars." Such characters have abounded in foreign films with stars like Jeanne Moreau (nearing 70) or Marcello Mastroianni (who died in December at age 72).
In Hollywood movies, according to many actors, when an older person does happen to wander onto the scene amid the stunts and car crashes, or for a pat on the silvery pate from patronizing young people, it is usually as the victim of abuse, the bumbling laughingstock, the rancorous so-and-so or other cuddly-prickly stereotypes.
"The deadliest thing you fight as an actor in movies and television is that they type you in their mind and they can't see anything else," Mr. Holbrook says. "And to a point they're right; you are what you are. But there are people who are actors -- Jason Robards, you know -- who have the capacity to alter themselves and play various characterizations. But we don't get much chance. The material isn't there these days."
Rarely in Hollywood movies, or so it is alleged by many senior actors, writers and directors, are older people portrayed with understanding or appreciation. With an aging population in this country, why is that tolerated? It is commonly assumed that older audiences are uncomfortable with the sight of aging people on screen to begin with, especially in films that portray them so narrowly and stupidly, and for this and other reasons avoid going to movies altogether.
Many older film people say that wouldn't be the case if people their age were depicted on screen the same way they function in life. Occasionally fine films come along -- "Cocoon" or "The Trip to Bountiful" or "Atlantic City" -- that treat the elderly as people with their faculties intact. Otherwise audiences usually seem to be fed buffoons, basket cases and crazy old coots.
It doesn't help that the older population doesn't complain. "Seniors are vocal about things like health care and social security, but almost totally silent about having themselves reflected accurately in the media," Mr. Masur says.
So that leaves the field pretty much to the young. Older actors mention a kind of vicious circle of economics and studio mindset. First, from Madison Avenue to Hollywood it is perceived that "younger" people, from the teens through about 45, are the ones spending money for specific products in this country. And what is a movie if not a product? Not that older people don't have a lot of money and leisure time to spend, but they aren't regarded as being as targetable.
With movies being made for the young, naturally it's the young who go to the movies. Teen-agers, in fact, often go several times to the same movie, for example Wes Craven's current high school horror film "Scream."
Studios obviously gear up accordingly. "In their view everything has to be written by young writers," says Brad Radnitz, president of the Writers Guild. "For parts you need young actors, and to understand the whole scene you need young directors."
Mr. Radnitz notes that in the old days of the studio system, directors and producers were company men churning out a balanced slate of films with room for all ages. Hollywood films, he says, are now individual projects of the producers, with studios serving merely as packagers and distributors. As for the film makers, he adds: "Each entity says: 'I'm not going to get too many shots here. I have one picture so I'd better make damn sure I make money on it.' "
That doesn't lead to broad-based film making. "Essentially it's an amusement park ride," Mr. Radnitz says. "No one is willing to take a risk. We've catered to the lowest common denominator in demographics, so pictures are for the 12-year-old mentality. That's the market, the kids coming back five and six times and making money for the studios."
Not surprising, many people in Hollywood regard this as a vast oversimplification. "I just don't think it's true at all," says Tom Rothman, president of production of 20th Century Fox. The studio, he points out, plans to release "Out to Sea," with Mr. Matthau and Mr. Lemmon, on May 30 and has several other films coming with solid roles for older actors. "Yes, there is a certain homogeneity in movies," he says, "but the problem is lessening because what you're seeing now is that the more original a picture is, the better it is doing."
Possibly that could be said of several recent independently made films -- "The English Patient," "Big Night," "Secrets and Lies," "Breaking the Waves," "Shine" and others -- all of which have attracted good critical attention and drawn mature audiences, not to mention most of the top Oscar nominations. But Mr. Rothman says it's also true of mature studio films like "The Crucible," "The People vs. Larry Flynt" and, speaking of the old folks, "Mother" and "The Evening Star."
Ms. MacLaine, for one, sees a slightly improving situation, if not a breakout, for older movie characters. "There seems to be more interest in wisdom, in what someone with more experience might have to offer," she says. "They're funnier, they've lived longer, they have more appreciation for contradiction."
As for Mr. Mueller-Stahl, recognition has come only recently in this country, and he says he will be glad for whatever comes along. "So you can play characters. They're still with us," he says. "I've been heroes and sons in East Europe and fathers of bad guys in West Europe. Now I'm going to make myself a career as a grandfather in America, which is a great benefit."
As for the tyranny of youth, he may have found another way. Recently he directed his first film. "I got an invitation as a young director for a film festival in Madrid," he says.

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Melvyn Bloom;
Furthering the Cause of 'New Zionism'

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AS executive vice president of the American Society for Technion the last 12 years, Melvyn Bloom has the job of overseeing efforts to raise money on behalf of Technion, formally known as the Israel Institute of Technology.
Through his work, Mr. Bloom, a resident of Pelham Manor, furthers what he calls "New Zionism" -- a partnership with a successful Israel rather than a handout to a needy country. It is a job he does well, raising from nonalumni more money in the United States for a university thousands of miles away than some Ivy League schools can do for themselves. 
 Founded in 1924, the institute, based in Haifa, is often called the M.I.T. of the Middle East. Mr. Bloom, who began his career in journalism and public relations, formerly worked for the United Jewish Appeal. He recently obtained a $30 million donation for Technion, from an American businessman, the largest in the school's history and one of the largest to education anywhere.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with him:
Q. What ingredients make for a good fund-raiser? Is it tenacity or is it connections?
A. I think traditionally both of those things have been part of it. But having said that, while those things are hardly irrelevant, that is not it any more. I think, yes, having an affection for people, wanting to make very good friends, enjoying those interactions are certainly a part of it.
But similarly, the notion of connections on an individual basis is too personalized, if you will, to be effective for someone who has to run a large and complex organization. The issue from my point of view is more of conducting the orchestra than playing the violin. The question is how do you put together the right combination of people -- the volunteers and professional organization -- who have the right set of networks among them. Who collectively can help reach out to a large variety of people?
Q. Must you have a good cause as well?
A. That's exactly it. That's the other thing that has to be stressed. I almost would have said that was the beginning. The same thing in terms of my experience in public relations, if your mission -- if your case -- is not valid and not something about which you as a fund-raiser can feel passionate about and able to communicate to others, then nothing that you say or do can be that effective.
Q. People must ask you why are you doing all this for another country? Much is often said about the special relationship of American Jews to Israel, but there are still so many needy causes at home.
A. First of all, there is the whole notion of the Zionist connection. The inextricable link between the Jewish people and the homeland certainly has a basis, depending on where you come from, that is almost biological. It's spiritual. It's historic. It's part of our continuity as a people.
While you're absolutely correct that there are serious needs and challenges and problems at home, it would be a false choice to say it's an either-or issue. First of all, no one knows precisely how to solve the problems that we face here; secondly, it's at the core of our identity, of our future and identity as a people to maintain that connection with Israel.
The next question becomes what is the most apt, most appropriate way to help Israel in a contemporary sense. That's where the mission or our organization comes along and why I believe we have the right mission for this particular stage of Israel's growth.
Q. What is that mission?
A. Our mission statement says it's to convince the leadership of the American Jewish community that the future of Israel is in high technology, and in Israel high technology is at the Technion.
Which is a way of saying this institution, often called the M.I.T. of the Middle East, is the only comprehensive technological and scientific institution not only in Israel but in that whole part of the world. It's the only institution like it in the whole history of the Jewish people. It's part of the enlightenment of the 20th century, and the question is now as we move toward the 21st century what direction it should move.
Q. What is this "new" Zionism that you believe in?
A. If one buys into the validity of the connection between American Jews and Israel, the next question is, How can you be most helpful? Many of us who are not yet senior citizens can remember the creation of the state of Israel in our lifetime, yet it's barely 50 years old. In that period of time, obviously, the evolution of Israel has been remarkable. It has moved from a country that only a generation ago was having its survival questioned by many.
The kind of New Zionism that I refer to is one that emphasizes pride over tragedy and future over past. If we can achieve intellectual power, Israel can, in my view, truly be a light unto the nations in a biblical sense. Painfully for many of us, I don't think Israel is in a place where for the Jewish people it can be the beacon right now in terms of ethical and religious teaching. But I think through science and high technology, Israel can do things for people all around the world and in that part of the world in particular, as hostilities become less important. People are going to eat better, have cleaner water; people will begin sharing pioneering technologies.
People, I think, are going to work together, and that will provide a path to the future, which is a very exciting vision. There's no limit in terms of what can be done by those of us who have this traditional commitment to try always to be repairing this universe into which we were born.
Q. How does the Technion come into this?
A. Israel is in a different era. Just recently the International Monetary Fund decided to add Israel to its list of industrial nations, which means that, clearly, Israel has either reached first-world status or is on the threshold of that. But there are some problems. There is a national consensus about the importance of economic independence for Israel. Israel hasn't achieved that. Israel needs the skills and people to ride the horse harder and in a more skillful way in the direction it is already going to achieve economic independence.
Technion is speaking to national goals. It speaks to excellence, and it speaks to pride in the sense we are talking about an institution of excellence.
It can attract support because of the historical and emotional connection with American Jewry and also in the same way that a Japanese industrialist might make a gift to Stanford or Harvard, or Oxford University might conduct a campaign in the United States. And that's really a source of pride for our friends in Israel, as opposed to the notion that the help is a form of social welfare.
Q. Does this idea of excellence at the top trickle down to the lower levels of schools in Israel? And if so, how does that compare with what is going on in the United States?
A. I was just in Israel last week, and one of the figures I heard that was instructive -- maybe good material for a comedian -- is that Israel is now second only to the Untied States in the number of attorneys per capita. If they continue to produce law school graduates at the current rate, they will actually be No. 1 in the world before long.
I think it's an issue of whether young people who have the aptitude to move in the areas of science and high technology need to be educated about those opportunities -- both in the United States and Israel. If I remember the numbers, Israel has something like 130 scientists for every 10,000 workers, which is not enough for where Israel has to go. As I recall, the United States had 80 and Japan about 75 scientists per 10,000 workers.
So the United States also, I think, can see an opportunity or a gap in terms of the distance between the opportunities out there and the number of individuals who are trained.
Q. Is Technion expensive to attend or does the Government subsidize its students?
A. It's really the latter. Yes, it's expensive, but not for the student. The tradition in Israel is, If you grow up as an Israeli and you serve in the army and you have the smarts to get into one of the top universities, you are entitled to go, heavily subsidized by public funds.

Mt. Vernon Reorganizes Schools

BYLINE: By F. ROMALL SMALLS 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
MAJOR restructuring of the school system here was approved by the Board of Education at a crowded and fiery meeting earlier this month. The nine-member Board of Trustees voted 6 to 3 to start a three-year pilot program altering the makeup of the district's schools.
Under the program, the trustees will reconfigure some elementary schools as kindergarten-through-eighth-grade schools and phase out at least one middle school in the 10,000-student district. This would create what some refer to as "elemiddle schools." The change has been criticized by some community leaders and by the board's only two black members. 
 School officials first responded to a call for change by embarking on curriculum reform, but after a turbulent school board election, the idea evolved into a dispute that has divided the community along decades-old racial and economic lines.
For decades, the Metro-North tracks were an unofficial color line, with most whites on the north and blacks and Jews on the south. But the city is now more diverse, with blacks constituting a slight majority. Whites are still concentrated on the city's north side. Poorer residents live mainly in northwestern and south-central areas, and middle- and upper-middle classes are in the northeast and the southeast. Eighty-five percent of the student population represents minorities.
Some officials say the real issue is more about class and economic status than race. In the last 30 years the demographics of Mount Vernon have changed to an older population and a shrinking middle class, and 55 percent of the tax assessment on residential property is allocated to the school system, City Controller Maureen Walker said.
Last summer Mount Vernon teachers took part in the Summer Institute on Curriculum Restructuring organized by the National Urban Alliance for Effective Schools of Teachers College at Columbia University, receiving $100,000 from the school board, supposedly to help establish a districtwide curriculum. Then the board started debating the restructuring of the district's 11 elementary and 2 middle schools.
In school board elections last spring, four white candidates defeated four blacks, two of whom were incumbents. The board at the time was the most diverse ever in Mount Vernon, and blacks stood to gain a first-time majority. The four new trustees were endorsed by the Italian Civic Association, a 70-year-old organization, which until 1994 held considerable influence in school board elections. That year the Coalition for the Empowerment of People of African Ancestry helped elect three black trustees, the largest number of blacks ever to serve.
Gloria T. Coleman, civil rights and political action chairwoman of the Empowerment Coalition, said of the most recent election that voter rights violations had occurred and that the results were being challenged in a complaint to the United States Department of Justice and the State Department of Education.
Mrs. Coleman said she is also seeking a change in how school board elections are administered, suggesting that the county's Board of Elections handle them. She expressed opposition to the kindergarten-through-eighth-grade concept, saying that students would be forced to attend only schools in their neighborhoods. Currently, parents have the option of sending their children to any school in the district, provided there is enough space.
Anthony M. Mosca, a newly elected trustee and member of the Italian Civic Association who favors the reorganization of kindergarten through eighth grade, said, "During the campaign, we had many cottage meetings with parents, administrators and other school districts, and one of the items on our platform was the K-through-8 concept." He also said he believed students would fare better in small neighborhood schools, as they do in parochial schools.
In addition, Mr. Mosca cited complaints from some merchants about the large number of students dismissed from the two magnet middle schools near them -- Franko Performing Arts and Science Magnet Middle School and A. B. Davis -- as another reason for phasing out middle schools.
"The business and commercial districts have been concerned with the hordes of children being released from the middle schools at 3 o'clock," he said. "A lot of people sell their homes and leave Mount Vernon when it comes time for their children to go the middle schools."
In the face of tougher academic requirements imposed by the state, however, some residents have expressed concern about the district's ability to meet the higher standards.
Mayor Ernest E. Davis said, "People are doing this because, perhaps, they have more faith in the elementary schools than in the high schools and middle schools."
Board members favoring the kindergarten-through-eighth-grade plan say that some parents would rather send their children to parochial or private school because they believe they will receive a better education there and that public middle schools are "too large and overbearing."
Under the pilot plan, sixth graders attending two elementary schools on the north side and one on the south side would remain in their present schools until eighth grade, starting in the 1997-98 school year. If parents wish to send their children to the district's middle schools, they will have that option, under the plan, but Franko Middle School will be closed within a year.
Alfonzo Grimes, principal of the Franko Magnet Middle School, questioned before the board made its recent decision, said he was opposed to the kindergarten-through-eighth-grade proposal because he believes adolescents are better educated in environments with children of the same age and that the magnet programs offer a more challenging curriculum. The Franko Middle School has been featured in the National Middle Schools Association's magazine, High Strides, Urban Schools, as a model secondary school. According to school officials, Mr. Grimes will serve as co-principal of the two combined middle schools, which will be at A. B. Davis next year when Franko becomes a school for lower grades.
In Phase 2 of the district's plan, at least one elementary school will be reconfigured into a kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school. This was an idea suggested by two of the board members opposed to the kindergarten-through-eighth-grade concept. Frances W. Wynn, a two-term board member, voted against combining elementary and middle school students along with two other school board members, Kenneth B. Sylvester, a black trustee, and Donald P. Augustine of the Italian Civic Association.
Ms. Wynn, Mr. Sylvester and a former board member, Lynn McBride, presented an alternative for reshaping schools as kindergarten through fourth grade and fifth through eighth grade. Mrs. Wynn also said in a recent interview that she believed the board was rushing into a change without sufficient research.
Mount Vernon will be the only public school district in the county structured with kindergarten-through-eighth-grade schools.
State law requires school districts to include ideas from community leaders, parents, school staff members and students in their decisions. This cooperative school management concept is conducted through what is known as the Compact for Learning/School-Based Management Teams. The Mount Vernon district's Compact for Learning Congress, made up of all of the district's management teams, has opposed school restructuring. The stated objective of trustees who voted for restructuring is to remove about 800 students from the Franko and A. B. Davis Middle Schools and enroll them in neighborhood "elemiddle" schools. The Superintendent's office estimated that the cost of the pilot program in the first year will be $135,000. Construction of modular classrooms may also be required. A Head Start program in a south-side elementary school is expected to be displaced.
Mrs. Wynn said at a previous board meeting: "You need at least a year to implement this type of major restructuring. It scares me that we don't know that. As trustees, we have to think seriously about our mission. This is not the kind of thing we can do quickly, as we are trying to do it."

HEADLINE: Plan to Reduce Nitrogen in Sound Is Criticized by Sewer Officials

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
PROPELLING efforts to reinvigorate Long Island Sound, a Federal and state panel has proposed reducing nitrogen discharges to the Sound by 58.5 percent over 15 years.
The proposal evolved from broad agreements that reducing nitrogen held the greatest potential to help reverse the decline of the estuary. In 1994 New York and Connecticut formally endorsed a plan that identified nitrogen abatement as an important objective, and the two states have pledged major spending. 
 But as news of the new plan, to be the subject of meetings in the summer, spread along the shore since it was announced last month, it has met opposition over its proposed methods. Operators of eight of the nine sewage-treatment plants on the North Shore that discharge into the Sound have opposed the across-the-board approach. They said the approach overlooked more economical and equitable methods.
The plan, the operators added, would penalize Long Island, the section of the shoreline least responsible for the problem, while letting off New York City, the largest nitrogen contributor, with too much leniency.
The operators said they worried about costs, which the proposal underestimated, and about financing from a $1.75 billion bond act that voters approved in November. About $200 million in bond money is supposed to be earmarked to clean up the Sound.
Last week the regional director of the Environmental Conservation Department, Ray E. Cowen, said adequate financing would be available from the bond act, a separate environmental protection fund and a low-interest revolving-loan fund.
"They don't have to worry about funding," Mr. Cowen said. "We are going to process those applications and give them the maximum amount that is available under those three programs. They should just get something in to us."
The operators may continue to worry that state financing will not cover the costs. Excess costs could add to tax burdens for sewer districts. The operators also question whether the expense at small plants would be worth the limited reduction of nitrogen.
The reduced levels were proposed by the Long Island Sound Policy Committee, headed by environmental officials from New York, Connecticut and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.
The proposal starts a new phase in a federally sponsored effort that began 12 years ago. The 58.5 percent cuts would apply equally to discharges from Long Island, New York City, Westchester County and Connecticut, a quantity that totals 222,838 pounds a day.
The proposal requires that each of 11 designated shoreline areas, including one in Nassau and one in Suffolk, find ways to meet the goal through actions that would include improving sewage plants and limiting industrial discharges.
On Long Island, where direct industrial discharges are not a factor, reductions would be achieved through a combination of sewer projects and plans to reduce discharges from so-called nonpoint sources. Those include the runoff from storm water, which includes lawn fertilizers and animal wastes. Faulty septic tanks are also sources.
Meeting the 58.5 percent goal would cost $650 million, the committee said, including $299 million for New York. The Long Island share would include $22.6 million to upgrade the sewage plants, according to state estimates.
Operators of Long Island sewage plants said nitrogen from their discharges accounted for 2 percent of the New York total. The proposal, they added, should emphasize reducing nitrogen from sewage plants along the East River in New York City that account for 95 percent of the state sewage total.
"Equity suggests that the dischargers which cause the problem should bear the burden of solving it," the operators wrote to the committee. They argued that equal investments would yield far more benefit in reducing nitrogen from New York City than from Long Island.
An engineering consultant for the operators, Gary E. Loesch of Holzmacher, McLendon & Murrell, said the across-the-board approach also ignored computer models that showed that the largest nitrogen discharges were from New York City.
But officials involved in drawing up the proposal said the modeling showed other factors. An official of the E.P.A., Mark A. Tedesco, said the operators were overlooking evidence that the Long Island discharges, while small compared to those of New York City, had "a greater impact on a per-pound basis," because of points of entry, geography, currents and other factors.
Nitrogen from sewage plants, storm runoff and other sources like fertilizers is linked to hypoxia, or low dissolved oxygen in water. A study that the two states and the E.P.A. began in 1985 found that hypoxia was the greatest single threat to the Sound.
Hypoxia usually occurs in late summer, when algae and marine plants that nitrogen has fertilized sink to the bottom and consume oxygen as they decompose. Nitrogen is associated with urine and other organic material in sewage.
Some 70 sewage plants discharge more than one billion gallons a day of treated effluent into the Sound. Nitrogen in the effluent spurs abnormal growth of marine plants when it is excessive, worsening the hypoxia.
From 1987 to 1993, researchers found, hypoxia in the summer occurred in one-half to two-thirds of the bottom waters. On Long Island, the area of hypoxia was as far east as Riverhead, but was most severe in western reaches. The researchers have linked hypoxia to the loss of types and abundance of fin fish, stunted growth of lobsters and a general decline in the marine habitat. Hypoxia can also kill slow-moving species. If oxygen levels fall low enough, fish kills may ensue.
Environmental officials said efforts to limit nitrogen discharges and in some cases reduce them had had beneficial effects. The state's Director of Watershed Management. Phil DeGaetano, said Nassau and Suffolk had complied with earlier requirements.
The operators of sewer plants in the two counties were not alone, he said, adding that operators in New York City and Westchester County were also complaining.
Boards of commissioners operate some districts. The City of Glen Cove, the Village of Great Neck are also operators in Nassau. In Suffolk, the County Public Works Department operates plants in Port Jefferson and Kings Park.
The Town of Huntington was the sole operator on the Island that did not join in writing to the committee. Mr. Tedesco, whose office is in Connecticut, said he knew of no complaints there.
Mr. Tedesco and Carolyn J. Hughes, executive director of the Long Island Sound Study, said the plan was flexible and could be changed. "We have spent a lot of time looking at this problem," Ms. Hughes said. "We have essentially talked a lot to a very small number of people about it. Now we will explain at the public meetings how we developed this plan and allow people to ask questions."
Each area would be free to devise its way to meet the goals under a trading system. The system would award credits to an operator that invested in upgrading another plant. Credits would be based on the quantity of nitrogen removed and then be used by the investing operator to avoid performing similar work at a possibly higher cost.
Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi of Glen Cove said last week that he was proposing that other operators in Nassau take advantage of the credit program by joining in upgrading the Glen Cove plant.
"Our plant is well suited for significant reduction of nitrogen for the least investment," Mr. Suozzi said. "In return they could be given credits that would allow them not to meet the standards at their own plants."

GRAPHIC: Graph/Map: "Saving the Sound"
In the third phase of a program that began in 1990, environmental agencies have announced a plan calling for a 58.5 percent reduction in nitrogen discharges to Long Island Sound over the next 15 years. Nitrogen is the nutrient most directly responsible for low dissolved oxygen -- a condition that scientists call hypoxia -- which renders large areas of the Sound unhealthy for marine life. Discharges from the 70 sewage treatment plants that ring the Sound contribute greatly to this problem.

Emerging Photographers Capture Images Radiating Power

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS BRAFF 

 BODY:

Dark Images, Bright Prospects: The Survival of the Figure After World War II
The Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton. To Mar. 29. 283-2118. 
 An assembly of painting, sculpture, video, photography, decorative and industrial objects, slide projection and music, this show feels dynamic, and it feels big. Certainly its ambitions are large, for the aim is to look at the American psyche during the 1945-55 decade and use the information as a context for that era's art.
The project is the most recent in a series of collaborations between the Parrish Art Museum and Southampton High School. Student participants were guided by educators, museum professionals and outside consultants specializing in art history, literature, economics, history, political science, film, journalism and design.
Examining artists' approaches to the figure in the new society is the central theme. Insecurity produced by the atom bomb and the cold war is used as part of the social definition. A consciousness of the general vulnerability of the human body is reflected in art in which the figure is not dominant, not in control, not celebrated. Fracturing, fragmentation and dissolving are frequent approaches. In the Hans Hofmann example here, pigment takes over and dominates the figure.
Much of the art is aligned with expanding researches into abstraction and in many instances the human motif is barely recognizeable. The body is never preserved as a coherent whole. It dissolves into vigorous brush gestures that integrate figure and landscape in examples by Willem de Kooning and Jack Tworkov. Another fine example, and one of the show's best pieces, is Ethel Schwabacher's "Woman III," which features a central mass of vibrant strokes, with one mark suggesting a green arm bent at the elbow and a middle, flesh-toned section that immediately suggests a breast.
In a particularly energetic work by Alfonso Ossorio, "Full Mother," the body is a flat mass of loose, throbbing lines. The Surrealists in New York in the 40's had a significant impact. Their explorations of biomorphic forms were an important influence on a painting of amoebalike figures by Dorothy Dehner and on a major canvas featuring cell-like shapes by Gerome Kamrowski. The Surrealists' use of the inner world, and especially the subconscious, made intuitive gestural abstraction an extension of human subject matter.
Some pieces, like Byron Browne's "Lion Hunt" and Herbert Ferber's "Apocalyptic Rider" suggest that the interest in mythology, reinforced by the Surrealists, provided one valid way to present a figurative motif.
A chronological installation accompanied by a current events time-line text brings some expected and unexpected insights. In 1946, for instance, we see a grid-format Adolph Gottlieb painting near a history panel pointing out widespread developments of housing tracts and the introduction of the first computer. Jacob Lawrence's faceted figures hang nearby and Seymour Lipton's spiky, aggressive and weighty sculpture is not far from the text noting the first use of the term "iron curtain."

Emerging Photography
 Sag Harbor Picture Gallery, 66 Main Street, Sag Harbor. To Mar. 15. 725-3100.
There is a considerable amount of power in this grouping of 13 talented photographers in early phases of their careers. Much of the force comes from insights into human situations, but there are also a number of bold esthetic successes. In spite of the crowded format, the selections project the thematic, stylistic and technical goals of each artist.
In many ways the show gives evidence of a growing wave of artists concerned with identifying social problems. Strong works by John Lucas and Axel Koester also convey emotional uncertainty and present the artists' own conflicts rather than the observations of a documentarian.
Addressing issues of race and isolation, Mr. Lucas allows fractured images of heads, hands and industrial landscapes to be broken again by 35 panes from an old, weathered window in a fine example of message blending with method. Auschwitz, German family members and their possible complicity in the Holocaust are woven into Mr. Koester's sequence of eight diaristic pieces, "What Will I Tell My Son?" The group includes images of a visit to the death camp by the photographer and his young child.
Other artists clearly taking positions of responsibility in their revealing works include Kristen Ashburn, Andrew Lightenstein and Alex Tehrani. Ms. Ashburn has studied institutional cases in Romania, while Mr. Lichtenstein has tried to penetrate the thoughts of individuals in Texas detentions centers. A special kind of compassion comes across in Mr. Tehrani's images of luckless, troubled students at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn. He manages to contrast toughness with a yearning for educational accomplishments.
As he pursues his interest in slice-of-life photography, with the subjects unaware of the camera, Richard Sandler tries to show people deeply absorbed in their own isolation in spite of the surrounding crush of city life. Their reverie has dignity. Mr. Sandler's talent with light achieves a delicate magic in his handling of the gauzy headcover worn by a woman waiting for a subway train.
Waiting is also the theme of Evan Kafka's memorable photograph of a solitary horse profiled against St. Petersburg's massive, stark palaces. A fine metaphor and symbol of a fragile nation, the huge empty square has the appearance of a stage on which anything might next occur.
Further insights into world conditions occur in James Nubile's black and white images from Eastern Europe that successfully combine history with extraordinary tonal and pictorial effects. One example uses the irregular night lightbeams spraying the sky to silhouette guards patrolling the Berlin Wall. Another surrounds movie makers in Sarajevo with a mysterious and dramatic foggy mist.
Imposing color photographs by David Leeson and Stephen Ferry mix their social observations with a strong sense of pattern and design, often using black shadows as a dominant compositional element. Mr. Ferry's images of women in a Spanish Sahara refugee camp, and of a mining family in Bolivia, are among the examples that deserve high marks for both compelling human insights and forceful visual components.

HEADLINE: A Stamford Landmark's Facade at the Center of a Battle

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
IN downtown Stamford, virtually denuded of landmarks after seemingly unending urban renewal, a nondescript 70-year-old building on upper Atlantic Street has become a line in the sand in the battle between preservationists and developers.
In truth, it's not the entire building, which houses the Palace Theater, that is in question, only its facade of brick, terra cotta and glazed tile, which, covered with grime, bespeaks its years of exposure to the elements and neglect. And yet it still exudes an architectural distinctiveness. 
 The four-story building opened as a vaudeville and movie house in 1927 with apartments on the upper floors and, since its revival in the 1980's, has been a center for the performing arts.
Now, though, a controversy -- perhaps the most intensive yet over a city landmark -- has developed as to whether the familiar facade on Atlantic Street should be preserved or should torn down during a proposed renovation project.
Not even those bent on saving the facade will say it is an architectural gem comparable to the now-vacant Old Town Hall, the Post Office or the old Stamford Advocate building, all of which are on the lower end of Atlantic Street. Rather, it is because the facade -- and the building itself -- is one of the few remaining tangible memories of old Stamford in the downtown district, and a very special one at that.
The Palace was for many years the grand dame of Stamford's movie theaters because of its magnificent foyer, its wide but relatively shallow 1,584-seat theater with side loges evocative of its days as a vaudeville house and its close, sharply-steeped balcony. Old-timers can recall when, during vaudeville's heyday in the 1920's and 1930's, stars like Will Rogers, Hattie McDaniel, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, Jackie Cooper, Red Skelton, Lucille Ball, The Three Stooges and Harry Blackstone the magician (and later his son, Harry Jr.) performed at the Palace.
"There's been an extraordinarily cavalier attitude in Stamford about the razing of landmarks, and the Palace is one of the last vestiges of older downtown that are left," said Neil Sherman, the president of the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. "In order to have any sense of community, we have to retain some of our community memories. And old buildings, like the Palace, are one source of memories. Other cities are now stressing the special heritage of their old buildings, but we haven't done that in Stamford."
Because of inadequate lobby space, the Stamford Center for the Arts, which owns the building in which the Palace is situated, plans to widen the front of the theater from 50 to 126 feet. To do so, the nonprofit organization bought a nearby carpet store and the site of a burned-out restaurant adjacent to the Palace. Funds for those purchases came from private donations, says John Hiddlestone, the director of development and community affairs for the Stamford Center for the Arts. Part of the renovation of the old theater, including the doubling of the stage and the construction of rehearsal rooms, is already under way, paid for in part by a $1.3 million state grant.
Though the Center's 49-member board has not yet made a final decision on the fate of the facade, most members are believed to favor razing it and building a front similar to the one on the Rich Forum on lower Atlantic Street, another venue for theatrical productions and concerts that the Center for the Arts also owns. Indeed, during a meeting of the board last month, the 20 members present unanimously agreed that the facade should be torn down and replaced with a new exterior. That nonbinding action was taken after the center had commissioned three architectural firms -- one from Bridgeport and two from New York -- to come up with separate renderings for the exterior renovation, one with the existing facade and the other without.
Comments by some board members antagonized preservationists and others determined to retain the facade, including the city's governing body, the Stamford Board of Representatives, which has unanimously voted in favor of preserving the facade.
One member of the center's board, Robert Harris, was quoted as describing the facade as being "ugly" and unworthy of preservation. Another, Robert Neu, a former Stamford superintendent of parks and recreation, went even further, speaking out against "hard core building huggers who have been diverting the process."
Frank D. Rich Jr., the president of the center's board, about half of whose members live outside of the city, was more diplomatic. "We're glad to have input from the community before we make a decision," Mr. Rich said in an interview. "I think there's a legitimate case for preservation, although we think that a minority of people in town want to preserve the front of the building. We also have to decide whether it's prudent to spend between $625,000 and $700,000 to preserve the facade."
That was a reference to the estimate, which Mr. Rich and other board members say such a project (shoring up the facade while razing the lobby), would cost. Opponents have contended that the cost would be substantially less if the entire front of the building, about 50 feet in depth, were saved, rather than merely the eight-inch-thick skin.
"The community is not going to let them" -- the Stamford Center for the Arts -- "tear the facade down," said David Anderson, president of the Stamford Partnership, a coalition of business, government and community leaders and a member of a citizens' committee set up to try to resolve the controversy. "The Palace is one of the few meritorious public places we have left and it would be folly to tear down the facade."
Roger Lang, a New York architect associated with the New York Landmarks Conservancy, agreed. "It's distinctive in its own right, and it's all the more worth saving because so little of the past is left in downtown Stamford," said Mr. Lang, who was the architect for the theater's interior restoration in the early 1980's. "It all comes down to a question of will and attitudes towards the past."
That may not bode well for the Palace's facade, given Stamford's record over the last quarter-century during which much of the downtown has been gutted and replaced by an array of contemporary construction.
"We've already suffered so many terrible losses of buildings," said Renee Kahn, the director of the Historic Neighborhoods Preservation Program in Stamford and arguably the city's most passionate and indefatigable preservationist. "Now they want to tear down a beautiful facade that is part of a historic street and replace it with something glitzy and out of place. Frank Rich doesn't like the building and his board has to go by what he tells them. After all, the Rich taste has been imposed on Stamford for the last 30 years."
That was a reference to the fact that much of Stamford's urban renewal has been done by a construction company owned by Mr. Rich's family. Indeed, the Rich Forum, which is owned and operated by the Stamford Center for the Arts, is named for the Rich family, which has deep roots in the city.
"It's no wonder that a lot of Stamford people say they never go downtown any more because they don't recognize the town," Ms. Kahn added. "There's no sense of belonging anymore. But I must say that I've never seen such across-the-board support for an issue like this."
In the end, the city of Stamford may have something to say about whether the facade will be saved. Through the city, the Stamford Center for the Arts has obtained a $ l.5 million grant from the State Department of Economic Development to help pay for the overall renovation project, estimated at between $3 and $4 million. As the conduit of that grant, the administration of Mayor Dannel P. Malloy has the authority to approve or disapprove of any design for the Palace, including the facade. And Mr. Malloy is on record as being in favor of preserving what few city landmarks remain.
The Mayor has criticized parties on both sides of the controversy. "There's been a bad job of managing this discussion," Mr. Malloy said. "There are certain buildings, like the Old Town Hall, that you preserve regardless of any particular future use. Then there are others, like the building that includes the Palace, that you want to preserve if they can be rehabilitated for specific purposes. In the case of the Palace building, I'd like to see some of the building used for office space and maybe a restaurant."
Carmen Domonkos, the president of the city's Board of Representatives, has been sharply critical of the Center for the Arts' board in the controversy.
"We've been giving tax incentives to owners of downtown property like the Stamford Center for the Arts," said Ms. Domonkos. "But if we give them such incentives and then they tear down their buildings they lose all credibility. And the city has also given about $2 million to the Stamford Center for the Arts."
Ms. Kahn sees the Palace controversy as a watershed episode in the struggle to save Stamford's few remaining landmarks. "It's time to draw a line in the sand," she said.

How a State Initiative Helps Create New Jobs

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A PROGRAM initiated by the state last May has proven helpful to companies expanding within New Jersey and has induced others to relocate to the state.
In the process new jobs are being created and empty office space is filling up, making a tight market even tighter. 
 Called the Business Employment Incentive Program, the initiative returns to companies -- in the form of grants for up to 10 years -- as much as 80 percent of the personal income tax revenue generated by each new employee. In some cases, companies also get an exemption from the state's sales tax on the purchase of machinery and equipment.
"What this does is give businesses a share in the tax revenue generated from unanticipated jobs," said Alan J. Steinberg, assistant commissioner of the state Department of Commerce, which oversees the program.
So far 24 companies have been approved for grants resulting from a total of 5,785 new jobs either created or promised, according to state data. That reflects the pattern of job growth in New Jersey, which has recaptured 217,000 of the 263,000 jobs lost during the recession, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.
Among the first companies approved for the program is MSNBC, the 24-hour cable news network begun last July by Microsoft Corporation and NBC. The network is turning a 110,000-square-foot warehouse on Hartz Way in the Secaucus Meadowlands into its expanded headquarters and studio.
The site, which was chosen over 200 others in the three-state metropolitan New York region, is expected to open by April and generate 400 jobs, said Lauren Leff, a company spokeswoman. (Separate from the program, the state is about to issue $150 million in bonds for the purchase of equipment for the building, which is being leased for 15 years from Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus.
Other concerns approved for the grants include Coopers & Lybrand, the Manhattan-based accounting firm; Lucent Technologies, an AT&T spin-off that develops and produces telecommunications products, and Teleport Communications Group of Staten Island.
Many of the companies are moving into existing office space, helping to reduce the vacancy rate in the 11-county northern New Jersey market. By the end of 1996 the rate was 16.4 percent, down from 19.4 percent the year before, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage.
Other companies are constructing buildings. One is Albert's Organics, a distributor of organic produce, which is relocating from Chadds Ford, Pa., to a 36,000-square-foot office and warehouse at the Pureland Industrial Complex off Route 95 in Bridgeport. The company is also receiving state financing to build the $2 million project, where it will employ 106 workers over the next two years.
To be eligible for the incentive program, concerns must create and maintain at least 25 jobs in targeted urban areas (municipalities with low-income neighborhoods in need of rehabilitation, such as Camden, Trenton and Newark) or at least 75 jobs elsewhere in New Jersey. Companies also have to retain a presence in the state for one and a half times the term of the grant, and it must be a prime reason they are moving to or growing in New Jersey. No money will be disbursed until the State Treasurer certifies that the taxes withheld from new employees' paychecks at least equal the amount of the grant. There are penalities and payback provisions: If a company does not maintain the jobs agreed upon the grant is terminated and if it does not stay in New Jersey the required time the state may recapture all or part of the grant.
The percentage of income tax returned to companies and for how long is based on several factors. Among them are the number and location of the jobs, the average salary for those jobs and whether the company is in an industry targeted as a growth area for New Jersey. The latter include financial services, telecommunications and international trade.
To accommodate its growing business Teleport Communications Group, a provider of telecommunications services, is expanding into a 121,000-square-foot building at the Princeton Technology Center in Dayton. Teleport, which retained its Staten Island offices, will use the Dayton building for its national training and operations center, where it expects to employ 375 to 400 workers over the next 18 months. The grant to the company, which operates in 57 metropolitan markets, will be $2.4 million over 10 years.
"While important to our original plan to expand to Dayton, the incentives became crucial as we saw opportunities to bring in additional functions such as our executive offices and sales and human resources folks," said John A. Scarpati, Teleport's chief financial officer.
THE grant to Coopers & Lybrand, which is expanding its presence in New Jersey, will be $3 million over 10 years. The accounting firm recently leased 67,000 square feet of space at 101 Hudson Street, an office tower along the Jersey City waterfront.
That brings the total amount of space the firm occupies in several locations in the state to 346,000 square feet, said Stephen A. Karness, managing partner for the firm's New Jersey operations. He said that 450 people work at the Jersey City office, and that an additional 200 jobs would be added at its New Jersey sites in the next two years.
"We could have relocated anywhere in the tristate region," said Mr. Karness. "But absent the incentive we probably would not have made the move."
Caren S. Franzini, executive director of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which is administering the incentive program, said: "The idea is to bring highly skilled jobs to the state." And in terms of competition, she added, "it helps even the playing field" with other parts of the country where the costs of living and doing business are lower.
Mr. Steinberg also pointed out that the program "honors the state's nonraiding agreement" with New York.
Developers, landlords and brokers also see the program as a plus in marketing existing or proposed office buildings.
"I don't want to hype it but the program has keened the interest of major tenants," said Edwin H. Cohen, an executive director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield. And it can have an impact on the cost of doing business, creating "an additional economic advantage" to draw tenants, he added.
Mr. Cohen is the exclusive leasing agent for the 758,525-square-foot office tower the Lefrak Organization, of Rego Park, Queens, plans to build at the Newport mixed-used project on the Jersey City waterfront once a major tenant leases space. Three other developer groups are also planning offices on the riverfront in Jersey City and Hoboken.
State incentives, which are not new, are largely borne from a "keep up with the Joneses attitude and their use goes up and down" depending on market forces, said Gene DePrez, a partner at Fluora Daniels Consulting, an international firm based in Morristown that specializes in corporate location issues. The trend is away from the pure cash awards given to companies during the mid-80's building boom, he said.
New Jersey's program "is an extraordinarily conservative incentive," said Dean Hughes. "The state is getting some revenue while not reducing existing tax revenue. And it is creating jobs that might not be there otherwise."
Mr. Steinberg of the Commerce Department added: "The key is that the program is revenue neutral." It does not cut into other state programs or cause taxes to rise, he added.
For companies, such incentives, while not the driving force behind their decision to relocate, could be "the tie- breaker," said Mr. DePrez. He said the availability and cost of labor and operating costs remain priorities.
"No one incentive is a panacea," added Mr. Steinberg. It is, he said, "another tool in the state's economic development arsenal" to help it capture its share of future businesses and jobs.

HEADLINE: UConn, Capitalizing on Salt Water Connections

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE studies and projects underway at the University of Connecticut's campus at Avery Point in Groton are as varied as the marine life in Long Island Sound: aquaculture, marine sciences and research partnerships with marine businesses. And Avery Point's maritime heritage is getting richer as construction of a new marine sciences center begins.
"Part of my vision is seeing these entities come together in a more coherent way, and that's happening," said David Madacsi, the interim director at Avery Point. "The campus is clearly developing a niche strongly associated with its marine location." 
 UConn is spending $51.8 million on construction at Avery Point to enable the university to compete with other research institutions for financial support and to attract scientists, students and partners in industry. Construction is expected to begin in June on a new Marine Sciences Research Laboratory; a building to house Project Oceanology, a marine science program primarily for high school and middle school students, and a central utility plant. Construction of a library is scheduled to start in the year 2000, Mr. Madacsi said. These plans are included in UConn 2000, the 10-year program to improve the university's infrastructure and buildings.
The Avery Point campus, situated on a 73-acre finger of land jutting into Long Island Sound, has been associated with the study of coastal waters since its founding in 1967. As southeastern Connecticut's economy shifted away from dependence on military construction contracts, the university and the state agreed to develop a research and technology center that could promote maritime industries, create jobs and train students -- undergraduate majors in coastal studies are being set up -- for the job market. The Marine Sciences and Technology Center was established in 1994.
One of the aquaculture projects at the center, conducted in collaboration with the National Marine Fisheries Service Laboratory in Milford, involves bay scallops, currently in limited production in the United States. Research has focused on identifying obstacles to commercial production in Connecticut, improving cultivation methods and restoring scallop populations in Long Island Sound.
More than 130,000 seed scallops have been provided to Stonington, Waterford and East Lyme to help bolster wild stocks. And 15,000 seed scallops were grown in Clinton Harbor, according to the university. If a commercial scallop industry were developed, jobs would be available in cultivation and supporting businesses like net and gear manufacturing.
In the Coastal Environmental Laboratory at the center, Richard Jadamec and Carol Anderson, co-directors of the laboratory, are working under contract with Marine Research Associates in North Stonington to identify the properties of oils that cause them to float or sink. The information is useful in finding and cleaning up oil spills.
Beakers of water were lined up in a recent visit to the lab. In some containers, a blanket of black goo lay on top of the water. In others, it floated beneath the surface or sank in a ball to the bottom.
Mr. Jadamec, a research assistant, and Ms. Anderson, a chemistry teacher, watch the movements of these residual oils in order to gain a better understanding of oil spills.
Shifting relationships between the properties of oil and water -- for instance, changes in surface tension or density -- affect oils in different ways, Mr. Jadamec said. "Turbulence is a factor, as well as the changes oil undergoes when exposed to the environment," he explained.
Mr. Jadamec measures the buoyancy of a ball of oil by timing its rise between two points in a glass cylinder. He also analyzes the effects of weather, evaporation and bacteria on the components of a given type of oil. Knowledge of its makeup is necessary in identifying the origin of a spill, a process called fingerprinting.
"If we can understand the behavior of oil, we may find a better way of doing cleanups," Mr. Jadamec said.
UConn belongs to a consortium of contractors in the United States, led by Ship Analytics International Inc. of North Stonington, that established a training center in Egypt for oil spill management and prevention.
Ship Analytics, a developer of maritime simulation and training, received a $21 million contract for the project from the Arab Academy for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Egypt.

Mr. Jadamec, who went to Egypt to help the academy develop oil fingerprinting techniques, said collaborating in research and sharing resources benefits the university and its corporate partners alike.
"These strong ties offer students exposure to problem situations in industry so they learn what the industrial environment is about," he said.
Building on Avery Point's relationship with the sea, two new undergraduate degrees in coastal studies, were recently approved by UConn's board of trustees. If approved by the State Department of Higher Education, the bachelor's degree programs would be the first offered at the Avery Point campus. Students would earn a B.A. or B.S. degree in the department of marine sciences. Currently, students transfer to the main UConn campus at Storrs to complete requirements for graduation.
Providing impetus for a coastal studies major, in addition to economic changes in southeastern Connecticut, is the fact that half the population of the United States lives within a hundred miles of its coasts. The concentration of people in coastal areas is expected to increase to 60 percent within the next 15 years, Mr. Madacsi said.
The coastal studies curriculum was developed after surveying businesses and obtaining the admissions criteria for a dozen graduate schools. Marine businesses were asked what skills and training they look for in employees, said the program's coordinator, James Kremer. Courses include liberal arts and marine and social sciences. Students would work with actual case studies of coastal issues and policy problems, participate in field research and gain experience through internships.
Graduates with a degree in coastal studies would be prepared for careers or graduate study in coastal environmental policy and management, regulation, education, science, law or business. "No matter what direction students go in, there are going to be implications of living in a coastal zone," Mr. Kremer said. A professor of marine sciences, Mr. Kremer arrived at UConn a year and a half ago from the University of Southern California, where he was a biology professor and coordinator of an undergraduate science curriculum on Santa Catalina Island.
Classes in the coastal studies major are scheduled to begin in the fall, said Mr. Kremer, who expects the program to accommodate 20 to 40 majors a year over the next five years. Although expansion would require addition of new teachers and equipment, Mr. Kremer said, he is optimistic that the university would support if the program were attractive to students. Noting that a large number of high school graduates in Connecticut attend college out of state, Mr. Kremer said, "We need to entice them to stay here."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Andrew Farkas and ESG;
A New Lead Player Who Is Changing the Game

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
AGGRESSIVELY raising money and buying financially shaky housing properties across the country during the early 1990's, Andrew L. Farkas quickly built Insignia Financial Group into the nation's largest manager of residential real estate.
With the purchase of the Edward S. Gordon Company last year, Mr. Farkas, who is chairman, president and chief executive of Insignia, signaled that he wanted to increase the company's presence on the commercial side as well, with the goal of becoming a national company in that segment of the business. 
 But competitors say buying commercial real estate companies in a strong market will be a lot more difficult than taking over distressed housing developments that lenders were happy to part with. And, they say, Mr. Farkas may not appreciate how difficult it may be to knit disparate corporate cultures into a seamless organization.
Nevertheless, the 36-year-old Mr. Farkas is currently a hot young man in a field that has seen more dreams dashed than fulfilled in recent years. Revenues at Insignia swelled from a little over $18 million in 1991 to $125 million in 1995, the most recent year for which figures are available. He is the owner of about 27 percent percent of Insignia's stock, a share worth $175 million, after being $5 million in debt at the beginning of the decade.
Despite the company's rapid growth and the recovery of real estate values across the country, he said, there are still opportunities out there. "I loved buying distressed properties because the values were terrific, but the last distressed deal we did was in early 1993," he said in a temporary office on the 34th floor of 375 Park Avenue. He is occuping the space until all of Insignia's New York holdings can be consolidated in one location.
The company's current strategy, he said, is to create additional value by operating real estate better than previous managers. "If we buy a property for X and it has a revenue stream of 0.2 X, we think we can get it to .4 X or .5 X," Mr. Farkas said.
One reason the bulk of Insignia's operations are in Greenville, S.C., is to keep a low cost base for a business that has traditionally had thin margins. "Historically speaking, management was a loss leader in commercial real estate," he said. "You did management to get the leasing deals. But we have figured out a way to make money in management."
The company manages over 300,000 residential units, which include condominiums and cooperatives as well as rental apartments.
Although he affects a folksy, country manner, responding "Yes, sir," and "Yes, ma'am" to questions, he is a New Yorker born and bred, a son of Robin L. Farkas, the former chairman of Alexander's, the department store chain that filed for bankruptcy in May 1992.
He acknowledges that having his name helped his early career as a real estate tax shelter syndicator, because many of the investors he was wooing were his father's friends who would return calls. The family relationship also provided an early connection with the Gordon company.
"Robin Farkas was one of a number of senior people who were very kind to me when I was young," Mr. Gordon recalled. "So, one day he called me and said his son was at Harvard and wanted to do his thesis on commercial real estate. He asked if I would allow him access to the dossier of market information we had collected and the people who put it together. We met and I found that he was a super kid with a tremendous energy level and a thirst to discover what the world was all about."
The paper, entitled "An Econometric Model for Prime Commercial Office Space in Manhattan," was duly delivered to the Harvard College Economics Department, where it was given a rating of magna honors, the second highest possible grade.
After graduation, Mr. Farkas, who said his initial application was rejected by Harvard Business School, went to work on Wall Street, starting at Salomon Brothers.
Both men stayed in touch, with Mr. Farkas avoiding Mr. Gordon's attempts to hire him and Mr. Gordon declining to invest in the various real estate deals Mr. Farkas was organizing.
MR. GORDON said he was content to keep his company private, but acknowledged that a public company's access to capital gave it a powerful engine for growth. When he and Stephen B. Siegel, ESG's president, decided it was time to expand the company out of the New York metropolitan area, they looked for ways to accomplish the task.
"I ended up calling Andrew," said Mr. Gordon. "He was in South Carolina when I called him and said I had an idea for ESG that I'd like to talk to him about. His response was to ask me what I was doing for lunch tomorrow."
The $74 million deal was done quickly and the Gordon empire, the fourth largest commercial real estate operation in the country, was folded into Insignia's commercial group, which now manages 110 million square feet of property nationally.
Mr. Siegel, who was named to manage all of Insignia's commercial properties, said the first months after the takeover were spent consolidating operations spread out across the country. But now, he said, he's on the hunt.
"We will never be a company with offices in 70 or 80 cities," he said. "It will probably never be more than a dozen major markets." He said acquisitions in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington areas were high on the list, followed by Florida and Boston.
Mr. Siegel said Insignia officials had decided that acquiring existing full service firms was preferable to trying to send people out from New York to start up cold in new markets. He said that since the established national firms, such as Cushman & Wakefield and CB Commercial, were not for sale, Insignia would have to seek out individual companies prominent in local markets.
But veterans of national expansions say they are neither easy or cheap. "We did it, but it took 15 years and we had our successes and failures," said Arthur J. Mirante, president and chief executive of Cushman & Wakefield.
"Part of the management challenge is to take different types of companies and blend them into a common platform," Mr. Mirante said. "The client does not want one type of research report in Chicago and another one in New York."
Because the real estate market has recovered from its lows, Insignia will have to pay "top dollar" for acquisitions, Mr. Mirante said, which could put pressure on earnings.
"I clapped when Insignia acquired Gordon," said Steven A. Swerdlow, executive vice president of New York area operations for CB Commercial. "The reason is that Steve Siegel is going to be taking his eye off the ball in the best market in the country -- New York."
He said CB Commercial had expanded from its original base of the West Coast by opening what he termed "home grown" offices in nearly 80 cities.
Mr. Swerdlow said one problem with acquiring local companies is that they are often dominated by a small number of people who may lose their drive after receiving a large payment for their business.
"In many cases it's an exit strategy," he said. He said Gordon was widely reported to be negotiating with Rostenberg-Doern, a commercial brokerage active in Westchester County and in Fairfield County, Conn. "You have two individuals in their late 50's or early 60's," he said. "What happens if they are acquired?"
John Rostenberg. one of the principals of the company, declined to comment on talks, if any, with Gordon. But he said "we would certainly not go into a venture and then walk out the door -- that's not why you do it."
Mr. Siegel said: "We don't do deals with people we don't have pre-existing relationships with. In addition, there are ways to structure things so that payment is linked to performance for three to five years, so there is time to integrate cultures."
Richard Podos, co-manager of the New York office of Equis Corporation, which specializes in tenant representation, said "the problem with acquiring service businesses is that the assets go home at night.".
The top Gordon officials say they have fit easily into the Insignia organization, despite Mr. Farkas's youth and hard-driving ways. "Andrew has dealt with me in an elegant way," said Mr. Gordon. "He gives me respect, but I recognize that he has the ultimate decision-making power."
Mr. Farkas, who lives in New York with his wife, Pamela, and two young daughters, admits to being computer oriented, and his ways are rubbing off on executives who tried to avoid the onrush of technology.
"I'm a convert to E-mail," said Mr. Siegel, who admitted that he seldom confronted a computer in the past without a technical assistant at his side. "Andrew uses it a lot -- he literally speaks to you through the computer," he said. "I took a laptop with me on my last trip and used to to communicate with people on the East Coast who were hard to reach because of the time zones."
"We have a complete internal E-mail system for all 9,200 people in the company," Mr. Farkas said. "E-mail is going to be as important to business as the telephone."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Always at the Crossroads

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
RICARDO KHAN remembers it well, after a fashion and after perhaps 18 years.
It was a time of incubation for the Crossroads Theater Company, then on the second floor of a former sewing factory. He was working the box office. He was answering the telephones. He was directing. He was acting. Between productions, he was appearing on the unemployment line. 
 One day a woman called. "You know, I'm white," she said. "Is it O.K. for me to buy a ticket?" The rest is fuzzy. "It's O.K., it's O.K.: we have a special section roped off in the back, just for whites," Mr. Khan may have said, or wished he had.
"Her question floored me," Mr. Khan said, now with total recall. "The reason we came into existence was to bring folks together. And here was a white person doing the same self-editing things that black people do, revealing the compromises we make within ourselves before we bring our whole being to someone else."
Delivering the message that Crossroads isn't "just a black theater," but a theater for everybody, has been an all-consuming mission for Mr. Khan, 45, founding member, artistic director and resident visionary, through almost two decades of standoffs on the race card.
"In the early 80's, liberal was not a bad word," he said. "The thought of people coming together in the name of peace was not considered corny. Today, the sound bites say, 'Blacks for blacks, whites for whites,' so we must ask, 'Is there a common ground?' and 'Is it a safe ground?' The world is more polarized than it was on the day the woman asked me that question."
And variations of a simplistic black-versus-white dichotomy go on. "Just as you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy Levy's rye bread, you don't have to be black to appreciate and be moved by 'Fear Itself,' " one reviewer wrote about Eugene Lee's play, produced at Crossroads last year.
If Mr. Khan's ideal of a cosmic rainbow -- a sublime contradiction of celebrating diversity while envisioning oneness -- is still reduced to black-and-white by some theatergoers and reviewers, he responds with resignation, forgiveness, patience and enlightenment. "These are honest reactions, real and welcome," he says. "We have much more to learn about how we're thinking than we think."
Mr. Khan would rather have the questions asked -- "it's just distressing that they are asked," he admits -- and the assumptions expressed "than for people to think this place is only for us."
IN 1978, two recent graduates of the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University here had a dream, and a plan of action. Armed with master's degrees in acting and directing, Mr. Khan and L. Kenneth Richardson assailed the theater establishment that had made patronizing offerings to black actors: roles as drug dealers and deadbeats, pimps and wife-beaters, with an occasional nod to "some of my best friends are . . ." tokenism.
In his earliest years, Ricardo Mohamed Khan, the oldest of five children born to Dr. Mustapha Mohamed Khan, a native of Trinidad, and Jacqueline Driver, lived in Washington. The family moved to a farm in Norristown, Pa., during Dr. Khan's medical internships, then to Philadelphia (his mother's birthplace) and Camden before settling in Cherry Hill.
Mr. Khan, then known as Rick, enrolled in Rutgers University in 1969. "I stayed for graduate school," he said. "I stayed for graduation. And I stayed for Crossroads."
Mr. Khan and Mr. Richardson founded Crossroads with a $50,000 grant under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, a Federal job-creation program of the 1970's. Necessary sponsorship came from the George Street Playhouse, then under the artistic direction of Eric Krebs.
"To a certain degree, forming Crossroads was about changing the world," Mr. Khan said. "But it was really, really about wanting to be a part of a world -- not with us on the side, but a world that turns to glorify the human spirit. That's what we were about then, and that's what we're about now."
Within a decade of its formation, Crossroads won an assured place on the regional-theater map. Joseph Papp, founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival singled it out as one of his two favored theaters. (The other was the Royal Court in London.) In quick succession, two plays by George C. Wolfe, a Crossroads discovery who in 1993 became Mr. Papp's successor, moved from New Brunswick to Off Broadway: "The Colored Museum," a trail-blazing satire of black stereotypes, and "Spunk," an adaptation of three stories by Zora Neale Hurston.
And by 1992, Crossroads itself had moved from its rickety birthplace on Memorial Parkway to a $4 million showplace, the tony centerpiece of New Brunswick's cultural complex on Livingston Avenue that includes George Street and the State Theater. So significant has Crossroads become as a living symbol of emerged black theater that Bill Cosby, who donated a week of one-man shows to the new space when it opened, refused to answer the queries of a New York reporter who had never heard of it.
NOW that Crossroads is at the center of a publicity blitz touched off by the recent war of words between the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August Wilson and Robert Brustein, founding director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and critic for The New Republic, it is no longer likely that the theater is unheard of by representatives of New York's news media or cultural elite. (Related article, Arts & Leisure, page 5.)
And Mr. Khan is, yet again, in the midst of the sort of reductive black-versus-white debate that it is his eternal struggle to avoid. He compares the self-conscious, "sanitized" dispute between Mr. Brustein (an advocate of all-inclusive art transcending race) and Mr. Wilson (a champion of separatist black theater), to the credos (nonviolent versus militant) that separated heroes (the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X) who are cut short of conciliation in the 1960's. That was a bitterly ironic message of "The Meeting," the Crossroads production at the time of the Wilson-Brustein debate last month at Town Hall in Manhattan.
The meeting between Mr. Brustein and Mr. Wilson was sponsored by American Theater magazine, published by the Theater Communications Group, an association of countrywide nonprofit theaters -- of which Mr. Khan is the president.
Mr. Khan can't help wondering why the event was so uneventful. "It's the American way that everybody has to compete, take a side, win -- as if both couldn't be right," he said. "With Martin and Malcolm, we had to pick our hero. Thirty years later at Town Hall, we had to take a side."
He is objective about heroes and passionate about taking no sides, about "celebrating all of who we are." Mr. Khan was speaking out for multiculturalism before a belief turned into a handy buzzword. He was championing diversity before it became politically expedient on grant applications.
"Theaters should produce what they want to produce," he said. "But I get offended if they go out and say, 'Let's put on a black play.' You should do it because your heart is in it, not because you should do it, but because you must."
When Mr. Wilson, pronouncing himself "a race man," railed against the lack of financial support for the black theaters last June in the keynote address of the National Conference of the Theater Communications Group at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, he mentioned that out of 66 member theaters of the League of Resident Theaters, only one was black.
"Crossroads is one of many non-mainstream organizations around the country," Mr. Khan said. "We cannot define ourselves in such a limiting way, like, 'I'm the only black in this room.'
"And I don't know what 'race man' means. I am very aware of my race when I want to be and when I don't want to be. It boosts me at times. It nags me at other times."
In discussing his position as the head of Theater Communications Group, Mr. Khan saidpaused to remember the group's conference at Rutgers in the early 1980's. "Crossroads was just two or three years old," he said, "and Lee and I wanted to go and belong to something beyond race. But we couldn't afford it."
When he took over, he added: "I needed to be the president, not the black president. But there was a need to treat me as the black president. The real issue that divides people is class, not race.
"I wanted to get into something I could take home with me and use. We need to talk about collaboration, what we can do to make theater central to American society, and about being respected for who we are. We're not in a melting pot of dissolving ingredients. I prefer the metaphor of a tossed salad, and I'm concerned about the role imagination and creativity play in the making of society.
"We have to redefine the African-American experience in more global terms, who we are. Yes, we're black. Yes, we're American. Yes, we're in the world -- on a meeting ground. Race relations have changed drastically. But we're still at a crossroads, and we still pivot on the same axis."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUND;
A Scorecard Doesn't Help In the Money-Fund Game

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
WHEN Strong Capital Management bailed out three of its money market funds early this month, investors had every right to be surprised.
The most recent report on holdings by two of the funds was dated last Aug. 31, five months before the bailout. The shareholder report for the third fund was dated Oct. 31. 
 And that highlights a weakness in fund disclosure. By the time investors in any fund receive its twice-a-year reports on portfolio holdings, the information may be hopelessly out of date. It is especially true with money market funds, whose holdings have average maturities of no more than 90 days.
"I don't think disclosure on any fund is good enough," said Louis P. Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors Inc. in Pittsburgh. But, he added, "twice yearly is ridiculous." Furthermore, fund companies now have 60 days to get those reports to regulators and shareholders; Mr. Stanasolovich advocates a 15-day requirement.
Although the reports of all three Strong funds listed some holdings in Mercury Finance -- the auto lender that defaulted on its debt and led to the bailout -- those reports noted that all such securities were set to mature before the end of January, when Mercury's debt became virtually worthless. Mercury Finance defaulted on $17 million in short-term loans on Jan. 31 after the disclosure of serious accounting irregularities.
But the Strong funds acquired more debt from Mercury Finance after the reports' dates, and Strong confirmed early this month that it bought back commercial paper from the three funds to avoid investor losses. The affected funds were the top-yielding Strong Heritage Money fund, the Strong Institutional Money Market fund and the Strong Money Market fund.
Shareholders in many other money market funds still don't know whether their funds held similar securities. At the time of the Mercury default, half of the 10 top-yielding money market funds tracked by IBC Money Fund Report on Feb. 11 had not provided shareholders with a new report since June 1996. Updated reports for these funds, with information through December, are due by the end of this month. By telephone, all the top 10 funds besides Strong denied holding Mercury Finance paper.
In recent years, attempts to provide more timely disclosure have gone nowhere. "So far, the industry has won every battle with the S.E.C. on this issue," said Sanford Bragg, head of the managed-funds ratings group at the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In July 1995, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed that money market funds provide portfolio information electronically each quarter. The commission was concerned after a number of money market funds got into trouble in 1994 because of the bankruptcy of Orange County, California, and the rapid increases in interest rates that undermined some complex financial instruments known as derivatives.
The S.E.C. proposal met with a withering attack from the Investment Company Institute, a fund trade group in Washington. The I.C.I. argued that compliance would be costly and burdensome. The systems and procedures for preparing the data "are far more significant than the commission seems to have anticipated and outweigh any useful purpose," the group wrote. As an alternative, it proposed that more general information be provided monthly to regulators and to the public, and that in a crisis, the S.E.C. could request more information.
Since then, the S.E.C.'s proposal has gathered dust. "We got substantial negative comment," said Barry Barbash, director of the agency's division of investment management. "We haven't found a disclosure format yet that meets our needs and that of investors." He noted that the commission has a legal obligation to take costs into account in its rulemaking.
Quarterly updates would not have prevented the Strong problem, industry officials and regulators say. "If information had been provided to us on a quarterly basis," Mr. Barbash said, "would we have been in a better position to see the problem with Mercury Finance? I don't think so."
Two ratings agencies -- Thomson Bankwatch and the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company -- had given Mercury Finance's paper a top-tier rating. But the two leading agencies, S.& P. and Moody's, had awarded the paper lower ratings -- marks not good enough for money market fund investments. "If someone who's in the business of rating funds can't figure out there's a problem, how are you and I going to figure it out based on information that's months old?" asked Paul S. Stevens, senior vice president and general counsel of the I.C.I.
A spokeswoman for Strong, Jody R. Lowe, agreed. "Disclosure would not have prevented what happened with Mercury," she said.
Given the rapid turnover in money market portfolios, nothing short of daily disclosure would provide a truly accurate picture. But that would be costly and would force funds to reveal proprietary trading strategies to competitors, Ms. Lowe said.
Concerns about strategy seem overblown to some. "Money market instruments are relatively generic," said Mr. Bragg of S.& P. "There is only a certain range of things you can do running a money market fund."
Even with quarterly or daily portfolio information, investors might not be able to act on market news before their funds suffered, the regulators argue. "It is unclear to me whether access to immediate information would be of assistance," said Robert E. Plaze, associate director of the division of investment management at the S.E.C. "It wouldn't allow you to avoid the problem."
Mr. Barbash said his agency's mission is not to eliminate risk in money market funds. "We're not bank regulators," he said. "Our mandate is investor protection, and therefore our efforts would be geared toward whether investors were misled."
Perhaps the most compelling argument for better disclosure is that it would help investors do a better job of picking funds. According to Mr. Stanasolovich, monthly reports would give him a better idea of which funds were stretching for yield and, therefore, taking more risk. "It's not that big a burden," he said, "and certainly these organizations can afford that."
In fact, more than 200 money funds already provide weekly data to S.& P. so they can be rated. "We require weekly portfolio holdings to be provided because money market portfolios turn over quite frequently," Mr. Bragg noted. "The information is all there."
Funds now report electronically to the S.E.C., too. The information could even be made available to investors on the World Wide Web site for Edgar, the S.E.C.'s electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system (http://www.sec.gov). Peter Crane, managing editor of IBC Money Fund Report in Ashland, Mass., said that with Edgar, "The time may be ripe for quarterly or monthly reporting."
More frequent disclosure might also discourage some funds from investing in risky securities altogether. "I think it would cause some problems to be addressed before the report was ever published," Mr. Stanasolovich said.
For now, investors should realize that even if portfolio information seems dated, money market fund managers tend to roll over their money with an issuer once they have done the research to buy one of its securities. That was true of Strong and the Mercury Finance paper, Ms. Lowe said.
On better disclosure, the fund industry will probably "drag its feet," Mr. Stanasolovich predicted, but "we will see quarterly reporting."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "High Yield, but at What Price?"
Money market funds often waive at least some of their expenses to bolster their yields. Chart list the the 10 highest-yielding funds for the week ended Feb. 11, when the average yield for general-purpose funds was 4.86 percent. All 10 leaders waived some expenses.
Funds can also achieve higher yields by buying riskier securities. If you are curious about the holdings of these top-yielding funds, don't run to their twice-a-year reports for answers. Money funds hold securities with very short maturities, so the reports may be hopelessly out of date. (Source: IBC's Money Fund Report)

Raw Sewage, Great Timing: An Election Year Tale

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
It was a campaign strategist's dream.
Standing on a bluff, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, as a dozen television cameras recorded every word, Governor Whitman issued a stern warning to New York: Don't even think about dumping 560 million gallons of raw sewage into New York Harbor, an act, she argued, that would threaten New Jersey's shellfish beds and beaches. 
 By the end of the day, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both Republicans, had backed down. They promised there would be no sewage dumping this year, and no dumping next year without a thorough environmental review.
For Governor Whitman, the prospect of raw sewage flowing south handed her a great opportunity during a re-election year. She was able to appear on the television news Tuesday night not only as a strong, commanding leader on behalf of her state, but also as a fearless environmental crusader at a time when she badly needs to bolster her record on the environment.
The environment ranks particularly high among issues that New Jersey voters care about. The state's economy has been long dominated by petroleum refining and chemical manufacturing companies that operate close to densely populated residential areas and waterways. There are more Superfund toxic-waste sites in New Jersey than in any other state.
Until recently, Mrs. Whitman has not been getting high marks from environmental groups.
In fact, this time last year environmental groups barraged her with criticism. Among other things, they strongly objected to deep budget cuts at the State Department of Environmental Protection and 1,500 pages of proposed changes in water regulations that would have allowed more toxic substances to be dumped into the state's waterways.
They held regular rallies, news conferences, and even paid for a radio advertising campaign that accused her of rolling back the state's environmental-protection measures.
At the time, Democrats viewed Mrs. Whitman's stance on the environment as one of the few areas, where the popular tax-cutting Governor could be vulnerable in this year's election. And while publicly defending her approach to the environment, Mrs. Whitman's top aides were privately expressing concern that the criticism would resonate with voters.
Beginning late last year, the administration set out to create a much different perception among voters about the Whitman administration's environmental record. Bob Friant, a top aide to the Governor's chief of staff, Harriet Derman, was dispatched to the environmental protection department to help improve its image.
Quickly, things began to change.
Governor Whitman announced that the state would scrap its 1,500 pages of proposed new water rules and start over. This time, Mrs. Whitman promised, both environmentalists and business groups would be at the table, and they would reach agreement on the major issues before new regulations would be published.
Then, after steadily slashing the environmental agency's budget over the last three years, Governor Whitman last month proposed a slight increase.
She also took every opportunity possible in her State of the State address to the Legislature last month to point out her record on the environment, which even her opponents acknowledge is quite good when it comes to preserving open space.
And then, came the raw-sewage plan, giving her a picture-perfect opportunity to dramatize her commitment to keep New Jersey's beaches, and shellfish beds clean after cutting funds only a year ago to help clean up the shore. Lawmakers eventually restored the program.
The environmental lobbyists embrace Mrs. Whitman as a new-found ally, but they say that her new stance does not make amends for her past policies, and record.
"She certainly has taken more pro-environmental positions in the last three months than she has in the last three years," said David Pringle, campaign director for the New Jersey Environmental Federation, an umbrella group for dozens of state environmental groups. "But that in no way makes up for all of the anti-environment positions of the last three years."
Mr. Pringle praised Governor Whitman for strongly opposing New York City's plan to dump the raw sewage, but he noted that New Jersey continues to dump a significant amount of raw sewage into the state's waterways.
New York City's plan would have dumped 140 million gallons of raw sewage into the harbor a day, over four days, totaling 560 million gallons. Mr. Pringle said the aging sewer systems in the northern part of the state, following a heavy downpour, can dump up to 140 million gallons of raw sewage a day that eventually finds its way into the ocean.
"It is a easy to tell New York what to do or what not to do, " Mr. Pringle said. "It is a lot tougher to get New Jersey's house in order. When all the headlines go away, we are still going to have 85 percent of our waters un swimmable, and unfishable, in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act."

New Round In Fight Over Mortgage Fee

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

 BODY:
A VIRGINIA case that had mortgage borrowers and consumer advocates celebrating only a few weeks ago was appealed last week, with the two banks accused of illegal practices asking that the suit be dismissed.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, is expected to decide within weeks whether to accept the case. If it does, it will take on a controversial question: Are banks breaking the law by paying certain fees to the independent mortgage brokers that refer loans to them? 
 At issue are the fees commonly paid by banks when a broker sends them a mortgage loan for a higher-than-normal interest rate. A bank might pay a broker the special fee, called a yield spread premium, if the broker writes a home loan at 9 percent that could have been written at a lower rate. Banks say this is an accepted way to compensate brokers that generate loans for them. And they say it can reduce a home buyer's closing costs by shifting part of the broker's fee to the bank.
Borrowers who have sued call such payments kickbacks that result in higher interest payments. The plaintiffs argue that the payments are outlawed by the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.
Last month, Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr., of the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, sent shock waves through the mortgage industry by saying -- in a ruling that denied the banks' motion to dismiss the suit -- that the payments were prohibited by law. Although it was only an early ruling in the case, the statement was surprisingly definitive.
The Mortgage Bankers Association of America filed a brief on the side of the two banks, Saxon Mortgage Inc. and the Crestar Mortgage Corporation. Those banks, both based in Richmond, won a stay of all further action in the suit while they sought an appeal of Judge Bryan's refusal to dismiss.
In granting the stay, Judge Bryan said he had not made a final decision in the case and that his earlier ruling meant only that the "plaintiff has stated a sufficient claim" that the payments were illegal.
Crestar's lawyer, Leonard Bernstein, said Judge Bryan was backtracking. But Daniel A. Ragland, who represents the two couples suing the banks, said: "He's not changing his mind here. He is still saying that under the facts as alleged it is illegal."
Homeowners began suing in recent years as mortgage brokers became more prevalent. The early suits were settled without the lenders admitting wrongdoing. The Ford Consumer Finance Company, a subsidiary of the auto maker, agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement last August.
In cases that proceeded, different judges produced different outcomes. Three weeks after Judge Bryan criticized fees in the Virginia case, a Federal district judge in Alabama ruled that a yield spread premium was "permissible as a matter of law."
More than a dozen lawsuits dealing with the issue have been filed in Federal courts across the country, Crestar argues in seeking an appeal. "No court of appeals has yet spoken on the legal questions raised in these cases," the bank said.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Latin Markets Again Run With the Bulls

BYLINE: By DAN COLARUSSO 

 BODY:
ANYONE who bought Latin American stock and bond funds a year ago can claim bragging rights at cocktail parties. The gains in both categories have been handsome, exceeding 40 percent in some cases.
But a not-so-subtle shift has taken place early this year. After a two-year rally, bonds have been replaced by stocks as the winning investment in the region. 
 After all, stocks are supposed to be the riskier, more rewarding investment in good times. And though the bonds have behaved much like stocks in recent years, money managers and financial analysts expect Latin American equities to now have their day in the sun.
Continued political changes and resurgent local economies created the two-year bull market for bonds and set the stage for this stock rally. Enthusiasm for the stock markets has returned, though not to the frothy levels of 1993 before the Mexican peso crisis, says Juan Carlos Garcia, the head of equity research at Santander Investments in New York.
To be sure, political risk remains apparent in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and even Mexico. A political meltdown could occur elsewhere as well. Still, the stability of the governments and their economic policies after the devaluation of the peso in late 1994 has reassured investors.
Money managers and equity analysts see relatively little risk in the region, barring volatility in the United States -- namely, a sharp increase in interest rates or a plunge by the stock market.
"The current recovery in equity prices is driven by the improvement in risk perception," said Walter Molano, an SBC Warburg economist.
The performance of the regional stock markets was solid last year, and mutual funds, stocked with blue-chip shares like Telebras, Telefonos de Mexico and Electrobras, performed well. Morgan Stanley's Latin American retail and institutional portfolios were the pace-setters, with gains of more than 46 percent for the 12 months ended on Feb. 14.
The pace has picked up this year. Every Latin American stock fund tracked by Morningstar had a gain of more than 10 percent for the first six weeks of the year. The leader, Merrill Lynch Latin America, exceeded 17 percent.
Still, the markets have room to run. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in this country is trading at about 22 times earnings, Brazilian stocks have a p/e ratio of 12.4, Mexican stocks 19.5 and Argentine stocks 24.5, according to State Street Global Advisors, money managers.
Mr. Garcia of Santander cites overall regional strength as a main reason for optimism. "For the first time in Latin America, growth is at the same levels in all of the big countries," he said. The gross domestic products of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico are growing at 3.5 percent to 5 percent, he said.
More capital in the area and low valuations in most stock sectors will fuel equity growth, he said. Consumer products and construction sectors, dependent on domestic spending, look more attractive to him than defensive stocks like utilities.
Other fund managers agree. "In all of the Latin economies, we've seen strength in the core emerging-markets plays, such as telecom and infrastructure, and the next stage in that progression is for consumers to start spending," said Robert Furdak, manager of the State Street Global Advisors Emerging Markets fund.
THE last couple of years, though, belonged to the region's bond markets. Fidelity New Markets Income returned 42 percent for the 12 months ended Feb. 14, and Bear Stearns Emerging Markets Debt gained 37 percent.
The bargains found in Latin American debt in early 1995 no longer exist, but investors seeking a high yield will still find better value in the region than in the United States junk-bond market, said David Reiss, an emerging-markets fixed-income portfolio manager at Bankers Trust Global Investment Management.
Latin debt captured the imagination of investors in 1995, when, despite a hangover from the peso crisis, it rose along with the United States Treasury market.
Last year, Argentina's commitment to its currency, Brazil's move to keep President Fernando Cardoso in office and the successful international bailout of Mexico made the bonds perform like "equities in drag," said Ali Naqvi, the head of emerging-markets fixed-income research at Citibank Global Asset Management.
The ride shows no sign of ending. Ed Vaimberg, manager of the Bear Stearns Emerging Markets Debt Portfolio, predicts 20 percent gains this year.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH;
Filling Gap Left by Caldor

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Hailed in July 1995 as a sign of the resurgence of Flatbush Avenue, the Caldor department store at the corner of Tilden Avenue may again be a bellwether.
Following the Feb. 11 announcement by the Caldor Corporation that it would close the store in May because of poor performance, owners, managers and workers at a half-dozen nearby businesses were already reporting mediocre sales last week. And they were already expressing fears that unless a new tenant is found quickly to fill the cavernous space, the closing of the Caldor could bring stagnation to an area that was taking its first steps toward economic revitalization. 
 "In '94, '95 and '96, it's been stable, but not growing very quickly," said Joseph Gindi, who has owned the Flatbush Houseland store across the street from the Caldor site for the last 25 years, back when a Macy's branch was there. "We make a living. Replacing it would be better. We need a big department store to bring people to the area."
The loss of the Caldor also points out the importance of finding a developer for the nearby Loew's Kings movie palace, which was once the economic driving force of the avenue but defaulted on taxes and was taken over by the city in 1978 and closed.
Steven R. Schubert, the executive director of the Flatbush Development Corporation, and some local merchants argued that Caldor struggled because it failed to tailor itself to the needs and tastes of the area's Caribbean immigrants.
The troubled nationwide department store chain, based in Norwalk, Conn., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September 1995 and is closing three other poorly performing stores, including one on Fordham Road in the Bronx. More than 300 employees at the Flatbush branch will lose their jobs.
The merchants and Mr. Schubert predicted that fitting several smaller stores or an upscale Caribbean restaurant into the Caldor site may be more successful.
"The closing appears like a setback on the surface, but we'd like to see it as an opportunity," Mr. Schubert said. "We'd like to see it combined with the Loew's Kings development."
Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner Companies, the developer of the site, said the store would be marketed to other large retailers. DAVID ROHDE

HEADLINE: COPING;
Public Schools? But of Course.

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
THERE is a public school in Brooklyn where first-graders enter a science classroom that resembles a rain forest, and there is a public school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan where fifth-graders isolate DNA. A third public school, supposedly the best in the city, is in East Harlem and most of its students are poor.
Are these schools "flowers growing out of the cracks in the pavement," as one administrator pessimistically suggested, or are they, as Clara Hemphill declares, proof of progress and signs of hope for the future of the city? 
 "People think that the rich go to good private schools and the poor go to bad public schools, and that's simply not true," said Ms. Hemphill, a 43-year-old former journalist with two children approaching school age. "The best public schools in the city are the best schools, period. The rewards of public education are not only social -- you learn to live with all kinds of people -- they are also academic. Better teachers, better programs, and you sit next to a kid who makes geography and history real."
This is not exactly conventional wisdom, so Ms. Hemphill is constructing her case neighborhood by neighborhood. Operating out of a tiny office at the century-old Public Education Association on West 32d Street, she is compiling a book of profiles of the 100 top public elementary schools (out of 676) in the city. It is part consumer guide, part urban plan. Without public schools, she maintains, the dream of a multi-ethnic democracy will live on only through jury duty and subway travel.
"I don't think kids should be guinea pigs for your political beliefs," she said, "but public schools are much better than most people imagine. There have been dramatic improvements in the past 10 years. Visionary educators such as Anthony Alvarado and Deborah Meier have created models.
"A generation of middle-class parents, many of them immigrants who aggressively shop for schools, have pushed for better programs, volunteered, raised funds.
"By the way, when it comes to special education, public schools are far and away the best. Corporations that want to create a work force and to make the city a more attractive place to do business have funded New Visions for Public Education and sometimes even adopted schools."
Ms. Hemphill's 20-year career included war reporting, which she wryly concedes may have been a preparation for her project. She sees New York on the brink of becoming a Third World city of isolated rich and desperate poor with public education as the only possibility for social harmony.
Her guidebook, to be published in the fall by SoHo Press, is aimed at middle-class and working-class parents, although the wealthy may find alternatives to what one private-school teacher has described as their tendency to "treat their kids like BMW's and park them in the best educational garages."
From a practical point of view, Ms. Hemphill points out, the $35,000 saved by not sending two children to an exclusive private school will pay for a lot of flute lessons. It will also relieve some parents of needing to earn about $60,000 pre-tax. Will that free Dad or Mom to spend more time with the kids and at school, assuming they want to?
Volunteerism at public schools helps bring down the adult-to-child ratios, but Ms. Hemphill says it is only a stopgap; government money is crucial. One reason poor schools can do so well, she says, is Federal aid.
Ms. Hemphill has returned from her treks through the city with some certainties: A good principal is the key to a good school. There is no Right Way; there are good schools where students wear uniforms and good schools where they sit on rugs. Good schools will adapt to ethnic or economic changes in a neighborhood.
She also discovered that whites underestimate the size and energy of the black middle class, whose values are shared by many conservative whites. Many parents educated in parochial schools are sending their children to public schools. Typical, she said, is a mother in Bay Ridge thrilled that her son's world view was enlarged by the classmate who fasts for Ramadan.
Ms. Hemphill's definition of a good school is complex, statistical, physical and emotional, but here are some quick eyeball checks. Are all the desks in neat rows? Are there only textbooks, no real books? Do all the bulletin boards look the same? Three yesses mean the children are probably being pelted by info-bits, rather than encouraged to think, which is a goal of a good school.
She hopes her guide will be an inspiration for more people to take charge of their neighborhood schools. In a time of centralization, budget cuts and lack of public support, that is critical. Her basic message is this: There is a good public school near you, and if there isn't, you can build one. (They will come.)

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
For a Passionate Few, Nothing's as Good as Gold

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
THE Dow may be flirting with 7,000, but don't expect all investors to be impressed. Some of them are much more enchanted by that traditional bedrock of investments: gold. And not just gold stocks or shares in gold mutual funds, but the real, solid, heavy, yellow stuff.
Take Robert F. Hague, 71, a retired investment banker who lives in Upper Montclair, N.J. He keeps 90 percent of his portfolio in gold -- bullion, coins, mutual funds and individual equities. He started buying gold 30 years ago, and his reason for doing so -- fiscal conservatism -- is a common one among gold bugs. 
 "I've felt for many, many years that we're going to have to use gold to straighten out our financial system," Mr. Hague said. "The reason the economy and the market look so good is because of excessive credit and debt. It's all false appearances. I think there will come a time when gold is recognized as the ultimate money."
Others apparently agree. While recent gold sales are dwarfed by, say, the 26.2 million ounces of net purchases in the inflationary days of 1974, buying has been on a modest rise. The 2.2 million ounces in net sales last year, for instance, were up from 1.5 million in 1995, according to CPM Group, a New York commodities consultancy.
Fears of an overvalued stock market and the large Federal debt are two reasons for the recent buying, said Richard Scott-Ram, an economist at the World Gold Council, the industry's trade association. Another may be low prices. Gold has been relatively cheap in recent years, and on Feb. 11 an ounce sold for $341.90, its lowest price since the first quarter of 1993.
But whatever the immediate conditions, investors have been drawn to gold for centuries, and their goal has always been safety: diversifying their portfolios, securing a haven for tough times and gaining a hedge against inflation.
Gold loyalists say the precious metal does these jobs superbly. "Gold is the only investment that holds its own," said Pat Gorman, a gold bug and the host of a radio show about the metal in Tucson, Ariz. "In the 1930's, you could have taken a $20 gold piece or a one-ounce gold coin and bought a fine men's suit. Today you can take that same coin and purchase that same suit of clothes."
Most investment experts are as skeptical of gold as the bugs are enthusiastic. The experts acknowledge that gold has sometimes served its historical purposes, but they generally warn investors to put only a small portion of their assets in it. Rather than enhancing safety, they say, too much gold can increase risk.
"Having a hefty portion of gold stocks would basically mean you have a concentrated sector play," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago.
Others question gold's traditional strength as a haven during crisis or times of high inflation. While gold often zoomed in value during war, for instance, it did not do so during the Persian Gulf war. And while inflation has been low recently, "gold prices haven't even kept up with it," said John Davis, a financial planner in Elmhurst, Ill.
Experts raise other warnings about gold, -- like average annual returns of just 46-hundredths of 1 percent from 1991 to 1996.
In turn, the gold industry and others offer counterarguments. While gold may not excel when inflation is modest, its inflation-fighting powers come to the fore when price increases step up, said Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group. "When inflation is over 7 percent in the U.S., gold does well," he said.
For many gold bugs, though, the debate is beside the point. Big fans of gold say that when the clouds gather -- as they believe they ultimately will -- those who hold gold will be glad.
Consider Raymond A. Igou Jr., 63, an orthopedic surgeon who has a practice in Stoneham, Mass. "Everyone is sitting around watching the stock market go crazy," he said. "Inflation is down, and we haven't had an oil crunch lately. But when everyone else thinks it's a bull, I call it a bear." As a result, Dr. Igou keeps 25 percent of his portfolio in gold coins, with the remainder in stocks, bonds and some partnerships.
The doctor chooses to hold gold in coins because "you get a double whammy: the rarity plus the gold," he said.
"Also, when the price of gold moves," he said, "collectible coins move faster and farther."
In this regard, Dr. Igou is typical. Eighty percent of individual investors who physically own gold -- as opposed to gold futures contracts or stocks and mutual funds that invest in mining companies -- hold only coins, according to the World Gold Council. (The most popular coins are South African Krugerrands and American Eagles.) Eighteen percent of these investors own coins and bars, while 2 percent own only bars.
Dr. Igou is typical in another way: behind his gold gathering looms a keen fear of disaster, and not just of a drop in the market. In a practice that some investors may find hard to fathom, he keeps some gold in a hiding place nearby. "I live on the ocean, so I made a list of all the things I would need in case of a big flood that washes away everything," he said. "One of them is gold, so I keep $40,000 or $50,000 worth."
SOME gold bugs are prompted by visions of mayhem on a huge scale. An economic bust is the worry of one 44-year-old manufacturer's representative in Northern Arizona, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Fearing a run on banks and great difficulty in finding and paying for food and other necessities, he keeps 50 percent of his $250,000 portfolio in gold bars, some hidden close to his home.
"In an economic dislocation," he said, "at least gold will give me a fighting chance."
For some people, gold is not just a shield from calamity. It verges on a life style.
Consider Rose Morgan, 49, a former commodities trader who lives in Vancouver, Wash. True, she is a mainstream gold bug in many ways. About 40 percent of her portfolio is in gold, both physical gold and gold stocks. She frets about inflation and, like Mr. Hague, she is a staunch fiscal conservative.
But Ms. Morgan is also a prospector. Three months out of the year, she searches for the metal high in the Sierra Nevada in California. She estimates that prospecting has earned her $100,000 the last six years.
She is also a self-described gold recycler, combing auctions and flea markets for bottles, china -- anything with gold plating. "It all started with a cologne bottle that I saw at a gold exhibit," she said. "I wondered, what's that bottle of cologne doing on display? Turns out it had 24-karat gold on the lid and bottle. And I had been throwing my husband's cologne out the window!" (She shares secrets of foraging for this ancient metal on a very modern tool, the Internet, at http://www.worldaccess.com/goldbug/.)
Ms. Morgan even tries to use gold as money. "My car repairman takes gold instead of a check, and so does my dentist," she said. "I always offer to pay in gold."
Indeed, with her all-encompassing approach, Ms. Morgan symbolizes a pattern among gold bugs: the belief that gold is much more than an investment. For them, it is variously a political statement, a source of wisdom and even a tenet of faith.
"There's something incredible about being the first or second person ever to have held a gold nugget in your hand," said Ms. Morgan, speaking about placer gold, which is gold in its original state. "You get a tingle."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Watching for Banks in the Parade of Financial Mergers

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
AFTER Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, Discover announced a $10.2 billion merger earlier this month, the new game on Wall Street became "Who's next?" Is Chase Manhattan about to buy Paine Webber, or will it snap up Prudential Securities?
As a result, the stock prices of many Wall Street firms that look like takeover candidates have been bid up sharply. Charles Schwab's stock price had risen by Friday to $37.375, from less than half that last summer, for example. And shares of Alex. Brown rose to $61.50 by Friday from less than $50 a few weeks ago, on rumors of a possible takeover by Nationsbank or another ambitious company. 
 Given such price jumps, investors may want to broaden their search for merger targets to a part of the financial industry that is out of this spotlight. A promising area, one that is much bigger than the securities business, is commercial banking.
While the names of Chase Manhattan, Nationsbank and other commercial banks have been uttered in Wall Street's new guessing game, the fact is that mergers within the banking industry itself are very common. There are now about 9,500 banks in the United States, down from 14,000 in 1985, and industry analysts say that the trend will continue until there are fewer than 2,000. Banking and finance accounted for $75 billion of takeovers in 1995, more than any other industry, according to Houlihan Lokey, a Los Angeles investment banking firm. Last year the industry ranked third, after communications and utilities.
Coming months may bring more of the same. "We think 1997 is shaping up to be a spectacular year for bank merger and acquisition activity," said Thomas H. Hanley, managing director and senior bank analyst at UBS Securities in New York. Mr. Hanley said recently that he expected his basket of bank acquisition candidates "to deliver at least a 20 percent to 25 percent return over the next 12 months."
He is currently recommending First Commerce of New Orleans, Summit, Hibernia, Union Planters, RCSB Financial and First American as regional banks that are likely to attract merger partners.
The truth, however, is that it is well-nigh impossible for an investor to predict mergers. "It is extremely difficult to pick acquisition candidates," said Rick Escherich, a managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department of J. P. Morgan. "The probabilities are so low for the investor."
"That's an old game," said Eric A. Longmire, director of research at Wyser-Pratte & Company, a New York money management and investment concern. "It's called 'rumitrage.' "
James K. Schmidt, who manages the John Hancock Regional Bank fund, which has $4 billion in assets, sees takeovers as just the icing on the cake.
"I very rarely buy a stock because I think it's a takeover candidate," said Mr. Schmidt, an executive vice president of the Hancock company. "I'd rather buy stocks like Union Planters of Tennessee. It's good value and if it gets taken over it's an extra."
Union Planters "is still at a discount to its peers in Tennessee," he said. One reason is that the bank missed analysts' earnings estimates for the last quarter of 1996, but that was largely because of a number of acquisitions the bank has made. Moreover, he said, "Tennessee is a real interesting state that is doing well economically."
The bank's lackluster recent results make it a more likely takeover candidate, some analysts add. The poor numbers, they reason, could put more pressure on management to increase shareholder value by selling the company.
Another solid bank and possible takeover target is First Commerce, according to Mr. Hanley and other analysts. It dominates the New Orleans market, and ranks second in market share in Louisiana. The company also has a high degree of insider ownership, which suggests a well-motivated management team.
First Commerce's fee income, which includes revenue from consulting and money management, has risen steadily, climbing 18 percent in the fourth quarter from the comparable period a year earlier. Its credit quality has stayed constant, and the bank's capital remains robust compared with many of its local rivals.
Another good regional bank, and a favored acquisition candidate for Mr. Hanley, is First American. With $10.4 billion in assets, First American ranks second in the growing Tennessee deposit market. It is well positioned, UBS says, in consumer and small-business loans, and has recovered well from its real estate losses of a few years ago.
What about investors who still think that guessing takeover targets will alone make them rich? Mr. Hanley cautioned that they needed to be closely in touch with firms that research the field thoroughly. Also, "You need tremendous patience and conviction in your own view," he said. "You can either get hurt, or you can make a fortune."
But in the end, he said, "There's no substitute for buying good companies."

HEADLINE: Patching the Cracks in the Rock

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
ADA AND BILL WELLS had been loyal customers of the Prudential Insurance Company of America for most of their lives. But at a time when they were settling into retirement and thinking of cutting back on their life insurance, a Prudential agent saddled them with a new policy that he promised would virtually pay for itself.
After a few years, they said, they discovered that they had been deceived by the agent, who had arranged a loan to pay for the new policy. Facing rising debt on the loan and annual premiums of $1,800 -- several times what they had been paying -- the Wellses, of New York City, joined legions of aggrieved Prudential customers taking legal action against the insurer that once possessed one of the most trusted names in corporate America. 
 This costly dispute, involving nearly 11 million policies, is merely the latest woe for a company that has been bombarded by calamities in recent years and was finally forced to put an outsider in charge for the first time since it was founded more than 120 years ago.
For two years, Arthur F. Ryan, an outsider recruited from Chase Manhattan Bank, has been struggling to turn the Newark-based company around after a loss in 1994 of more than $900 million. Not only is he trying to restore Prudential's reputation, but he faces an even greater challenge in bringing cohesion to a jumbled empire that once seemed to resemble nothing so much as the warring fiefs of medieval Europe.
Though revenues have been flat for two years at about $30 billion, Mr. Ryan has put Prudential back in the black through cost-cutting and profitable sales of securities and other assets. Earnings for 1996 are estimated at roughly $1 billion, up from $478 million in 1995.
But whether Mr. Ryan, 54, can improve operating performance and restore prosperity to the nation's largest insurer, with almost 50 million customers and nearly $180 billion in assets, remains in doubt.
More than half of Prudential's businesses -- from life insurance to corporate health care, from homeowners' insurance to guaranteed investment contracts, a field that Prudential thoroughly dominated only a few years ago -- are still losing ground to competitors. Last fall, for example, the health care unit failed to win renewal of a nearly $4 billion contract with the American Association of Retired Persons.
Prudential's standing with the insurance rating agencies has been slipping, too. Only last week, Moody's Investors Service dropped the company another notch and other agencies are contemplating additional downgrades.
While Prudential's ratings are still at the high end of the scale, they provide an unflattering comparison with competitors like John Hancock, Northwestern Mutual and New York Life, which remain at the absolute top, and sales of insurance and pension plans have suffered. Moreover, each tick downward has meant a tick upward in the cost of borrowing.
But Mr. Ryan knew what he was in for at Prudential, and he is pressing ahead. To begin with, he has set up a new way of selling life insurance, largely to guard against the abusive sales tactics that have landed the company in so much trouble. Now, once an agent has talked a customer into a policy, an administrative worker from headquarters must review the policy directly with the client, making sure that he or she understands precisely what is being bought.
Just as important, the life insurance business, upon which Prudential's image as the Rock of Gibraltar was built, is finally being streamlined. The five regional headquarters that were once proud outposts for the company's centurions have been shut down. Two of those offices are being converted into service centers to handle administrative tasks once done in local offices.
Prudential's central problem stems from the fact that life insurance -- while still the largest single part of the company's business -- has been steadily losing appeal to Americans far more interested in investing in the booming stock market for a more comfortable retirement than in planning for death.
But that's not all. Its homeowners' division had concentrated too heavily in hurricane zones and was staggered by enormous claims. Its big corporate health care business was being outmaneuvered by more nimble competitors in important markets across the country. And shortly before the insurance complaints began coming to the surface like long-buried land mines, Prudential's securities subsidiary paid $1.5 billion in fines, compensation and legal costs for misleading clients -- many of them elderly, with modest nest eggs -- who lost money on high-risk limited partnerships that they could ill afford.
That is why, at the end of 1994, Prudential's board turned to Mr. Ryan almost in desperation. Tall and slightly stooped, with an easy smile and a warm handshake, Mr. Ryan had cut fat and introduced new technology at Chase, where he rose to the No. 2 job. He was renowned for rolling up his sleeves at his own computer. He liked working one-on-one, but was perfectly at ease at center stage in the company auditorium. And he had never had anything to do with insurance. As Prudential's board saw it, he was exactly what the company needed.
"Here was someone with a new approach who could make the reforms," said William H. Gray 3d, the former Representative from Pennsylvania who is a Prudential board member in addition to heading the United Negro College Fund.
Burton Malkiel, a professor at Princeton University and former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, was on the board's search committee. He found Mr. Ryan to be "extremely bright, extremely decisive."
So Mr. Ryan set to work. No longer, he decreed, was Prudential to be first and foremost a life insurance company, with anything else regarded as a distant afterthought. He had been watching the revolution that had catapulted the Fidelity mutual funds to the top of the heap of the country's money managers and had transformed banks into financial powerhouses again, while seemingly leaving life insurance as something your father recalled with nostalgia.
"I don't want to communicate that insurance is less important," Mr. Ryan said in a conversation the other day at Prudential's white marble headquarters here, "but that money management is equally important."
One of his first big changes was to consolidate a handful of sometimes competing investment units under a single umbrella with more than $193 billion under management. Money management for individuals and institutions -- in contrast to investing premiums, as insurance companies have always done -- was a crucial part of his vision, and he told his executives to start coming up with new mutual funds and other investment vehicles that would compete with industry leaders.
AT a gray marble work table in his 24th-floor office, an elegantly simple Japanese screen stretching behind him, Mr. Ryan strikes a measured tone, neither glowing nor gloomy. The company is "going through a tough period," he acknowledged. But he figures he's gaining on the demons. "We're well on our way," he said.
The company that Mr. Ryan inherited was encrusted in gentlemanly tradition. It was a place where managers received their bonuses whether or not they made their annual goals, and where regular hours and uninterrupted weekends were regarded as an entitlement. "It was a very comfortable place," one longtime Prudential executive said. It was also a formal, somewhat stuffy place where the chain of command was rigidly observed and where a saccharine form of corporate circumlocution known as "Pru polite" often left managers wondering what top executives were trying to say.
Mr. Ryan, of course, wasn't the first at Prudential to identify life insurance as a waning business. The company had already expanded beyond it into about a dozen separate businesses. But instead of operating under a comprehensive strategy, those businesses, as well as the five regional headquarters of the life insurance division, addressed the world on their own terms. It was not only a matter of little central control. Each of the units had its own computer system, its own purchasing system and its own advertising program. They did not share information about their customers, so the company could make the most of each relationship, and all too often one Prudential unit would be elbowing another for the same piece of business.
To Mr. Ryan, the organization looked like "a series of independent silos," free-wheeling subsidiaries working at cross purposes with fragmented game plans.
To bring about change, he figured, a lot of the old guard had to go. Twelve of the 14 executives who report directly to him are new to their jobs. Of the top 150 executives, two-thirds are new. About half were recruited from the outside. The others were longtime Prudential employees who passed the test of the new mission.
In two years, Mr. Ryan has shrunk the work force to 83,000, from about 100,000. In doing so, he has cut deeply into the ranks of the company's notoriously unproductive insurance agents. But with the sales force now at about 12,000, down from roughly 16,000, "the company has also lost some agents it didn't want to lose," said Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president and analyst at the A. M. Best Company, a rating agency. And with regulators still breathing down its neck, Prudential is not a particularly attractive place for newcomers, either.
Not everyone at Prudential is thrilled with the Ryan way of doing things. But one of the hundreds of specialists working under contract to help transform Prudential said that some of the initial resistance seemed to be fading.
"People are saying," he explained, " 'We've had some bad press on the life insurance side. Some of our other units are bleeding. Things are getting tougher out there. Maybe we do need some realignment.' At least on the conceptual level, people are becoming receptive to the idea."
Bob Koehler, a former vice president and head of the company's retiree association, still keeps in touch with colleagues. "A lot of people say Art Ryan is like a breath of fresh air," Mr. Koehler said, "and they're glad to see him in there."
Many people who had been trained by Mr. Koehler moved into more prominent positions under Mr. Ryan. "These people were not in senior management, but close to it," Mr. Koehler said. "They give him the continuity of the old Prudential without being committed to the old ways."
Still, one recurring conflict, the independent specialist said, is between short- and long-term goals. "They want to get things done quickly to stop the bleeding," he said. "But sometimes that delays fundamental change that, by its nature, takes longer."
As an example, he said, the plan for new regional service centers calls for them to be staffed with teams of employees trained to handle several kinds of work. But to get the centers up and running, he said, the company is assigning employees to their old, single-mission roles while planning only later to retrain them to fit the team concept.
Mr. Ryan has not been reluctant to prune dead wood. He sold off several of the company's businesses: its reinsurance unit, whose earnings had fluctuated widely; its mortgage division, which had been suffering through a downturn in housing sales, and its weak Canadian life insurance branch.
PERHAPS the most troubled of Prudential's businesses these days is its corporate health care unit, a behemoth with a network of 90,000 physicians, 1,000 hospitals and 4.5 million clients, which accounts for about 30 percent of the company's revenues but has been unable to make a profit for two years. In September, shortly after its two senior executives had been pushed into retirement, the unit lost its bid to renew the contract with the A.A.R.P. While searching for a new head of the unit, Mr. Ryan has put himself and a group of four executives in charge.
Mr. Ryan's solution for most of what ails the health care unit is consolidation. Here was an operation, Mr. Ryan said, with way too many silos. "We had 40 markets in which we operated," he said, "and all acted relatively independently."
While imposing uniform operations, Mr. Ryan recognizes that health care is an essentially local business and that to succeed companies need to dominate or at least play leading roles in each market. In markets that Prudential does not have a prayer of dominating, units are being sold, as happened in Boston in mid-January. In others, where the fundamentals look good, Mr. Ryan is shopping for acquisitions. Throughout, Prudential has been shifting from traditional health insurance to managed care and is trying to expand its dental and disability insurance programs.
Because of a heavy concentration of homeowner policies in South Florida, Prudential's property and casualty company was nearly wiped out by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Claims rose to $1.3 billion and the operation had to borrow from sister units. Prudential wanted to simply stop selling homeowner insurance in South Florida. But regulators ruled that if the company wanted out of that business it would have to get out of Florida entirely, abandoning its lucrative life insurance business there as well. So to reduce its risk, Prudential began paying a full year of premiums for homeowners willing to sign with another company. These days, Prudential estimates, a hurricane disaster in Florida would cost the company, at most, $440 million.
The next milestone in the company's saga of scandal comes tomorrow in Federal District Court in Newark, where teams of lawyers will debate whether a proposed class-action settlement fairly compensates up to 10.7 million policyholders who regulators across the country say may have been misled. Last summer, Prudential paid a fine of $35 million, imposed by the regulators, and acknowledged that for more than a decade, until 1995, some of its agents had improperly persuaded customers to cash in or borrow against existing policies to buy new, often more expensive ones in a practice often referred to as "churning." The main beneficiaries were not the customers but the agents, who received additional commissions, and the company, which gained market share and made more money.
WHATEVER the outcome at the hearing in Newark, the company's worries are far from over. Nearly 20,000 policyholders have refused to go along with the class action and hundreds of individual suits -- including one by the Wellses -- are being prepared by lawyers or are working their way through the courts. Other suits have been filed by agents who say they were dismissed because they tried to blow the whistle on dishonest insurance sales.
Officials in five states had been campaigning against the class-action settlement. But over the last two weeks, with the payment of $35.2 million, hours of personal negotiations by Mr. Ryan and an improvement in the provisions for compensation of policyholders, the officials in California, Florida, Massachussetts, Texas and Virginia dropped their objections.
No one knows how long it will take to restore Prudential's reputation. For many people like the Wellses, redemption may never come. "I believed in them," said Mrs. Wells, who taught elementary school in College Point, Queens, for nearly 20 years. "I had confidence in the company. I thought they were honest. Now I don't. We were misled all the way."
While former agents contend that they were trained by Prudential in the kind of tactics that were used in the Wells case, Robert DeFillippo, a corporate spokesman, said that such practices were "unacceptable and against company policy."
"What's painful about this story is that the woman has lost faith in the company," Mr. DeFillippo said. "The company knows there are a lot of people like that. And we know we have one last chance to provide remedies and to demonstrate that we will keep our promises."
For some insurance experts watching Prudential, the situation seems grave. "The problems at Prudential are very deep," said Kevin Ceurvorst, a group vice president and senior analyst for the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company in Chicago. "They've made some progress, but while they've been dealing with their problems, their competitors have been moving ahead. It's hard to say whether Prudential can overcome its deterioration."
In lowering Prudential's ratings last Wednesday, Moody's said that besides the burden of overcoming the insurance scandal, the company faced "significant operating and competitive challenges that will likely continue to hurt its financial performance over the near term."
Still, not all the outsiders tracking Prudential have turned sour. Mark Puccia, the senior insurance analyst for Standard & Poor's, another major rating agency, sees Prudential as continuing to regain its health, mainly on the strength of Mr. Ryan's leadership. It is its confidence in Mr. Ryan, Mr. Puccia said, that has kept Standard & Poor's from further lowering Prudential's ratings.
Mr. Mayewski of A. M. Best is also betting that Mr. Ryan will make it. "He's putting the fundamentals and the discipline in place that are required for success," Mr. Mayewski said.
In the coming year, Mr. Ryan is aiming for another substantial increase in earnings, to about $1.5 billion, as he continues a three-year plan to chop expenses by $800 million. But for future growth, Mr. Ryan says, Prudential will eventually need to go on the acquisition trail, particularly in the money management field.
"Right now, we see lots of opportunity to grow by investing internally," he said. "And very frankly, in terms of acquiring other companies, prices are too high. But I'm sure that at some point that will be part of our game plan."
One possible advantage for Mr. Ryan is that as the chief of a mutual company, he has no shareholders nudging him to get the company's earnings hopping. As a mutual company, Prudential functions somewhat like a cooperative. Ownership is formally in the hands of policyholders whose main interest is in their own insurance rather than in how the company is being run. When it comes time to pick board members, few policy owners exercise their right to vote.
The original idea of mutual companies was that they would not try to make a profit, but would return dividends to policyholders on any earnings above operating expenses. But without a profit motive, many mutual companies, including Prudential, became more comfortable than competitive.
Mr. Ryan argues that the formal structure of a company is not a principal influence on a company's performance. "It's the management first and the management second," he said, followed at some distance by "the oversight of the board."
One big drawback of a mutual company is that because it has no shares to sell, it cannot easily raise money for expansion. Mr. Ryan may well want to convert Prudential into a stock company for precisely that reason. That is not out of the question, he says. But it is not on his agenda for this year. He has also been watching the development of a hybrid corporate form in which the mutual company takes on the designation of a holding company and is permitted to create a publicly owned subsidiary through which investment money can be raised. The legislatures of five states have approved that form, but not the one in New Jersey, Prudential's home state.
A priority for Mr. Ryan has been trying to fix the company's image. But just last month a Federal judge fined Prudential $1 million for "gross negligence" after discovering that executives in several field offices had destroyed stacks of documents related to the life insurance case. And, in another indication that all is not yet right with Prudential's dealings with its customers, ABC's "Prime Time Live" broadcast footage in December from a hidden camera showing an agent assuring a customer in Syracuse that she would receive higher interest on a life insurance policy than could actually be delivered. Prudential responded by dismissing the agent.
"Prudential has got to put this issue behind them," said Mr. Puccia of Standard & Poor's. "And in order to become a vibrant, ongoing enterprise, they've got to start growing their book of business and improving profits. Up to now, they've been in a divestiture mode. They've got to turn the wheel 180 degrees now and start aggressively increasing revenues."

Chart: "What's Happening in Prudential's Main Business"
 
LIFE INSURANCE
 
PROBLEM: Interest in traditional life insurance has waned. And Prudential has a more fundamental difficulty; As many as 10.7 million policies sold from 1982 to 1995 are affected by accusations that agents "churned" customers, essentially talking them into using cash values in old policies to buy new ones just to create commissions.
 
ACCOMPLISHMENT: Moving toward settlement of class-action suit at an estimated cost of up to $2 billion. Centralized control by closing five regional headquarters, and underwriters from headquarters now review all new policies to make sure customers understand exactly what they are buying.
 
GOAL: To complete all litigation, restore reputation and recover position as industry sales leader.
 
HEALTH CARE
 
Problem: Organization is fragmented and is being out-maneuvered by more nimble companies.
 
Accomplishments: Starting to sell-off units in markets where results have been poor and looking for acquisitions in markets where attaining leading roles seems possible. Improved customer service and efficiency by consolidating more than 40 centers at four locations that will operate round the clock, seven days a week.
 
Goal: To become a leader in many of the company's 40 market areas and to get out of those areas where the chance of success seems remote. New head of unit expected to be named soon.
 
INVESTMENTS
 
Problem: Operations lacked focus as Prudential concentrated on life insurance. Several units offering competiting services. One subsidiary, Prudential Securities, paid $1.5 billion in fines, compensation and legal fees for misleading clients, many of them elderly, who lost money on risky limited partnerships.
 
Accomplishments: Investments given equal priority with life insurance. Several previously independent units combined under the umbrella of Prudential Investments. Developed several new mutual funds and annunities. Sale of limited partnerships ended.
 
Goals: Continue to develop new investments products and to emphasize retirement services, variable annunities, mutual funds and institutional asset management.
 
PROPERTY and CASUALTY
 
Problem: Company suffered heavy losses in Florida and other hurricane zones. Policies were often sold as inducements to securing or keeping life insurance clients, with an inclination to bend underwriting rules and not focus on the bottom line.
 
Accomplishments: Replaced head of unit with outsider in January, 1996. Reduced number of policy holiders in high risk areas to reduce overall risk. Began tightening underwriting guidelines in an attempt to more closely correlate premiums with risk and dememphasizing linkage with life insurance.
 
Goal: Profitability by 1998. (pg. 12)

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Not long ago, in a widely read introductory work on economics, I came upon an extended discussion of why popcorn is expensive at the movies. It turns out that economists have been debating this subject in scholarly journals for more than a quarter century.
Many of them have concluded that the common-sense explanation of the problem is wrong. Movie popcorn doesn't cost $3 a box because the theater owner has a monopoly. It costs that much because people go to the movies in groups, and if a theater started offering cheap popcorn as a come-on, popcorn lovers would try to pull the whole group to that theater, causing dissension. Expensive popcorn is the price of leisure-time social harmony. 
 It's an ingenious theory, but it ignores some common-sense truths. The cost of popcorn is utterly irrelevant to anyone's decision about where to go to the movies. All that really matters is the movie being shown and the location of the theater. To factor in concession prices is to assume an all-purpose calculating mind that moviegoers simply don't possess.
What is it about economists, anyway? For the past generation or more, most of us have suspected they are a little eccentric, and much of the time they seem to agree. They have always liked to make jokes about themselves: "Your idea may be fine in practice," the senior professor sneers at his junior colleague. "But it will never work in theory." Economist jokes revolve around a couple of defining characteristics: their love of theoretical assumption and their haughty rejection of common sense.
There is nothing economists enjoy more, they will readily admit, than telling the uninitiated that the plain evidence of the senses is wrong. These days they are doing it with a particular vengeance. Ordinary Americans look at their country and note the disappearance of 40 million jobs in the past two decades and conclude that something terribly disruptive has been going on. They see that many of the nation's biggest corporations now do most of their manufacturing in third world countries, and infer that precious livelihoods are fleeing to Thailand and Sri Lanka.
The response of many economists is to insist that no such thing is happening, that for every job lost a new one is born and thus the country does not suffer materially in the transition. (The individuals who are affected materially by this transition are rarely considered relevant.) In the past couple of months, the economic professoriate has been a familiar presence on the country's most influential Op-Ed pages, smacking down the journalists and occasional renegade economists who insist that the evidence of the senses holds some truth.
It is not my purpose to intrude on the arcana of the foreign trade debate. What interests me is the argument that the professoriate ultimately seizes upon in its effort to discredit the heretics: They aren't "real" economists. They lack credentials. Worst of all, they don't know the math.
"There are . . . important ideas that are crystal clear if you can stand algebra," a distinguished economist wrote in a typical diatribe a few weeks ago, "and very difficult to grasp if you don't."
Of all the ammunition an economist can throw at you in an argument, the math insult is perhaps the most dispiriting. It is essentially a charge of illiteracy. And anybody who has not mastered the algebra of trade theory by middle age is probably never going to pick it up.
But even people who know very little math know something about math: It is a reasoning process based on a set of postulates, a set of assumptions. It is only as good as the assumptions it starts with. Medieval astronomers developed highly sophisticated mathematical models for tracking the path of the planets, and they got their numbers to work. The only problem was that they thought the sun revolved around the earth.
Present-day economists may know more than medieval astronomers, but they too are captives of a single overarching idea: that most people in everyday life are rational calculators of their own self-interest -- that they are, in economic jargon, maximizers of utility. Given a sufficient amount of information, they will come to the logically correct decision every time.
Modern conventional economics is not just a series of calculations about trade or jobs or money. It is a theory about human behavior. And it is a theory that, to say the least, deserves more scrutiny than it normally gets.
The sociologist Alan Wolfe gave it that scrutiny in his ground-breaking book, "Whose Keeper?" Treating human beings as pure calculators of self-interest, Mr. Wolfe pointed out, ignores virtually all differences across time, space, temperament and culture. Such an approach assumes that given the right amount of information, we would make the same "rational" decision whether we were young or old, sick or well, outgoing or reclusive, alone or in a group. Most mainstream economists would shrink from defending this idea in its bluntest formulation. And yet it is the fragile assumption upon which an entire edifice of formulas, calculations and predictions is ultimately based.
What attracts economists to questionable ideas and makes them so belligerent? The best way to answer that question is to think of economics more as a faith than as a science.
If you look at some of the personal recollections of the current cohort of free-market economists, you usually find a common thread. At some point in their early lives, beset by the usual self-doubts of youth, they discovered the market and fell in love. Some of them actually use those words. The market offered them a certainty that no other available creed could provide. It gave them a cascade of answers. In fact, given the initial assumptions of individual rationality, the market can answer all questions -- not just questions about trade or jobs or inflation but all the important questions of life. Even questions about the price of popcorn at the movies.
In that respect, free-market economics resembles such earlier claimants to truth as Marxism and psychoanalysis -- sweeping theoretical systems that provide their acolytes a reassuring certainty in exchange for a few gigantic assumptions as starting points. Like Marxists and Freudians, free-market economists take refuge from their critics by retreating under the cloak of unimpeachable science.
Market economics is not only a faith; it is an entirely appropriate faith for the generation of thinkers who were born shortly after World War II, went to college in the 1960's and now dominate the public policy discussion in academia and much of government. Market economics enshrines choice and lionizes the individual. Carried to its furthest extreme, it all but suggests that anything the individual really feels like doing can't be wrong. It is a branch of 1960's ideology in formal dress.
As the mantra for millions of Americans, perhaps most of a generation, this set of ideas is entitled to some respect. But it need not be taken at face value, and mastery of algebra should not be a prerequisite for discussing it.

 BODY:

CAMPAIGN FINANCE
Did Someone Say Reform?
Campaign finance reform? I'm absolutely, 100 percent for it, politicians always say -- how about tomorrow? Next week at the latest. First, though, I've got to get a few million in my pocket so I'll be around next week. And, oh yes, start with that other party -- it's the real culprit. Last week, alas, it was hard to sense any bracing breeze of reform on either side of the aisle. First it turned out that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato had taken money clearly intended for Republican Senate campaigns and shifted it to New York races -- all legal, he said, but an army of eyebrows shot up. And President Clinton didn't exactly stand out as a warrior for frugal politics, traveling to New York to grab a quick million for his party's Senate candidates. Senator Trent Lott's take on unlimited donations: It's "the American way."
 
CLASS ACTION
Heads, You Lose; Tails, the Lawyer Wins
The class-action suit certainly sounds like a wonderful invention. Thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of powerless civilians employ a single team of lawyers. Each person pays a tiny legal fee and thus, naturally, gets a decent chunk of any damages awarded. What efficiency! But this naive notion, alas, ignores the astounding ability of lawyers to run through cash -- a phenomenon documented with jaw-dropping vividness in the best seller "A Civil Action." A case in point: One Dexter J. Kamilewicz, of Yarmouth, Me., was a class-action "winner" recently in a suit involving mortgage escrow accounts. His winnings: $2.19; his legal bill: $91.33. No, that's not a joke. Mr. Kamilewicz didn't think so either, and, yes, he is now suing the lawyers. Can he afford to win this one, too?
 
TRANSPORTATION
The Grail of Airline Safety
Nothing is totally safe. Stay inside? The house could burn. Go outside? Lightning could strike. Go for a drive? That's one of the riskiest things you could do. How about flying? It's remarkably safe, but the slight margin of risk is a matter of endless scrutiny. Take last week's semantic skirmish: The National Transportation Safety Board said the Boeing 737 fell short on safety because a small rudder failure could cause a crash, but both Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration disagreed, with Boeing calling the plane "absolutely safe" and the agency citing a "very good" safety record. The debate revolved around whether the risk of a crash fell into the highly nontechnical category "extremely improbable." And as Vice President Al Gore announced recently, new rudder valves should be on the way soon.
 
DOOMSDAY DREAMING
Fixing Social Security, Again
Clearly, the parlor game of the moment is fixing Social Security. Hardly a week goes by without some new formula, some new twist, some new set of projections incomprehensible to the laity. Last week's entry: "Fixing Social Security," a report by a business group called the Committee for Economic Development. The plan? Radical it's not -- it tinkers here, fine-tunes there, leaving the structure of the thing pretty much intact as it rumbles into the 21st century. Some highlights: After the first $425 in monthly wages, new retirees will gradually get back a lower percentage in their retirement checks. The retirement age will move toward 70, not 67. And you'll need to work 40 years, not 35, for full benefits. But here's the political bone tossed to the elderly: current benefits would be untouched.
 
TALENT SEARCH
Older Siblings? Of Course
Job applicants, take note. Education, job history and such trivial matters still count for something, but today's hot resume item is the old family snapshot. Are you the oldest, the youngest or in the middle? Surprisingly, this suddenly carries weight with employers, thanks to a recent book called "Born to Rebel," which argues that first-borns are authoritarian conformists, and that younger siblings are more adventurous types. Gerald Levin, the Time Warner chairman and the youngest of three, fits the theory, says the author, Frank Sulloway of M.I.T. Mr. Levin, he said, citing the purchase of Turner Broadcasting, has "a marked penchant for risk-taking." Can you dismiss this as oversimplified nonsense, as a theory too cute by half? Not easily: the book's in its fourth printing, Mr. Sulloway's panel at that snazzy World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was packed, and executive recruiters are perking up. Tomorrow's growth company: Rent-a-Big-Brother.
 
THE NEW LITTER
Pennies From Hell
In 1964, if memory serves, this mighty nation did just fine without a coin worth a fifth of a cent. Gum was purchased, change was made, commerce hummed merrily along. Yet that's what today's penny is worth -- a fifth of a 1964 cent. That year's penny bought what a nickel does today. Yet the penny survives, an indestructible relic gradually taking over every drawer and jar in the land. They sit on the floor unclaimed, and some customers won't even take them as change, a New York merchant said last week. "They don't want anything to do with it," he said. Round off to the nearest nickel? No, we are a precise breed, ruled by merciless computers. You can almost hear the alarms go off. Ban this copper-plated litter? Insult Lincoln's memory? Never. They'll just keep piling up, till they outnumber the cigarette butts in office-building doorways. They'll be put on barges and no one will take them.
 
 
GLOBAL TRADE
One Deng Legacy
A lot has been written about the legacy of Deng Xiaoping. But from a purely economic standpoint, here's a vivid snapshot of one revolutionary change that took place during his tenure.
 
THE MEDIA
$100,000? Oh, That
On Dec. 13, on "20/20," Barbara Walters interviewed Andrew Lloyd Webber -- then dutifully disclosed that ABC's owner, Disney, had invested in several Lloyd Webber musicals. She did not mention that she herself had invested $100,000 in the Broadway production of his "Sunset Boulevard." "She just didn't think of it," a spokeswoman for ABC News said last week. Whoops.
 
RADIOACTIVE WASTE
Both Deadly and 'Safe'?
Deadly radioactive waste started leaking from the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island at least three years ago, the Energy Department said last week. Various politicians assured nearby residents that their drinking water was safe. What a relief.
 
ADVERTISING (THE LACK THEREOF)
A Ford Gift: 'Schindler'
It's a fair guess that Henry Ford, who once wrote a tract called "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem," would have wanted nothing to do with "Schindler's List." His successors at Ford Motor, though, are not only sponsoring the film on NBC tonight but are doing it without commercial interruption -- a rare and wondrous event in the commercial-saturated world of network television. Is this a return to TV's "golden age," the time of single-sponsor shows like "Ford Theater" and "Ford Star Revue"? Or is it simply that a pitch for any product would seem jarringly tasteless in the midst of this shattering Holocaust movie?

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKLYN UP CLOSE -- 1996 REPORT;
The State of Brooklyn

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE

 BODY:
Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, delivered his annual State of the Borough speech Wednesday. While emphasizing the positive -- such as the strongest economic growth in downtown Brooklyn in 50 years -- Mr. Golden's review also noted several stalled initiatives and a handful of massive, unresolved projects that have the potential to significantly brighten or significantly mar the borough's future. 

WHAT WENT RIGHT
 
Renaissance Plaza -- After a 13-year effort, construction of Brooklyn's first major new hotel in 50 years began.
 
Atlantic Center -- The long-awaited retail center opened in downtown Brooklyn to massive crowds.
 
Atlantic Terminal -- After years of delay, the Transit Authority committed to a $140 million refurbishment of the terminal, which includes 10 subway lines and a terminus for the Long Island Rail Road.
 
WHAT WENT WRONG
 
Traffic -- A decade-old effort to reduce traffic congestion in downtown Brooklyn followed the same pattern: inaction.
 
Housing -- Completion of the new, 2,400-unit Gateway Estates project near Starrett City, the biggest housing initiative in the borough in 20 years, was delayed by technical issues. A proposed development on Bergen Street between Underhill and Vanderbilt Avenues remained frozen after years of court battles.
 
Education -- Long-running complaints by the Borough President about the School Construction Authority's failure to quickly build and repair schools and open itself up to more public scrutiny remain unresolved.
 
WHAT LIES AHEAD
 
Gowanus Reconstruction -- The state agreed to prepare an environmental-impact statement that will examine alternatives to rebuilding the dilapidated elevated expressway. But a proposal from residents that the roadway be replaced by a tunnel has a slim chance of succeeding.
 
Hub Port -- Mayor Giuliani backed a long-running proposal to build a freight tunnel under New York harbor that would make Sunset Park and Red Hook part of a deep-water "hub port" serving a new generation of ships and bring thousands of jobs to Brooklyn's long-stagnant waterfront. Where the $900 million in funding needed for a new tunnel will come from remains to be seen. DAVID ROHDE

HEADLINE: Second Thoughts About Being Better Off;
The Rehabilitation of Morning in America

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
NOTHING has so defined the American mood over the last 20 years as economic pessimism. From nearly every quarter came the message that prosperity was in decline and young people would have to adjust to a lower standard of living than their parents'. But now, all of a sudden, the last couple of decades don't look so bad. Recent economic history is being revised. And in the new version, Americans turn out to have been more prosperous than they realized. The children can relax.
The revisionists are multiplying. They appear in the Clinton Administration, in the pronouncements of Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's just-departed chief economist. They are evident in Congress, in the optimism of Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a liberal Democrat, and Connie Mack, a conservative Republican. They show up on Wall Street, in the bullishness of Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, and in corporate America, in the boosterism of Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. And they appear among academics who study and pronounce on the American condition. From all of them, the new message, though never uniform, is roughly this: 
 The world's juggernaut economy has turned out to be America's, not Japan's or Germany's. Those nations went down the wrong road, while Americans -- bemoaning their situation every step of the way -- nevertheless remade their corporations into streamlined global competitors. What's more, living standards, instead of stagnating or deteriorating, rose in ways that are only now being noted. And Americans developed technology with an inventiveness and flexibility not recognized before.
"We never realized how much we did in the 1980's to restructure American business and capitalize on new technology," said Mr. Rohatyn, who is managing partner at Lazard Freres & Company.
Like Mr. Rohatyn, the revisionists are mainly the well-off and successful. Their views, reflecting their own good fortune, flourish because the present looks good. The nation is six years into an economic expansion, unemployment is low and median family incomes have begun to rise, just as they did at this point in the 1980's expansion. But in the seventh year of that expansion, 1990, a recession came that soon made most Americans even more pessimistic. That could happen again, deflating the revisionists' line.
For now, there is no talk of the next recession, although one is inevitable. Certainly there is no such talk from the Democrats, who had played a big role in rekindling the pessimism of the early 1990's. After four years in the White House, they have a stake now in the economy's achievements. Mr. Stiglitz, chief author of the 1997 Economic Report of the President, points, for example, to the "promising statistics" suggesting that income inequality, after 20 years, might finally be reversing.
 
Thanks, Japan
 The new economic thinking also gets a boost from Japan and Germany, whose economies seemed so invincible in the 1980's but are caught today in downturns and, in Germany, high unemployment. For the revisionists, these reversals are inevitable results of a mistaken preference in Japan and Germany for government intervention in economic activity. By comparison, they say, America's laissez-faire approach has finally given the United States the upper hand.
"People had written off the innovative character of American entrepreneurs and their workers, and they were wrong," Mr. Jasinowski said. "They had emphasized our troubles, the slower economic growth, the downsizing, the uneven distribution of income. These are real issues, but they had gotten out of proportion to the industrial renaissance that has been taking place."
Even the millions who suffer from these real issues appear to be helping re-establish what Mr. Jasinowski considers the right proportions. Expectations have diminished, said Richard T. Curtin, a director of the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. What Americans accept today as a step up in living standards would have been scorned as piddling 25 years ago.
"It is a little like people are saying, 'I am not earning enough to get by, but it is not as bad as it could be,' while in the 60's they thought, 'How good can it get?' " Mr. Curtin said. "When you make that downward change in your standard of judgment, that makes a great deal of difference in the national outlook."
The shift in expectations began in the 1973 oil crisis, with its gas lines and new sense of vulnerability. Rising fuel prices, the severe mid-1970's recession, Japan's inroads into American markets and high inflation all contributed to what President Carter first characterized in the late 1970's as the "malaise" settling on the country.
Resisting such pessimism, Americans elected Ronald Reagan, with his morning-in-America message. But the onslaught continued. The 1981-82 recession was the worst downturn since the Depression. Heavy manufacturing was devastated, the layoffs massive. The air traffic controllers' strike marked an accelerating deterioration of union bargaining power. Mergers and downsizing made job insecurity commonplace. And wage inequality became, in the 1980's, a national characteristic as the less skilled, less educated lost ground to the college trained. Even the skilled often found themselves falling behind sometimes.
 
Redistribution
 "We have redistributed an incredible amount of income and wealth without managing to raise the living standards of most Americans," said Lawrence Mishel, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
Without challenging that statement, Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics, said that the American economy has turned out to be the best in the industrial world and that has offered breathing space to solve the nation's problems. "There is plenty of trouble at the bottom," he said, "but you don't have to worry about the Titanic going down. There isn't an iceberg. You have plenty of time to fix the deck chairs."
If they are very broken. Neither Mr. Mack nor Mr. Moynihan, leaders in Congress on economic issues, thinks they are. For Mr. Mack, the 1980's were years of robust economic growth, unrecognized by the Democrats until now. And for Mr. Moynihan, the groundwork laid in the 1980's and 1990's is paying off. "There is a reward for good behavior," he said, "but perceptions lag. It takes time for a culture that was deeply pessimistic about the future and deeply anxious about the present during the cold war to come out of that."
The main misperceptions, in the eyes of the revisionists, involve productivity and wages. Steady improvements in productivity, or output per worker, are essential for robust economic growth. The Government's productivity statistics, however, say the improvement has been anemic -- a finding most economists endorse and most revisionists reject. How can the data be accurate, says Mr. Jasinowski, when corporate America is performing so well? "It is hard to find an industry," he said, "where we are not equal to or better than our competitors."
The other misperception involves wages and salaries. By most measures -- family income and hourly earnings, for example -- they stopped rising in the early 1970's, except for brief spurts upward in the late 1980's and again very recently. But measuring incomes involves measuring inflation. Stagnant wages in the national statistics mean wages have failed to rise faster than inflation. A 3 percent raise today comes out zero, once statisticians subtract the current annual inflation rate of 3 percent, according to the Consumer Price Index. But inflation is over-stated, many revisionists insist, and as Exhibit A they cite the recent report of a commission of economists appointed by the Senate Finance Committee, mostly at Mr. Moynihan's instigation.
The commission concluded that the C.P.I. has been overstating inflation by 1.1 percentage points -- that the real annual inflation rate today, for example, is not 3 percent but 1.9 percent, which means the 3 percent raise represents not stagnation but a 1.1 percent increase, and since 1973 such gains have gone unrecorded. Accepting that conclusio means accepting a more subjective standard of measuring the cost of living.
 
Better Every Day
 What the statistics fail to reflect sufficiently are quality improvements, the commission concluded. An automaker adds $50 to a car's price to cover the cost of a better anti-rust paint. That extra cost should not have counted as a rise in the inflation rate, or at least not as much of a rise as the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates when it totes up the Consumer Price Index. Indeed, Americans for 20 years have been enjoying better cars, better medical care, fancier houses and more powerful computers, never realizing, the revisionists argue, that their living standards were rising.
But that raises the income inequality problem again, says Joel Popkin, a former chief of the bureau's C.P.I. division. "We have to consider," he said, "that, while the quality of goods and services may be rising, this new living standard is beyond the reach of an increasing proportion of Americans."

Maybe a Strike Wouldn't Have Cost That Much

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
PERHAPS it was a political no-brainer for President Clinton to intervene last week and halt the pilots' strike at American Airlines.
As George Stephanopoulos, a former senior White House adviser, explained on "Nightline" just before the pilots' strike deadline, "Despite all the highfalutin theory about getting involved in labor and management disputes, when all of the people in the country who are inconvenienced by this can say, 'The President could have prevented it and he didn't,' I don't think that's a price he wants to pay." 
 But some of those highfalutin theories deserve a second look.
Mr. Clinton said he based his decision on economics, arguing that the potential damage of the strike met the test of the 1926 Railway Labor Act: that a labor dispute "threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service."
This was no small decision. Lyndon Johnson was the last President to use the powers of the act, when machinists struck several airlines in 1966.
Invoking the act will inevitably alter the rhythms of labor negotiations at other major airlines in coming years.
But those concerns were apparently outweighed by the potential impact of a strike: according to a widely quoted study by the United States Department of Transportation, a walkout by the pilots at American would have cost the economy up to $200 million a day, and possibly stranded 43,000 travelers.
Where did these numbers come from? Before the strike deadline, the department gave the total figures to the public but not the math that produced the totals. The agency said that its economic assumptions were intended only for Federal mediators and the President.
But the report, which was obtained by The New York Times, shows that some of the Government's totals are as shaky as a fold-down tray on a commuter plane.
 
Funny Numbers
 For example, the estimate of 43,000 stranded passengers "does not reflect at least three significant factors that could mitigate the impact," the report says. Other airlines might add service in places like Miami and Dallas where American is dominant; many passengers might postpone or cancel their travel plans; and many travelers might switch their tickets to other airlines in anticipation of a strike.
So given the certainty that all these things would occur or had already happened, why was the publicized total so high?
For all the potential ripple effect of a strike -- particularly in the Caribbean, where American is the dominant carrier -- the $200 million figure also seems high.
Consider that American Airlines' own doomsday study, intended to persuade the White House to intervene, estimated that the economic impact -- touching everyone from proprietors of a dry cleaner in suburban Dallas to Chilean salmon producers to waitresses in Jamaica -- would be $83 million a day.
And for context, consider that $200 million represents the daily total of passenger revenues of the entire United States airline industry (American's market share is about 20 percent).
The Government's calculations even included the potential loss to shareholders of AMR Corporation, American's parent, who might not get a dividend this quarter in the event of a strike. Not that anyone was expecting a payout in the first place -- shareholders have not seen a dividend from the company since 1980.
"The true economic loss to society is much too small to provide an explanation for Clinton's intervention," said Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively about the airline industry. "It's ridiculous."
Perhaps the Transportation Department heard so few challenges to its estimates of dollars lost and passengers stranded because its figures felt right, considering the outsized attention and interest the airline industry generates.
The airline business has become a kind of national spectator sport: roughly nine major teams with distinctive uniforms and personalities that often reflect the forceful characters of their head coaches, like Robert L. Crandall, the chief executive at American.
Few businesses can offer the kind of entertaining highlight film like that of the pilots' strike chairman, Matthew Field, on CNN announcing Operation Fire at Will: "What I do now, I do without reservation or hesitation. What I do now is for the pilots of American Airlines and their families. What I do now is for all professional aviators."
And the crowd cheers when fares go on sale. Then, like true New York sports fans, travelers immediately start grumbling -- there's no real deal here, it's impossible to get through to book a flight.
This is an industry that all Americans think they understand, so they can play armchair quarterback on what's wrong with it and how to fix it.
"Once you've been a passenger, you've been knighted as a pundit," said David A. Swierenga, chief economist at the Air Transport Association, the major airlines' trade group.
Mr. Clinton has not flown on a commercial flight for some time, but he too knows something about voters' interest in the airline industry. He scored several political points in 1993, for example, by nudging American and its flight attendants to settle their dispute and get thousands of travelers home for Thanksgiving.
 
Clinton's Calculation
 He also learned an important lesson earlier that year, after he parked Air Force One on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport to get his hair trimmed. Although airport records later showed that not a single flight was delayed, it was widely reported at the time that several airplanes were held up as his stylist combed and clipped, turning Mr. Clinton's haircut into a public relations buzzcut.
Since then, the President has made a big effort to improve his image and his poll numbers. So even if the Transportation Department's math isn't solid, Mr. Clinton's calculations are: 9,300 American Airlines pilots versus thousands of stranded passengers and millions of armchair quarterbacks. No contest.

HEADLINE: Delay Seen In Restoring NATO Role For France

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 22

 BODY:
France said more than a year ago that it would rejoin the NATO commands it left in 1966 if the United States would concede more of them to European officers. But now the French Government is under increasing domestic pressure to stay out and will probably decide to do so this spring, many French and American officials say.
NATO diplomats and French officials said that in talks held this week with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in Paris and other European capitals, neither the United States nor France had changed its position on the main stumbling block. 
 That is President Jacques Chirac's demand that the United States give up the right to name the officer in command of Allied Forces Southern Europe in Naples, whose main asset in wartime would be the United States Sixth Fleet.
The Clinton Administration, with Congress behind it, insists that an American admiral stay in charge. It has already agreed to a NATO reorganization that would put real power into the hands of the alliance's European deputy commander, allowing Europeans to use NATO equipment and communications for military operations of their own, officials say.
On Monday, according to diplomats who were present, Mr. Chirac told Mrs. Albright that France would seek to reach a compromise with the United States by April or May, but that if no agreement could be found by then he would keep France out of the military structure, with no hard feelings. He said another effort to resolve the issue would be made again in two or three years.
"If the French don't come back in," one American official said, "the European separate defense identity they wanted will just develop within NATO without them."
Mr. Chirac's conservative Government is grappling with seemingly intractable problems. At the top of the list are unwanted immigration from former French colonies and 12.8 percent unemployment. Frustrations, combined with fear that the far-right National Front party will make strong election gains next year and anxiety about France's losing pre-eminence in Europe to Germany, have produced a new chauvinistic tone in political debate.
Many of Mr. Chirac's friends and foes alike have taken to using the kind of anti-American oratory that de Gaulle used when he took French soldiers out from under American military command 30 years ago.
The change was strikingly apparent in a parliamentary debate on a French-German defense agreement at the end of last month. Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a deputy who served as Defense Minister during the Socialist presidency of Francois Mitterrand, said dismissively of NATO:
"Whether you like it or not, it's American. Its command is American, since the Americans haven't given it up, not even in the southern European sector in Naples, despite a demand by President Chirac."
An adviser to Mr. Chirac said Friday, "Our margin of maneuver was reduced by the parliamentary debate, no question about it."
The United States holds the top post of Supreme Allied Commander for Europe in Brussels and that of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, in Norfolk, Va.
So, the French argue, when President Clinton and other leaders approve a reorganization at a meeting of the 16 NATO allies in Madrid in July, they should provide balance between American and European posts by giving European officers the alliance's two main land commands in Europe. These will be the one in Naples, covering the Mediterranean and the troubled Balkan region, and one for northern Europe in Brunssum, the Netherlands, covering everything else.
"The President has said that France is ready to go back into NATO," a French official close to him said, "but he can only do it if the two sides are balanced."
Some diplomats say a compromise is still possible if both leaders want one. But with more pressing issues on the agenda -- like which countries to include in NATO and how to reconcile Russia -- one NATO official said the betting was against France's rejoining this year.

HEADLINE: The Mexican Drug Scandal

 BODY:
The arrest on drug trafficking charges of the general who led Mexico's antinarcotics program is shocking evidence of how difficult it will be to stem the flow of drugs from abroad. Just two months ago America's top drug fighter, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, praised his newly appointed Mexican counterpart, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, as a man of "unquestioned integrity." Now General Gutierrez stands accused of accepting bribes from and collaborating with leading Mexican drug traffickers. The general's reputation for integrity stemmed from his crackdowns on the drug trade while a regional commander. Now he is suspected of ignoring his favored traffickers and moving only against their competitors.
The scandal raises questions about a key premise of antidrug policy in Mexico -- namely, that its military would be more immune to corruption than the already corrupted civilian narcotics agencies. It also raises the frightening possibility that General Gutierrez, who received high-level briefings in Washington, has already disclosed strategies and secret informants to his alleged drug lord patrons. 
 President Clinton must decide, by March 1, whether to certify that Mexico and other nations are cooperating with American antidrug efforts. He can either grant full certification, deny certification or allow certification based on "vital national interests" even if antidrug cooperation is less than full. Nations that are not certified lose most forms of economic assistance (except for counternarcotics aid) and Washington must vote against loans to these nations from international institutions. Last year six countries were decertified: Myanmar, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Iran, Syria and Colombia.
Mexican authorities moved with admirable swiftness to arrest General Gutierrez. But his arrest is yet more evidence that corruption is affecting even top-level Mexican drug officials and thus preventing Mexico from cooperating fully with the fight against cocaine. An honest assessment would lead President Clinton to withhold full certification from Mexico but grant instead a waiver on "vital national interest" grounds. That would acknowledge Mexico's less-than-full cooperation in the fight against drugs while continuing to recognize Mexico as an important ally whose economic health matters deeply to the United States.

HEADLINE: Rewards and Penalties Vary in States' Welfare Programs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Exercising the vast discretion given to them under the new welfare law, many states are adopting stricter work requirements and shorter time limits than Congress envisioned for public assistance.
But some states temper their stringent policies, allowing exemptions for parents who cannot find jobs or who are caring for disabled relatives. 
 Six months after President Clinton signed the welfare law, 40 governors have submitted state welfare plans to the Federal Government, and the Department of Health and Human Services has certified 37. Those states are allowed to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of Federal money that are, in many cases, greater than what the states would have received under the old welfare law.
States are, as Congress expected, going off in different directions, with different combinations of penalties and rewards. Some are using welfare money to subsidize wages or to pay housing and other expenses to help people get through crises so they can avoid welfare.
Some states encourage work by penalizing those who refuse to cooperate. Indiana has sharply increased the use of such penalties, which typically cut welfare checks by $90 a month.
Other states treat earned income in a new, more generous way, to make sure people are better off working than on welfare. In Pennsylvania, for example, a family of a mother and two children is now forced off welfare when the woman earns more than $10,300 a year. But under a policy effective next month, the ceiling will be raised to $14,100.
The 10 states that have not submitted their welfare plans are still working out details, often in negotiation between governors and state legislators. July 1 is the deadline for them to submit their plans to the Federal Government.
At first, state welfare programs look like a crazy quilt. But separate reviews of state plans by the Federal Government, the National Governors' Association and The New York Times disclose some patterns.
TIME LIMITS Eighteen states -- 45 percent of those that have filed plans -- set time limits on welfare stricter than the five-year lifetime limit authorized by the Federal law. Twenty-two states plan to enforce the five-year limit.
Indiana and North Carolina have two-year limits. In North Carolina, people reaching the limit may reapply for benefits after three years off welfare. Montana has a two-year limit for single parents. Louisiana will pay welfare for no more than two years in any five-year period. Utah has a three-year limit. Connecticut has a 21-month limit, but makes exceptions and grants extensions in some cases -- if, for example, a person is caring for an incapacitated child or spouse.
WORK REQUIREMENTS The Federal law requires adults to work within two years of receiving cash assistance, but 16 states, or 40 percent of those filing plans, have adopted more stringent work requirements. Twenty-four states intend to use the two-year work requirement.
Some states, including Florida, Tennessee and Texas, say that adult welfare recipients are expected to go to work immediately. Massachusetts requires work within two months. Virginia requires work in three months.
Michigan reduces welfare benefits by 25 percent if people do not meet work requirements within two months. In North Carolina, welfare recipients must obtain jobs or participate in job training within three months, or their benefits will be cut. Many states want to define "work" more broadly than Congress, so they can give credit for job-search activities or literacy classes.
INTERSTATE MIGRANTS At least nine states say they will treat new arrivals differently from longtime residents. Thus, families who have moved into one state from another may receive lower benefits or may be required to go through a waiting period.
If, for example, a family moves to New York from a state that pays lower welfare benefits, New York wants to pay that family the smaller amount it would have received in the other state for one year. Pennsylvania and Maryland have the same policy.
Florida allows people to receive welfare for two years in any five-year period, with a lifetime limit of five years' cash assistance. But if a family moves to Florida from a state with stricter time limits, Florida enforces the shorter limits.
The new welfare law permits such differential treatment, even though Supreme Court decisions dating back to 1969 suggest that it might be unconstitutional. The Court has expressed concern that such arrangements deny equal protection of the laws to some people or interfere with the "freedom to travel."
FAMILY CAP At least 19 of the 40 states that have filed welfare plans say they will not increase payments for women who have additional children while receiving public assistance. For decades, states have routinely provided more money to larger families. But in recent years, some states have ended such automatic increases, on the theory that they create an economic incentive for parents to have more children whom they cannot support.
DRUG TESTING Only two states, New York and Ohio, said they would test welfare recipients to see if they had been using illegal drugs. Thirty states said they would not require such testing. The other states have not made a decision or did not address the issue in their state plans. Several studies suggest that 20 percent to 25 percent of welfare recipients abuse drugs or alcohol in ways that may impair their ability to get and hold jobs. But experts say that drug testing is not necessarily the best way to identify those people.
Terrance M. McGrath, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Social Services, said state officials wanted to test all people applying for welfare.
"Our No. 1 priority is to get people off welfare and into jobs," Mr. McGrath said. "They won't be able to do that if they have a drug problem. Welfare money should not be used to finance the purchase of drugs. Under our plan, people who test positive would be required to go into a drug rehabilitation program."
Jacqueline A. Romer-Sensky, deputy chief of staff to Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio, said: "We screen pregnant women for drugs. It's not punitive. It's part of a larger effort to make sure that babies are born drug-free."
DRUG FELONS At least 20 states say they plan to deny welfare to people convicted of felonies involving the possession, use or distribution of narcotics. So far only Oregon has indicated that it wants to allow people convicted of such crimes to receive cash assistance. The other states have not made decisions or have not addressed the issue in their plans.
Under the new law, people convicted of drug crimes are generally ineligible for Federal welfare benefits, but states may override the ban by passing laws.
Jean I. Thorne, the Federal policy coordinator for Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, a Democrat, said: "If you are a drug-related felon with a couple of kids, we want you to get drug and alcohol treatment so you can go back to work and be self-sufficient. It's a good use of money."
Brian C. McNeil, a policy adviser to Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona, a Republican, said: "The Governor is tough on drugs. But there is no reasonably efficient way to verify statements of people applying for welfare when they say they have not been convicted of drug crimes. If you're not going to verify the statements, then inquiring about a person's drug history is a questionable use of time."
IMMIGRANTS A surprisingly large number of states -- 36 of the 40 filing state plans -- said they would continue providing cash welfare benefits to impoverished legal immigrants who have not become citizens but were in the United States before Aug. 22, when President Clinton signed the welfare bill. Only Alabama, South Carolina and Wyoming said they would not provide benefits to immigrants already in the country. Those who arrive on or after Aug. 22 are generally ineligible for Federal welfare benefits for five years.
SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT Twenty-seven states said they would subsidize jobs for welfare recipients. Typically, states take a portion of the money earmarked for welfare benefits or food stamps and give it to employers, who in turn pay wages to the welfare recipients.
Nineteen states, including New York and North Carolina, will make occasional payments to low-income families so they can cope with temporary setbacks and stay off welfare. People who are unexpectedly laid off or suffer brief illnesses may be eligible for such emergency grants.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Boone Would Rather See Any Team but His Royals Finish in Last Place

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: HAINES CITY, Fla.

 BODY:
Bob Boone will obviously win no humanitarian award this year. Gene Lamont will certainly not vote for him.
Boone, the Kansas City manager, suffered through the first last-place finish in the Royals' 28-year history last season, and it seemed that he might feel for Lamont, a fellow former catcher, who has the task of steering the Pittsburgh Pirates through what is destined to be an arduous season. 
 But no.
"Not one ounce," Boone said. "I've been through it. I understand it. I don't feel for him. I don't feel for him at all. For one thing, there's no pressure on him. No, I do not. I wish I could play him every day and beat his brains out. That's the way I feel about it."
It's nothing personal, you understand.
"Maybe if I wasn't in this position, I could have some compassion," Boone went on. "It's just that you're trained. That's what you do. I want to win, 10 to nothing, every day. I want to laugh at you every day. I'm not going to feel sorry for you that you can't beat my team. I want to dominate you every day and not feel sorry for you one bit.
"I can't take Gene Lamont out of that at all. If I had any of those feelings, it might have been toward Buddy Bell. At the start of last year he had no chance every day because of the pitching. So if there's any compassion I ever had, it was for Buddy Bell. But I didn't spend much time dwelling on it or thinking about it."
Well, so much for shared feeling.
The Royals, having added Chili Davis as their designated hitter and Jeff King and Jay Bell as half of their infield, have a better feeling about themselves this season. Boone even looks forward to using fewer lineups than the major league-leading 152 he wrote on lineup cards last season. It was a shuffling act that gained him much criticism.
"It was a real fun topic in Kansas City," the third-year manager said. "To say there was criticism is being kind."
In his defense, Boone pointed to the Yankees' frequently changing lineup. Joe Torre used 131 different lineups, second most in the league and, Boone said, "was pretty successful." Boone also rejected the idea that he enjoyed having different lineups, as if he woke up every morning gleefully asking himself what new alignment he could concoct today.
"Not true," he said. "Your team dictates what you do. I want a set lineup. I want to be able to write it down. I'd love to have Earl Weaver's teams. I don't have to do anything. We're going to play for three-run homers. I love that thought. But if you can't hit a three-run homer, you're going to do a lot of waiting around."
Last season, the Royals scored the fewest runs, hit the fewest home runs and amassed the fewest total bases in the American League. It was the absence of a couple of big hitters that forced Boone to put different names on different lines of the lineup card every day.
"I had no middle of the lineup that said, 'You play me in the middle of the lineup every day because I'm one of your best hitters and we're going to win,' " Boone said. "So my everyday challenge was to hook up who I thought were the best hitters against their pitcher for that day."
The second basic reason for the constant changes, he explained, was that when a team is in a development mode, as the Royals were, playing time is not necessarily dictated by what players deserve.
"I had players playing because it was their turn," Boone said. "When you develop, that's what you have to do. You close your eyes to what they're doing because you know they need X number of at-bats no matter what they did. It's kind of foreign to what I know as major league baseball, but we had sold this development package to our fans and we were on that course."
Boone had to learn what his young players were capable of doing and often placed them not only in different spots in the lineup, but also at different positions on the field. Craig Paquette, for example, started at first, short, third and left and batted third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth. Jose Offerman started at first, second and short and batted first, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth.
"A lot of it was experimentation," Boone said. "The other point was I was trying to make 12 or 13 guys think they were playing every day. I needed them to say, 'Boy, I had a full year; I played every day.' When you're trying to make 13 guys regulars on your team and you have only 9 spots, you're going to have a lot of different lineups."
Boone looks forward to having a more stable setup this season.
"King and Davis will be in the middle," he said. "Bell will be in there every day somewhere, Offerman everyday at second. Paquette's going to get a chance at third. Bip Roberts will be in left."
And maybe one day Earl Weaver will spiritually sit in the dugout.
 
A Boost for Baerga
 On the same day Carlos Baerga was at the Mets' camp in Port St. Lucie talking about his decision to quit drinking and change his life style, Mike Hargrove was across the state in Winter Haven responding to a question about Baerga's decline with Cleveland last season.
"Carlos is a good guy, a good person; I like him," the Indians manager said. "He's a good player. He's a leader. He cares about his teammates. I just felt Carlos got caught up in the extras around the game. He lost sight of his priorities. That comes out sounding like he's out doing drugs or chasing women or partying. I don't mean that.
"He liked to entertain people and have a lot of people around him all the time after the games. He'd go out and stay out late. His priorities got screwy and he couldn't get it back. He lost his focus. He quit working. We tried to get him to take ground balls, 50 ground balls a day, and he'd take 30. That sort of thing."
Told of Hargrove's assessment, the Mets' second baseman didn't duck any of it.
"I got a lot of friends," he said. "They come with me, and I also have my family and I like to go out and have a good time. But I always respect my teammates. I know that I have to work hard the next day to do my job and I give thanks to him."
Hargrove said that he expected Baerga to have a "huge year" this season and that he would be disappointed if Baerga didn't.
Baerga said he appreciated Hargrove for publicly saying he didn't have a drug problem. The whispers had already begun.
 
Arbitration Inflation
 In 1974, Richard Moss, then the Players Association's general counsel, argued the first salary arbitration case ever and won a $30,000 salary for Dick Woodson, a pitcher for the Minnesota Twins, who wanted to pay him $22,000. Last week, Moss presented the only winning case on the players' side in this year's arbitration hearings, gaining a $2.5 million salary for Tim Wakefield over Boston's bid for $1.55 million.
 
In Salary Race, Bonds by a Nose
 The negotiations that produced a record contract for Barry Bonds of San Francisco could have been completed earlier except for the goal of Bonds and his agent, Dennis Gilbert.
"They had one objective in this negotiation," said a person familiar with the negotiations. "Get Bonds's average annual value over Belle's. They wrangled for a week or two over it."
Playing "Can You Top This?" Albert Belle signed last November for $11 million a year. Bonds's two-year extension with an option for a third year in 2001 has been portrayed as a $22.9 million deal, or $11.45 million a year. It's not worth that much because $1.4 million is deferred in each of the two years without interest, but it still beats Belle. Bonds and Gilbert made sure of that.
With $1.4 million from 1999 to be paid June 30, 2002, and the $1.4 million from 2000 to be paid June 30, 2003, the current value of the package produces an annual average of $11,131,057.
Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle is generally considered No. 3 on the list now, but deferred money without interest reduces the current value of his contract to an annual average of $8,228,307. The real No. 3 is Pat Hentgen of Toronto, the American League Cy Young Award winner, who two months ago signed an extension for 1999 that guarantees him an additional $8.5 million.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Campaign Selects Its New Face;
A Tough Deputy Switches Modes From Negotiation to Re-Election

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
By Thursday, less than 24 hours after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had transformed Fran Reiter from his blunt, driven Deputy Mayor into his blunt, driven campaign manager, the physical changes were already evident.
The severe, dark power suits were gone, as was the vague sense of siege that sometimes trailed her through City Hall. Instead, having been released into the informal, open-collar world of pure politics, she was wearing a sunny yellow sweater and black slacks, and was actually laughing and telling funny stories. 
 "I'm in campaign mode now," she explained.
In truth, Fran Reiter is almost always in campaign mode. As the Mayor's lead negotiator with business leaders and neighborhood groups over the last three years, she has embodied the administration's bulldozer style of conquest, criticizing and even withering opponents at times, compromising when necessary, tirelessly promoting her boss's agenda at every opportunity.
Now the woman whose negotiating skills have led many business people to call her the administration's brightest star, is poised to become "the face" of the Giuliani re-election campaign, in the words of her mentor, Raymond B. Harding.
"I now refer to her as the face of the campaign, the main political spokesperson for the duration of the campaign," said Mr. Harding, the Mayor's closest political adviser and the leader of the state's Liberal Party, to which Ms. Reiter has devoted much of her adult life. "That's the face we want to put on television."
And it doesn't hurt that the face happens to be that of a woman, particularly if Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, ends up as the Democratic nominee for Mayor after the September primary.
Ms. Reiter, however, will be only too pleased to blast away at whichever candidate emerges from the primary, male or female. Though the task will clearly be easier than it was in 1993, the job of managing the Mayor's campaign seems to fulfill a hunger within her to return to the world of full-blown politics, to which she is most accustomed. At 43, Ms. Reiter has come a long way from the day in 1982 when she joined the New York State Liberal Party because she considered the Democratic Party both too conservative and too indolent. (Family ties also played a role.) She remains no less committed, though, to the idea of a practical, muscular politics -- a method of getting things done far more important to her than ideology.
"There's a certain pragmatic streak in the Liberal Party that I love, and it goes side by side with its ideals," she said in an interview, explaining her devotion to the tiny party that has helped Mr. Giuliani appear more than a Republican and her something less than a dogmatic liberal. "I think we're a force for getting stuff done, for supporting candidates who want to make things happen."
Just minutes after her appointment on Wednesday, in fact, she had already assumed her post on the steps of City Hall on behalf of one such candidate. Arms folded, head tilted back, she unleashed for the cameras a stream of sarcasm directed at the four Democratic challengers to Mr. Giuliani who had appeared at a forum that morning. Each of them, she noted with distaste, had agreed to support the Rev. Al Sharpton if he won the September primary.
That moment on the steps was but the first of innumerable appearances Ms. Reiter will be making in place of the Mayor as his re-election drive begins to accelerate in the months to come. Though Mr. Giuliani's political advisers have been trying, not always with success, to rein in his own personal attacks on his opponents and make him appear more mayoral, Ms. Reiter will be under no such constraints.
Ms. Reiter is in no danger of being described as more diplomatic than her boss, but attacks on Ms. Messinger or the other candidates might sound less vicious coming from a woman, particularly among the key bloc of female swing voters.
"I don't see myself as a woman Deputy Mayor or a woman campaign manager," Ms. Reiter said. "But how will the rest of the world see it? You know, I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't be helpful for someone like me to be supporting Rudy Giuliani. Of course it's going to be helpful."
In 1992, in fact, Ms. Reiter performed a similar role for Robert Abrams, the former State Attorney General who was in a tight race for the Democratic nomination against two prominent women, Geraldine A. Ferraro and Elizabeth Holtzman. The Liberal Party, of which she was then the chairwoman, had decided to back Mr. Abrams, and Ms. Reiter was enlisted to persuade Democratic women to consider a man.
"If you're a male candidate with a macho image, it can often be misinterpreted by the public that you're beating up on a woman opponent," said Ethan Geto, Mr. Abrams's campaign manager and now a top city lobbyist. "Fran was a very impassioned speaker and helped to diffuse that political perception. In fact, she was our No. 1 choice after Mrs. Abrams as a surrogate speaker for the candidate." Mr. Abrams won the primary, but lost the general election to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Before the Giuliani campaign, she had never before worked for a Republican. In 1990, she even ran (heatedly, but quite unsuccessfully) against a moderate Republican very much in the ideological mold of Rudolph Giuliani: Bill Green, the former Upper East Side Congressman whom Mr. Giuliani later appointed to the city's Campaign Finance Board. But she sees no contradiction in her current advocacy for a Republican Mayor who is proud of spreading himself across the ideological spectrum, advocating at once immigrant rights, abortion rights, the death penalty and a rigorous workfare program.
"I don't think I've changed," she said. "Ideologically I'm still a left-of-center person. But I define my liberalism in much more traditional American liberal terms. I'm much more a Roosevelt-Humphrey type liberal than what we tend to refer to as liberalism here in New York, which I think is a 1960's aberration."
Ms. Reiter was reared in a family of Democrats in a building her grandfather built in 1928 at Second Avenue and 11th Street. (The effects of growing up on what was once the Rialto of Yiddish theater are still evident from the embroidered "oy vey" pillow on her desk, a sentiment that will presumably still apply to the campaign.) She still lives by herself there in an apartment not far from her mother's, elsewhere in the building; her brother, Jonathan, first vice chairman of the Liberal Party, lives a few blocks away. After studying directing at Boston University, she worked in a variety of theater jobs, but eventually became successful at marketing syndicated television shows, including movie packages, sports specials and even women's wrestling.
She had been drawn to the "libs" after her mother got a job with the party as an office manager in 1980. Jimmy Carter, Fran Reiter believed, was too conservative; the local Democrats resembled a "1960's radicalism" that she considered ineffective and out of touch. When Mr. Harding, the Liberal Party leader, selected a brash Federal prosecutor as the party's mayoral candidate in 1989, she decided she, too, admired Rudolph Giuliani's intelligence and sense of independence, and became head of the Women's Coalition for Giuliani.
"The evolution of Fran's political career has very much tracked that of the Liberal Party," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who has been friends with Ms. Reiter for about 15 years, but who is not a supporter of Mr. Giuliani. "I don't think anyone would really say that Giuliani represented the historical position of the party, but they made a calculated decision about supporting him. And Fran rode that wave, and has performed very well in doing so."
By 1993, she was deputy campaign manager, overseeing the 34 field offices and serving as an adviser on women's and gay and lesbian issues. Though Carl F. Grillo, another Liberal Party ally (who died last December), actually directed the crucial get-out-the-vote effort, the Mayor and his confidants were impressed by Ms. Reiter's forcefulness and her organizational ability. After the inauguration, she was named Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Relations, the chief land-use and community liaison post; last April, she gave up community relations and took over the economic development portfolio.
She still bristles at suggestions from critics that she was installed in the job by Mr. Harding as a reward for the crucial support of the Liberal Party. Two of Mr. Harding's sons were also hired by Mr. Giuliani in important posts; Mr. Harding himself has recently been under fire for prospering as a lobbyist of city agencies while advising the Mayor on political issues.
"It is demeaning and it is annoying, but it is the world I live in," she said. "The only way you counter that is you do a good job, and you try not to get too crazy about it."
Having learned the art of negotiation from haggling with television stations, Ms. Reiter brought to her job a willingness to deal that impressed many of the developers, business leaders and community organizations she dealt with. Comfortable with power, she would come to the table with a hard line and then be prepared to back off a bit from it.
One business official who has sat across from her at the table described her as occasionally "slippery," willing to recast oral agreements that had been made in earlier meetings for an advantage. She can be bellicose and even rude with adversaries -- as she was with Time Warner Cable in the fight to get the Fox News Network a channel -- but most negotiators who have worked with her used words like "smart," "cocky" and "aggressive" in admiring terms.
Even Ms. Messinger describes her as "occasionally the only person in the administration you could reach out to and reason with on a community issue."
She lost the most important economic development initiative of her tenure when the City Council refused to go along with a plan to allow more superstores in the city. But she also won praise for pushing through a plan to bring new businesses and residents to the Wall Street area, and seemed likely to continue in her role until Peter J. Powers, the Mayor's oldest friend, decided he didn't want to reprise his role as campaign manager. (He will stay on as campaign chairman, providing strategic advice. Randy Levine, former labor commissioner, is one of several candidates being considered to replace Ms. Reiter.)
Ms. Reiter's intense loyalty and political mind-set made her a logical choice to run the day-to-day operations of the campaign, a decision she and Mr. Harding say was made solely by the Mayor based on her record.
"I've done a pretty damn good job as Deputy Mayor, and I'm prepared to let the record speak for itself," she says in characteristic fashion. "Which is more than I can say about the Democrats running for mayor."

HEADLINE: Florio Decides He Won't Run For Governor

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Ending months of speculation that he wanted his old job back, former Gov. Jim Florio said today that he would not seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination but that he would do all that he could to defeat Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in November.
Mr. Florio said in an interview that he had given serious consideration to a rematch with Mrs. Whitman because he had believed that his fellow New Jersey Democrats were not making a strong enough case against Whitman administration policies, which he said threaten the state's economic future. 
 But after watching the field of six potential Democratic challengers over the last couple of months, and meeting with them privately during the last two weeks, Mr. Florio said he is now convinced that the other candidates can successfully draw attention to the long-term problems that he believes Governor Whitman's policies have created. He said he can be more effective by stepping aside and lending his support to one candidate, Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from Camden County, who he said would be able to wage the most aggressive campaign.
"Without exception, all of them are good people," Mr. Florio said of the field of contenders. "They are smart people. They are attractive people. I am enthusiastic about the energy that some of the candidates have. But what you need is all of those things and a commitment to be extremely aggressive about highlighting the differences between the Whitman administration and what I hope would be the consensus policies of the Democratic nominee and the Democratic party. I am now convinced that candidate is Rob Andrews."
Although Mr. Florio had never publicly declared his intention to challenge Mrs. Whitman, he did not dismiss a possible campaign until today. The prospect of a Whitman-Florio rematch had been the subject of much talk and concern in New Jersey Democratic circles. Democrats, who lost control of the State Legislature and hundreds of municipal and county seats after Mr. Florio pushed through a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990, feared that a rematch would revive voter anger over the tax hikes at a time when they were seeking to rebuild the party and field the next generation of Democrats.
There was not a trace of ambivalence in Mr. Florio's voice as he described his decision to withdraw from the race and throw his support behind Mr. Andrews, who took over the Congressional seat that Mr. Florio left in 1989 to become Governor. "I am very comfortable and assured to have somebody who can carry a good message," he said.
Mr. Andrews will benefit not only from Mr. Florio's continued popularity among rank-and-file Democratic voters but also because he no longer has to worry about sharing the same political base in south Jersey with Mr. Florio.
In an interview, Mr. Andrews said that he welcomed Mr. Florio's support. "I'm obviously delighted and honored," Mr. Andrews said.
Mr. Andrews said he also believed that Mr. Florio's decision increased the chances of unifying the state Democratic party. "I believe that we will have a unified party very soon, and get on to the business of pointing out the reasons why Governor Whitman should be denied a second term," he said.
A poll by Quinnipiac College, published last week, showed that Mr. Florio, with his statewide name recognition, could have easily won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in June, but that Mrs. Whitman would trounce him in November.
Now that Mr. Florio has withdrawn from the race, Mr. Andrews, who is 39, and State Senator James E. McGreevey, 37, a Democrat from Middlesex County who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge Township, are considered the front-runners in race for the Democratic nomination.
Mr. McGreevey praised Mr. Florio, saying that he deserves enormous respect, but he dismissed the former Governor's assertion that Mr. Andrews would make a stronger case against Governor Whitman than he would. He also said his background as a mayor, rather than as a member of Congress, would make him a more effective governor.
"Mr. Andrews and Governor Florio are both from Camden County and shared the same Congressional district," he said. "As a mayor, your results are measured on a day-by-day basis. It is not casting a particular vote. It is by delivering a product, which is more relevant to the challenges in the Governor's office."
Other Democrats who have declared candidacies include Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County Executive; Susan Bass Levin, the Mayor of Cherry Hill; Michael Murphy, a former Morris County Prosecutor and George Zoffinger, a former State Commerce Commissioner.
Since the Democratic candidates all lack experience in a statewide campaign and are little known outside of their home counties, they share the problem of building name recognition among voters.
"We are all essentially known in our own area and not beyond. This makes it a very hot, even contest," Mr. Janiszewski said.
Mrs. Whitman, who was unavailable for comment today because she was in California, finishing a four-day trip to raise more than $100,000 in campaign funds for the New Jersey Republican Committee, has said she would relish a rematch with Mr. Florio so she could compare her record of cutting taxes with his tax increases.
Mrs. Whitman narrowly defeated Mr. Florio after a bitter campaign in 1993. Close friends and associates of Mr. Florio said they believed he had wanted to challenge her this year to vindicate his policies. But Mr. Florio insists he was motivated by his concern that Mrs. Whitman's fiscal policies -- along with her approach to the environment, property taxes and the public schools -- were creating long-term problems for the state. In the next economic downturn, he said, New Jersey will be without the resources needed to get through difficult times because of the Governor's policies of the last three years.
"The policies of this administration are nothing less than irresponsible," Mr. Florio said. "But to this point, none of this stuff has pierced through the clutter of public discussion. It is going to take a Herculean effort to mix passion, force and knowledge of the substance of the issues to uncloak what has been done. I am confident that the message will get across."
But does this mean that Mr. Florio will be stepping out of the public eye and retiring from politics forever? "I am not going away," he said.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS SHOW SOME FLEXIBILITY ON CAPITAL GAINS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
After years of deriding any cuts in the capital-gains tax as a handout to country club Republicans, Democrats in Congress have softened their opposition and, in some cases, have come to support a reduction in the tax, increasing the likelihood of a compromise this year on the often bitter partisan dispute.
Democrats said the change had been driven to some degree by the stunning rise in the stock market, which has left many small, middle-class investors sitting on big gains and interested in minimizing their tax bills if they sell shares. 
 But the political dynamic of the issue has been most changed by increasing complaints about the tax from farmers and the owners of small businesses, powerful constituencies. Those voters have received a far more sympathetic hearing from Democratic lawmakers than have the Wall Street securities firms and other traditional proponents of reducing the tax on profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and other property and investments.
"This issue has moved from the country clubs and the boardrooms to the barrooms of middle America," said Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a leading Democratic proponent of capital-gains cuts, whose view would be disputed by his more liberal colleagues.
Important differences still hinder a compromise. Most Republicans want to slash the top capital-gains rate of 28 percent on all profits, arguing that such a reduction would unleash new investment and create jobs and economic growth. Democrats tend to favor narrower and far less costly proposals aimed specifically at small-business owners, farmers and homeowners.
Still, because a compromise will be essential to efforts by the Clinton Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress to reach agreement on balancing the Federal budget, members of both parties said that enough common ground existed on the issue to reach a deal.
"There has been a significant evolution of Democratic thinking on capital gains," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California and a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee who has introduced a proposal aimed at helping small businesses. "Generally speaking, many Democrats would be flexible, and some would consider moving to a broader-based approach."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one of the few Democrats to support a Republican proposal for an across-the-board reduction in the maximum rate, to 19.8 percent, said that only a handful of his Democratic colleagues would be willing to vote with him today. "But you're now talking about positions along a spectrum, rather than saying, 'No way; this can never happen,' " Mr. Lieberman said.
Part of the reason that Democrats in Congress appear more flexible is that President Clinton, who has never taken a strong ideological position on the issue, has made clear that he is willing to use capital gains as a bargaining chip in the negotiations over a balanced budget. Without any firm sense of where the White House will draw a line, Democrats said more of their colleagues were interested in staking out a middle-of-the-road position.
Republicans say no budget deal is possible without broad capital-gains relief, although it is unclear what tradeoffs they are willing to make between capital gains and their other tax proposals, including a credit for families with children.
The White House has been vague about how far it might go. But the Administration has said that the $33 billion in capital-gains reductions the Republican leadership wanted over the next five years would require spending cuts unacceptable to Democrats and that if the Republicans wanted an agreement, they would have to scale back their demands.
As an opening offer, the White House has proposed exempting from capital-gains taxes as much as $500,000 in profits from the sale of a home, a step that it estimates would cost $1.4 billion over five years.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said, "Tax cuts that are much higher than the President's proposals would require us to make program reductions that would unduly harm our economy and society."
The arguments about the economic effects of cutting the tax have hardened over the years into articles of faith. Conservatives are adamant that a deep reduction would unshackle the nation's entrepreneurial strengths and maybe even pay for itself through increased growth. Liberals reel off statistics about how half of capital gains accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population, making the issue one of basic fairness, and of cost.
Those ideological differences, as well as raw political calculation, kept the two parties at loggerheads from the mid-1980's through the end of President George Bush's term. The harder Mr. Bush pushed for a reduction, the more determined the Congress, then controlled by Democrats, was to deny him a victory.
Senate Democrats are showing signs of changing that unyielding position. During the late 80's and early 90's, the Democratic leader in the Senate, George Mitchell of Maine, was an implacable foe of reducing the tax. Among the plans offered by Democrats this year are two by leaders in the Senate.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, is pushing a plan that would help farmers, owners of small businesses and homeowners by expanding on a narrow capital-gains measure that Congress approved in 1993 as part of a bill that raised taxes over all.
Mr. Daschle, who represents a farm state, is pushing hard for a provision that would allow farmers to exempt $400,000 in profits from the sale of land if they rolled the money into a pension savings account. The provision, aides said, is intended to address farmers' complaints that the current policy discourages them from selling their land.
Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, the chief Democratic whip, has made an innovative proposal that would set the maximum rate based on how long the taxpayer had owned the asset. The profits from any asset held more than two years would be taxed at 26 percent, with the rate declining two percentage points for each additional year of ownership, down to 14 percent for assets owned eight years or longer.
The proposal would reward long-term investors, making it less susceptible to criticism that it would reward Wall Street investors, some Democrats said. Mr. Ford said it would be far less costly than the Republican proposals, probably costing $10 billion over five years.
Like many Democrats, Mr. Ford said his thinking had been heavily influenced by what he had heard from owners of small businesses and farmers; many have complained that although they need the cash, they have been reluctant to sell their assets as they grew older because of the big tax bills they would face.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "AT A GLANCE: 4 Proposals for Changing Capital Gains"
 
CURRENT LAW -- The maximum rate is 28 percent for individuals. Taxpayers over 55 can get a onetime exclusion of gains up to $125,000 on the sale of a home. Individuals can get a 50 percent exclusion on the sale of certain investments in small businesses with assets of less than $50 million if the investments are held for at least five years.
 
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION -- Would retain 28 percent top rate. Would allow married taxpayers to exclude up to $500,000 in profits on the sale of a home ($250,000 for single taxpayers) with no age restriction. Would change the way profits on the sale of securities are calculated, effectively increasing the tax on many transactions, and would close a loophole used by big investors to avoid capital gains taxes.
 
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP -- Would reduce maximum rate for individuals to 19.8 percent and would allow investors to factor out the effects of inflation in calculating the gain on assets owned for three years or more. Would reduce the maximum rate for gains on investment in many small businesses to 14 percent.
 
SENATOR TOM DASCHLE -- Democrat of South Dakota. Would keep 28 percent top rate. Would allow exclusion of up to $500,000 profit on sale of home for married taxpayers ($250,000 for single taxpayers). Would double, to $100 million, the asset size of a small business that would qualify for the current 50 percent exclusion.
 
SENATOR WENDELL H. FORD -- Democrat of Kentucky. Would reduce top rate on a sliding scale based on how long an asset was held. After two years, the top rate would drop to 26 percent, and it would drop two percentage points for each additional year of ownership. The scale would bottom out at 14 percent for assets held eight years or more. The plan would not distinguish between types of assets but would reward longer-term investment.

HEADLINE: China's Rulers Face Key Test: Power of Army

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 22

 BODY:
On the seventh day after he took up the title of Commander in Chief of China's armed forces in November 1989, President Jiang Zemin went to the far western province of Xinjiang to inspect a frigid frontier post. He demanded to know why the soldiers were sleeping with only one blanket. "Aren't they cold at night?" he asked.
There in the barracks, like George Washington looking after the men of Valley Forge, he admonished the officers, "Our cadres must care for each and every soldier and be concerned with their welfare." 
 Every few months over the last five years, China's state-run propaganda apparatus has added a new page to the legend of Mr. Jiang's "paternal care" for China's soldiers. Once, when 1,000 sailors lined up for review on the deck of a ship in the scorching sun, Mr. Jiang was reported to have seen the sweat running down their faces and "quickened his steps" so they could stand down. And in 1995, he climbed 77 stairs -- someone actually counted them -- to meet sentries on the Russian border, even though it was raining and his clothes were soaked through.
For more than 47 years after the Communists came to power in 1949, China had been governed by men who had been military and political commanders. But unlike Mao and Deng Xiaoping before him, Mr. Jiang has no military background, he did not fight in the Communist revolution and he has never worn the uniform of the People's Liberation Army, which remains the most powerful and enduring institution.
Of all the issues facing China's younger leaders after the death of Mr. Deng on Wednesday, none are more critical than political control over China's vast military, whose scientists gave China the atomic bomb and whose soldiers defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and fought the United States to a standstill on the Korean Peninsula. Today, the military has its own representative at the inner sanctum of the ruling Politburo and takes part in all important political and foreign-policy decisions.
Thus, Mr. Jiang's success in becoming the pre-eminent leader in the coming years hinges on his ability to dominate this all-important institution. It is not yet clear that he can.
Despite the extensive image-building that Mr. Jiang's publicists have salted through the Chinese press organizations in recent years, there remain fundamental concerns among Chinese and Western officials about whether Mr. Jiang will be able to withstand rising pressure to finance ever-larger military budgets even while the civilian economy is straining for budget resources. And there are concerns whether he can walk China back from the aggressive posture it took toward Taiwan in 1995-96 in advance of the island's first direct presidential election.
And most important, if Mr. Jiang proves unable to match Mr. Deng's success in charting a course of growth and prosperity for the Chinese people, he risks internal deadlock and civil strife that could prompt a military intervention into China's internal politics and threaten his political survival.

Military's Status As Final Arbiter
 It would not be the first time the military stepped in.
In 1971, Mao's most favored military leader, Lin Biao, drew the armed forces into a failed plot to overthrow Mao's rule. In 1976, after Mao's death, the military conspired with Mao's palace guards to arrest the so-called Gang of Four, including Mao's wife, to end an era of radical politics. Mr. Deng was rescued from house arrest by Marshal Ye Jianying in early 1977 and, in 1989, he summoned the military to crush the pro-democracy revolt centered at Tiananmen Square, thus saving civilian leaders from an incipient rebellion.
"In the end, you have to say that the Chinese military is the final arbiter of Chinese politics," said David M. Lampton, a China scholar who frequently accompanies American military and civilian leaders to China as director of the National Council of United States-China Relations.
When Mr. Deng died last week, he bequeathed to Mr. Jiang unrivaled control of the world's largest standing army, whose antiquated weapons and equipment are in the midst of a costly modernization and whose nuclear arsenal is the size of France's.
Former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger, who held discussions with Chinese military leaders last fall, said Mr. Jiang "can never satisfy the demand" in the military for "more rapid modernization" and will have to struggle to balance the pressure from his uniformed chiefs with countervailing pressures from provincial leaders to concentrate on developing the civilian economy, which was Mr. Deng's priority.
Some of the more nationalistic military leaders he must control would like to disrupt the structure of security alliances that the United States erected in the Pacific, particularly with Japan and South Korea, during the cold war. Among many of these officers, "There is a certain sense that he is not a national leader, or that he has no presence as a national leader," as one longtime military observer here put it.
But intervention is not a role that the Chinese military relishes, Mr. Lampton said.
Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in California, said, "If you look back at history, every time the military leaders let themselves get sucked in, they got burned, whether it was with Lin Biao or at Tiananmen."
"I think that most of their senior officers would rather be pliant servants of the state or exercising authority in their own domain," he said, "instead of being the fundamental broker" of power and policy.
Mr. Pollack's remarks reflect a broad assessment today of China's military leaders, and their relationship to the new generation of post-Deng leaders. "Jiang Zemin will not be subject to a major challenge provided there is no major screw up," said Mr. Pollack, "but if something goes awry, that's where he will be subject to political challenge and the situation will become more complex. The tradition of the P.L.A. is that they get involved when things go awry, and that means they play a role that others can't and so their intervention can only severely diminish Jiang's authority."

Plans to Ease Out Two Old Warriors
 For this reason, perhaps, Mr. Jiang has seemed anxious to make over the top of the military.
He has spent more time inspecting troops in the field and pinning medals on generals than any of his predecessors, and he has purged or retired all of the top officers who were appointed by his rivals, the former President Yang Shangkun and his half-brother Yang Baibing, who were forced out of their military leadership posts by Mr. Deng in 1992.
Mr. Jiang's officer corps is characterized by younger, more professional military technocrats. But to more fully consolidate his power, Mr. Jiang must secure the retirement of the two most senior military men Mr. Deng put in place five years ago, Adm. Liu Huaqing, 80, and Gen. Zhang Zhen, 82, who serve as the principal vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission that Mr. Jiang chairs.
In Chinese culture and that of the Communist Party, they are elders to Mr. Jiang and their seniority of service to the Communist cause puts them in a position to criticize him in ways that military leaders contemporary to Mr. Jiang might not.
"Jiang does not want strong military leaders who would be inclined to step in quickly if he is having trouble," said Michael D. Swaine, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific policy at the Rand Corporation.
By all accounts, Mr. Jiang, 70, would like to replace the older pair with Gen. Zhang Wannian, 68, and Defense Minister Chi Haotian, 68. One test of Mr. Jiang's influence over the military will be whether he can force the retirement of the older men this fall at the 15th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
"He has made good progress with the military," a military analyst here said of Mr. Jiang. "But I would not say they are loyal to him to the point that they would stand in front of him and take a bullet."
Mr. Swaine of Rand said, "He does not have the kind of close personal relationship with a large number of military officers to the point where they have confidence that he will make the right decision in each instance as they had with Deng."
June Teufel Dreyer, an expert on Chinese military affairs at the University of Miami, was more blunt. "He's just not Deng," she said, "he does not command the same kind of respect and he is not a hero of the revolution."
For now, there seems no question that Mr. Jiang is firmly in command of the country and has the support of the Chinese military leadership. But any number of challenges could test his ability to hang on to the military's loyalty.
Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty in July and pro-democracy forces there are determined to test the boundaries of their freedom and the meaning of "one country, two systems" -- a formula for some local autonomy -- promised by Mr. Deng. Any civil disturbance that grows beyond the capacity of the Hong Kong Police to manage could force Mr. Jiang to invoke martial-law powers and risk the kind of bloodshed that devastated China's image at Tiananmen Square.

A Bellicose Stance On Fate of Taiwan
 And after Hong Kong's return, another crisis over Taiwan looms. Beijing has warned that sometime after the Portuguese colony of Macao is returned to China in 1999, reunification with Taiwan is a "programmatic" priority, a word that many analysts have interpreted as a threat to set a deadline for reunification if President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan does not begin a serious political dialogue to reunite what Beijing views as a renegade province with the mainland under a "one country, two systems" formula.
Though Mr. Jiang and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen appear to have calmed the waters over Taiwan after supporting a campaign of military intimidation, some military leaders are still taking a bellicose line.
"We told our American friends that we are not Saddam Hussein," a senior Chinese military officer said in a recent interview. "But if Taiwan became independent, we simply would have no room to back off and would resort to military force regardless of whether the United States interfered. If the Americans did not come, we would do it. If the Americans came, we would do it."
Mr. Lampton said the actions of Taiwan's leader also represent a wild card. "If Lee Teng-hui begins to take steps that are very disturbing" to the Chinese military, "those actions will strengthen the military more rapidly" and add to the pressure on Mr. Jiang to take decisive action that could risk another military crisis -- and his rule.
In the meantime, Mr. Schlesinger said: "China's military leaders are going to be interested in anything that affects the strength and status of China and on that they are going to have considerable voice, and the Taiwan question in particular has got to be handled with great delicacy. The name of the game for policy-makers on both sides is to continue to defer that question."
Mr. Lampton said he was certain that Mr. Jiang would like to.
"I see him as more reactive," he said, in trying to explain how Mr. Jiang might handle a showdown with the military.
"Like Deng, he is basically committed to an open economic and reform policy. He prefers better relations with the United States rather than worse. He prefers Taiwan on the back burner rather than on the front burner. But in the end, he is going to pursue a course that will lead to his survival."

HEADLINE: Average Russian Still Fears a Wider NATO

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Strobe Talbott's arguments are unlikely to allay Russian fears of NATO expansion ("Russia Has Nothing to Fear," Op-Ed, Feb. 18). 
 If the Clinton Administration's real reason for pursuing NATO expansion were to shore up the Central European economies and encourage democratization, it would be pressuring Western Europe to admit the former East Bloc countries into the European Union. Through trade, lowering of tariffs and integration of economies, the goals Mr. Talbott claims to seek would be attained.
Why do the United States and its European allies not use the E.U. as a training ground in which the newly democratic countries might demonstrate their commitment to free-market institutions? This would help soothe Russian apprehensions. A swift expansion of a military alliance right up to Russian borders will not.

HEADLINE: Average Russian Still Fears a Wider NATO;
Russian Self-Reliance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In regard to Thomas L. Friedman's Feb. 16 column, "Europe's Wild Ride": 
 The argument that NATO expansion will offend Russians and therefore we shouldn't provoke them sounds like appeasement of a misguided kind. A strong but nonaggressive NATO might even help Russia to set its priorities straight, and remind it that it shouldn't even think about following its traditional pattern of expanding to incorporate wealth rather than facing the hard questions of how to build economically on its own. Supporting real democracies in the neighborhood would also send the right message and provide the best example.
There seems to be ample good will toward Russia in the United States, despite its totalitarian past, and thus a good basis on which to build a foreign relationship. But we should not forget and fall back into naive patterns of appeasing the bully.
Just as after World War II we supported both Germany and Israel and worked to overcome the gulf by helping provide each what was necessary, Israel its identity and security and Germany its economic well-being, we should help mend wounds after the cold war by assuring Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic their security, and help Russia toward economic self-reliance and democracy within a free and friendly world.

HEADLINE: Don't Remember Deng as Capitalist Apologist

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 20 front-page headline announcing the death of Deng Xiaoping suggested that the Chinese leader "chose capitalism." First, there was no choice. Market reform was forced upon China's leadership as the only means to escape an increasingly stagnant economy. Second, Mr. Deng's insistence upon the development of "Socialism with Chinese characteristics" hardly makes him a harbinger of capitalism. 
 Whatever is said of him, he would not wish to be remembered as a capitalist apologist. Deng Xiaoping shared a deep distrust of private property with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

HEADLINE: Even in Winter, The Market for Summer Rentals Is Hot

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THE cellular phone rang in Sonnie Hall's silver blue Ford sedan -- again. "What now?" she said, as she picked it up. "So how many of them are there?" she asked. "They didn't have an appointment and I can't see them today. I'm totally booked." She paused. "So what weeks do they want?" She listened. "Aug. 2 to Aug. 16 is gone. If they'll do July 12 to 26 there's a few openings; if they leave a name and number I'll get a fax out Monday."
Ms. Hall, a tall woman with streaky blond hair tied with an elaborate ribbon, turned to her passenger. "I hate to say we have nothing," the rental agent whispered in her baby-soft voice. "If they're willing to be flexible, they might get something." 
 Such is the life of a rental agent on much of Cape Cod these days. Ms. Hall works in Chatham, Mass., at the point unglamorously known as the elbow of the Cape, before the Jeeps and beach wagons swing north and head for Provincetown. In Chatham, where residents prefer the appellation "the Nantucket of Cape Cod," Ms. Hall estimates about 80 percent of her August rentals are gone, with slightly more available for July. In Osterville, another desirable village even closer to New York and Boston, Robert Kinlin, of Kinlin Grover Real Estate, gives the same estimate -- 80 percent -- but said that estimate extends across all the summer season.
In the Hamptons, brokers say that the season started earlier than ever before and that, as Alex Kulch of Sotheby's said, "most of the great stuff is gone." Because of this year's mild weather, the strengthening economy, the hot sales market and other factors, rental agents on the Cape, in the Hamptons and in parts of the Jersey Shore say the rental business is the best it has been since the late 80's -- not only for volume, but for prices -- up at least 10 percent and in a few cases, nearing 25 percent higher than just a year ago.
In Ocean City, N.J., where a white stuccoed cube-shaped house with four bedrooms on the beach rents for $5,000 a week, John Andrews at Berger Realty, the town's largest rental agency, said things were humming: "We're already 30 percent ahead of last year." Prices are up, too, he said, maybe as much as 20 percent. Besides the generally benign economy, he attributed the rises to local circumstances: "Our beaches are a lot cleaner than they have been in the past and word is getting around." Companies once "dumped things in the water," he said, "and they washed up on the beaches."
Chip Collins, general manager of Berger and last year's president of the Ocean City Board of Realtors, said the publicity that attracts people to Atlantic City casinos -- only 10 miles away -- helps to bring people to the Jersey Shore. Places like Ocean City are family-oriented, he said, "but one member of the family might break away for a day at the casino."
To take advantage of the tourist renaissance, the towns have responded. In Ocean City during the summer, Mr. Andrews said, the town fathers and mothers hold baby parades, a "Night in Venice" when yachtsmen decorate their boats, kite flying contests, sand sculpture competitions and Pamper Scampers, an infants' race -- all of which have helped make the town a magnet for renters.
In Cape May, the Victorian-era resort that has kept a remarkable proportion of its gingerbread architecture, large five- to seven-bedroom houses like the mansion-sized "cottage" at 1 Jefferson Street rent for $3,000 a week. "I wish we had a couple dozen more," said Bill Bezaire, co-owner of Coldwell Banker Sol Needles Real Estate. The big houses are 90 percent booked, he said, whereas the smaller places are 50 to 60 percent booked. Prices are up only about 3 to 5 percent over last year, he said. "But last year was a banner year, so I guess that means we're headed for our best year ever."
Yet the picture is not exactly the same in other places. In the Berkshires, agents say there are lots of places left -- including a converted cobbler's shop in the historic village of Interlaken. According to the rental sheet issued by Wheeler and Taylor Real Estate in Great Barrington, Mass., the "shop" has three bedrooms, a bath and a compact kitchen; it is "charming" and "cheerful" and "close to Tanglewood." It rents for $5,000 from Memorial Day to Oct. 1. One of the priciest rentals, an estate with extensive grounds, a pool and an antique farmhouse "with wonderful faux finishes," rents for $30,000 for the season.
Along the New Hampshire coastline, "from Seabrook to Portsmouth," Jim Mills, president of the Seacoast Board of Realtors, said that while the season started earlier than ever this year, prices are about the same as they were last year. And in Old Saybrook, Conn., the shore town where Katharine Hepburn keeps a rambling shingled summer waterfront cottage, the manager at William Raveis Real Estate said he hadn't even received any rental listings yet. "They start coming in around the end of March, early April," said Todd Skeirik of Raveis. "We have a whole different pace here."
Along the Connecticut shore, rentals often come in two varieties: very cheap and very expensive.
"This isn't a big rental area," said Mr. Skeirik. "We get a bunch of $600 or $700 a week places, and then we've got one that rents for $20,000 the season," he said.
"We've got nothing in Fenwick," he added, naming the section of Saybrook where Ms. Hepburn lives. "A lot of people around here just aren't interested in renting." Pat Jones, who helps run the Madison, Conn., company that bears her name, said she handled only a few rentals -- and those people would rather keep the fact that they rent out their house unpublished.
ON the northernmost tip of Cape Cod, an agent at Jack Kelly's Pied Piper Real Estate in Provincetown said that things were moving faster than last year, but that no more than 20 percent of their listings were taken. And in Provincetown, $1,500 a week will still pay for a 3-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath condominium in a romantic shingled house on a quiet lane, a two-minute walk to the bay and a 15-minute walk to the ocean beach.
The house, on Point Street, is in the West End near the concentration of art galleries just off Commercial Street, the town's main strip. The house bears a distinctive blue plaque with the symbol for a wave. "It's one of the floaters," explained Dominick Rizzo, one of the town's many agents. "It was floated over from the spit of land where the Long Point Lighthouse still stands 100 or so years ago." The apartment is on the second floor of the old house, with peaked ceilings, skylights and views of the garden.
The biggest surprise may be on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, where prices of summer rentals seem to have stayed pretty much the same as last year -- with a few notable exceptions at the top end. Or, as Curtis Barnes of Nantucket Real Estate puts it, "Rental prices are very stable this year." On the Vineyard, at Flanders Real Estate, an old-line firm, Abigail Howland, a rental agent, said that "things are pretty much the same as last year: we're just plugging along."
The reports are surprising because the sales market, particularly on Nantucket, is soaring; a survey of properties that were for sale two years ago, versus similar properties sold within the last two months, shows that sales prices have actually doubled in many cases.
"People are buying and paying unheard-of figures," said Deborah Killen of Killen Real Estate, which has been renting houses on Nantucket for 35 years.. "But people are buying these huge houses to have, to use, maybe to rent out for some of the summer -- but not as a short-term investment."
One gray-shingled house for rent on Orange Street near the center of town was totally redesigned by the architect Hugh Newell Jacobson and was featured in a national home style magazine several years ago: The floors are pickled, the antique paneled doors are painted glossy white on one side and left with the original mottled paint on the other side. The decor is spare and elegant and pristine. There is a handsome brick patio in the back, with dark green lawn furniture.
The last part of August is taken, but July and the early part of August are still available, according to Ms. Killen. The rent is $2,800 a week in July and $3,000 a week in August -- about the same as last year. Houses of similar size, age and condition -- without Mr. Jacobson's touches, of course -- are priced from $950,000 to $1.2 million, according to a survey of a half dozen color brochures issued by realtors on the island.
Although rentals tend to be moving at a faster pace on the lower part of Cape Cod, buyers there are also paying more than they have in years, and they are not buying with an eye to making money on rent. "These are not investors," said Mr. Kinlin.
"Someone would have to pay $1.95 million for this kind of waterfront house," he said, walking around a massive gray 1920's summer house overlooking the Oyster Harbor in Osterville. "And he's using it himself in August. He'll rent it out in July for $25,000. But if someone comes in and offers $20,000 or $22,000, he won't bother leasing it. He won't dicker. The price is the price; it's the principle of the whole thing."
In the Hamptons, according to agents, rentals are red hot -- like the small carriage house a block off Main Street in Southampton. It's like a doll's house; a privet hedge, a rose arbor and an ivy-covered tree serve to frame the entrance; the roof has a saucy peak, a chimney and just below the peak, a small-paned arched window. It has a little bedroom and bath downstairs and a little loft upstairs. It rents for $15,000 for the season -- and it's already rented, to a "professional woman from the city; she likes it so much it's her third year," according to Mr. Kulch of Sotheby's, who handles both rentals and sales in the area.
Then there is the rather nondescript rambling gray ranch with sliding glass doors and one of the finest locations: at the end of a cul-de-sac in Water Mill, on a point of land abutted on one side by Mecox Bay, on the other by Burnett Creek, and looking south to the ocean. As if the site weren't enough, it is further distinguished by an expansive Japanese-style garden, with low-slung spreading junipers, wine red in winter, and crushed rock, and a small concrete pagoda surrounded by tufts of yellow Japanese grasses. The house is no longer available for July, but the month of August is still open, for $40,000.
"Especially over the last year, rental prices have really jumped," said Mr. Kulch. "Perhaps 10 to 20 percent, and some even higher.
"You'd think there'd be some resistance -- and there is," he continued. "The tenants are savvy, and they remember the prices -- to a remarkable degree. Some should be brokers! But it's the result of a sustained economy, and people are still willing to come out. They may not be happy, but the demand is as strong as ever, and the inventory is less."
Mr. Kulch compared the Hamptons to a number of other summer destinations. "If you take a place like Northeast Harbor, Me., well, there's different people there. The Hamptons is New York-oriented, overwhelmingly so; people in business, in the arts. They may try Maine, they may try Nantucket. If they're trying to get to a business meeting and they're fogged in a few times, they'll come back here.
"Here, in a sense, they spend time networking," he explained. "It's more of a continuation of their life style; they like to do business when they get together. They entertain a lot: parties, parties, parties. They've always had a lot of private parties out here, but now the benefit parties are multiplying geometrically. On any one weekend, one can't even count them and they're not inexpensive: $50 to $250; it's a recent phenomenon."
Mr. Kulch is right. The crowd is different in other places, according to the brokers.
OSTERVILLE, near the beginning of the Cape, is an old summer resort still inhabited by old money. "The Mellon family owns a lot of Oyster Harbor, and there's the Du Ponts; years ago, the Singer family," said Mr. Kinlin. "There were a number of stockbrokers who came here in the late 1800's and built massive homes on the water. There were a lot of people from Pittsburgh."
The people who summer in Osterville -- where houses rent for up to $25,000 a month -- are different from the people who rent in nearby Centreville, where there are still many expensive properties but there are less expensive ones as well. "Centreville is more casual," he said.
Pressed to describe the differences on a superficial plane, Mr. Kinlin laughed.
"The people who rent in Centreville are into cutoffs, boat shoes and T-shirts," he said gamely. "In Osterville, it's the country club-beach club-Wianno sailing crew look. Golf attire: navy blue blazer, Lacoste shirt, country club cocktail crowd."
In Osterville, there is currently another beach cottage, gray shingles with yellow trim, on Seaside Avenue, where the owners let prospective tenants in to view the property only a few times each year. "The couple that own this house are very, very particular," said Mr. Kinlin. "It worked out well for this year, because the people who've rented it for the season were able to see it last fall, and they took it." The rent, he said, "is between $50,000 and $60,000 for the season."
The market for both rentals and sales began to come back about three years ago, according to several brokers in the Osterville-Hyannisport area, who said that aside from a few extra-special properties, sale prices are still about 60 percent what they were in the height of the mid to late 80's.
To cope with the increasing demand for rentals, Mr. Kinlin created a rental division just over a year ago. In Osterville and Hyannisport, a midsized rental in the town averages $4,000 to $5,000 a month. For the campier, beachier small houses in Centreville, like the Craig-Tide cottages across from Craigville Beach, the price goes by the week: $800 to $1,200.
In Chatham and Orleans, further up the Cape, rental prices are generally cheaper, with houses in Chatham going for more money than in nearby Orleans.
"This is only $2,000 a week," said Ms. Hall, who works for John C. Ricotta and Associates in Chatham, driving in the driveway of a sprawling five-bedroom house -- complete with covered patio and copper-toned kitchen appliances -- overlooking Pleasant Bay in Orleans, with a magnificent lawn leading to a wooden stairway to the sandy beach. "If this was in Chatham, it'd be $3,500 a week."
The difference?
"In Orleans, they can't walk to town, and there isn't an ocean beach," she said. "Lighthouse Beach in Chatham is famous."
Ms. Hall and the other agents around the region all stressed that they interviewed all prospective tenants. One hapless family grilled by the agent said they had rented in Chatham before, but had rented privately, directly through the owners. "That's too bad," she said. "Then you don't have any references from any other realtors; that could hurt you." (But by the end of the day, she had managed to set up one appointment for them, anyway -- after they mentioned they knew several people Ms. Hall knew.) Even with the big houses, Ms. Hall said she liked to see "related people" for house shares.
In the Hamptons, too, rental agents and the house owners they represent like to see families rather than a bunch of unrelated men or women out for a good time.
But when the rents are as high as they are in the Hamptons -- a fragile-looking three bedroom postmodern effort on stilts goes for $71,500 for the season; a grand mansion in Wainscott for $500,000 -- it gets harder to screen everyone who shows up once the place is rented.
NOT that there is likely to be much of a problem when -- and if -- somebody lays out half a million for a summer rental. But for the cheaper rentals, which can still start at $12,000 or $15,000 a summer, the landlords are becoming increasingly wary, according to the Sotheby's broker.
"Last summer, there were suits brought for misrepresentation," he said. "In one cul-de-sac there were at least two houses that became full-fledged group houses: real Animal Houses; way stations for refugees. And we've had cases of laying out the mattresses for 15 to 20 people.
"Now, the owners are banding together," Mr. Kulch said, "putting money together to combat it, for legal actions. Imagine if you spent $40,000 or $50,000 a season for your family and you had to be subjected to that! This is something that will have to be addressed more as time goes on."
For Mr. Kinlin on Cape Cod, there are other problems with rentals.
"Rentals are a necessary evil," he said, detailing the amount of work attached to handling rental business -- the daily telephone calls from tenants angry about broken refrigerators, about broken air-conditioning -- then the angry calls when owners come home and think the renters did not maintain the house properly.
"We clearly make our money by selling houses, but rentals are a way to service future clients," the broker said. "obviously, we hope someone who rents will sometime turn into a buyer. But there's a fine line as these things need to be addressed, with the owner on one side and the tenant on the other. We've also got to please the owner, who's saying, 'Hey, I'm getting a little tired of these phone calls.' You walk a very fine line."

HEADLINE: Prime Time;
The Communist Dynasty Had Its Run. Now What?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

 BODY:
WHEN Deng Xiaoping visited the United States in 1979, the actress Shirley MacLaine told him how impressed she had been on a visit to China during the Cultural Revolution, when Mr. Deng and countless others had been forced to toil in remote areas and "learn from the peasants." The actress said she had been particularly moved by a scholar working in a field, who had described how much more fulfilling it was to grow tomatoes than to work in a university.
Mr. Deng looked at her and said: "He lied." 
 It was Mr. Deng's genius to cut through the propaganda and chimera of Maoism, and thereby save Communism in China. His 18-year reign as Chinese Emperor was one of the greatest since the legendary Yellow Emperor who supposedly helped found the nation thousands of years ago, and he rescued the Communist Dynasty when it was tottering after Mao's death. But his own departure again leaves the dynasty in fragile shape.
The Communist Dynasty, founded by Mao in 1949, has today largely lost the "mandate of heaven" -- the moral authority and popular support or acquiescence -- that gives it legitimacy and enables it to rule. So China may now be approaching a transition not only of emperors but also of dynasties.
 
Possibilities Open
 This does not mean that anything much will happen immediately or even in the next few years. Still, Mr. Deng's death has created a tremendous range of possibilities, from a military coup at one extreme to evolution toward quasi-democracy on the other. So long as his heart beat, China was vaguely predictable, but now all kinds of things become conceivable.
One measure of the frailty of the Communist Dynasty is that the name already is a bit of a misnomer, for China is not a Communist country in any meaningful sense. It is run by a Communist Party, but the principles governing China are not Marxist-Leninist but Market-Leninist. In other words, China is a marriage of a market economy and Leninist dictatorial principles.
China's Communists today care not about Communism but about power. The bottom line is: We'll stay in power, and everything else is negotiable. There may be more Marxists in New York than in Beijing.
"By the end of his life, he saw clearly that it wasn't working" the widow of one of China's top leaders once confided. "But what could he do? Of course he couldn't admit it to anyone but me."
Mr. Deng's own youngest son, Deng Zhifang, demonstrates the path that the best and brightest are taking. An American-trained engineer, he worked for a state-owned company in the 1980's, answering his own telephone and riding a bicycle to work each day. Now he is a property magnate and international businessman based in China worth tens of millions of dollars. He makes decisions in the same way as any Hong Kong tycoon.
Deng Xiaoping effectively transformed China from an ultra-leftist country to an ultra-rightist country, and today the Communist Dynasty governs not by socialism but by something close to a dictionary definition of fascism. China's underlying dynamic, with its combination of vibrant free enterprise, state-owned companies and authoritarian political system, has little in common with Maoism but has great parallels with Franco's Spain or Park Chung Hee's South Korea or Pinochet's Chile.
This arrangement has given China tremendous vitality, but it has not done much for the longevity of the political system, and Mr. Deng's China may some day be remembered the way the world now looks back on Franco's Spain. The problem is that Market-Leninism seems to be an inherently unstable concept, for the market eats away at the Leninism.
It may seem odd to speak of China's leaders today as emperors, but that historical lens is probably the most useful in explaining their behavior. China's Communists initially rebelled against history, but they soon fell into traditional patterns, and Mr. Deng's role could not possibly be explained by his formal positions. At their peak he was Deputy Prime Minister, and for the last seven years he held no title loftier than Honorary Chairman of the China Bridge Association. In fact, of course, he was Emperor, and it was a title he could not have given up had he wanted to.
Throughout history, Chinese have noted a "dynastic cycle." The first emperor is a strong-willed general or peasant rebel who seizes power and imposes far-reaching changes, but he is followed by rulers who are steadily weaker. The dynasty's moral authority sags under the burden of taxes, corruption and ineptitude, and a new leader emerges to found a new dynasty.
 
A 'Melon-Head'
 Mao was a classic dynastic founder, and Mr. Deng was a strong ruler too. But Jiang Zemin, the stocky, bespectacled and totally uncharismatic "weather vane" whom Mr. Deng picked in 1989 to be the next emperor, is almost immediately recognizable as the kind of emperor who belongs at the tail end of a dynastic cycle -- if he becomes any kind of emperor at all.
Prime Minister Li Peng is even less the type to inspire the Mandate of Heaven. Intensely unpopular and widely ridiculed for his authoritarian and awkward style, denounced even by his mother, he is a lightning-rod for jokes about the regime. In one, a worker is arrested for shouting "Li Peng is a melon-head" and is sentenced to 20 years in prison -- 5 for counter-revolutionary crimes and 15 for revealing state secrets.
Mao was an avid reader of history and was acutely aware of the problem of the dynastic cycle. In July 1946, when he was still a gaunt guerrilla leader, he was visited by Huang Yanpei, a prominent scholar, who noted: "Dynasties begin with a surge of vigor, and then decay and disintegrate. Has the Communist Party found a way to break this vicious cycle?" Mao beamed: "We've found a way. It's called democracy."
Perhaps that would have worked, but Mao and Mr. Deng both refused to try real democracy (and, of course, Mao meant proletarian democracy rather than any kind of Western approach). It is a great pity, because in China the Communist Party was unusually compatible with democracy, for the simple reason that the party was much more popular with ordinary people than in most Communist countries. In Poland, the party would have lost a plebiscite. But in China, the Communist Party could have counted on the peasantry and perhaps won a free multi-party election. Even today, it perhaps could.
Mr. Deng had broad legitimacy, especially in the early 1980's, because of his decades organizing the Communist revolution and his later years freeing the economy. But Mr. Jiang lacks that kind of legitimacy, and there is no legitimating institution or mechanism, such as elections, to grant him that authority.
Among the greatest burdens for the Communist Dynasty in sustaining its legitimacy is the still-reverberating memory of the Tiananmen killings of 1989. It is a bit odd that the Communists should have caused the deaths of some 30 million peasants in the late 1950's and early 1960's, in a great Mao-made famine, and yet the killing of several hundred students should be a greater blot on the party's legitimacy. Yet one of the lessons of Chinese history is that a ruler can kill peasants to his heart's content, but tangles with students at his peril.
Even Mr. Deng's family members had their regrets about the Tiananmen killings, for his children told their friends that their father had nothing to do with the massacre. Few people believe that, and almost everyone expects China at some point to face the killings anew.
When Mr. Deng became Emperor, his approach was to try to evade his responsibility for the Cultural Revolution by pinning the blame on the "Gang of Four" and sending them to prison. In one sense it was ludicrous to say that those four hard-liners did everything. But as a political gesture it helped distance him and the Communist Party from the Cultural Revolution. Remembering that example, some new aspiring emperor might try making Mr. Li the scapegoat for Tiananmen.
So what will the next dynasty be like? The bleakest possibility is national fragmentation, even civil war, for that has occurred periodically in Chinese history. But that also seems an extremely remote possibility. In Tibet and Xinjiang, local people may mount insurrections against Chinese rule, but that is difficult to imagine in the main parts of China. The Cantonese in the south, who prospered in the Deng era, may complain all the time about the incompetent and corrupt weasels in the north, but it is almost unimaginable that they would shed their blood to prove the point.
 
Most Likely
 Another possibility is a military coup, for with Mr. Deng's passing it is now the People's Liberation Army that holds ultimate power. Often in developing countries the passing of a powerful leader has been followed by a coup, and Mr. Jiang seems very aware of the risks.
Yet another possibility, perhaps the most likely, is the kind of gradual evolution that occurred in Spain, South Korea and Chile. It may be slower yet, and there may even be new massacres ahead, but the "second revolution" that Mr. Deng instigated is creating the middle class and rising income and education levels that in other countries have been associated eventually with growing pluralism, tolerance and even democracy. China already has economic and cultural pluralism, and political pluralism may gradually emerge as well.
The dynasty most like the Communist one in Chinese history was the Qin, founded in 221 B.C. by a ruthless emperor much like Mao. The first Qin emperor unified China, created the Great Wall, and modernized the country in hundreds of ways, yet he also burned books and buried scholars alive. His dynasty was very short, expiring soon after his death, but it laid the basis for its successor, the Han Dynasty, a golden era of Chinese history. In the same way, the Communist Dynasty may be short-lived, for it has been unable to respond to the yearnings for political participation that its economic revolution engendered. Yet the Communist Dynasty has laid a framework -- by unifying the country, distributing land to the peasants, emancipating women, and educating the labor force -- for what could be an extraordinary dynasty in the years ahead.

An Original Man
 The Life and Times
 of Elijah Muhammad.
 By Claude Andrew Clegg 3d.
 Illustrated. 377 pp. New York:
 St. Martin's Press. $25.95. 
 I can think of no 20th-century leader with anything like the impact of Elijah Muhammad whose life has been so profoundly unexamined. Even as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, his closest disciples, have become part of the national debate and popular culture, Muhammad, the head of the Nation of Islam for nearly 50 years, has remained a shadowy figure, defined, if at all, by hearsay and propaganda. Yet this diminutive, frail, informally educated man built the Nation of Islam from a tiny fringe group into a multifaceted organization that became an important player in black America's spiritual, economic and political life. By the time of his death in 1975, Muhammad had in one way or another touched the lives of most black Americans and, less directly, most white ones, too. In "An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad," Claude Andrew Clegg 3d, a professor of history at North Carolina A&T State University, has brought Muhammad to light in a fluidly written biography rich with information, analysis and suspense.
Born Elijah Poole in Sandersville, Ga., in 1897, Muhammad was one of 13 children; his father was a sharecropper and Baptist preacher, his mother a domestic worker who "claimed to have had a vision that one day she would give birth to a male child of pre-eminent stature and importance." The first decade of Muhammad's life gave no indication of the prominence to come. But at 10, while working as a laborer, he saw the lynched body of a young man he knew. "The murder and the subdued reaction of the African-American community repulsed him," Mr. Clegg says. In 1923, married and with children, he moved himself and his family, including his parents and siblings, north to Detroit. Mr. Clegg draws a vivid picture of the personal and social pressures he encountered there -- from economic insecurity and pervasive racism to political disfranchisement. They eventually led the unemployed Muhammad to despair and liquor.
It was in Detroit in 1931 that he met W. D. Fard, a short, white-skinned man who identified himself as God and offered Elijah Poole a new name, a religion customized for black Americans and the seeds of what would become the Nation of Islam. Muhammad, Mr. Clegg writes, "was mesmerized by the ideas of the Muslim leader regarding the originality and superiority of blackness, moral living, proper dieting and the new world to come." In a seamless interweaving of history and biography, Mr. Clegg sets Muhammad's almost immediate conversion to Islam in the context of national politics, his own personal history and existing black political and religious organizations, including Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association.
The building of the Nation of Islam was a long process, one rife in the early years with internal dissension and persecution by local police, the F.B.I. and the Federal Government, which convicted Muhammad of draft evasion in 1942. Four years in prison "did more toward consolidating his authority over the Nation of Islam than a decade of bickering, purges and wandering could ever have done," Mr. Clegg writes. Settled in Chicago after his release in 1946, Muhammad demonstrated a brilliant ability to turn adversity into advantage. He won new converts by capitalizing on government repression, and made his study of prison farms and businesses the foundation for the Nation of Islam's economic empire in the 1950's. Mr. Clegg provides a critique of the Nation of Islam's theology, which celebrates blacks as the "original people" and condemns whites as "devils," but he also observes that what attracted thousands to the Nation of Islam was Muhammad's personality, his warmth, persuasiveness and paternalism.
By the 1960's, membership was estimated at anywhere from 5,000 to 250,000. Whatever the numbers, the Nation of Islam's influence was enormous. It operated dozens of temples, owned property worth millions of dollars, ran numerous businesses and published a national newspaper. Muhammad's call to black Americans to "Do Something for Self" and to disdain integration put the Nation of Islam in militant opposition to most civil rights organizations of the era and made its leader a powerful voice in local and national politics. It is a voice that, more than 20 years after Muhammad's death, is still heard, most notably at the 1995 Million Man March in Washington. "An Original Man" begins the work of telling us why.

HEADLINE: MAKING WELFARE WORK;
New and Improved? Not Quite

BYLINE: By Paul Offner; Paul Offner is the District of Columbia's Commissioner of Health Care Finance.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When President Clinton announced recently that welfare caseloads are down by 2.1 million from four years ago, he called it "the biggest drop in welfare rolls in history." The President pointed to the waivers he has granted to 43 states, making it easier for them to place welfare recipients in jobs and training programs. Republican leaders gave the credit to Governors like John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin.
But the impressive caseload reduction occurred under the old, discredited welfare law that Mr. Clinton and the Republicans have repealed. Neither party seemed interested in explaining why, if it was working so well, we had to scrap that system for an approach that will put millions of children at risk of becoming destitute. 
 The President's waivers may well have helped states move welfare recipients off the rolls. But the business cycle, historically, has been the primary influence on the number of welfare recipients. From 1989 to 1993, a period of rising unemployment, the welfare caseload grew from 10.8 million to 14 million. After that, unemployment declined, and by October 1996, the number of welfare recipients was down to 11.8 million. The system worked.
So why the need for such a drastic fix? The public seems to think that welfare dependence has been on the rise. It has not. Actually, a smaller proportion of the population is on the dole today compared with 25 years ago. From 1972 to 1989, about 4.8 percent received Aid to Families with Dependent Children. By 1993, about 5.4 percent did. Today, it's down to 4.6 percent.
Timing is everything in politics, and in this area, the conservatives have had all the luck. In 1988, a Democratic Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed, the Family Support Act, which encouraged modest state and Federal investments in job training, day care and other services welfare mothers need to become self-sufficient. Then the economy soured, caseloads started growing, and governors found their states short of money to invest in reform efforts. The Family Support Act did finance a number of experimental programs that increased employment, earnings and school attendance. But because of the economic downturn, welfare caseloads increased by 30 percent in the first four years. Obviously, the new law wasn't working, critics said.
Now the economy is strong, the number of welfare recipients is declining and already the new law looks like a success. But eventually the economy will weaken and more people will seek welfare. States will run out of money -- the law freezes Federal financing at earlier levels -- and will be unable to meet the law's ambitious work requirements.
The President, though, foresees only clear sailing. "Together, we can make the permanent underclass a thing of the past," he said. Yet there's little in the new law to help reverse the high levels of unemployment and out-of-wedlock births in poor urban neighborhoods. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson articulated a similar vision, saying the nation must make "a commitment to eradicate poverty." Unfortunately, Mr. Clinton is not likely to do any better than his predecessor.

HEADLINE: Woody and Buzz, The Untold Story;
Could Pixar Make It Without Disney?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
When Andrew Stanton graduated from the California Institute of the Arts in 1987, he expected to struggle to make ends meet as an animator. And his expectations proved accurate for years.
For Mr. Stanton, as for most young animators at the time, work was a succession of humdrum jobs, each lasting a month or two, doing sketches or cleanup chores on brief, animated sequences for commercials, cartoons and movie credits. He made about $20,000 a year, and lived in a rented house he shared with three other young men, just as he had as a student. 
 Today, the 31-year-old Mr. Stanton earns a six-figure salary and owns a spacious house in the wooded affluence of Marin County. He is regarded as a rising young talent in the suddenly hot field of animation -- a reversal of fortune that has made people like him millionaires in the last few years.
"Sure, it surprised me," he said. "I went from being nobody to being somebody awfully quickly."
So have many others amid the animation gold rush in Hollywood. As one of the main writers of "Toy Story," the hit animated film that his employer, Pixar Animation Studios, made with Disney, Mr. Stanton has done better than most. But his quick ascent into the higher-income brackets has been fairly typical among animators.
Salaries for experienced animators, writers, directors and producers have more than doubled in the last three years, estimates Nancy Newhouse, a Los Angeles attorney who represents animation professionals. Six-figure incomes are common, she says, and a handful of animation directors now make more than $1 million a year.
Skilled teams as well as individuals are much in demand. So Disney is moving to tighten its partnership with Pixar by giving the computer-animation studio a larger slice of the profits from future films. After the surprising success of "Toy Story," the first in a three-movie deal with Disney, Pixar's bargaining position has strengthened considerably.
Pixar has been negotiating to lift its share of profits from the movies it makes for Disney from the present 10 to 15 percent to roughly three times that level. Those negotiations are close to completion, say people familiar with the talks. An announcement of the sweetened terms for Pixar is expected early this week.
Disney has good reason to want to keep Pixar happy. The animation boom has been fueled by the rush of major Hollywood studios suddenly eager to make animated feature films. Twentieth Century Fox, a unit of the News Corporation; Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner; Dreamworks; Viacom; and Universal, a unit of Seagram, are making sizable investments to build up their animation efforts. Put simply, they are all chasing the Walt Disney Company and its revitalized animation studio.
Disney's blockbusters of the 1990's -- "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin," "Lion King" and "Toy Story" -- have firmly focused Hollywood's attention on both the popularity and the extraordinary economics of successful animated movies.
Animated movies can be enduring profit machines, generating earnings year after year. While a live-action movie that produces $200 million in profit is deemed an enormous success, "Toy Story," for example, is expected to generate total profits from the box office, videos, computer games and merchandising of nearly $400 million in the two years since its release in the 1995 holiday season. Some industry estimates have placed the total profits from "Lion King," released in 1994, as high as $1 billion.
The allure of animation is obvious, but the odds for the Disney imitators are long. "There is this rush into animation now, but it remains to be seen if anybody besides Disney can really succeed," said George Lucas, the director. "That talent machine hasn't been nurtured over the years, except at Disney."
If the others fail, it will not be for lack of ambition or funds. Or for lack of former Disney managers or artists, since the challenge to the Magic Kingdom is being led by its alumni -- most notably, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former Disney executive who guided the revival of Disney's animation unit until 1994, when he departed to become a founder of Dreamworks.
Pixar occupies an anonymous low brick building in an industrial park near the waterfront in Point Richmond, north of Berkeley. It is tiny compared with the big Hollywood studios, and it is certainly not a household name. Yet except for Disney, Pixar is the one studio that can claim to have produced an animation blockbuster. "Toy Story," the buddy film starring Woody the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear the spaceman, was the nation's leading box-office money maker in 1995.
Pixar is also a pioneer in the use of digital technology. Films that are entirely computer animated, like "Toy Story," have a three-dimensionality and detailing that is very different from the signature look of the hand-drawn animated features made since "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" in 1937.
Even the making of modern, predominantly hand-drawn animated films has been transformed by computer technology. The "extras" in crowds in the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" or the stampede of wildebeests in the "Lion King" were generated by computer animation. Today, much of the laborious painting and tracing, once done by hand, is done by computer. "It's like finding a magic pencil," Frank Thomas, an 84-year-old former Disney animator, said of the new technology. "So many of the things we used to sweat over, you don't have to do anymore."
Despite its encouraging start, both artistically and as a technology leader, Pixar illustrates the challenges of building an animation studio and an animation business. Its history goes back more than a decade, and its future is still uncertain.
In 1986, Steven P. Jobs purchased the computer graphics unit from George Lucas for less than $10 million. The group, known as Pixar, was a small team of computer scientists and film makers who were smitten with the notion of making computer- animated feature films.
Pixar's advanced computer graphics impressed Mr. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., who had been ousted from Apple in 1985. (In December, Mr. Jobs sold his software firm, Next Software Inc., to Apple and rejoined Apple as a part-time adviser; he insists, though, that he spends 80 percent of his time at Pixar.)
In the 1980's, Pixar's technology was far too primitive to make a full-length movie. So for years, Pixar tried to earn its way by selling computer work stations and software used for digitally enhancing images ranging from satellite photographs taken by intelligence agencies to hospital X-rays.
That business strategy was mostly a failure, and Pixar chewed up $50 million of Mr. Jobs's money. Yet all along, he financed a small, back-room group at Pixar that made a series of critically acclaimed computer-animated short films, like "Tin Toy," which won an Oscar in 1988. All of them were directed by John Lasseter, a former Disney animator, who also directed "Toy Story."
The short films, and Pixar's technology, attracted the attention of Disney, and the two companies began working together. In 1991, Disney seemed to throw the struggling start-up a lifeline, when Pixar signed its three-movie deal with Disney.
Still, for those familiar with the ways of Hollywood, a contract with Disney was one thing, but the sign that Pixar was really up and running as a studio came a year later when Disney gave its "green light," meaning investing real money to develop "Toy Story."
"As soon as we had the green light, people here bought houses and started families," said Mr. Stanton, a bearded young animator, who had joined Pixar in 1990. "Ben, my son, was born later that year."
These days, Pixar is hard at work on its second movie for Disney, code-named "Bugs," scheduled to be released for the 1998 holiday season. Story development on the third film, unnamed as yet, has begun. Mr. Stanton will be co-director of "Bugs," along with Mr. Lasseter. The images and story line of "Bugs" are guarded as closely as state secrets.
The hallways at Pixar are marked with blue plastic signs bearing names like Toy Boulevard and Scooter Run. In fact, the workers occasionally zip by on white scooters, equipped with bicycle bells. Animators and artists work in partitioned cubicles, each done up in a determinedly individualistic decor. Toys, old couches, lava lamps, Art Deco mirrors and Japanese screens are all in the mix, along with high-powered computer work stations. Someone's pet Dalmatian roams the place.
It is a setting self-consciously designed to nurture creativity. For while Woody the cowboy may be 52,865 lines of computer code, what makes the audience care about that digital image is the character and the story, painstakingly fashioned by screenwriters, animators and artists.
The fledgling studio is growing rapidly with a payroll of 300 people, twice the size of two years ago. Pixar recently reported impressive financial results for 1996, its first complete year as a public company. Revenues tripled to $38 million, as profits jumped sixteenfold to $25 million.
Still, investors are not yet impressed. Pixar shares soared when first offered to the public in November 1995, just after the release of "Toy Story," but its stock has dropped sharply since. The shares closed last week at $14.125, down from a close of $39 a share on its first day of trading, Nov. 29, 1995.
The early enthusiasm evaporated as investors focused on two things. First, Pixar's financial performance will be cyclical, rising with hit movies and falling until the next one. Second, under the current three-movie contract, Disney collects nearly all the profits from Pixar's movies.
According to the terms of the 1991 contract, Disney supplies financing, story advice, marketing and distribution for the films, while Pixar makes the films and CD-ROM's based on the movies. For its contribution, Pixar receives 10 to 15 percent of the total profits from the box office, video sales, computer games and merchandising revenues.
Looking at Pixar's share price, Mr. Jobs says investors are being short sighted. His company, he says, is building a long-term asset of considerable value. "It isn't going to happen with one film or two but we have a shot at building the second great animation studio after Disney," he said.
Besides, Mr. Jobs has tried to brighten Pixar's immediate prospects recently by trying to negotiate a better deal for Pixar. "Toy Story" has strengthened his hand. Initially, Disney thought of it as a niche film instead of the blockbuster it became. So Mr. Jobs has been pushing to get Pixar 30 to 40 percent of the profits from future films, and perhaps sweeten the current contract.
Pixar, in theory, could try to link up with another major studio to obtain the marketing and distribution muscle it could not muster on its own. But Mr. Jobs observed, "We love working with Disney."
For Disney, the Pixar connection has proved lucrative. And the entertainment conglomerate seems eager to tighten its links with the pioneering computer-animation studio when rivals, including Dreamworks, are working on computer-generated films.
A year before Pixar went public, Mr. Jobs did offer Disney a 10 percent stake, and Disney declined. "It's my one regret," said Peter Schneider, president of feature animation for Disney. "When we had an opportunity to buy a slice of Pixar, we should have."

Chart: "The $400 Million Man"
Whether digitally assembled or hand drawn, all animation starts with an artist's sketches and story boards. The similarities end there. Here is a look at the differences between Disney's traditional hand animation, like that used in the forthcoming movie, "Hercules," and the digital animation that Pixar used in "Toy Story," which is expected to generate $400 million in profits.
 
Framework
 
DIGITALLY
 
Millions of lines
Characters, like Woody, are translated from clay models into digitized ones -- made of millions of lines linked to make polygons.
 
MANUALLY
 
Hundreds of lines
All characters start with a rough pencil sketch by the lead animator. These are copied and refined by another artist. The most complex characters, like Hercules, are made up of hundreds of lines.
 
Color
 
DIGITALLY
 
Millions of colors
The computer has millions of colors available to it. Once the model is created, the surface is colored. The computer will adjust color for the light source, the light color, shadows and reflections on the object.
 
MANUALLY
 
Hundreds of colors
This is the only digital stage in Disney's animation process. Clean drawings are scanned into a computer and colored by artists, but the colors are largely determined by an art director.
 
Motion
 
DIGITALLY
 
Computerized motion
Key frames in a scene are built by an animator. Then a computer fills in the actions in between that will make the motion look fluid in the film.
 
MANUALLY
 
Hand-drawn motion
The lead animator for a scene draws the key frames, but one or two "in-betweeners" draw the steps that complete the fluid motion. The faster the motion in the scene, the more drawings the lead animator completes to get the subtleties just right.

HEADLINE: HOUSING PROJECTS IN NEW YORK CITY FACE BIG CHANGES

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Facing stiff reductions in Federal aid, the sprawling New York City Housing Authority is exploring what was once unthinkable: turning over some of its high-rise buildings to private managers and earning more money from all its projects by sharply increasing the number of tenants with jobs, who can pay more rent.
The authority, long the nation's largest and most successful public housing agency, says it has essentially concluded that it must abandon many of its long-held ideals if it is to survive in this new era of austerity as a provider of housing for those who cannot afford to buy or rent their own homes. 
 The authority is being forced to consider these proposals because of the major changes emanating from Washington, where the Republican majority in Congress is cutting housing subsidies even as it tries to spur local housing officials to adopt more market-driven policies by loosening rules that had restricted how they could spend Federal money.
"The status quo absolutely cannot be maintained," said John G. Martinez, a deputy general manager at the authority who is in charge of finding ways to revamp its operations.
While urban officials across the country have denounced the cuts in housing aid, some Republicans in Congress have countered that it is foolish for the Federal Government to continue pouring money into a system that they say has largely been a failure. Unlike the authority in New York City, many housing authorities across the country have been beset by mismanagement and corruption, and Federal officials in recent years have seized control of some, including those in Philadelphia and Chicago.
The Republicans say they want to reduce the housing subsidies to push the authorities to operate more efficiently. And they say that by relaxing many of the rules that have governed how much rent can be charged and how subsidies can be spent, Congress will give the authorities the freedom to flourish.
The reductions imposed by the Republicans in the last two years have so squeezed the New York City authority that earlier this month, officials announced that they would trim the authority's work force of 15,000 by at least 1,000 employees. Trying to avoid layoffs, the officials said they had reached a tentative agreement with municipal unions to offer workers who voluntarily leave a severance package.
But officials at the authority acknowledge that they need to do more than just cut staffing to compensate for the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal subsidies for its 331 housing projects. They say the authority will probably have to relinquish its role of being the housing provider of last resort for many of the poorest of the poor.
It may have to subcontract the job of operating its properties to nonprofit groups or private companies while also seeking to reap additional money from its buildings by leasing more space to commercial businesses. And while the authority's officials will not publicly discuss it, they say they will eventually have to examine selling some buildings, an idea long considered taboo.
The cuts in Federal subsidies come when there is already a severe shortage of housing for poor and working-class people in New York City. At least 130,000 people, for example, are on the waiting list for the authority's apartments. The authority, which houses 600,000 people, is also under pressure from the overhaul of the Federal welfare law last year, which could end up reducing the amount of money that some tenants receive to pay rent.
"For the Housing Authority to meet its public purpose and to be in a position to insure that it can provide safe and sanitary housing," Mr. Martinez said, "it is absolutely imperative that the authority look at a different way of doing business."
He stressed that the authority had not yet made any decisions on major policy shifts, adding that its board would begin mulling options in April.
Like New York City's, most other housing authorities, including those in Boston, Washington and Newark, are grappling with the same problems: how to cut costs and take in more revenue to make up for dwindling Federal money. The challenges are even greater for authorities that have been poorly run.
Many are scaling back renovations on aging buildings that were never particularly well maintained in the first place. They are forming partnerships with nonprofit groups, and they are re-examining one of the most sensitive subjects in public housing: what percentage of units should be set aside for poor people who have little means to pay.
By law and tradition, housing authorities have devoted most of their space to the poorest of the poor. Across the country, the percentage of tenants with jobs for most authorities is only about 15 to 20 percent. New York City's has one of the highest, at 30 percent -- one reason, housing experts say, that it has been relatively successful.
But with so many budget pressures, New York City's and other housing authorities say they want to move more people with jobs to the top of the waiting lists.
"We now have to say to some of those poor people, 'Sorry, we need to house more working people,' " said Sandra B. Henriquez, administrator of the Boston Housing Authority. "We have to worry about income."
Some tenant leaders said such changes might leave poor people with nowhere to go. And they said they were already seeing the effects of the cuts in Federal subsidies for renovating and running buildings. At the Drew-Hamilton Houses in Harlem, a tenant leader, Barbara G. Barber, said the authority had eliminated a custodian's job recently, leaving hallways dirtier and reducing pickups for garbage.
"These budget cuts are going to wipe out public housing if someone does not listen," Ms. Barber said. "This is going to be very devastating to residents."
The New York City authority, which is a quasi-independent agency that is controlled by the Mayor, pays for only about half of its costs from the rents it charges. The rest are covered by government subsidies, 90 percent of which come from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The New York City authority's annual HUD subsidy for renovations and repairs has dropped by more than 25 percent, from $435.1 million in 1994 to $320 million this year. The authority's HUD subsidy for operating costs has stayed largely flat in recent years, even as its expenses continue to grow. And city officials said they believed the cuts would get worse by the end of the decade.
Two of the leading Republicans in Washington on housing policy, Representatives Rick A. Lazio of Long Island and Jerry Lewis of California, said they realized that the reductions might be hard for the authorities to shoulder. But they said that with Congress trying to balance the Federal budget, housing agencies had to operate differently.
"The way the Federal Government goes about assisting communities with housing and other services is largely irrational," Mr. Lazio said. "It is based upon a model that is largely obsolete, especially considering the fiscal stresses that we are under."
The New York City Housing Authority has already experimented with turning over a few of its smallest buildings to nonprofit groups to manage. The question now is whether it can save money by letting such groups manage its many high-rise buildings, which are where the vast majority of its tenants live. Or, further down the line, whether it should sell some of the buildings to nonprofit groups or private companies.
Otherwise, if the subsidies continue to decline, the authority might have to focus its resources on keeping up the buildings that are in the best condition.
"The alternatives are to evaluate our projects and try to find alternative places for people and then raze those projects if they can't be maintained," said Roy Sinclair, chief financial officer at the authority.
The average rent in the authority's projects is just under $300 a month, officials said. For an apartment being rented for that amount, the authority currently receives a subsidy of about $300 a month from HUD, giving it a total income for the unit of nearly $600 a month.
For now at least, the authority must abide by a Federal rule that limits the tenant's rent to a maximum of 30 percent of the tenant's income. But if the authority rented the same space for which it had received a total of nearly $600 for a nonworking family instead to a working one, it might be able to charge that family more than $600. Such a move might be even more financially beneficial for the authority if its HUD subsidies continue to drop.
Mr. Martinez, the authority's deputy general manager, said its leaders understood that many tenants were fearful of this new era. He said that the authority would never force people out of their apartments and that by bringing in more working tenants and giving them the opportunity to choose which developments they can live in, it would create a better atmosphere in its properties.
"The major catalyst for all this is the impact of what we see happening at the Federal level in terms of reduction of subsidies," he said. "But the overriding concern is that we have a commitment to maintain the number of public housing units in the community, and to try to enhance a greater quality of life for people."

Fossils as the Focus of an Ethics Debate

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Tyrannosaurus rex is causing trouble again. Only this time, as tomorrow's offering from "Nova" explains, it is not as predator but as the object of conflicting affections.
"Curse of T. Rex" tells of a battle out West, the main source these days of dinosaur skeletons, over what the narrator calls "the finest specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex ever found." Skirmishing began in 1990 when commercial fossil hunters unearthed a remarkably preserved dinosaur, courteously named Sue for its discoverer, on a ranch on a Sioux reservation in South Dakota. 
 That set off a suit by the ranch owner against the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, the biggest fossil dealer in the world, which had paid him $5,000 for digging rights; claims by a Sioux tribal council that anything found on Indian land was Indian property; criminal charges by Federal agencies, and lamentations from museum and university paleontologists that commercial operators were getting in the way of scientific research.
All parties are heard from tomorrow night as the program digs into the issues. The entrepreneurs maintain they are serving science by locating remains that would otherwise go uncollected. One says, "The best way to insure the preservation of fossils is to collect them and to get as many people out there looking for these fossils as possible."
The paleontologists complain they are being priced out of some digs and warn that information is being lost because private companies, freelance poachers and black-market operators are too intent on making a quick profit from the remains to preserve clues that give the bones context and meaning. "Once we can't trust the data, we can't trust the science that comes from that data."
In the current climate of deregulation, the narrator notes, "Congress is more likely to open up Federal land to market-driven collecting than to toughen laws against it." The hour ends on an upbeat note with an example of cooperation between commercial collectors and researchers.
In the courts, the ranch owner emerged victorious: Summam rex, or, in roughly excavated Latin, king of the bottom line. As for Sue, you'll have an opportunity to take her home from Sotheby's in April. Her owner expects a bid of $1 million.

'Freeloaders'
ABC, tonight at 10
In tonight's ABC News special, John Stossel makes a case that everybody in America, poor, rich and middle, wants a handout. Panhandlers prefer to eat without having to work. Sports moguls get rich on public subsidies. Politicians and corporations collude to rip off the Treasury. The equal treatment of small fry and big cheeses is silly, and its resort to conservative economic theory is strained, but some points are scored.
Particular attention is given to Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Company, known for its political muscle, its illegal price-fixing and its uplifting commercials on the Sunday talk shows. Mr. Stossel suggests to Mr. Andreas, who gives millions to both political parties and benefits mightily from Government programs for which consumers pay, that he is a hog at the trough. Mr. Andreas grants that's one way to look at it.

HEADLINE: Free On-Line Time for a Price: Ads That Just Don't Go Away

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, when cyberspace was young, most on-line service providers charged their customers by the hour. These days, offering unlimited access for a set monthly price is practically a necessity for any consumer on-line business.
Now, a small but growing group of Internet access companies is taking the next step: doing away with monthly fees altogether while aiming to make money almost exclusively from advertising. 
 "It was bound to happen," said Evan Neufeld, an analyst in New York for Jupiter Communications, an on-line market research firm. "Internet service providers are not making money at $19.95 all-you-can-eat access, and it seems like prices are going to go down. Unless you're AT&T and can absorb huge losses, you have to look for other revenue streams."
At least three new on-line service providers are no longer charging monthly rates: Cyber Freeway (http://www.cyberfreeway.com/) and Bigger.net (http://www.bigger.net/), both based in San Jose, Calif. and serving the Bay Area, and Smart World Communications Inc. (http:// www.smart1.net/), based in Danbury, Conn., which is aiming to offer Internet access across the country.
Free advertiser-supported E-mail service is available from some other companies, including Juno Online Services L.P. (www.juno.com). Juno's president, Charles Ardai, said his company, based in New York, had more than 1.5 million customers.
But unlike Juno, the three newcomers are offering access to all facets of the Internet, including the World Wide Web.
Getting started on Smart World's system generally costs about $90 upfront, while Bigger.net, a unit of TGGH Inc., promotes itself as "the $59.95 lifetime Internet provider," charging that amount to begin service plus $10 a year to maintain an electronic mail account.
Cyber Freeway, which is being financed by the American subsidiary of Hyper Net Inc., a Japanese company, is now free of any charges for consumers, according to its general manager, Donald L. Tuttle. Mr. Tuttle said Cyber Freeway, which has attracted "a few thousand customers" since opening in December, would begin charging new subscribers a one-time $29.95 fee once the service attracts 20,000 users.
Steven B. Daum, chief executive of Smart World, which expects to have 1,500 high-speed telephone access lines available in 50 metropolitan markets by the end of this week, said, "The model simply is to get the same amount of revenue from the advertisers as we would get from subscribers."
But on-line industry analysts said bringing that model to profitability would not be simple. Bill Bass, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a market research firm based in Cambridge, Mass., expects on-line advertising spending to increase from an estimated $400 million this year to almost $5 billion in 2000. Nonetheless, he said: "That's a speck in the advertising universe, an insignificant speck. There just aren't enough advertising dollars out there to support everyone on-line."
Kate Delhagen, another Forrester analyst, is skeptical about the services' prospects for success. "I'm of the school of thought that you get what you pay for," she said, "and the reliability of these networks and service providers remains to be proven."
For now, Smart World's only advertising revenue comes from banners on its World Wide Web home page that disappear when a user begins surfing to other sites. Customers seem happy with that approach.
"I would not go any other way," said Thomas R. McDowell, an on-line consumer who is also a technical support representative for an AT&T subsidiary in Jacksonville, Fla. "You pay one time and that's it."
But Smart World is developing access software that will place advertisements on the user's computer screen for as long as the customer is on line, regardless of where they roam in cyberspace. Cyber Freeway already uses a similar program.
Contemplating that possibility, Mr. McDowell was less enthusiastic.
"I would not like that," he said. "I wouldn't want it to be always on the screen. That would be very obtrusive."

HEADLINE: Radcliffe Women, Once Docile, Prod Harvard Sharply on Equality of Sexes

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 23

 BODY:
The men at Harvard have always been educated to lead the world. Peggy Schmertzler recalls a different set of expectations for her and her classmates at Harvard's neighbor, Radcliffe, in the 1950's.
"I remember the deans' telling us an educated person made the best mother," recalled Mrs. Schmertzler, Class of '53. "She could sing French songs to her children." 
 On graduating with a history degree from one of the finest schools in the country, Mrs. Schmertzler promptly enrolled in a private summer secretarial school that was conveniently located on the Radcliffe campus. And, also as expected, she married a Harvard man.
Now Mrs. Schmertzler and a group of other Radcliffe women -- many of them having raised their children, survived divorce, carved out careers despite society's barriers, having been bolstered by the women's movement that most of them did not participate in at the time, having come of age, belatedly, in their 50's and 60's -- are turning their attention toward Cambridge.
Concerned about their grandchildren, who might one day attend the university, and about a younger generation of academic women, Mrs. Schmertzler and her classmates are challenging Harvard for the first time in their lives.
The university has changed dramatically since their day, when they lived in Radcliffe Yard but took classes at Harvard where the men outnumbered them 4 to 1. Radcliffe officially merged with Harvard in 1977, and today the dorms are coed, and women make up 44 percent of the undergraduate student body. But Mrs. Schmertzler and the other members of her group say more change is needed.
In the midst of Harvard's $2.1 billion capital fund-raising campaign, they have mounted an organized challenge to what they see as evidence of the university's persistent sexism: its unimpressive record of hiring tenured women as faculty members.
They have so far persuaded alumni to divert nearly $500,000 in gifts into a protest escrow account to try to force Harvard to act. And though the amount may be relatively small, Harvard is smarting at the unwelcome attention.
Neil L. Rudenstine, the university president, sent Mrs. Schmertzler a letter 10 days ago, stating his strong commitment to hiring more female faculty members, outlining the university's progress in that area and saying that he and others wished it could occur more rapidly.
The women of the 1950's are out of patience. "Harvard has been educating brilliant women for over 100 years," Mrs. Schmertzler said. "The women are available."
"Do it now, Harvard," she added. "If you think we're going to send our grandchildren here, we're not."
The women's transformation can be charted by their reunions. At first, they talked about their husbands and their children. At the 25th, the stars talked about their professional success. At the 30th, the subject was divorce, the deaths of parents, troubled children.
Finally, at the 35th reunion, the women were ready to look beyond themselves. They wanted to know what Harvard is for women today.
"Maybe it's because we had older daughters we were concerned that women had more opportunities," said Mrs. Schmertzler, who worked as a waitress and as a secretary before going back to college and becoming a job placement director for a nonprofit organization.
They learned that in 1988 women accounted for only 7 percent of the arts and sciences faculty. They formed the Committee for the Equality of Women at Harvard, with Mrs. Schmertzler its chairwoman.
Being Radcliffe women, they did their homework, thoroughly researching Harvard's record on women. Mrs. Schmertzler reported their findings at her 40th reunion, in 1993. "I felt I was going to be arrested," she said. "I had never asserted myself. And here I was going against Harvard."
Word of Mrs. Schmertzler's report spread to the Radcliffe Class of 1958, which was on campus for its 35th reunion. Many of its members joined the committee, including Ann R. Shapiro, who returned to college in her 40's and now is an English professor at the State University of New York in Farmingdale, and Millie Marnin, who earned her Ph.D. in economics from Northwestern University in 1966, becoming the first woman in the department in 30 years.
From another class, Lilli S. Hornig, who received a Ph.D. in chemistry from Harvard in 1950 despite the male professors who she said tried to discourage her, was a staff scientist at Los Alamos, N.M., in World War II and later helped found an organization at Wellesley College to improve opportunities for academic women, became the committee's research policy analyst.
Today, Mrs. Schmertzler says, the committee has nearly 2,000 alumni members, men as well as women.
The Radcliffe women have become advocates for a younger generation of academic women at Harvard. Because of the intensely political world of the university, many of those women say they do not feel free to speak out.
Mary Waters, a 39-year-old sociology professor, was willing to talk for the record. "They're incredibly courageous," she said of Mrs. Schmertzler's group. "These women are unique in their position in being able to speak up. They're not worried about their jobs or their future careers."
Prompted in part by the efforts of the committee, Seyla Benhabib, a professor of political theory and a former chairwoman of the arts and sciences faculty's Standing Committee on the Status of Women, said she and a small group of other senior faculty members were looking into ways that the atmosphere for female junior faculty members at Harvard could be improved and the ranks of tenured women increased.
The members of the committee acknowledge that Harvard had made progress. Today, of 418 senior faculty members of the faculty of arts and sciences, 48, or 11.5 percent, are women. From 1991 to 1996, the number of tenured women in the faculty of arts and sciences increased by 26 percent, to 48 from 38, while its tenured faculty as a whole grew by 6 percent, Mr. Rudenstine wrote in his letter.
Harvard's record is not unusual in the Ivy League. At Princeton, the rate of tenured women in the arts and sciences faculty is 14.7 percent; the rate at Yale is 11.5 percent.
Nationally, however, women hold 24.5 percent of tenured professorships in faculties of arts and sciences, the American Association of University Professors says.
Harvard officials argue that the university's record cannot be compared with other schools because, unlike the overwhelming majority of schools, it does not grant tenure to associate professors.
Mr. Rudenstine explained in his letter to Mrs. Schmertzler that while a "university-wide master plan" that would rapidly accelerate the number of women might be appealing, power over the recruitment and promotion of candidates remained within the individual departments of the university's nine faculties.
The women's movement was nowhere in sight when Mrs. Schmertzler and her classmates arrived at Radcliffe. And many of them were suspicious of the movement when it did begin.
"I was very fearful of being a feminist," said Mrs. Schmertzler, whose father, a prominent Baltimore doctor, believed college was wasted on his daughters. "I thought it was a dirty word. I fell for the myth. I prided myself on being reasonable and sensible."
Mrs. Schmertzler had been returning to Cambridge for her reunions since 1963, the class's 10th reunion. Recently divorced and with three young children, she attended only after a friend talked her into it. "I thought it would be too horrible," she said. "I was feeling disgraced.
"It was just God's gift," recalled Mrs. Schmertzler, who has since remarried. "There was this group of fabulous women. Nobody came with spouses, or with children. We were there as ourselves. Being with other women, just on our own, was a thrill."
Books like Marilyn French's "The Women's Room" provided yet more solace. "It was a revelation to find that I wasn't just isolated, and a misfit," Mrs. Schmertzler said.
She was talking at the Harvard Faculty Club the other day with Dr. Hornig and another committee member, Betsy Hatfield, Class of '53, who started out as a high school English teacher but is today a banker.
They were joined by one of their student supporters, 19-year-old Lamelle Rawlins. It is not only among the faculty where change occurs slowly: in December, Ms. Rawlins was elected the first female president of the Harvard undergraduate student body. For her, Ms. Rawlins said, the members of the committee are role models.

HEADLINE: A Differing View of the Spread of Technology

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Disputing earlier conclusions that the Information Revolution is bypassing much of rural America, a new study financed by the National Science Foundation argues that information technology is becoming more and more equally distributed across the country.
The new study takes issue with one released last fall by researchers at the Taub Urban Research Center of New York University. That study showed that 50 percent of all United States Internet host computers were in just five states: California, Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Virginia, and that 90 percent of all Internet host computers were in just 21 states, primarily on the East and West Coasts and in a Midwest belt. 
 But Shane Greenstein, an economist at the Institute for Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois and one of the authors of the new report, criticized the Taub report for focusing on the Internet at only a single snapshot in time.
The new study, which will be published as a report of the National Bureau of Economic Research, purports to show a broader picture of communications and computer technologies and indicates that between the mid-1980's and early 1990's, such advanced technology became more equally distributed across the United States.
"The Cassandras are definitely wrong," Mr. Greenstein said. "Communication and computer technologies are becoming more geographically diffused."
The data are significant, the researchers said, because if private investment in advanced networks is quickly reaching most of America, there will be less need for Government intervention with public investment.
The report, "The Evolution of Advanced Large-Scale Information Infrastructure in the United States," was also written by Mercedes M. Lizardo, a researcher in the department of economics at the University of Illinois, and by Pablo Spiller, an economist at the Walter A. Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley.
The study relied on data, collected between 1986 and 1992, on the deployment of fiber optic communication networks and the installation of large business computers. The data were originally gathered by the Federal Communications Commission and by Computer Intelligence Infocorp, a market research firm based in La Jolla, Calif.
The deployment of fiber optic network connections is a good indicator of the availability of a wide range of advanced data and voice communications services, the researchers noted.
The data, which show the number of miles of fiber optic cable deployed in each region of the country and computer capacity measured in terms of MIPS, or millions of instructions per second, indicate that computer and communications capacities have increasingly become more evenly distributed.
Mr. Greenstein said fiber optic mileage in the United States jumped from 265,472 to 6,316,436 miles during the period of the study. Over the same six years, national computing capacity expanded from 112,000 to 553,231 MIPS.
In addition to measuring the absolute increase in computer and communications capacity, the researchers used a series of statistical techniques to measure changes in concentration over time. They found strong evidence of decreasing concentration of what they call the "advanced backbone information technology."
"With normal market forces things have gotten better for the vast majority of locations in the United States," Mr. Greenstein said. For example, in 1986 about 28 percent of the nation's local telecommunications providers did not have fiber deployed in their regions. Six years later only about 4 percent did not.
Mr. Greenstein said the group's data showed that there were still some pockets that had been excluded from access to advanced communications and computer networks, but added that they were the exception.
He said that by and large the deployment of fiber optic networks had followed the same routes carved out first by telegraph and then by long-distance telephone networks. These communications lines have generally been laid down along railroad rights-of-way.
Underlying the rapid dispersion of information technology capabilities is their use by industries like finance, insurance and real estate, which tend to rely more heavily on computers than traditional manufacturing industries but also tend to be more evenly distributed geographically, Mr. Greenstein said.
Mr. Greenstein predicted that the Internet would eventually follow this pattern as well. He said his research group is now conducting a study of the geographic dispersion of Internet service providers.

HEADLINE: Union Is Losing Battle With an Island Resort

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C.

 BODY:
Three years ago, the housekeepers, drivers, cooks and waiters of the Melrose Club, a luxurious private resort on South Carolina's isolated Daufuskie Island, won an epochal victory by voting to form the first trade union in Beaufort County.
That vote, and the union's attainment of wage and benefit concessions last summer after two years of arduous contract negotiations, reverberated across Calibogue Sound to the hotels and resorts here on Hilton Head. Before long, the union's victory had echoed throughout the burgeoning hospitality industry in America's least-unionized state. 
 But less than five months after the club's 165 employees celebrated the ratification of their first contract, most of them are out of work and the union is fighting for its life. On Dec. 31, new owners took control of the resort. Just before the sale, all the workers were dismissed; few have been rehired by the new owner.
The union's precipitous descent serves as an object lesson about the halting nature of labor organizing these days, a lesson that has particular resonance in the hard-to-unionize South. While the leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has focused new attention on the region, unions here continue to face serious obstacles, and groundbreaking advances are often followed by demoralizing defeats.
"Here they played by all the rules," said George W. Hopkins, a labor historian at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. "They made the case to the workers, they had an election, they won and now they find the victory snatched out from under them. It's got to be tremendously dispiriting to the workers to have this happen after a long campaign."
In general, the last decade has been a dispiriting one for organized labor, and nowhere more so than in the South. Here, the combination of right-to-work laws that allow workers to refuse to pay dues to unions that represent them, and a historical antipathy toward unionization have helped lure large employers and contributed to rapid job growth.
From 1985 to 1995, a period when employment in private business rose 23 percent in the 11 states of the former Confederacy, the number of private-sector union members in the region dropped 19 percent, according to statistics from the Bureau of National Affairs, a private research organization. In that period, the proportion of all private-sector workers unionized in those states dropped to 4.7 percent from 7.1 percent.
The decline in unionization in the South, measured both in the number of workers and in their percentage of the work force, has exceeded the drop throughout the nation as a whole. The proportion of the private-sector work force that is unionized nationwide dropped to 10.3 percent in 1995 from 14.3 percent in 1985.
There have been some notable successes for labor in the South in recent years, but not enough to offset the economy's transformation from manufacturing to service industries, which are less prone to unionization, said Bruce S. Raynor, the Southern regional director of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, or Unite.
In South Carolina, where just 2.3 percent of private-sector workers are unionized, the employees of only 34 companies have voted on whether to unionize in the last three years, with management winning in 21 elections and labor winning 13, according to the State Chamber of Commerce.
That is what made it so remarkable that in October 1994, the Melrose employees voted 98 to 45 to join Local 465 of the International Union of Operating Engineers. Fed up with erratic management and a gradual erosion of their benefits, the workers said, they embraced the union. Then they settled in for two years of negotiations, demonstrations and charges of unfair labor practices that produced a contract last August. The contract granted raises that averaged 13 percent over two years.
Predictably, the unionization battle on Daufuskie, a moss-draped island accessible only by boat that did not get telephone service until 1977, has taken on racial overtones.
Both the new and former owners of the 772-acre resort are wealthy and white. Shortly after the resort opened in 1987, with a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, an elegant inn, tennis courts and an equestrian center, its memberships sold for $75,000 and annual dues ran to $2,300.
By contrast, many of the displaced workers are poor and black. Some are the progeny of slaves who harvested indigo and Sea Island cotton on these barrier islands. Now, the descendants often earn meager wages trimming the greens and making the beds at rich people's resorts, many of which, they caustically note, have "plantation" as part of their names.
In the contract battle, labor organizers played on Old South imagery, circulating handbills that depicted cotton-picking slaves and described the Melrose Club as "a plantation where they treat workers like they own them."
Now that they must rally their dejected members, union organizers have dusted off that theme. "I think it's a case of white people who want black people to be servants, and in the Southern United States I think it's hard not to see it in stark racial terms," said Simon B. Greer, a white New York native hired by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to help organize workers at Melrose and elsewhere in South Carolina.
Black employees who were dismissed from Melrose seem less eager to paint the conflict in racial terms. But many are at a loss to explain why they were dismissed from jobs that often required great sacrifice for modest pay.
Annette Y. Campbell, who worked as a cook for $8.56 an hour, said she would rise at 3 A.M. to complete the 45-minute drive from her home in Savannah, Ga., in time to catch the 5:30 A.M. ferry from Hilton Head to Daufuskie. Eric L. Coney, a bus driver with seven years of experience who was earning $10.18 an hour, said he particularly resented picking up the newspaper and finding a classified advertisement seeking applicants for his job.
The management of the resort, now named Daufuskie Island Club and Resort, which is owned by the Club Corporation of America, based in Dallas, maintains that it has not rehired many of the Melrose workers because it wants a fresh start for a development that had been plagued by financial problems. Part of that process, said Arch Y. Stokes, the Atlanta lawyer who represents the resort in labor matters, is seeking the best qualified employees for every position.
That hiring process has created a new work force that includes only a minority of union members. Under Federal law, a union can claim to represent workers only if it has the support of a majority of the company's nonmanagement employees.
"It is illegal for an employer in America to recognize a union that has not lawfully established itself as representing a majority of the employees," Mr. Stokes said.
David K. Miller, an international representative for the union, estimated that 141 Melrose workers had been dismissed at the end of the year and that only 37 had been rehired. Mr. Miller said he believed the new owners clearly intended to break the union.
On Jan. 24, he filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board accusing the resort of unfair labor practices, including its refusal "to hire former Melrose Club Inc. employees to avoid its bargaining obligation and in retaliation for their union representation and activity." If the union does not win its fight against the resort's hiring practices, it will have to decide whether to give up or begin another organizing drive with the new workers.
Willie L. Clark, Southern regional director of the National Labor Relations Board, said the new company would be guilty of unfair labor practices if it is found to have deliberately not hired former unionized employees in an effort to kill the union. If the board rules in favor of the union, the agency could force the resort to rehire workers and pay them lost wages.
"If you're going to hire a new work force, generally it's easier to hire somebody who already knows the job than somebody who you have to train," Mr. Clark said. "Why would you do a wholesale dismissal?"

HEADLINE: CHINA AFTER DENG: DIPLOMACY;
U.S. AND CHINESE SEEN NEAR A DEAL ON HUMAN RIGHTS

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 23

 BODY:
After seven months of secret diplomacy, American and Chinese officials seem to be within striking distance of a breakthrough in their longstanding dispute over human rights. At issue is the fate of thousands of Chinese political and religious dissidents held in prisons, labor camps or just at home under heavy guard or surveillance.
Under the terms of a deal that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will seek to nudge toward agreement when she arrives in Beijing on Monday for her first official visit, China would agree to sign two important United Nations covenants on human rights, release a representative group of up to eight political prisoners and restart talks with the International Committee of the Red Cross aimed at establishing a program of prison visits to determine the status of the thousands of prisoners of conscience in China. 
 In return, China could expect to bring an end to the annual confrontation over its human rights record at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
For President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin, this prospective breakthrough comes at a time of extraordinary opportunity and risk.
With the death last week of Deng Xiaoping, it accords the new generation of Chinese leaders an early chance to end the period of harsh repression that has followed the Tiananmen massacre of 1989.
[Ms. Albright arrived in Beijing on Monday, stepping off her plane only hours after the body of Mr. Deng arrived at the Babaoshan cemetery for cremation.]
To emerge from their long "defensive crouch," as a former American Ambassador, J. Stapleton Roy, once called it, China's new leaders would have to stand up to the hard-line forces in the Communist Party. Those forces see any act of political tolerance or human rights concessions to Washington as appeasing those who would like to topple Communist rule here.
It is anyone's guess as to whether the Chinese feel confident enough to go forward. But American officials point to two important factors.
First, the leading hard-liner, Prime Minister Li Peng, has predicted in internal leadership discussions that he can pull off an acceptable deal with the Americans that would help China's case before the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
The commission meets from March 10 to April 18 this year and will again take up a resolution calling for an investigation into human rights conditions in China. Beijing has defeated the resolution each time, often by narrow margins.
Chinese officials say such an achievement by Mr. Li would boost his campaign to gain a prestigious party post and retain supervision of China's foreign affairs after he steps down as Prime Minister next year.
The second factor is that both Chinese and American officials have known since November that Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement who was sentenced to 14 years in prison last fall, is willing to go into exile in exchange for his freedom.
Mr. Wang is one of the best known of the eight dissidents on the list presented in July by Anthony Lake, who was then Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, in talks with Communist Party leaders. Mr. Wang's release and arrival in the United States, which has already privately conveyed a willingness to provide him asylum, would be a dramatic 11th-hour concession by China.
Since November, China has released three other political prisoners on the list, apparently in response to the American requirements: Chen Ziming, sentenced as one of the "black hands" behind the 1989 demonstrations; a dissident from Inner Mongolia named Ulan Shovo, and Xi Yang, a journalist.
For Mr. Clinton, who took political risks in breaking the link between China's human rights performance and its trade status that was imposed by his predecessor, a demonstration of tangible gains would vindicate his policy of engagement.
But Mr. Clinton, whose Presidency now faces an extended investigation into Asian fund-raising efforts during his re-election campaign, will need concessions that are able to withstand Congressional scrutiny.
One difficult issue for Mr. Clinton is deciding how many prisoners among the eight cases raised would have to be released to declare progress. One is Wei Jingsheng, China's best-known dissident, who has served 17 years of a total of 29 years and for whom Mr. Clinton once showed great public concern.
With both China and the United States constrained by domestic political considerations, Ms. Albright appeared to be lowering expectations for her first meeting with Chinese leaders since she became Secretary of State. Her senior aides indicated that she was maneuvering to give the Chinese an opportunity to get through the period of Mr. Deng's funeral before the final hard bargaining on the Geneva resolution.
"The emphasis in China over the coming weeks and months is likely to be on continuity, on stability within the leadership, on building consensus within the leadership," said a senior official who briefed reporters traveling with Ms. Albright. "In other words, nothing risky."
"Our expectations are not too high," he said, adding, "Based on the current situation, we expect to proceed with the resolution."
Last week, the State Department sent cablegrams to the 53 nations on the Human Rights Commission saying that without a breakthrough in the talks, Washington intended to go forward with plans to sponsor the resolution in Geneva calling China to account for human rights abuses.
But Administration officials have been careful to say the final decision to go forward will be made closer to the Geneva meeting. American officials also hope that the brinksmanship in the talks, or recriminations over failure, will not disrupt the visit of Vice President Al Gore to Asia in March, but Beijing has withheld final dates for his stay.
"While one can always hope for human rights progress, we shouldn't expect any dramatic movement forward in the next few days," the official traveling with Ms. Albright said. "We obviously would welcome a gesture now or at any point in next few months."
Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, said: "Mrs. Albright is hoping that the Chinese will make significant enough concessions that the Administration could credibly back off on going forward in Geneva. For the Chinese, they want to avoid the kind of loss of face that would arise from another debate and from a vote in Geneva."
John T. Kamm, a former president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong who regularly travels to Beijing on behalf of political prisoner cases, said that for the Chinese, "with the passing of Deng, a new beginning is possible."
"There is now a window of opportunity for China to demonstrate that it intends to live by international standards of human rights," he said. "If Jiang Zemin were to make this decision, it would demonstrate to the outside world and especially to Hong Kong that he is stepping in and being very decisive. But there is going to be considerable opposition in the party to doing this."
A crucial issue this year has been whether China would sign and then ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and a similar document on economic, social and cultural rights. Together, they would obligate China not only to uphold freedom of speech, assembly and religious worship while also adhering to due process of law, but also to report on its human rights situation to the international community.
"We think signing the covenants would be an extremely important step forward for China," said a French diplomat here.
China has said only that it will sign the documents without committing itself to a specific date and has used that vague commitment to try to split the American and European alliance that has formed each year in Geneva. Last year China tried a similar tactic, but after "consideration," did not sign the covenants.
Similarly, while China has invited a senior Red Cross official to visit Beijing, it has refused to make a specific commitment to go ahead with the agency's prison visit program, which has been the subject of many fruitless negotiations.
"We look for progress on various issues," said the official with Ms. Albright. "We don't expect the visits themselves to be merely symbolic. We want them to provide evidence of an improvement in relations."
Stanley Roth, who is expected to become Ms. Albright's assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, told an interviewer in Washington this weekend that "the relationship cannot be a one-way street."
"If there is no improvement in all the issues the United States cares about," Mr. Roth said, it will be "very hard to create support for a broad relationship."

The Making of a Myth Who Rode Into the Sunset

JOHN WAYNE'S AMERICA
The Politics of Celebrity
By Garry Wills
380 pages. Simon and Schuster. $26.
Gen. Douglas MacArthur thought he was the very model of the American soldier, even though he never served in the military. The critic Eric Bentley thought he was "the most important man in America," the man who helped start the Vietnam War. The young Newt Gingrich tried to imitate his walk; and the mature Ronald Reagan tried to imitate his manner. Richard Nixon thought a lot of America's social problems could be solved if more people took this actor as a role model, and Oliver North and Pat Buchanan borrowed their battle cries -- "Saddle Up!" and "Lock and Load!" -- from one of his movies. 
 The man, of course, was John Wayne.
As Garry Wills observes in his discursive new book, Wayne became for many Americans a "conduit they used to communicate with their own desired selves or their own imagined past." "When he was called the American, it was a statement of what his fans wanted America to be," Mr. Wills writes. "For them, Wayne always struck an elegiac note. He stood for an America people felt was disappearing or had disappeared, for a time 'when men were men.' "
In "John Wayne's America: The Politics of Celebrity," Mr. Wills sets out to examine "the complex idea conveyed on the screen" in the course of Wayne's career, "a compound idea of what American manhood is in the minds of the vast majority of Americans." Although Mr. Wills brings his usual acumen and fluency to this discussion, the long-winded volume he has produced is really little more than a modest essay, padded out to book length with biographical asides, tired analyses of Wayne's movies and detailed assessments of his work with the directors John Ford and Howard Hawks. The central focus of the book is often lost, as though Mr. Wills felt compelled to use all the research he'd accumulated along the way or simply wanted to showcase his abilities as a film critic.
Much of the factual material in "John Wayne's America" retraces ground covered by earlier books like "John Wayne: American" by Randy Roberts and James S. Olson and Tag Gallagher's "John Ford: The Man and His Films." As for Mr. Wills's ideas about Wayne, they, too, tend to range from the familiar to the predictable. We are told that Wayne's screen persona embodied the American myth of the frontier, and that it also embodied "a politics of large meanings" -- "a politics of gender (masculine), ideology (patriotism), character (self-reliance) and responsibility."
Like many writers before him, Mr. Wills points out the contradictions in Wayne's life. He notes that the big-screen warrior, who denounced those who refused to serve in Vietnam as "soft," got out of serving in World War II so he could focus on his career; that the star of so many horse epics actually hated horses; that the indomitable man of the West was born in Iowa with the very unmacho name of Marion Morrison. Indeed this volume's central narrative traces John Wayne's creation of a mythic persona: an invented self that projected an aura of authority, autonomy and slumberous power.
"Wayne was careful about the persona, not accepting things that would endanger it," Mr. Wills writes. "He refused to play a coward for Howard Hawks. He refused to shoot a man in the back for Don Siegel. He would be villainous, but not weak."
The raw materials for John Wayne the persona were Wayne's imposing physique and an economical, purposive body language, which combined with the famous Wayne voice (stop-and-go phrasing, melodic rhythms and an easy timbre) to convey an air of inevitability and control. Like so many things, this physical presence was consciously crafted -- shaped by the lessons Wayne learned from Yakima Canutt, the veteran cowboy stuntman, and Harry Carey, the cowboy star of Ford's early silent films.
Though Ford would later take credit for inventing John Wayne, Mr. Wills notes that the director Raoul Walsh was the one who first spotted Wayne moving props on the Fox set back in 1929 and decided to make him a star. As for Wayne's mature persona -- as a middle-aged authority figure radiating command -- it came to fruition in Hawks's 1948 classic, "Red River," in which he played the brutal cattle owner Dunson. The character of Dunson, in turn, would inform many of Wayne's most powerful later roles, including Stryker, the tough Marine sergeant in "Sands of Iwo Jima" (1949) and Ethan Edwards, the implacable avenger in "The Searchers," Ford's 1956 masterpiece.
By 1948, Wayne had become a fierce anti-Communist, and many of his subsequent pictures evinced a distinct political subtext. By waging World War II in "Sands," Wayne's character was, in effect, waging the cold war; and in Ford's three Seventh Calvary pictures ("Fort Apache" (1948), "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" (1949) and "Rio Grande" (1950), Wayne became, in Mr. Wills's words, "the cool but determined model for Americans living with continual danger." The image in those films of United States Cavalry units surrounded by hostile Indians not only served as a metaphor for what was perceived as America's embattled place in the world, but also helped to ratify imperial ambitions.
In the wake of confusion over Vietnam, the ideological certainties purveyed by these films -- and brought to an absurd culmination by "The Green Berets" in 1968 -- had begun to fray, and Wayne's career was in danger of reaching a dead end. What he did in movies like "True Grit" (1969), "Big Jake" (1971) and his final movie, "The Shootist" (1976), Mr. Wills argues, is recognize "that his success would now depend on becoming a living anachronism."
He had become a living monument to a West that had been tamed, a frontier that had closed.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
A Case of Rape, Memory and DNA

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The script is not unknown to real-life television: a wrongful conviction, a long stay in prison, final exoneration. Tonight's absorbing "Frontline" uses such a case to inquire into the vagaries of memory and the fallibility of eyewitness testimony.
"What Jennifer Saw" goes back to a summer night in 1984. Jennifer Thompson, then 22 and a college student in Burlington, N.C., tells of being raped by a black man who broke into her apartment. She believes she retained images of his face in "little brief pieces of light that I could piece together." Following up on an anonymous tip, the police show her several photographs, from which she chooses Ronald Cotton; later she picks him out in a police lineup. 
 This carefully reported hour takes pains to make clear that this was not a stereotypical case of old-fashioned Southern justice. Mr. Cotton was a plausible suspect. He had a police record, including a conviction for rape, and a shaky alibi. But given little physical evidence, the prosecution relied on Ms. Thompson's identification during the trial. A lawyer comments: "It is incredibly powerful evidence, and jurors want to believe the victim. They identify with the victim and especially when there's really no motive for the victim to lie. It is very hard evidence to overcome."
By Ms. Thompson's own account to the program's interviewer, she was determined to give a face to her tormenter, glimpsed in the dimness and through the emotions of that horrific night. There is no suggestion here that she purposely lied, but a psychologist who has studied memory (but was not deemed sufficiently expert by the judge to testify at the Cotton trial) gives examples of how shaky eyewitness testimony can be.
Elizabeth Loftus, another student of memory, who has appeared on "Frontline" before with criticism of the way so-called memories have been extracted from children in sex-abuse cases, maintains that eyewitness accounts are subject to all manner of influences and often seem more definitive in the courtroom than they are in fact.
Convicted and sentenced to life, Mr. Cotton spent 11 years in prison before his innocence was proved by DNA evidence and the real rapist was arrested and confessed. The narrator notes, "Ronald Cotton was only the latest in a string of prisoners released because DNA had shown that they were wrongfully convicted." (Among the experts heard from affirming the scientific credibility of DNA tests are Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, known to followers of the O. J. Simpson criminal trial for casting doubt on the DNA evidence presented against their client.)
A troubled Ms. Thompson does not quarrel with the DNA results, but for her the image remains: "I still see Ronald Cotton."

(Check local listings)
This attempt to grapple with the deepest concerns of black Americans -- political, economic, cultural -- is too ambitious to ignore but too spotty to recommend. The essays and discussions by black academics, writers and others provide as many slogans as original insights, as much hot air as fresh air.
The production, credited to three producers with very different techniques, adds to the hour's clutter. If you tune in, my advice would be to stay alert for the comments of Glenn Loury, a professor of economics at Boston University; he has a reputation as a conservative, but he's a lot more interesting than that.

HEADLINE: A Dam Open, Grand Canyon Roars Again

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
LAST March, in a precedent-setting effort to turn back the ecological clock, Federal officials unleashed four roaring jets of white water from a Federal hydroelectric dam on the Colorado River. The objective was to mimic the annual floods that for millenniums, until the dam was built, had set the terms of life at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
The plants and animals of the river and its Grand Canyon shores evolved with the West's spring and summer floods and were superbly adapted to them. These floods not only poured nutrients into the ecosystem, but they also carved its architecture by redistributing sand from the river bottom, shaping it into sand bars and creating backwaters where fish could breed and grow. 
 The advent of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, 15 miles above the Grand Canyon, short-circuited this process, initiating an ecological decline that pushed several of the canyon's unique species to the brink of extinction.
So when 45,000 cubic feet of water thundered out of the dam's flumes each second for a week, the first experiment of its kind at a big Federal dam in the West, the air was filled with hosannas to a new era.
But has the experiment really panned out? The formal reports from a corps of scientists are only now coming in, and the picture is decidedly mixed.
The flood did build many new beaches, sand bars and backwaters. Some of the beaches made superb camp sites for the canyon's abundant river rafters. But the deluge was not strong enough to flush non-native species from the system, as had been hoped. Among these intruders are carp and catfish that compete with and prey on endangered natives like the humpback and bony-tailed chubs, the Colorado squawfish and the razorback sucker. Experts say that a natural flood, on average more than twice as powerful as the controlled one, would have swept away the non-natives, while the natives, more suited to watery cataclysm, survived.
Short of partly renovating the dam to allow it to pass more water safely, the full restorative effects of flooding cannot be exploited, some experts say. Furthermore, the effects of a restorative flood are not permanent. Many of the new beaches and sand bars have been steadily eroding. That was expected, but now nature has thrown a curve: high water caused by heavy snows in the last two winters forced the Government last week to increase somewhat the normal flow from Lake Powell, behind the dam. Rather than building the beaches and bars, this flow is expected to speed their erosion.
All this testifies to the difficulty of restoring natural processes once human activity has drastically altered them. In this case, the experiment has shown that controlled flooding "is only a tool, it's not a panacea," said David L. Wegner, an aquatic ecologist and engineer who directed the Glen Canyon scientific experiment for the Federal Government until recently. He now heads a private consulting company, Ecosystem Management International Inc., in Flagstaff, Ariz.
Still, whatever its ecological outcome, the experiment is widely seen as a breakthrough in another arena, that of politics and policy. In the past, Western dams like the one at Glen Canyon have been operated with only two considerations in mind: producing electrical power and providing water to farms and cities downstream. Protecting nature was nowhere in the picture. Now it is, along with a whole range of human activities that depend on it, like angling, boating, camping and nature study -- all the tourist-related activities that economically define what is called the New West.
So while the Grand Canyon experiment is only a beginning, many say its main importance may be that it has shown that widely divergent interests, all of whom took part in the planning, can compromise in trying to give nature freer rein.
With the Grand Canyon flood, "we're taking a whole new step toward restoring river systems and not just destroying them," said Pam Hyde, the southwestern regional director for American Rivers, a national environmental group.
Federally licensed private hydroelectric dams in the East are increasingly attuning their operations to nature's requirements. But the Grand Canyon experiment is said to be the first involving a big Federal dam in the West. There are scores of these, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who pushed the button to start the Grand Canyon flood, said in an interview that the experiment "has enormous implications for river management all over the West" and that the lessons of Glen Canyon will be applied to other rivers.
Before the Colorado was dammed, the big floods that created and refurbished habitat for native fish worked mostly on the downstream side of tributaries, which pushed boulders out into the main stream, narrowing it and creating rapids. Where the river widened again just below the tributary's mouth, circular eddies formed and the flood waters slowed. This allowed sand scoured from the river bottom to settle and create a submerged bar thrusting out into the main stream. After the flood subsided, a calm backwater formed behind the now-exposed sandbar.
During the deluge, native fish that had evolved with flooding "would go right against the side wall of the canyon, where the velocity is lowest, and put their noses right into the wall and ride out the flood," said Dr. Edmund D. Andrews, a geophysicist who is co-leader of a team of experts at the United States Geological Survey office in Boulder, Colo., who have extensively studied the 1996 controlled flood. The non-native fish stuck to mid-stream and were carried away, leaving the backwater spawning habitat to the natives.
The flood also pumped new energy into the ecosystem by stirring up vast deposits of nitrates, phosphates and carbon, in the form of decaying vegetation and other organic matter, that had been trapped in the bottom sediments. These liberated nutrients fed algae and microscopic animals at the bottom of the food chain and re-nourished native streamside plants like honey mesquite, cat's-claw acacia and coyote willow.
The Glen Canyon Dam interrupted this life-giving cycle. Sandbars eroded. Backwaters dried up. Widely distributed invasive species like the catfish and carp ate the scarce, isolated natives and competed with them for food and spawning habitat. Invasive plants like the tamarisk, a native of Egypt, crowded out natives along the shoreline. Nutrients remained locked away, useless.
The objective of the "spike flow" last March was to re-establish the natural process while avoiding serious harm to a blue-ribbon trout fishery just below the dam, to endangered species like the Kanab ambersnail and to 4,000-year-old Native American archeological, cultural and religious sites near the water's edge.
The scientific papers now emerging show that the flood heightened and slightly widened existing sandbars, built scores of new camping beaches, liberated large quantities of nutrients and created 20 percent more backwater area for spawning fish. No endangered species were significantly harmed, it was found. Nor was the trout fishery, although some experts are unsure what would happen to it if floods became routine. No archeological sites were damaged; indeed, some were actually protected from erosion damage by a new blanket of sediment.
But the sandbars and beaches were found to be eroding not long after the flood, and higher everyday water releases made necessary by the heavy runoff of melting snow rendered the backwaters unusable for spawning. Non-native fish species and large, invading shoreline plants were scarcely affected.
All in all, Mr. Wegner said, "It's a little early to claim success."
As things stand now, experts say, going very far beyond the March 1996 flow level would probably require releasing water through its spillways rather than through special conduits around the dam, as is ordinarily done. Some of the experts say they fear that the force of a historic-size flow could damage or even destroy the dam. Dr. Andrews, for one, suggests that for about $120 million in dam renovations, it would be possible and economically feasible to restore floods of historic velocity. Long-term recreation revenue might help offset costs.
A Government analysis calculated the cost of last spring's flow at $1.8 million in foregone electrical generating capacity. The Government absorbed this cost rather than pass it along to consumers of electricity. Some experts suggest that in the future, consumers should bear part of the cost, since the ecological damage is caused by the need to supply power.
Future controlled floods might not be as expensive as the first, however. One important scientific finding was that most of the Grand Canyon flood's ecological effects were felt in the first 48 hours of the weeklong flow. This suggests that a substantially shorter and therefore less costly flood might achieve the same results. Dr. Andrews said the consensus of his group was that several new, short spike flows might be an ecologically healthier way to dispose of this year's heavy runoff of melting snow than a steady, somewhat heightened everyday flow.
In the meantime, officials, scientists and water managers are hoping that the 13-year research project leading up to last spring's controlled flood has answered enough questions so that any future floods in the Grand Canyon or elsewhere would be easier to carry out as well as less costly. Nevertheless, the process of getting all interests to the table and coming up with a plan that all can live with is not expected to be easy. So if a new era has dawned, it may not unfold very rapidly. "It will be a slow process," Secretary Babbitt said.

When the Colorado River floods, it creates calm backwater areas in the Grand Canyon where native fish can spawn and grow. This commonly happens on the downstream side of a tributary, whose waters push boulders out into the river, narrowing it and creating rapids. Where the river widens again, circular eddies form and the water slows. This allows sand to settle and create a bar thrusting out into the stream. When the flood subsides, the bar is exposed and the backwater forms behind it. Damming the river stops this process, and backwater havens dry up. (Source: Dr. Edmund D. Andrews; David L. Wegner)(pg.

HEADLINE: Panel Pushes For Revival Of Spending On the Arts

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
A nonpartisan Presidential committee has warned that cuts in public, private and corporate spending on the arts and humanities are undermining cultural and educational institutions in the United States. In a report to be released today, the panel recommends wide-ranging measures to confront what it calls growing threats to the nation's cultural heritage.
The 35-page report of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, headed by John Brademas, a former Democratic Congressman from Indiana and president emeritus of New York University, recommends that President Clinton lead a "millennium initiative" to revitalize public and private support for culture. 
 Goals of the initiative, which President Clinton is said to support, would be restoring funds for the arts in schools and requiring arts instruction for all high school students; forming private-public partnerships to make American works accessible through new technologies; fostering philanthropy through tax reform, and expanding international cultural contacts by, among other things, requiring competency in a foreign language for graduation from high school or admission to college.
The report urged Congress to enact or to preserve several tax measures that encourage individual and corporate donations to nonprofit groups. Such donations now provide 90 percent of the nation's cultural financing, the report says, and given pressures to balance the Federal budget, educational and cultural institutions will have to tap the private sector further to survive.
In implicit criticism of Congressional conservatives who have cut public subsidies for the arts and humanities and who favor abolishing those national endowments, the committee, which includes Republicans and Democrats, strongly endorses a Federal role through direct public subsidies, tax breaks and other incentives, particularly for art that highlights "our ethnic and cultural differences." It also criticizes what it calls "a climate of intolerance for challenging works and ideas."
Mr. Brademas said he had presented a copy of the report on Friday at a meeting with President Clinton and Hilary Rodham Clinton, the committee's honorary chairwoman.
Both the Clintons, he said, were enthusiastic about the committee's recommendations, particularly the proposal that the President lead a national initiative to galvanize private support for the arts. Mrs. Clinton, a supporter of increased public funding for culture, has scheduled a news conference to discuss the report's conclusions at the Library of Congress today.
The report surveys the strengths and failings of the complex support system that sustains the nation's 8,000 museums, 30,000 libraries, 3,665 institutions of higher learning, 2,000 local preservation commissions, 351 public television stations, 548 public radio stations, 7,000 community theaters and 1,800 symphony orchestras.
Among the steps the committee recommends to strengthen support for culture are the following:
*Congress should restore Federal funds for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services and insure that they receive appropriations equal to $2 for each person in the country by the year 2000, compared with the 88.5 cents a person committed in fiscal 1997.
*Congress should retain the charitable deduction in the Federal tax code for gifts to all nonprofit organizations and should make permanent the deductibility of gifts of appreciated publicly traded stocks to private foundations, a provision set to expire in June.
*Fourteen states and the District of Columbia should abandon efforts to bolster revenues by challenging the tax-exempt status of non-profit institutions or by imposing payments on them in lieu of taxes.
The committee expressed particular concern about the "disturbing signs of a weakening philanthropic spirit," including a decline in the average size of gifts from the wealthiest Americans. Citing other studies, the report noted that even as all charitable giving increased by 11 percent in 1995 over the previous year, private contributions to the arts and humanities did not increase, when adjusted for inflation.
This trend is particularly worrisome for cultural institutions, since the arts and humanities are more dependent on private giving than many other segments of the nonprofit sector, the committee said. Performing arts groups, for instance, receive as much as 40 percent of their total income from donations, compared with 3 percent to 5 percent for hospitals and an average of less than 20 percent for many other nonprofit groups.
The report also concludes that increases in corporate donations to the arts and humanities over the past two years, which account for about 7 percent of all philanthropic donations, "mask a long-term decline in corporate giving" when measured as a percentage of pre-tax income. In addition, the report criticizes the trend among businesses of tying contributions to specific marketing objectives.
It cites as a positive development the 40 percent rise in foundation support for the arts in the 1980's, "the only source of sustained increased giving to cultural organizations" in the past decade. Particularly striking is the explosion of community foundations, whose assets jumped from $1 billion to more than $13 billion in just over 20 years.
But at the same time, the reports adds, foundation giving, which tripled from $3.4 billion to $11.3 billion from 1980 to 1994, is both highly concentrated and unevenly distributed. Citing a study by the Foundation Center in New York City, 505 foundations with assets of more than $50 million were responsible for half the grants to charitable causes.
The committee has 13 members who hold key Administration cultural posts, as well as has 31 members from outside the Government, among them the performers Isaac Stern and Rita Moreno and business executives including Terry Semel, the chairman of Warner Brothers; Harvey Golub, chairman and chief executive officer of American Express, and Robert Menschel, a limited partner of Goldman Sachs and Company.

HEADLINE: Russia Atom Aides Buy I.B.M. Supercomputer Despite U.S. Curbs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 24

 BODY:
In an effort to circumvent United States export controls, Russia's nuclear weapons establishment says it has obtained a powerful I.B.M. supercomputer through a European middleman.
Russian nuclear officials, who disclosed the purchase, said they planned to use the computer to simulate nuclear tests. 
 "If we see something we can buy on the European market, we buy it," Vladislav Petrov, the head of the public affairs department for Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy Affairs, said in an interview.
Mr. Petrov said the computer had been purchased for $7 million.
The purchase of the supercomputer, an I.B.M. RS/6000 SP, underscores the vein of distrust that still colors relations between the United States and newly democratic Russia.
Even as Washington talks of partnership between NATO and Russia and supports Russia's efforts at economic reform, the two sides are still at odds over Moscow's access to sophisticated American technology.
Russian officials insist that supercomputers are needed to maintain the reliability of their nuclear stockpile now that Moscow has agreed to a ban on nuclear tests.
"Computer modeling is very important to us," Viktor N. Mikhailov, the Minister of Atomic Energy Affairs, said recently.
But American officials say supercomputers could help Russia design new weapons. The United States does not want to help Russia insure the effectiveness of its nuclear arsenal.
"We have made a policy decision not to assist the Russians in their stockpile stewardship program," a senior American official said. "Even though relations with the Russians are good, we are potentially a target for their nuclear forces if relations change."
The Clinton Administration is also concerned about the political ramifications in Congress of aiding the Russian military establishment.
Under United States law, American computer manufacturers are required to consult with the Commerce Department before selling computers to Russia that are capable of performing between two billion and seven billion calculations a second. The sale of faster computers generally requires a license.
The Administration turned down applications last year from I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard to sell supercomputers to Russia. The Russians said the computers would be used for research on pollution and nuclear safety, but suspicions were aroused because they were to be shipped to nuclear weapons design centers.
Recently, the head of Silicon Graphics, a California-based company, acknowledged that his company had made a mistake by selling two small supercomputer systems to Russia. The United States Attorney in San Jose has opened an investigation into that sale.
The I.B.M. supercomputer is even more powerful and can perform 10 billion calculations a second, Russian officials say. They say it is 10 times more effective than the computers now on hand.
Russian officials decline to say precisely which middleman sold the I.B.M. supercomputer. But they have not hesitated to publicize the acquisition, perhaps calculating that this may undermine the rationale for continued American export controls.
Russian nuclear officials say they want to purchase even more powerful supercomputers to maintain Russia's status as a nuclear superpower, with Washington's blessing.
Stressing the need for nuclear research, Mr. Mikhailov touted Russia's nuclear arsenal as a means of offsetting its weakness in conventional weapons. "The only protection throughout this period will be nuclear weapons," he said.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Supreme Court to Review Sharp Limits on Membership in Credit Unions

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to review a lower-court ruling that placed sharp limits on the membership of federally chartered credit unions. The Federal agency that regulates credit unions, urging the Justices to hear the appeal, warned that the decision "threatens the survival" of credit unions, which have millions of members throughout the country.
The issue is whether the agency, the National Credit Union Administration, properly interpreted Federal law when it reversed longstanding policy in 1982 and permitted credit unions to include employees of more than one company. 
 Half of the more than 7,000 Federal credit unions in the country have taken advantage of the expanded membership definition, and those organizations, with 32 million members, are now presumably invalid under the ruling in July by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The case is being closely watched by the banking industry, which has found itself increasingly in competition with credit unions for consumer banking services like car loans, mortgages and checking accounts and which brought the legal challenge to the new policy. The loser in the case in the Supreme Court is likely to seek help from Congress.
The Depression-era statute that established the nonprofit employee savings associations limited memberships to "groups having a common bond of occupation or association" or to "groups within a well-defined neighborhood, community or rural district." For nearly 50 years the "common bond" language was interpreted by Federal regulators as limiting each credit union to the employees of a single company.
But faced with having to bail out credit unions of small companies that were failing in the recession of the early 1980's, the agency reinterpreted the Federal Credit Union Act to permit separate employee groups to join together in one credit union. As long as the employees within each separate group had a "common bond" with one another, multiemployer credit unions met the legal definition.
A result was a rapid consolidation and expansion of credit unions. Most of the 200 largest now have members from multiple employers. Under the ruling by the appeals court, no credit union in the country can accept new members who do not fall under the former "common bond" definition. The banking industry has asked the appeals court to order the retroactive divestiture of employee groups that have been added since 1982.
The decision "threatens nationwide instability and losses in the credit union industry affecting millions of persons," the Clinton Administration said in urging the Court to hear the appeal, National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank & Trust, No. 96-843.
The case was brought by the First National Bank and Trust Company of Asheboro, N.C., to challenge the charter that the National Credit Union Administration issued to the AT&T Family Credit Union in Winston-Salem, N.C. The credit union was chartered in 1952 to serve employees of the Western Electric Company in North Carolina. Under the new policy, it received authorization to add employees of a Coca-Cola bottler, the Duke Power Company, the American Tobacco Company and other companies.
The credit union has also expanded to all 50 states and now includes more than 150 occupational groups.
The bank lost its case in Federal District Court here in 1994 before prevailing in the appeals court. One question for the Justices is whether, regardless of the legal merits of the case, the appeals court should have permitted the bank to pursue its suit.
The Administration and the credit union, which is also appealing the ruling, argue that a bank does not have legal standing to challenge a regulatory decision involving credit unions because banks do not fall within the "zone of interests" that Congress intended to protect when it passed the Federal Credit Union Act.
There were these other developments at the Court today:
 
Term Limits
The Supreme Court refused to involve itself in the latest legal battle over term limits for members of Congress. The Justices, without comment, declined to hear a case on the validity of states' voter referendums that instruct members of Congress to support a term-limits constitutional amendment and that essentially invite voters to retaliate against senators and representatives who do not follow the instructions.
Voters in nine states adopted such measures at the polls in November, and court challenges have been filed in most of those states. The appeal today asked the Justices to decide the constitutionality of a referendum adopted by Arkansas voters, but found by the Arkansas Supreme Court to be an illegitimate effort to amend the Constitution by means other than those provided for by the Constitution itself.
The Justices' refusal to hear the appeal means that the Arkansas referendum is now dead, despite its approval in November by a margin of 61 to 39 percent. The action has no legal effects in the other states that adopted similar measures. It is possible that the Supreme Court will take up the issue after the high courts of other states have addressed it, particularly if a difference of opinion develops among the state courts.
The other states are Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota.
The Arkansas referendum was typical of the others in instructing the members of the Arkansas Congressional delegation to support the version of a term-limits amendment supported by U.S. Term Limits, a main lobbying group on the issue. The measure had called for limiting Congressional terms to six years, or three terms, for House members and two six-year terms for senators.
Members of Congress who failed to support that version, or who supported any other version, were to be identified on the ballot in future elections with the label "Disregarded voter instruction on term limits."
The Arkansas Supreme Court, ruling two weeks before election day on a challenge brought by an Arkansas voter, declared the referendum an unauthorized, and thus unconstitutional, means of amending the Constitution. As the state court said, the Constitution can be amended through a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures or through passage by two-thirds of each house of Congress, followed by ratification by three-quarters of the state legislatures.
In neither case did the Constitution contemplate direct action by the voters, the Arkansas court said.
Acting on an urgent appeal by the state, the United States Supreme Court granted a last-minute stay, on Nov. 2, allowing the referendum to proceed, with its constitutionality unresolved. The stay was intended to expire if, on considering the state's formal appeal of the ruling, the Justices decided not to hear the case, which is what occurred today. The case was Arkansas Term Limits v. Donovan, No. 96-903.
The term-limits issue appears, in any event, to be dead for this session of Congress, after a vote on Feb. 12 in which series of proposals failed to win a two-thirds majority in the House. After those votes, U.S. Term Limits put out a list of 18 House members from the nine states with term-limits referendums, who voted against the organization's preferred version or voted in favor of a different proposal.
In the states where the term-limit initiatives have taken effect, it will be up to election officials to place the negative labels next to those members' names the next time that they run for election.
 
Justice Stevens
The Court announced that Justice John Paul Stevens was treated at Georgetown University Hospital late last week to clear an obstruction of a coronary artery. The 76-year-old Justice was on the bench today and did not miss any arguments last week.
The Court's announcement said that Justice Stevens suffered mild chest pain on Wednesday. Tests showed that he had not had a heart attack but that he had had an obstruction that was relieved through angioplasty. The statement said he recovered at home over the weekend and was now "symptom free."

Abortion Clinics
After its ruling last week on the permissible scope of measures to protect access to abortion clinics, the Justices set aside rulings from Colorado and Arizona that had upheld an approach that the Court found in a case from upstate New York to have violated the free-speech rights of anti-abortion demonstrators.
The approach, sometimes known as a "bubble zone," involves an area within which a demonstrator may not approach a patient as she makes her way to the clinic's entrance. A Colorado law, which a state appeals court upheld in 1995, barred an approach, without the person's consent, within eight feet for the purpose of passing out a leaflet or "engaging in oral protest, education or counseling." A Phoenix ordinance, upheld in 1995 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, upheld a similar eight-foot "bubble."
The lower courts have to now reconsider those decisions in light of last week's ruling in Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, in which the Supreme Court upheld a 15-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics in upstate New York but found the indefinite and movable quality of a 15-foot "bubble zone" to be too restrictive of the demonstrators' First Amendment rights.
That decision does not necessarily invalidate the approach of the lower courts in the cases today, Sabelko v. Phoenix, No. 95-1415, and Hill v. Colorado, No. 95-1905. That is because the New York case concerned a court-ordered injunction, which the Supreme Court subjects to more searching review than a law or ordinance that has been adopted through a normal legislative process.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Slip On Caution By Investors

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices slipped yesterday as bond investors looked cautiously ahead to testimony this week from the Federal Reserve chairman as well as to looming supply.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 6/32, to 99 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.65 percent, from 6.64 percent on Friday. 
 Traders also pointed to a slumping dollar as a reason for lower bond prices, since a weak dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like United States securities less attractive to foreign investors.
The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow and the House's panel on Thursday to give his semiannual testimony on the state of monetary policy and the economy.
Mr. Greenspan's appearances and the pressures of new securities coming to market "could keep the Treasury market on the defensive, with the testimony capturing center stage and the two-year and five-year note auctions providing the warm-up acts," said Larry J. Wipf, a vice president and economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
"While a tightening bias will no doubt be maintained, recent favorable inflation news will likely deter the Fed from tightening anytime soon," Mr. Wipf said. "Barring shocking economic news during the next month, Fed policy will likely remain on hold at the March 25 meeting."
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, said that recent data had suggested continued, but cooler, economic growth compared with the fourth quarter last year, when the economy grew at a 4.7 percent pace. "Despite the latest numbers showing that housing and autos have peaked, industrial production has slowed, and the trade deficit has deteriorated," she said, "there is still no clear sign that the economy has cooled enough to eliminate totally the concerns about future inflation and a possible pre-emptive strike against it by the Fed."
Ms. Cooper said signs of a tightening in the labor markets were of increasing concern, noting that for the first time since 1989 new claims have fallen below the 310,000 level for two consecutive weeks. "Accelerating wage growth and the potential follow-through to the general price level is an issue on the minds of the Federal Open Market Committee members," she said.
Market participants also took note of the Treasury's $17.5 billion sale of two-year notes today and $12.5 billion of five-year notes tomorrow. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 5.86 percent and the five-year maturity at a price to yield 6.17 percent, both up a basis point from Friday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
At yesterday's regular weekly Treasury bill auction, the average rate for a three-month maturity rose three basis points from last week, to 5.01 percent; the rate for a six-month bill remained unchanged at 5.03 percent. Analysts said the results were generally in line with expectations, though they thought the six-month rate was a little weak.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of the new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Green Fades From a Blueprint;
In Trump Revision, Highway Stays and Park Goes

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The lambs were roaring in 1991 and the lion was bleating a bit.
So it did not seem entirely implausible when they lay down together; when a band of civic groups, fresh from several anti-development victories, allied themselves with Donald J. Trump, then battling for his financial life. Together, they formed the Riverside South Planning Corporation to oversee the design of the 16-building project that is to stretch along the Hudson River from 59th to 72d Street, on the old Penn Central rail yards. 
 What Mr. Trump was to get from the deal was a smooth ride through the often bumpy governmental review process. What the civic groups were to get was a role in shaping one of the largest developments in recent New York history and, far more important, a generous new riverfront park in place of the ugly elevated West Side Highway, which was to curve inland to open the water's edge. Six years later, having gained the approvals and won the backing of Hong Kong investors, Mr. Trump says he will begin construction next week on the first Riverside South building, a 46-story apartment tower between 69th and 70th Streets.
But the highway is not budging yet. And it may not for a long time, if ever. The political will needed to dismantle the viaduct and reroute the road has practically evaporated.
Even Mr. Trump, who once called himself the "No. 1 fan of getting the highway down," now says he would be better off economically and logistically if it remained in place.
Did the lambs get fleeced?
"Everybody has gotten what they bargained for except the civics," said Richard A. Kahan, chairman of the Riverside South Planning Corporation. "The city and state never guaranteed that the highway would be relocated, but everybody agreed to use good faith and their best efforts to see that it would proceed. There never would have been a project if people had known then what they do today: that government would change its mind."
The "civics" are the Municipal Art Society, the Parks Council, the Regional Plan Association, the Riverside Park Fund and a neighborhood group called Westpride. The Natural Resources Defense Council was an original member of this coalition but resigned in 1993, once the government review was completed.
"Ultimately, the reason everybody is in this is because everybody wants to see the riverfront park," said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society.
If the highway were moved inland, it would be covered for a stretch of several blocks by an ample lawn sloping gently down to the Hudson River, so people could walk directly to the water's edge. Were the highway to stay in place, parkgoers would have to pass under the brooding, noisy viaduct to reach the water. "Nothing matters as much in this whole process -- to us and the future of the city -- as the future of that park," Mr. Sexton said. "At this moment, it's just plain uncertain."
In fact, at this moment, the political odds are stacked against it. Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani favor the general idea of opening up the waterfront but contend that there are better ways to spend $200 million in Federal and state transportation funds than tearing down an elevated viaduct that was recently rehabilitated at a cost of more than $70 million.
Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter said that by agreeing to the highway relocation, the Dinkins administration raised unrealistic expectations. "You shouldn't do that," she said. "Big projects can't be arbitrarily subject to changes in administration. But that doesn't mean you support something stupid. We had to say no. To do this now makes no sense to us."
Nor does it make sense to the Pataki administration, said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. "To do it now would be -- how can I put it? -- a luxury," he said. "And we certainly can't afford luxuries these days."
Federal dollars for highway projects do exist but New York's most influential political officials do not count the highway relocation among their top priorities. Today is the deadline for members of Congress to submit projects for money from the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and the Congressman whose district includes Riverside South -- Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan -- is among the project's strongest foes.
As a practical matter, this means that Riverside South is likely to look much different from the vision the groups offered in 1990 when they were fighting Mr. Trump's proposal for a development of 14.5 million square feet on the Penn yards. That was to be called Trump City and feature the world's tallest skyscraper among 60- and 70-story towers.
The civic groups proposed a waterfront park minus the highway-on-stilts, lined with buildings about one quarter of the height proposed by Mr. Trump. The groups filed a lawsuit in December 1990 to prevent reconstruction of the viaduct until alternatives were studied.
Mr. Trump and the civic groups announced the current, compromise plan in March 1991: an 8.3 million-square-foot project with a 23-acre waterfront park and buildings from 30 to 40 stories.
The civic groups dropped the suit in the understanding that the city, state and Mr. Trump would push for the highway relocation. And they formed the planning corporation, which has been financed by Mr. Trump, his partners and the Chase Manhattan Bank, the mortgage holder.
Essentially, the corporation took over the role of the City Planning Commission, effectively limiting the voice of local opponents in the review process and alienating some longtime civic advocates who mistrusted any alliance with Mr. Trump.
One of those was Joyce Matz, who resigned as spokeswoman for Westpride in the wake of the deal.
"What makes civic groups important is their independence," she said. "If we'd all held firm, not compromised and not joined the enemy, that project could have been made smaller."
But Linda Davidoff, who was executive director of the Parks Council at the time, said she believes that Trump City might have prevailed had the civic groups kept up their fight. "David Dinkins walked in the door the day the recession started," she said. "As Mayor, he would have approved of any big development."
Those who sat at the table with Mr. Trump point to several things besides the relocated highway that they say will make Riverside South far preferable to the Trump City plan: fewer apartments in smaller buildings, design controls meant to assure a variety among the towers, guidelines to address energy conservation and other environmental issues, a street plan that adheres to the existing city grid and a 750-foot recreational pier.
"We're getting better than we would have gotten," said Roberta Brandes Gratz, a founder of Westpride, a writer on urban affairs and a board member of the planning corporation. "But it's clearly not the best. No one on the inside fooled themselves for a minute thinking they'd get the best, knowing that Trump was the developer."
To some, the Upper West Side is winding up with the worst of both worlds: the highway is still elevated, there is no unimpeded access to the river, and the buildings, while smaller than originally proposed, are far from demure.
Mr. Nadler does not mourn the passing of the park, however, calling it a $10 million-an-acre "private backyard for the people who live in these buildings."
He also asserts that he has at least hobbled the Riverside South project. Indeed he is not entirely convinced that he has not stopped it, likening the many announcements of its impending construction to those that once heralded Westway, the highway project along the Hudson River that was never built.
The beginning of Riverside South does seem to be on an ever-shortening but ever-receding horizon. In July 1994, Mr. Trump said construction could start within a year. In June 1996, he said construction could start within four months. In January, he said it could start within a week. So far, it has not.
A spokesman for the Buildings Department said the first Riverside South tower, designated Building C, had the necessary permits to begin. Besides Mr. Trump, the development team, Hudson Waterfront Associates, includes Henry Cheng, Vincent Lo, Charles Yeung, Edward Wong and David Chiu of Hong Kong.
Because Building C would rise from a rail yard about 30 feet below street level, it would have three basements so that its first floor would be level with the existing grade. Part of the building would be directly above an Amtrak right-of-way. Adjoining the tower on the west would be an elevated viaduct carrying a southern extension of Riverside Drive.
Kent L. Barwick, former president of the Municipal Art Society, believes the political winds may shift in favor of highway relocation once the towers of Riverside South emerge. "It will dawn on people that the developer is building what he wants anyway," Mr. Barwick said, "and they'll begin to ask what are they going to get out of it."
Having planned to step down from the chairmanship once construction began, Mr. Kahan finds himself asking the same question.
"I never would have wanted my name attached to a project that would leave an elevated highway standing along the Hudson River," he said. "This was a deal to get a park. I don't consider a piece of grass with an eight-lane highway running over it the kind of park we envisioned."

HEADLINE: TALKING BUSINESS WITH: CHARLES MILLARD;
Is Harbor Tunnel Worth the Billions?

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Even before the first million is spent or the first public hearing is scheduled, the city's harbor project seems a bit like a pipe dream. The proposal, by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is to revive heavy industry with a freight-rail tunnel under the New York Harbor and a container port for deep-hulled ships, all of which will cost billions of dollars.
While critics may find the idea an easy target for sniping -- reminders of the failed Westway project abound -- advisers to the Mayor say the plan demonstrates his ability to embrace planning on a huge scale and could provide a critical test of his standing in Albany and Washington, as well as with New York City voters. They say Mr. Giuliani is prepared to put every political muscle behind the proposal. 
 Chief among his economic advisers on the harbor project is Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. He readily acknowledges that political and financial hurdles loom large. A 39-year-old Republican and fiscal conservative, Mr. Millard served two terms on the City Council before being appointed head of the development agency in December 1995. He discussed the harbor plan in an interview.
Q. Various proposals for a harbor tunnel and expanded port have been around for more than 50 years. Why press the issue now?
A. The Mayor recognizes that the city's future cannot be built solely on white-collar jobs, and that not everyone can be an investment banker or new-media guru. We have the opportunity to capture maritime industry because of the dredging crisis and the increase in world trade. But we have got to seize the moment and build our infrastructure.
Q. What is the dredging crisis?
A. A new generation of supertankers will soon be in operation with drafts that require dredging down to 50 feet. New York City's advantage is that you can do that in Brooklyn and Staten Island much more cheaply than they could in Elizabeth, where you hit bedrock at 35 feet and the cost becomes astronomical.
Q. What would it cost?
A. It depends on what we build. Our consultants' study said it could go as high as $4 billion for a very large container port in Brooklyn and the tunnel. A more realistic first stage would be a smaller port in Brooklyn and the tunnel for about $2.5 billion. We could also theoretically put the port in Staten Island for about $1 billion, but that would be without a tunnel.
Q. Why do we need both?
A. The best synergy would be to go forward with both the hub port and tunnel, since it would capture the new generation of maritime industry and provide the city with its first freight-rail link with the rest of the country. But since we don't yet know where the port would be built -- in Howland Hook or Stapleton on Staten Island, or at various locations in Brooklyn -- it is probably too early to assess all the variables. A port in Staten Island could probably survive without a rail tunnel. But in Brooklyn, it probably could not.
Q. How would you pay for them?
A. We would need substantial Federal funding, and there is justification for it in the progress we would make in cutting down pollution and congestion. Everyone sees the benefit of taking trucks off the road. Our chances of getting Washington to pay for the hub port are not as good as for the tunnel. Our competition for the new generation of ships will be Norfolk and Halifax, both of which are already served by good rail links. But of the three, New York is best positioned because the huge market it serves in the tri-state area.
Q. Won't Congress see this as a battle between Norfolk and New York?
A. Our best hope is persuading Congress that there is only going to be one major hub port, and New York provides the best chance of beating out Halifax. It is clearly in the national interest to have more world trade in a United States port than in a foreign port. In any case, Federal funding is not going to happen without the cooperation of all elective officials.
Q. Who in particular?
A. Susan Molinari [Republican of Staten Island], who heads the House Rail Subcommittee, can play a critical role. She was one of the first public officials to be briefed on this project, and she understands that it is a complex undertaking in which not every detail has been worked out.
Q. But she has not said that she will support the plan. And Governor Pataki has been lukewarm.
A. This clearly can't be accomplished without the Governor. But the decision to fund it is still a couple of years away, and by then, we hope we can demonstrate that both the city and the state would be enriched. The tunnel and port would generate enough revenue in taxes and tolls to cover the cost of construction, and the overall benefits in jobs and reduced traffic congestion would far outweigh the costs.
Q. Does any of this stand a chance in a Republican Congress with little inclination to finance big projects in big cities?
A. If this was easy, it would have been done already. But the Federal Government is still supporting transportation projects. Witness the Alameda Corridor rail project in Los Angeles that the feds are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into. There will be a lot of competition from other cities and states with projects of their own, but the Mayor has a tremendous amount of credibility in the White House and Congress that should work to our advantage.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Quarterly Edition of Money Planned for Asian Readers

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Seeking to capitalize on what it says is an era of growing interest in personal financial planning in Southeast Asia, Time Inc. plans a quarterly Asian edition of Money magazine.
The 28-page, English-language quarterly, which will hit newsstands in the region on May 26, will be produced in Hong Kong by freelance journalists, bound into the Asian edition of Time and presented as Time Money, said Caroline Donnelly, an executive editor at Money in New York, who will be moving temporarily to Hong Kong to direct the coverage. 
 "It will be 100 percent local," she said. "Most American magazines publishing over there use essentially domestic content with a thin overlay of local content. This will all be produced by Asian reporters and writers."
Time's Asian edition has 133,494 readers in Southeast Asia, Ms. Donnelly said, almost half of the edition's total paid subscribers. In the six months ending Dec. 31, Time, a unit of Time Warner Inc., had 288,063 paid subscriptions for its Asian edition, said Ginny Sexton, communications director for the Audit Bureau of Circulations in Schaumburg, Ill.
The decision to produce Time Money comes at a time when workers and professionals in the region are feeling less secure about their futures and are also more willing to take on some investing matters themselves, Ms. Donnelly said. "All over Asia, planning for retirement has become an issue," she said. "The state is not there to take care of you as it once was. Real estate is so hideous that there is no room to put your elderly parents in your home."
She added: "This generation is in much more of a self-help mode. These are people who are young, with big ambitions for themselves and their families, who don't see prosperity or even security quite guaranteed to them the way it might have been in another time."
That may be, but one publishing expert in the region cautioned that an English-language publication would encounter obstacles.
"For that kind of magazine to have an impact, it has to be localized, and in the local language of whatever country it's in," said one media analyst in Hong Kong who works for a large Wall Street firm and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The South China Morning Post, a major daily newspaper in Hong Kong, plans to publish a personal-finance magazine called M, the analyst said. It will be written in Chinese, which is spoken by the majority of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.
At the same time, other English-language financial magazines are written and sold in Southeast Asia, including Asia Inc. and the Far Eastern Economic Review, both of which run features on personal finance and investing topics.
Ms. Donnelly said publishing in every language spoken in the seven countries where Time Money will be sold -- Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines -- would not be possible economically. And an analyst in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said Time Money might do well in Asian countries with no comparable, local personal-finance publication.
John Marcom, publisher of Time's Asia edition, said English-language publications were complementary to other media in the region and were attractive to advertisers because they were read by people who used English on the job -- generally, better-educated professionals. "We never pretend we're reaching the bulk of the Asian population," he said.
Articles in the planning stages include preparing for buying a house, paying for education and establishing retirement funds, Ms. Donnelly said. All of the articles will discuss the specifics of doing so in each of the countries where the magazine will be sold. The newsstand price for the Asian edition of Time, $35 (Hong Kong), or about $4.50 (United States), is not supposed to rise when the Money insert is included, Mr. Marcom said.
"Because this is a market that is more interested in certain topics than the market in the U.S., I expect we'll write a bit more on things like real estate, currency trading, small business and family businesses," Ms. Donnelly said. "We hardly ever write about family business."

HEADLINE: Face-to-Face Meetings Fill In Cyberspace Gaps

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 24

 BODY:
There was chatter of virtual this and virtual that, talk of "tele-presence" and the diminishing need to go anywhere but on line, mention of a future in which colleagues will meet as holographic projections around computer-generated conference tables.
But here is the paradox: The scientists and scholars doing the chatting, brought together in Seattle last week by the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, were doing it, primitive as it is coming to seem, in the flesh. 
 They had got together in part to talk about not needing to get together. And they and many other groups have been gathering bodily like this in growing numbers over the last three years, in the very period when the explosion of Internet traffic has led some of the digerati to increasingly question the necessity of -- and here the voice often drops in light contempt -- "being" in any particular place.
In fact, the convention business in the United States is booming, industry spokesmen say, and the boom is coming not only from the robust economy but also from an unexpected byproduct of the Internet: the growing desire of people who connect in on-line communities to gather in what some call "meatspace," the opposite of cyberspace, if only once a year.
William J. Mitchell, dean of the architecture school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was as if the ancient Greek agora -- the marketplace where people rubbed shoulders and gossiped -- is becoming a movable, temporary one, assembled in part to fill needs the Internet cannot.
"The more electronic communication expands and diversifies our circle of contacts, the more we're going to want to add the dimension of face-to-face," said Mr. Mitchell, author of "City of Bits," (M.I.T. Press, 1996), which explores how cyberspace is replacing real space in institutions like colleges and libraries.
On-line talk can be wonderfully cheap and convenient, he said (in an E-mail interview), but is even better when supplemented by "periods of face-to-face which serve to build trust and commitment."
That and other irreplaceable advantages of the flesh have many faces beaming in the convention industry.
The American Society of Association Executives estimates that the number of conventions, expositions and meetings held each year by members rose 11 percent from 1992 to 1995, to an annual total of well over 200,000, with particular growth in technology-related fields. And members expect the number of meetings to increase 39 percent this year over last, based on bookings and plans. Over all, meetings and conventions make up an $82 billion industry that is the 22d biggest contributor to the gross domestic product, according to the Convention Liaison Council, an industry group in Washington.
The number of people attending each meeting is multiplying, as well, prompting a scramble to expand convention centers in cities from Seattle to Boston. Comdex, the premier computer industry convention, drew more than 200,000 to its meeting last fall, and the National Restaurant Association convention recently attracted more than 100,000.
The initial worry among convention planners that the Internet might cut into business is just a memory.
"It boils down to the fact that nothing will ever replace the face-to-face peer interplay for which meetings are famous," said Ken Sommer, a spokesman for the American Society of Association Executives, which has more than 23,000 members and draws more than 5,000 to its annual convention. "The networking, the high-level learning, interacting with colleagues, exchanging information, doing business. Technology is merely enhancing meetings, not decreasing them."
Technology helps conventions by encouraging attendance through World Wide Web announcements or jazzing up sessions with fancy satellite video conferencing or laser pointers. On top of that, technology changes so rapidly that professionals flock to seminars, trade shows and conventions just to keep up, particularly in fields like medicine and consumer electronics.
Roy B. Evans is chief of the Professional Convention Management Association, in Birmingham, Ala., which teaches meeting management -- at meetings -- and has a major textbook. When he got into the business 37 years ago, Mr. Evans said, "the American College of Cardiology could have met in my bedroom. Today only three or four cities could handle it."
Mr. Evans backs the idea of quizzing participants after conventions and seminars to prove how useful the sessions have been. But he also agrees with "the old cliche that you learn more in the cocktail parties and hallways than at the sessions."
The power of the hallway could be observed at the science meeting in Seattle, where more than 5,000 scientists and science enthusiasts hobnobbed, lectured and listened for six days in a program so varied that the schedule was an inch thick.
Attendees were obviously well-wired; the remark most commonly overheard in conversation was "Send me an E-mail about it." But they also took such obvious pleasure just being in each other's company that most of the organized excursions to see the sights of Seattle were canceled.
And then there were the celebrities.
"There is no substitute for going to a meeting and being able to come back and say, 'Bill Gates came to my meeting,' " said Michael Strauss, the association's program director, referring to a talk given at the convention last Monday by Mr. Gates, the multibillionaire chief of Microsoft.
Dr. John Cantwell Kiley, a medical doctor with a Ph.D. in philosophy, took full advantage of that talk. He stood up afterward in the hall of 1,500 people and asked Mr. Gates whether, if he were blind, he would trade all his billions for sight. Mr. Gates said he would -- and offered his E-mail address for further discussion.
Dr. Kiley had made a point about the nature of true wealth directly to one of the wealthiest people in the world. But what he was really excited about was a long philosophical discussion with Benjamin Peng, a materials scientist who complimented him on his question.
"You get more activated, more excited, you see a whole world of possibilities when you meet in person," Dr. Kiley said. "We could have had an E-mail discussion, but I couldn't have seen the look in his eyes. There's something about it that's colorless and lifeless. You have to touch the flesh."
Though a boon for convention planners, the appeal of the flesh is an obstacle for the growing number of businesses whose employees work from home or in teams that collaborate over long distances.
At the science convention's session on such "virtual organizations," speakers discussed recent research showing that some virtual businesses fail simply because workers cannot develop trust in each other when they have never shared lunch and office chat.
Albert M. Erisman, director of technology at the Boeing Corporation, which used a virtual team to build its 777, noted that psychologists had found that co-workers needed to be less than 70 feet apart to share information casually. The challenge, Mr. Erisman and others said, is to create that "shared casual environment" over distance, perhaps through constant video connections.
But for now, he said, nothing beats "the old thing about hanging around the water cooler.
"Maybe we should encourage that," Mr. Erisman said, "so people can build trust and then go back and do their work in a decomposed environment."
He then paused at the podium for the applause, which came with no audio delay.

HEADLINE: President Asks Experts for Advice on the New Reality of Cloning

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Reacting to what the White House called the "very startling news" that scientists in Scotland had successfully cloned a mammal, President Clinton today asked a Federal bioethics advisory commission to review the research implications for human beings and report to him in 90 days.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said the commission, which was appointed last summer to review questions of biogenetic research, had not been asked to reach any conclusion or make specific recommendations for legislation or regulation, only to "review the legal and ethical implications of this technology." 
 Mr. McCurry said the President had been moved to act after reports that an embryologist at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh had replaced the genetic material of a sheep's egg with the DNA from an adult sheep and created a lamb that is a clone of the adult.
Mr. McCurry said he was not aware of any existing regulations that would ban such research on animals in this country.
Earlier in his Administration, Mr. Clinton signed an executive order banning the use of Federal money to create human embryos for research purposes, and Congress has also banned such financing.
In his letter to the commission today, Mr. Clinton said the Scottish breakthrough "represents a remarkable scientific discovery but one that raises important questions."
Mr. Clinton asked for "a thorough review of the legal and ethical issues associated with the use of this technology," and "recommendations on possible Federal actions to prevent its abuse."
"While this technological advance could offer potential benefits in such areas as medical research and agriculture," the President said, "it also raises serious ethical questions, particularly with respect to the possible use of this technology to clone human embryos."
Mr. McCurry said the commission, which is headed by Harold T. Shapiro, an economist who is the president of Princeton University, could consider a host of questions, including whether the current ban on federally financed human embryo creation should be expanded to cover private institutions.
"The advisory commission will be in a position to look at the issue of whether those doing private research through their own academic pursuits ought to be sensitive to these issues, or whether there are any policy implications that arise from these developments," Mr. McCurry said.
The commission was formed to look into biogenetic research, animal husbandry and the general area of biotechnology.
The lamb in Scotland was cloned from a 6-year-old ewe, using tissue taken from the ewe's udder. Most scientists had not thought that a whole mammal could be regenerated from mature body cells that were specialized for something other than reproduction.
While the research suggests that cloning humans might some day be possible, many genetic experts have said it would be unethical to try.
Others on the 15-member advisory commission include Alexander Capron, a professor of law at the University of Southern California; Eric J. Cassell, a professor of health at Cornell Medical College and an attending physician at New York Hospital; James Childress, a professor of religion and medical education at the University of Virginia, and David Cox, a professor of genetics and pediatrics at Stanford University and an expert on genetic defects, including Down syndrome.

HEADLINE: Colombia Lengthens a Drug Baron's Jail Sentence

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 24

 BODY:
A prison sentence for one of the leaders of Colombia's notorious Cali drug cartel has been extended, judicial officials said today.
The cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, 53, had received a light prison term Jan. 17 that would have allowed him to leave prison in as little as five years. But a judge in Bogota sentenced him to 23 years over the weekend and his final sentence may be as high as 30 years, judicial officials said. 
 His original sentence, which prompted protests by the United States, was handed down in Cali.
The new sentence, handed down on Saturday, involves the shipment of 330 pounds of drugs to Tampa, Fla., in 1989.
The United States will decide by late this week whether to certify that Colombia's effort to fight drug production and trafficking has been effective. It is widely expected not to certify Colombia for the second consecutive year, continuing and perhaps expanding economic sanctions as a result.
An estimated 80 percent of cocaine used in the United States is grown or processed in Colombia, and the leaders of drug organizations have repeatedly received light sentences or have been suspected of operating their drug businesses from prison.
Mr. Rodriguez and his older brother Gilberto are leaders of the Cali drug cartel, which allegedly helped finance President Ernesto Samper's 1994 election campaign and once controlled up to 80 percent of the world's cocaine trade. Gilberto Rodriguez's five-year sentence is being appealed by the Government and may also be increased substantially.
A governing party lawmaker said today that Colombia should take reprisals against American interests in the country if the United States imposes economic sanctions.
Senator Amilkar Acosta of Mr. Samper's Liberal Party said he and other lawmakers had drafted a bill that would allow Mr. Samper to take unspecified action against American interests throughout Colombia.
"For every measure that the United States adopts affecting the country's economy, the Colombian Government ought to respond in kind with respect to U.S. interests in Colombia," he said. "We're talking about investments and exports."

HEADLINE: Little Progress in Talks, Yet Albright Is Hopeful on China Ties

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 24

 BODY:
After a visit filled with symbols of warmth and courtesy but little progress on contentious issues like missile sales and human rights, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that she was "more encouraged than when I arrived" about the possibility of a more congenial relationship with China.
American officials had said they expected no dramatic concessions on a day in which the Chinese cremated Deng Xiaoping, and there were none. But Ms. Albright's first talks as Secretary of State with Mr. Deng's successors were characterized as frank and detailed discussions of the long list of issues that have often confounded the relationship. She said she came away with a strong feeling that the Chinese want to pursue and improve their relationship with the United States. 
 When Mr. Deng died during Ms. Albright's travels, she said that she had expected her visit to China to be postponed. She saw the Chinese leadership's willingness to have her come on a working visit at this time as "a positive sign," she said. Her predecessor, Warren Christopher, did not visit China for the first 18 months of President Clinton's first term, a lapse that seemed symbolic of the President's drift on China policy in his first term.
Ms. Albright tried, at an evening news conference, to walk a fine line between showing that she was not cowed by the Chinese and expressing courtesy toward a country in mourning. President Jiang Zemin sought to solidify his position after the death of Mr. Deng. In eight months the issue will be decided at a Communist Party Congress.
On human rights, American officials said that there was "no meeting of the minds," and that no breakthroughs were imminent.
"Human rights is the area in which we've seen the least progress," a senior official said. The official noted that of eight political prisoners on a list given to the Chinese last July, the Chinese have released some on medical or other grounds, but not a majority.
The names of specific dissidents were not raised, American officials asserted, because the Chinese have the list and are well aware of it. Ms. Albright said the discussion of human rights was "extensive" and that the Chinese were aware of the importance of the issue to Washington.
Still, American officials said they had no indication that the Chinese intended to sign two international convenants on political and social rights and no indication that talks would begin again soon with the International Committee of the Red Cross about visits to Chinese prisons. Consequently, they said, Washington expects to co-sponsor another resolution condemning China's human-rights practices when the United Nations Human Rights Commission meets in Geneva in March or April.
Ms. Albright said that she "told it like it is," and American officials said she led off her conversations on human rights with the line: "I've come a long way, so I must be frank." Foreign Minister Qian Qichen thanked her for her frankness, while Prime Minister Li Peng was described as taking a generally positive tone, when he has in the past been "sarcastic, acerbic and dismissive," a senior official said.
Mr. Jiang was described as "sober and statesmanlike" as he broke away from working on a speech for a memorial ceremony on Tuesday for Mr. Deng.
While a senior American official said Mr. Jiang seemed "very much, as the Chinese put it, the core of the leadership," a European diplomat here described this period as the closest analogy in China to an election campaign. Both agreed that Mr. Jiang had to stress a continuity of policy after Mr. Deng's death, and not risk significant concessions.
Touching on another sticky topic, Ms. Albright announced that the Chinese had set a date in mid-March for a new round of expert talks with the Americans on questions involving the spread of nuclear and missile technology and the export of products that could be used for chemical weapons.
She welcomed the Chinese willingness, since last May 11, to forbid the export of nuclear technology to internationally unsafeguarded sites in Pakistan and elsewhere, but she and other American officials said the Chinese had to do more to restrain the spread of missile parts and technologies, as well as of chemical weapon "precursors."
American officials said she specifically warned the Chinese about missile and chemical exports to Iran and Pakistan and the sale of advanced conventional weapons to Iran, and said "This could be a problem in our relations."
Ms. Albright had a detailed discussion of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, telling the Chinese that Washington wants a smooth transition that respects Hong Kong's autonomy, freedoms and capitalism. She also discussed China's more promising recent offer to adjust its economy to make a more acceptable application to join the World Trade Organization; the growing annual American trade deficit with China, now nearly $40 billion a year by disputed American figures, and relations with Taiwan, where Beijing has cooled its invective against President Lee Teng-hui.
Ms. Albright said she wanted to demonstrate President Clinton's commitment to improved relations. "My main mission is to engage with China and make them realize we want them to be part of our international community," she said. "There is no question our relations with the Chinese are a key to stability as we go into the 21st century."
But after nearly five hours of talks with President Jiang, Mr. Li and Mr. Qian, there was little hard progress to present.
She announced, as expected, that Vice President Gore will visit Beijing next month, probably after he visits Japan in the last week of March, and that Foreign Minister Qian would then visit Washington. Presidents Jiang and Clinton have agreed to schedule state visits, with Mr. Jiang probably coming to the United States in November and Mr. Clinton coming here in 1998, but the official dates remain unfixed.
Mr. Qian, at a joint news conference, said that "recently progress has been made" in relations between China and the United States. He said he hoped Ms. Albright's visit would "mark a good beginning for continued improvement and development" this year.

HEADLINE: MAJORITY LEADER PROPOSES A PANEL ON INFLATION INDEX

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, proposed a commission to find a way to fix the Government's main inflation gauge today, providing possible political cover for a deal that would help balance the budget by reducing cost-of-living increases for Social Security.
Mr. Lott's statement was the first specific proposal from a Republican leader to solve the problems with the Consumer Price Index, which many economists believe overstates inflation and leads the Government to overcompensate benefit recipients by billions of dollars a year. It seemed intended to draw the Clinton Administration into a shared effort to resolve the issue, which holds great political peril for both parties but could yield some of the savings that many in Congress think would be necessary to eliminate the Federal budget deficit. 
 Mr. Lott said the panel of experts he has in mind should make a specific recommendation for a cost-of-living adjustment, and that Congress and the White House should accept it. "I think we will do it," Mr. Lott said. "I think it should be done."
White House officials were noncommittal in their response but did not criticize Mr. Lott's idea.
"Our goal is to find the best broad-based technical agreement on this technical issue," said Gene Sperling, the chairman of the White House's National Economic Council. "We have not ruled in or out any specific means for exploring where that agreement lies."
Any reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment made to Social Security and other benefit payments would probably be small at first -- less than $100 a year for most recipients -- but could build over time to thousands of dollars a year. Powerful lobbying groups like the American Association of Retired Persons have warned that they would vigorously oppose any adjustment that was not based on rigorous technical study and have warned against engineering a reduction in the payments as a political solution to balancing the budget.
Wary of angering senior citizens and other constituencies yet intrigued by the potential fiscal benefits, the Administration has held the position that there are problems with the index that need to be fixed, but that any change should be the result of a consensus among economists.
Leaders of the two parties have been maneuvering for the last several months to find a way to deal with the issue without leaving themselves to suffer the political consequences alone. In endorsing the idea of a commission, Mr. Lott was clearly hoping to accelerate the tempo of what will no doubt continue to be a delicate political dance without directly exposing himself or his party to the attacks that would inevitably be unleashed on a detailed proposal for reducing cost-of-living payments.
"If the number is accurate, leave it alone," Mr. Lott said. "If it's understated, fix it. If it's overstated, fix it."
Speaking at a conference of the National Association of Broadcasters, Mr. Lott said he would like to see a cost-of-living formula developed by a group of four "graybeards" -- presumably prominent economists -- who would be chosen by the White House and the Congressional leadership with advice from Senator William V. Roth, the Delaware Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York.
Mr. Lott, who made the proposal in response to a question from the audience of broadcast executives, said he would want to see the commission get to work quickly and make its recommendations this year. Such a timetable could enable any change in the formula to be accounted for in negotiations to balance the budget.
The idea of a nonpartisan commission of experts was first floated several months ago by Michael J. Boskin, a Stanford University economist and former Bush Administration adviser. Mr. Boskin led a Congressionally appointed commission that concluded in December that the price index overstates inflation by about 1.1 percentage points a year. The index rose 3.3 percent last year.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, gave his support to a commission last month, saying it could determine the proper cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security and other Federal benefit programs each year while the technical experts at the Bureau of Labor Statistics continue to refine the price index.
The Consumer Price Index attempts to measure inflation by tracking the prices of a "market basket" of products meant to approximate typical consumer purchases. Although it was never intended as a broad cost-of-living index, it has been widely used as one, and currently is the basis not just for annual increases in Social Security and other benefits, but for adjusting tax brackets for the effects of inflation and for determining wage increases under many union contracts.
By reducing outlays for benefits and generating higher tax revenues, any reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment below the current forecast for the price index would go a long way toward solving the nation's fiscal difficulties.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that a 1 percentage point reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment would narrow the deficit by $195 billion over the next five years. In 2002, the year by which both parties have pledged to balance the budget, it would save $63.5 billion, about a third of the $188 billion deficit projected for that year.
Social Security recipients would be most directly affected by any change to the cost-of-living formula. Social Security payments for this year were calculated on the basis of a 2.9 percent increase in the index over a certain period last year.
If that increase had been 1.1 percent lower, as advocated by the Boskin commission, the average monthly payment would have gone from $724 to $737 rather than to $745 -- a difference of $8 a month. But the effect would build on itself each year, with the difference ultimately amounting to thousands of dollars a year for each recipient.
With both parties eager to reach a balanced budget agreement but loath to give up their priorities to do so -- sweeping tax cuts for Republicans, education and health care initiatives for Democrats -- the appeal of an adjustment to the price index has grown strong in Congress.

HEADLINE: Success in Cloning Hardly Insures Profit

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Shares in PPL Therapeutics P.L.C. soared on the London Stock Exchange yesterday, following the news over the weekend that scientists in the tiny Scottish biotechnology company, in collaboration with researchers at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, had successfully cloned a sheep. Its shares rose 16.4 percent yesterday, closing at 3.875, up 52.5 pence.
But despite investors' enthusiasm, there is often a vast gulf between a scientific breakthrough and a marketable product. Analysts note that the biotechnology industry's short history is littered with the remains of companies that shined in the laboratory, but came up short on the route to sales success. 
 PPL has the rights to use the jointly developed cloning technology to create genetically altered animals that would produce pharmacologically useful proteins in their milk. The company has applied for, but not yet received, patents on this technology.
The analysts warn that an investment in PPL is subject to technology risk, because the use of genetically altered animals may not be the best way to make drugs. There is patent risk, as well, plus all the other caveats that apply to a young company.
Despite yesterday's run-up in PPL's stock, the shares remain below the 4.50 price of the initial public offering last June. PPL sold 7.8 million shares at that time, raising 33 million, which it said it would use for the development of its leading product candidates. With 22.4 million shares, the offering gave PPL a market capitalization of 100.6 million. It PPL said at the time of the offering that it expected no earnings from operations for at least five years. Indeed, it said that directors estimated that net cash outflows over the next two years, taking interest receivables into account, would be 17 million to 22 million. At the time, the company reported 1995 revenue of 4.47 million and an operating loss of 1.73 million plus carry-forward losses of 7.16 million.
PPL does not have American depository receipts, but investors can buy its shares through many full-service brokers.
The company has already produced genetically altered animals for drug production using an older technology, and has one drug in the first phase of clinical trials in association with its corporate partner, Bayer of Germany. The most comparable company, the Genzyme Transgenics Corporation of Framingham, Mass., which is 48 percent owned by the Genzyme Corporation, has one drug that has completed first-phase trials, in partnership with Hoechst Marion Roussel and Sumitomo Metal Industries. But that is a long way from market, too; three phases are required. Genzyme Transgenics closed yesterday at $9.625, up $1, in Nasdaq trading.
While it is easy for investors to be attracted by scientific advances, most drug candidates -- 9 out of 10 by some counts -- fail. Short of failure, companies with stellar science can otherwise prove disappointing.
Two years ago, Athena Neurosciences of South San Francisco achieved a breakthrough when it developed a genetically engineered mouse that could be given Alzheimer's disease, providing the long-sought animal model for studying the disease and for measuring the efficacy of possible drugs. But Alzheimer's was a distant target, and Athena had a difficult time raising capital for nearer-term projects, so last year it agreed to be acquired by the Elan Corporation of Ireland, which specialized in drug-delivery technology.
Whole categories of genetic engineering have been slow to pan out. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health, under the direction of Dr. W. French Anderson, performed gene therapy in 1990 on two girls, 4 and 9, who lacked a critical immune-system enzyme, adenosine deaminase, a deficiency that gave rise to "the boy in the bubble" syndrome. The girls now lead relatively healthy lives, but there are still no commercially available gene-therapy products, nor is any expected soon.
Although PPL's scientists had published reports in peer-reviewed journals of their work cloning mammals at earlier stages in the process, these received scant attention from financial analysts, perhaps because of the remote likelihood of economic success. The company's June 1996 prospectus makes only passing reference to this work, dwelling instead on PPL's current process for expressing therapeutic proteins in the milk of genetically altered animals, and its purported advantages in relation to alternatives.
James McCamant, editor of the Agbiotech stock letter, had written on PPL before last weekend, but he does not recommend buying the stock. "This announcement doesn't increase the value of the company significantly; it just attracts attention," he said. Even if one believes PPL is a worthy investment, "now is not the time to buy it, when the stock's up on the announcement."
And Mr. McCamant is not sure that PPL's business strategy is ever likely to create large returns. "They are clearly a pioneer, but what they are doing is basically being a production house for other companies," he said. "The profits you can make in doing that are constrained by the fact that there are lots of other ways to make drugs. You're not going to get monumental profits producing proteins in milk because there are so many other ways to do it."
Today's big biotechnology drugs, like Amgen Inc.'s Epogen, or Activase from Genentech, are genetically engineered copies of naturally occurring proteins, which are produced in yeast, bacteria or mammal cells that are cultivated in huge fermenters. Genetically altered animals hold the promise of producing greater amounts of protein for less cost, but this is by no means a sure thing. The fermentation process has come down in cost as it has become more common. In addition, experiments have shown that genetically altered plants can also produce therapeutic proteins, and plants are far less costly to produce than sheep or goats.
It is also not clear that PPL's cloning technique, breakthrough though it is, gives the company an equally clear competitive advantage. Genzyme Transgenics has already produced more than 25 different proteins in genetically altered animals, and has a broad array of partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies. Pharming Inc., a privately held company in the Netherlands, has used altered cows to produce human lactoferrin, a natural antibiotic, as well as human collagen, a structural protein used in cosmetic and surgical processes.
"PPL will have a proprietary method that will give it an advantage," said Carl Gordon, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly, noting that the cloning technique should lead to more consistent protein production than existing processes. "But its competitors are still making good progress, and it's not clear, a priori, that doing it PPL's way is necessary," he said. "It's not like PPL has a monopoly."

U.S. May Punish Mexico For Drug Corruption
American officials said Mexico might for the first time lose its status as a country that cooperates in the effort against drugs because of recent disclosures about ties between Mexican officials and drug traffickers. Mexico's Attorney General, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, said that 36 employees had been dismissed from the federal drug agency and that every remaining staff member was being scrutinized for possible corruption.

Albright Meets China's Leaders
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she "told it like it is" in her meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China and other leaders in Beijing, talking frankly on controversial issues like weapons sales and human rights. Little concrete progress was made, but Ms. Albright said she was "encouraged" that relations with China could improve. She said Vice President Al Gore would visit China next month. A11 

Thousands of people quietly watched the motorcade carrying the body of Deng Xiaoping, draped with the red flag of the Chinese Communist Party, down Beijing's Avenue of Eternal Peace to a crematory. A memorial service for Mr. Deng drew 10,000 of the Communist elite to the Great Hall of the People as sirens wailed throughout Beijing. A10
 
A New Computer for Russia
Russia's nuclear weapons establishment said it had obtained an I.B.M. supercomputer despite an American ban on such exports. Russian officials said that they had made the purchase through a middleman, whom they did not identify, and that they were eager to buy more such machines. They said the ban on nuclear tests made them need supercomputers to maintain the reliability of their nuclear stockpile. A7
 
Televised Apology in Seoul
South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, took to television with what he called "agony and sorrow" to apologize for a loan scandal that has resulted in the arrest of four of his close associates. Mr. Kim also said he was ashamed that his second son, Kim Hyun Chul, had become embroiled in the scandal. A11
 
Peru Security Forces Criticized
President Alberto K. Fujimori publicly criticized Peru's intelligence service and national police for the first time, saying they failed to act on information that Tupac Amaru rebels were transporting weapons from the jungle to Lima in preparation for an attack similar to their hostage-taking raid on the Japanese Ambassador's residence in December.

Search for Missing in Chechnya
The Russian and Chechen authorities agreed to work together to search for almost 1,500 missing Russian soldiers and civilians. Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen leader, promised to help search for the missing, exhume unidentified bodies and update missing-in-action lists. Chechen refugees have begun returning home from neighboring areas. (AP)

G.O.P. Leader Offers Inflation Index Proposal
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, suggested setting up a commission to revise the nation's main gauge for inflation. His proposal, the first by a Republican leader on the subject, could serve as a cloak for a political deal that could help balance the budget by limiting cost-of-living increases for Social Security. A1
 
Immigrants Elude Checks
Congressional officials said the Clinton Administration had allowed more than 180,000 immigrants to become American citizens before checks for criminal records had been completed. Another 71,557 immigrants whose applications were checked became citizens despite having arrest records. A1
 
Court Takes Credit Union Case
The Supreme Court agreed to review a lower-court ruling that placed sharp limits on the membership of Federally chartered credit unions. It declined to hear a case on the validity of referendums that instruct members of Congress to support a constitutional amendment on term limits. A18
 
Chemical Warning Not Pursued
The Central Intelligence Agency provided the Army with detailed warnings more than five years ago that American troops might have been exposed to nerve gas in the demolition of an Iraqi ammunition depot shortly after the Persian Gulf war, but because of errors by the Army, the information was not confirmed at the time, a Pentagon inquiry determined. A16
 
Federal Terrorist Watch
The F.B.I. issued a "terrorist threat advisory" after receiving reports that two or three men had been seen in a small Texas town with a rental truck apparently containing thousands of pounds of fertilizer and 30 gallons of diesel fuel. It also released a sketch of one of the men. The F.B.I. said it could not immediately establish the validity of the report, but officials noted that the material described was sufficient to produce a bomb similar to the one that exploded in Oklahoma City nearly two years ago, killing 168 people. A12
 
Similarities in Atlanta Bombs
Officials said they had found similarities between the bombings of a gay nightclub and an abortion clinic in the Atlanta area. But the investigators also said that there were differences between the bombs and that agents were far from concluding that the same person or group was responsible for both. A13
 
College Plan Is Faulted
Tax policies to make college more affordable, like those proposed by President Clinton, would help the middle class but do little for the poor, two research groups say. Their study, to be released today, says that a program would have to focus on need to have an effect on people who do not now send their children to higher education. A14

Empire State Gunman Is Said to Have Acted Alone
Investigators began to construct a more detailed portrait of Ali Abu Kamal, the 69-year-old Palestinian who shot seven other people and himself on the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building. The portrait suggested an emotionally bruised man who acted alone rather than in concert with any political or terrorist group. A1
 
Officials at the Empire State Building said they were installing metal detectors and an X-ray scanning machine to check visitors to the observation deck. Investigators said that Mr. Abu Kamal had visited the observation deck the day before the shooting, but that they did not know why, or whether he had carried his gun. B5

HEADLINE: Ceremonies Honor Fliers Shot Down By Cuban Jets

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Exactly one year after the Cuban Air Force shot down two airplanes belonging to a Cuban exile group based here, a memorial squadron today returned to the scene of the attack, honoring the victims without incident despite warnings from the Cuban Government.
To commemorate the downing, leaders of exile groups dropped wreaths into the waters of the Florida Straits between 3:21 and 3:28 this afternoon. That was the precise moment that Cuban MIG's fired missiles at two small, unarmed Cessna airplanes belonging to Brothers to the Rescue, a group that specializes in searching for rafters fleeing Cuba. 
 Four Cuban-Americans died in the incident, which plunged relations between the United States and Cuba into a period of deepened hostility that has yet to lift. As a result of the attack, President Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton bill, which strengthened the American economic embargo against Cuba and, as a result, strained ties between the United States and some of its closest trading partners.
Today, Cuba stepped up patrols in the waters off Havana, but the Cubans kept their distance from a Coast Guard vessel sent to the attack area. Late last week, a spokeswoman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, Marianela Ferriol, warned that her Government would take "all measures necessary to prevent any violation" of Cuban airspace or waters.
Just hours after that statement, Washington warned both the Cuban Government and exiles here of their obligations under international law. While cautioning exile groups that any penetration of Cuban territory would be "playing with fire," the State Department also reminded the Cuban Government that such groups had a right to pay tribute to the victims in international waters.
Cuba maintains that it acted in self-defense last year after the exiles' planes deliberately violated the country's airspace. But American radar data and the eyewitness accounts of crew members and passengers on a cruise ship and a fishing boat that were in the area indicate that the attack took place in international waters, at least 8 miles beyond the 12-mile limit claimed by Cuba.
After an emotional memorial service at Opa-Locka Airport north of Miami, the home base of the fliers who died, the exile air squadron took off early this afternoon, with reporters from local television and radio stations tagging along. Flight organizers complained that the Federal Aviation Administration warned them in a pre-flight briefing that they were prohibited from using radio frequencies to make political statements directed at Cuba.
The aerial flotilla did not include the two aging British Provost jet fighters that a Cuban exile group here bought with the announced intention of flying them in the ceremonies today. The purchase provoked concern in Washington and led the Federal authorities to restrict the jets' flight plans to within 40 miles of Key West.
"It was intended as a symbolic flight," said Ramon Saul Sanchez, the leader of Movimiento Democracia, the group that obtained the planes. Mr. Sanchez said the group changed its plan "so as not to compromise the other civilian planes and so that Castro won't have an excuse" to attack the memorial squadron.
Other commemorations took place on land and at sea here. Several Spanish-language radio and television stations observed periods of silence this afternoon, and hundreds of people attended memorial Masses or highly politicized mourning ceremonies.
During at least one Mass today in Havana, the names of the four victims were read out. But leaders of dissident groups said Cuban state security had squelched efforts to organize any larger commemoration, and relatives of the dead men still in Cuba have complained of a recent increase in official harassment.

HEADLINE: New York Study Finds Uninsured Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In a report that has implications for the entire country, researchers have found that the number of New Yorkers without health insurance has jumped in the last five years.
One quarter of New York City residents under 65 now have no health insurance at all: the exact figure is 24.8 percent, up from 20.9 percent five years ago. Surprisingly, most of the uninsured hold full-time jobs. 
 More and more companies have curtailed health benefits as the cost of health care has gone up, requiring employees to contribute heavily to premiums, especially for family members.
Others have stopped offering health coverage altogether. So while government insurance programs have continued to cover the elderly and large numbers of the poor, low-income workers and their families are increasingly vulnerable.
Most uninsured families make between $15,000 and $45,000 a year, the report found. The number of children without insurance has gone up twice as fast as the number of adults.
"This is a crisis that is growing exponentially," said Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, who released report. "But unlike kids being shot on the streets, the rising uninsured rates among kids and working families is a quiet crisis that is too easy to overlook."
One of President Clinton's main goals in his failed health plan was to provide health coverage for the 38 million Americans who lacked it. He and Hillary Rodham Clinton repeatedly showcased poor working people who were uninsured. But since that plan failed, their plight has faded into the background. Although managed care companies have effectively taken up the President's call to practice more cost-conscious medicine, they have little incentive to worry about the uninsured.
By 1995, the number of Americans without health insurance had grown to 40.3 million, or 17.4 percent of the population under 65, the Employee Benefit Research Institute said.
In New York State, the percentage of people under 65 who are uninsured was 17.2 percent, up from 13.9 percent in 1990. The Public Advocate's office said the higher rate in New York City reflects a concentration of the working poor and immigrants, who tend to be in low-paying jobs and are not always eligible for government insurance. Many of New York's poor are part of the underground economy, meaning they are paid in cash, their earnings are unrecorded and they do not receive benefits. The proportion of people without health insurance is even higher in California (22.7 percent) and Texas (27 percent), states that have large immigrant populations.
This growth in the number of people without medical insurance comes at a particularly inopportune time. In the past, such people have relied on emergency rooms or clinics that dispensed care cheaply or free. But now, even that option is becoming less available, since hospitals under pressure to cut costs are increasingly unwilling and unable to dispense care below cost to the uninsured.
"Everyone's going to be competing for paying patients, but there's no one looking out for the uninsured," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospitals Association, an industry group. "And with the squeeze on doctors and hospitals, the problem will become more acute as you go along."
The state has earmarked tens of millions of dollars to compensate hospitals for charity care, but Mr. Raske said that with the number of uninsured New Yorkers growing, that pool could be overwhelmed. He said his organization is about to begin a national campaign to highlight the growing number of people who lack health insurance, hoping to encourage a national solution.
Angela Pollatos of Washington Heights in northern Manhattan is typical of those who have lost insurance in the last five years. Her husband is a painter, working for a midsize company, who made $30,000 last year. His company does not offer health insurance.
Three years ago, when Mrs. Pollatos was working, the family bought private insurance through a government-subsidized program. But the premiums were rising quickly, and when Mrs. Pollatos stopped working after the birth of a son, the family could no longer afford the program. Mrs. Pollatos has tried to buy insurance, but has been discouraged by the cost: $500 a month for the cheapest family plans. She found free coverage for her 2-year-old son at a health maintenance organization, the Bronx Health Plan, through a state program that offers insurance to cover outpatient care for children of the working poor.
But she had close to $3,000 in medical bills after she suffered an ectopic pregnancy last year. Her husband, who lives with chronic pain in his shoulder, cannot afford a scan that might determine the cause. Patients without insurance coverage tend to delay care so that minor illnesses fester, becoming more serious problems, health experts say.
"We try to put a little money away each month in case for God's sake something happens," Mrs. Pollatos said. "Then your stomach hurts and you go to the doctor and you use it all up."
Mr. Green's report, "Who Are New York City's Uninsured?" contains this information:
*Fewer than half of New York City residents now have private insurance, down from almost 60 percent five years ago.
*The proportion of children who have no medical insurance rose to almost 20 percent in 1995, up from 14 percent in 1990, despite new state programs to subsidize insurance for children.
*About 22 percent of the uninsured work for companies of more than 1,000 employees, contradicting the conventional wisdom that large companies usually offer comprehensive benefits.
*Forty-one percent of men and 28.4 percent of women between 18 and 34 were uninsured in 1995. People in this age group are the most likely to be uninsured.
Having failed at systemwide reform, Mr. Clinton has had to settle for piecemeal change. Last August, Congress passed legislation that allows workers to keep their health insurance if they lose or change jobs, and forbids insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Statistics in the Green report predate this legislation, but health experts doubt that these provisions will reverse a quickly growing trend.
Many say that the situation could worsen in the short term, since many states, including New York, are trying to trim Medicaid rolls.
Doctors who run primary care clinics say that since the failure of the Clinton health plan, the trend has been in one direction: growth in the number of uninsured.
At the Covenant House medical clinic in midtown Manhattan, doctors say they are suddenly treating patients from working-class families, in addition to their usual patients, poor homeless teen-agers. The doctors say that when they advertised their free medical clinic on the subways last spring, they were overwhelmed by the response.
"We are seeing college kids who live at home but were off the family budget, who saw the ad on their way to C.C.N.Y. and have no other access to health care," said Bruce J. Henry, the executive director of Covenant House. "We are seeing kids falling through the cracks all across the spectrum."

Social Security Fairness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell (Economic Scene, Feb. 20) quotes me as saying that the provisions in the Committee for Economic Development's privatization plan for Social Security "wouldn't stop those already retired from ripping us off." I certainly did not say those words. I said that my plan, which I formulated with Jeffrey D. Sachs, is one of the few that "doesn't let the elderly off the hook with respect to resolving Social Security's long-term financing crisis." 
 I don't think the elderly are some cabal that is using Social Security to steal from us baby boomers and our children. Indeed, many of those Americans most concerned about unbridled growth in entitlements are elderly.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Stedman Graham;
'They Used to Call Me Oprah's Boyfriend'

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
HE looked and talked as if he had just stepped out of one of those glossy photos in Fortune or Forbes of perfectly pressed, unflappable corporate types. And as he glided into Nobu, the post-modern Japanese restaurant in lower Manhattan that is a daily destination for perfectly pressed, unflappable corporate types, Stedman Graham was all facts and figures.
This is the same Stedman Graham who is known to television talk-show watchers (not to mention millions of People and Ebony magazine readers and supermarket-tabloid addicts) as Oprah Winfrey's longtime boyfriend. The athletic, 6-foot-6 man who has stood by the talk-show queen as she has gone from thick to thin. The man who was briefly engaged to her. The man who may or may not have objected to intimate parts of an autobiography, which she pulled in 1993 before it could be rushed into print. The man who overcame an angry childhood that left him as an adolescent and adult with cripplingly low self-esteem. 
 He was at Nobu for one of his favorite meals: sushi a la carte. Like his modular lunch of yellowtail and salmon rolls, Mr. Graham was carefully assembled, from his spit-polish size 15 loafers to his meticulously manicured fingernails.
But he was also there, for once, to talk. After years of being swallowed up in Ms. Winfrey's sizable shadow, Mr. Graham, who turns 46 next week, said he wanted the world to know that he is not just, as McCall's magazine recently put it, "Mr. Oprah."
He said more than once that he is his own man, with his own ideas and dreams. He is quick to remind anyone who appears unaware of it that he is the founder, president and chief operating officer of S. Graham & Associates, a management, marketing and consulting firm that specializes in sports. He shifted easily from topic to topic, from how men need not feel threatened by relationships with women who earn more than they do to his conviction that the chorus of those who say they speak for black America sorely needs new voices and new messages.
"We have lost leadership in our African-American communities," he said. "The old guard has not brought in any new players. They've closed out younger people who could take their places and create some opportunities and change the way we think and keep the movement going."
He spoke passionately about what he sees as the failure of the black middle class to return to struggling inner-city neighborhoods and help people who still live there. "No one would ever think that I think this way," Mr. Graham then remarked.
His opinions do not surprise Les Brown, the author and motivational speaker, who is also married to a woman better known than he, the recording star Gladys Knight. "Stedman is a deep thinker, a guy who has special perceptions of things," said Mr. Brown, who has helped Mr. Graham sharpen his public speaking. "He is a warm person and a guy who speaks from his heart."
The newest of Mr. Graham's corporate hats seems to please him most. He is the president of the marketing firm Graham Gregory Bozell. Before lunch, Mr. Graham was listening to proposals by his staff at the company's headquarters on West 23d Street (his world spins on a double axis of New York, where Wall Street is, and Chicago, where Ms. Winfrey is). One presentation envisioned festivals to showcase African art, music, food, history and business opportunities. Another was for a sports resource center at George Washington University, where Mr. Graham directs sports seminars and is active in marketing.
"We could change the whole culture of sports," Mr. Graham said. During the presentation he said quietly, "exciting," "great synergy." He attended Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Tex., on a basketball scholarship. On graduation with a Bachelor of Science in social work, disappointed not to be drafted by the National Basketball Association, he played in the 1970's in the European Basketball League, where, a publisher's biography states, "he starred for several years."
At lunchtime, he was talking about his public image. "People didn't know anything about what I do or what I'm involved in," he said, sipping hot tea. "They say, 'Wow, where did this guy come from?' "
"I'm stepping out," Mr. Graham said in a voice both gentle and insistent. "I know there is going to be a backlash at some point," he added, noting that some people might have a problem with his having "equal billing with one of the most powerful women in the world." In the eyes of some, Mr. Graham said, that would "make me a dangerous man."
Mr. Graham's beginnings were modest. He is the second son of a house painter and grew up in predominantly black Whitesboro, N.J. He is himself the divorced father of a daughter, Wendy Graham, 21. He said that he is determined to "help other people to reach their full potential." If that means cultivating a better-known public persona, then Mr. Graham, who has a master's in education from Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., says he is ready.
He stepped into the spotlight this month when he became the face of the National Black Fine Art Show, a landmark gathering of black artists, dealers and art. Without Ms. Winfrey at his side (although she attended), Mr. Graham chatted with reporters, as television crews trailed him past watercolors, oils and sculptures. Graham Gregory Bozell was a sponsor of the three-day show at the Puck Building in SoHo.
Next week, he will start a book publicity tour, promoting "You Can Make It Happen: A Nine-Step Plan for Success" (Simon & Schuster). He is proud of this semiautobiographical volume, written with Wes Smith. Over lunch Mr. Graham often referred to the book to illustrate his point, for instance, how for years he struggled with low self-esteem.
The book, he said, is an easy-to-follow road map of his journey from inner turmoil to freedom. "Being positive begins with eliminating the negative," one section begins, with all the obviousness of an old-fashioned Broadway show tune. But Mr. Graham, whose bedtime reading is business textbooks, said that reducing life's problems to building-block size helped him stand on his own.
"The crucial point for me, No. 1, was to examine myself," Mr. Graham said in low, mesmerizing tones. "To get some self-awareness and to stop looking at the external and start looking to the internal for answers."
His friend Julius Erving, the basketball great, said the book explains "success as a process that anyone with the desire for it can follow."
Mr. Graham credits Ms. Winfrey with helping him face down the demons rooted in his past. He recalled that he became angry after attending a party in Aspen, Colo., with Ms. Winfrey and other influential people who wanted to stand next to her. "As the night wore on," he writes, "I found myself getting pushed further and further away as they moved past me to get to her." Later, he wrote, "Oprah tried to make me understand that the real source of my pain was in my past."
He added that through Ms. Winfrey's patience, soul-to-soul talks and their support for each other, he found the childhood source of his pain: "I never imagined that I could be equal to white folks. I never imagined that I could feel that I was an equal."
Mr. Graham said none of his accomplishments would have been possible without great planning -- and he is an obsessive planner, scribbling out list after list of tasks to do.
"Oprah asked me the other day, she says, 'What are you doing?' " Mr. Graham recalled.
"I'm organizing," he told her.
"She says, 'I guess that's your word this year, huh?' "
Mr. Graham said he simply told her how busy he was. "That is why I have to organize," he said he told Ms. Winfrey. "She didn't say a word."
Mr. Graham's vision of himself as a self-made marketing entrepreneur is expanding. "They used to call me Oprah's boyfriend," he said with a barely concealed grin. "Some people call me Stedman now."
A self-described late bloomer, Mr. Graham said: "I'm finally a free man for the first time in my life. I have filled the hole in my heart."

HEADLINE: A TASTE OF: Boston;
A New Sense of Adventure Sweeps the Dining Scene

BYLINE: By RUTH REICHL

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
ON the night in May 1995 that Jasper White closed his restaurant, he walked in to discover a roomful of chefs. For weeks, cooks all over Boston had been reserving tables under assumed names, planning the surprise. "We couldn't just let the restaurant close without letting him know how much he meant to us," one said.
It is a typical restaurant story from a town that loves its chefs. People call them by their first names, as if they were members of the family, and they support Jasper, Lydia (Shire), Gordon (Hamersley) and Todd (English) with a passion that chefs in less loyal cities can only envy. And in Boston, chefs can always count on help from their friends. 
 "When someone in Boston opens a restaurant," said a New York transplant, Michael Schlow, "every other chef in town shows up to wish him well. It's the reason I came here: It makes working here extremely appealing."
Appealing as it was, that very clannishness kept others out. Boston liked its chefs home grown, and the city seemed too small, too closed, too fond of its existing restaurants to attract outsiders. For a long time, a mere handful of chefs were responsible for maintaining Boston's gourmet profile. But the recession ended a few years ago, and the restaurant scene exploded, changing all that. Older chefs expanded existing restaurants and opened new ones; younger chefs swept into town. At the same time, a new group of ethnic restaurants opened, making eating out in Boston more exciting than ever.
Last month I spent a few days exploring Boston's newer restaurants; here are a few of my favorites.
 
Cafe Louis
Forget everything you think you know about restaurants that are in clothing stores: The restaurant in the uppity Louis of Boston is different. Would you expect any less from a men's store so distinguished that celebrities routinely line up for the annual sale?
Louis occupies a historic Back Bay building, and the restaurant, which has its own entrance, has an elegant simplicity underlined by beautiful old-fashioned details. The bread baskets are hand-wrought; the lamps look like delicate evening bags.
The surprise of this restaurant is that despite its location, Cafe Louis is a far better place for dinner than for lunch. The chef, Mr. Schlow, who worked with Pino Luongo in Manhattan, favors serious French-inflected food, and while his lunch menu of salads, pastas and sandwiches is pleasant, it is far less ambitious than the dinner menu. And frankly, I was dazzled by some of his food.
One appetizer is a torchon of poached foie gras, beautifully presented with a compote of figs with hints of rosemary, reduced balsamic vinegar and a sprinkling of chunky grains of salt. The flavors are lovely. Mr. Schlow also makes a wonderful "tart" of lobster and mangoes, lightly sprinkled with dots of flying-fish roe and bathed in a piquant papaya vinaigrette. His tuna tartar is gorgeous, a sort of cake decorated with creme fraiche and a dab of caviar.
Mr. Schlow's entrees are decorative enough to mask their basic simplicity, but the strength of his cooking is the way he allows pure flavor to dominate. His garlic and herb-rubbed chicken, surrounded by caramelized baby beets and topped with a frizzle of fried sage leaves, is a perfect example.
The wine list is small but choice; the desserts are wonderful. Don't miss the bitter chocolate souffle.
There is a down side to Cafe Louis. Prices are high, the room could be more romantic and the service ranges from coldly pleasant at night to frenzied during the lunch rush.
Cafe Louis, 234 Berkeley Street, at Newbury; (617) 266-4680. Dinner entrees, $19 to $34.
 
Metropolis Cafe
"You ladies are the best customers I've ever had," our waiter at Metropolis kept saying as we ordered yet more food. The truth is, we just didn't want to leave. The small storefront restaurant in the South End may be modest, with low lights and a tile floor, but it has such a cozily comfortable quality you want to move right in.
This is one of those restaurants that give you prices in cents ($3.95) and serve garlicky olive oil instead of butter with the bread. The menu offers few surprises, but the food has an appealing honesty. My favorite dish was spaghetti cacio e pepe, a simple dish of spaghetti tossed with lots of garlic, cracked pepper and lashings of pecorino cheese. Perfectly cooked, it was served with an extremely generous hand. Tagliatelle with wild mushrooms arrived in a fine roasted garlic broth, and a creamy puddle of polenta with a fistful of sauteed mushrooms on top tasted pleasantly of thyme.
The chef, Seth Woods, a New York native who worked at the Union Square Cafe, does best when he is not tempted to add Asian touches, but few chefs in Boston seem able to resist the urge. I liked a hefty herb-crusted pork tenderloin served with a small mountain of mashed potatoes. Seared swordfish with lobster mushroom ragout and caramelized onion-sherry sauce turned out to be far simpler than the menu description made it sound, and I liked it very well. But sesame-crusted tuna with spicy peanut noodles was plain silly.
Best dessert: a rich chocolate pudding cake with the texture of Indian pudding and a scoop of ice cream melting in rivers across the top. The waiter watched with admiration as we finished every morsel.
Metropolis Cafe, 584 Tremont Avenue; (617) 247-2931. Dinner entrees, $12.50 to $17.95.
 
Elephant Walk
When I was in Boston, I was eating two lunches and two dinners every day, and I knew I had to pace myself. But I had a problem with Elephant Walk: I simply couldn't stop eating. The Cambodian food was so delicious that I kept taking just one more bite.
Near Brookline, this bright, open restaurant with its brick walls, plants and vaguely colonial look is a spinoff of the original restaurant in Somerville, Mass., opened by the De Monteiro family. Mr. De Monteiro was the Cambodian Ambassador to Taiwan in 1975, and when the Khmer Rouge took over, the family fled to France and opened a restaurant. When they moved to Boston, it seemed natural to serve both French and Cambodian food.
Cambodian cooking combines the delicacy of Vietnamese food with the vibrant power of the Thai kitchen. What impressed me most was the clarity of the flavors. You see this best in the appetizers, dishes like the soupe Phnom Penh, a beautiful bowl of broth filled with thin rice noodles, pieces of sliced pork, ground pork, bean sprouts, cilantro and fried garlic. Subtle and tasty, it gets extra punch from the hot sauce served on the side. Crisp spring rolls are served with lettuce, mint, basil, bean sprouts and a dish of tuk trey, the Cambodian condiment of fish sauce, vinegar, lime juice, sugar and garlic.
Nataing, little rice cakes, are served with an irresistible sauce of ground pork, coconut milk, peanuts, chilies and garlic. Nom krourk are rice pancakes with a gelatinous texture, topped with shredded shrimp, basil and cucumbers. The dish arrives with two dipping sauces: the ubiquitous tuk trey and another made of coconut milk.
There are a couple of terrific tofu dishes and a fine entree of shrimp in a sauce that mingles tamarind, lemon grass, cilantro, kaffir lime leaves and coconut milk.
Want to try the French food? Gorgeously translucent slices of tuna are served lightly breaded and very rare, with a pair of pretty chili sauces. Pork tenderloin is grilled over wood and served in a peppery cream sauce alongside a knot of long beans. Delicious as these dishes are, they lack the exotic appeal of the Cambodian side of the menu.
Elephant Walk, 900 Beacon Street, Boston; (617) 247-1500. Dinner entrees, $9.50 to $18.95.
 
Pignoli
If you haven't already been charmed by the sight of men making pasta in the window as you enter a restaurant, the slightly dizzy atmosphere of Lydia Shire's newest restaurant should do the trick. Adam Tihany designed the exuberant room, layering color texture and comfortable chairs with obvious delight. The lights that float above look like cartoon zeppelins.
But it was the food that won my heart. A beautiful antipasto selection offered marinated peppers, cured salmon, bresaola, olives and some of the best anchovies I have ever tasted. When I asked where they had come from, the chef, Daniele Baliani, who worked at Le Cirque and San Domenico in New York City, emerged from the kitchen. "They're good, aren't they?" he grinned. "They're Sicilian."
Pignoli serves a really original variation on the Caesar salad, combining celery with thin slices of pecorino cheese, fried celery root and even a celery aioli. Pastas are excellent. I was impressed with the robust, honest flavor of green basil tagliolini tossed with char-grilled tomatoes.
And Mr. Baliani is very good with risottos. I particularly liked a saffron risotto with small, garlicky shrimp and strips of bitter grilled treviso, the long-leaved radicchio.
At night, the restaurant's menu gets more robust, offering roasted loin of veal with dried cherries, or crisp salmon on stewed leeks and smashed potatoes.
Desserts are terrific, too. A dense chocolate tart is served with a rich scoop of gianduja ice cream, and a fine blood orange sorbet is paired with biscotti laced with pignoli.
Pignoli, 79 Park Plaza, at Arlington and South Charles Streets, (617) 338-7500. Dinner entrees, $20 to $28.
 
Lala Rokh
"If you were served this in a Persian home," said the waitress as she put down a dish of kashk-e-bademjan, "you would know that the family really respected you." No wonder; the appetizer of roasted eggplant and caramelized onions is a complex preparation, surrounded by minced beef and mint oil, with a drizzle of goat's milk yogurt running through the middle.
The owners, Azita Bina-Seibel and her brother Babak Bina, also have a chic Northern Italian restaurant called Azita's, but in this new restaurant they honor their Persian heritage. They have covered the walls with their own heirloom art and trained the staff in the finer nuances of the cuisine.
Persian cooks employ a flavor palate alternating sweet and bitter in a fascinating way. Yogurt is mixed with aromatic herbs, and meat is often combined with saffron, fruit and cinnamon.
Torshi, little relish side dishes, act much like chutneys in India. They include sir, whole garlics that have been aged in the sun; anbeh, a mango and tamarind relish, and bademjan, whole baby eggplants stuffed with garlic and herbs. Eaten with polos, classic dishes of rice mixed with meats and vegetables, they make the food especially fragrant. I particularly liked adass, a sweet polo combining veal, lentils, caramelized onions, currants and dates.
For dessert, don't miss the saffron ice cream, which is textured with nubby little lumps of frozen cream.
Lala Rokh, 97 Mount Vernon Street, Beacon Hill; (617) 720-5511. Dinner entrees, $12 to $16.

Rialto
If you reserve a table for 5:30, nobody in Boston laughs. This is pleasant for theatergoers but can make late-night dining dreary. "We were just going to call and see if you really wanted to come," said the hostess of one upscale restaurant when we appeared for our 8:45 reservation; an hour later, we were the only people in the place.
That is why I was so happy to walk into Rialto at 9 o'clock and find the place packed. Navigating the large dining room, I heard four languages, which combined with the clean lines and polished service to give the room a cosmopolitan air.
Rialto was opened two years ago by the team behind the late, much-beloved Michela's; it clearly knows what it is doing. The chef, Jody Adams, favors local, seasonal ingredients and is very adept with Boston's seafood. Even the excellent clams come with a pedigree. Ms. Adams steams them with fennel seed, dried cherry tomatoes and corona beans so big they could double for clams. It is a satisfying dish. She also makes an impressive Provencal fish soup with immense depth of flavor.
Terrine of Roquefort and mascarpone is served with poached pears, toasted walnuts and a decorative fluff of mache. An egg is coddled inside a potato. A tarte flambe, a sort of grilled pizza, would be much better if it contained fewer ingredients. Among the main courses, I liked the heady hotness of spaghetti with squid, squid ink, mussels, chilies and lots of garlic; it was spicy enough to take your breath away. Braised lamb shank is a great winter dish, a huge meaty bone surrounded by bacon, chestnuts and onions. Glazed veal sweetbreads are served with mashed potatoes, roasted squash and spiced pears. But the most interesting dish is made with local cod. Fresh cod is layered with lightly salted cod (made on the premises), and then wrapped in pancetta. The fish is served with a triangle of polenta and fresh greens. Fresh, original and entirely local, this is the sort of food that makes eating in Boston so exciting.
Rialto, in the Charles Hotel, 1 Bennett Street, Cambridge; (617) 661-5050. Dinner entrees, $19 to $29.
 
East Coast Grill
Anybody who wants to know what young Boston is eating should visit the newly expanded East Coast Grill, now three times the size it was a year ago. Loud and casual, with an open kitchen and an irreverent attitude, the restaurant smells like wood smoke and sounds like fun. It is totally appealing.
Chris Schlesinger, the chef and owner, is known for great barbecue, impeccable fish and "pasta from hell," a dish so hot that people who eat an entire plateful often get a standing ovation.
The restaurant is fond of special events; the best known are for lovers of spicy food who come from all over the East Coast to test their mettle. But you don't have to be a hothead to appreciate the restaurant: March will feature East Coast Oyster Appreciation Week, followed by an April Fool's celebration. Only one thing is guaranteed: It will be fun. But then, eating in Boston usually is.
East Coast Grill, 1271 Cambridge Street, Inman Square; (617) 491-6568. Dinner entrees, $12.50 to $20.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Rally Fades and Dollar Dips Before Greenspan Testimony

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower against the yen and mark yesterday after an early rally faded on concern about the uncertain impact of scheduled testimony from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
Mr. Greenspan, whose reference to "irrational exuberance" in the stock market two months ago incited a panicky global selloff that briefly wrenched down the dollar, was set to give his twice-yearly report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking Committee today. 
 "There may be a little bit of fear that he may make that type of statement again," said Robert Katz, a currency trader at the MTB Bank Corporation in New York. "The market has been in a holding pattern ahead of that."
Traders said the dollar was also pushed lower against the mark on news of rising import prices in Germany and remarks by Ernst Welteke, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, who said the dollar's rapid ascent could further aggravate German inflation.
The mark's strength against other European currencies, particularly the Italian lira, also helped restrain the dollar. The mark has been gaining partly over increased uncertainty about the timetable for the single currency, the Euro, and which countries will participate.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 121.60 yen from 122.18 yen on Monday and to 1.6719 marks from 1.6732 marks. The pound cost $1.6350, down from $1.6359. The dollar ended little changed in other transactions.
The dollar traded as high as 122.35 yen and 1.6755 marks in early Asian dealings, largely on buying interest in Japan from investors seeking to take advantage of the dollar's sharp retreat on Monday.
But continued uncertainty about the dollar's inability to surpass a recently established four-year high of 124.80 yen and three-year high of 1.7050 marks helped weaken the currency as the day progressed.
"The rally today just failed because there wasn't enough momentum to take it higher," said Earl I. Johnson, an economist at the Bank of Montreal in Chicago.
Others said the predominant reason for the dollar's pullback was the uncertainty created by Mr. Greenspan, whose power to unnerve the financial markets is well known.

Tokyo to Propose Repeal Of Holding Company Ban

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The governing coalition of Japan said today that it would move to repeal the nation's 50-year-old ban on holding companies, giving Japan's plan for financial deregulation its biggest boost.
Japanese corporate managers have long called for lifting the ban, which was imposed by the United States during the military occupation after World War II to break up the conglomerates that were blamed for financing the Japanese war effort. Holding companies, Japanese corporate interests argue, will enable businesses to enter new areas, merge with and acquire other companies more easily, and eliminate unprofitable units. 
 The establishment of holding companies, which are legal in the United States and Europe, has drawn special attention since November, when Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto released plans to deregulate Japan's financial markets by 2001.
Members of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party as well as the party's two coalition partners said they would ask the Cabinet to approve a draft bill by March 11 to end the ban. Approval by the Parliament is almost certain, and a new law should be in place next year.
"Holding companies will play a decisive role for the Japanese economy, which faces enormous competition in the global market and is under pressure to achieve structural reform," said Seiichi Mizuno, a legislator and member of Sakigake, the smallest group in the three-party coalition.
The coalition's proposal does contain some limits on holding companies. For example, corporate groups with assets exceeding 15 trillion yen, or $121 billion, would have to submit to "strict scrutiny" by the Government before they could obtain permission to form holding companies. Legislators said that would be necessary to prevent a corporate group from exercising too much control over industry, which was another reason the United States imposed the ban.
One important issue remains unresolved, however. The Government has yet to decide whether to introduce tax consolidation, which would allow holding companies to partly offset the taxes due on a unit's high profits with the results of a less profitable subsidiary. A Government panel is still considering the issue.
Tax consolidation is viewed as an essential by some companies. The president of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Junichiro Miyazu, has said that the company will not form a holding company without consolidated taxation. N.T.T. plans to split into three units under a holding company in 1999.

Parlez-Vous U.S.A.?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: CASABLANCA, Morocco

 BODY:
The frigate U.S.S. Carr pulled into Casablanca harbor last week and the U.S. Embassy held a reception on board, replete with Budweiser and chicken fingers, for local dignitaries. I dropped by and was soon conversing with a senior Moroccan official. Sporting a tailored suit and speaking elegant French, he explained why he was sending his two children to the American school in Casablanca, and not to the French schools where he was educated. "Two reasons," he said. "First, in the world we are going into if you don't speak English, you're illiterate. Second, the French system teaches you how to be an administrator. The American system teaches you how to survive on your own. That's what I want my kids to know."
Although French culture and education has been imbedded in Morocco's major cities since the early 1900's, there are now four American schools here, and they are in such demand they have waiting lists for the waiting lists. In addition, English-language schools are mushrooming all over. Visa requests to study in America, particularly for M.B.A.'s, are skyrocketing. 
 What gives? It's actually a fascinating cultural competition between America and France for the soul of the new generation in traditionally French-dominated North and West Africa. Now that the cold war is over, and the Western model has triumphed over Communism, all the competition now is between different Western models for succeeding in a free-market world. In this region, it's a competition America is increasingly winning -- without even knowing it. It's all driven by local demand. And it's not just demand for McDonald's and Michael Jordan. It emerges from an intuitive sense that a senior Moroccan official picks up -- from movies, television, who knows where -- that tells him the way America looks at the world is a better fit with where his society is heading.
That view is not surprising, since throughout North Africa the pressures of technology and the global economy are forcing nations to shift power from the once-dominant state bureaucracy and monopolies to the private sector. Whereas being a bureaucrat was once a ticket for life, it's now a ticket to nowhere. The future belongs to those who can hustle on their own -- with all the opportunity and brutality that entails.
"The French higher education system has not adapted to this revolutionary period," remarked Dominique Moisi, one of France's leading experts on international affairs. "The French system rewards people for their capacity to follow the path laid out for them. It does not encourage people to rebel or to develop their character. The mood out there is that if things are changing now in the 1990's, it is not because of France. It's because of America."
And it's because of people like Jim Lowenthal -- a one-man American Foreign Legion. Once an A.I.D. official in Morocco, Mr. Lowenthal started his own communications firm, which is now the largest Internet service provider in Morocco. Recently, U.S.A.I.D. asked him to help set up Internet nodes throughout French-speaking sub-Saharan Africa, so that from any village in Mali or Rwanda you could make a local call and get on the World Wide Web.
"Being American is a real advantage now in Francophone Africa," says Mr. Lowenthal. "All over West Africa educated people are saying we need the Internet and we need English. The recent opening of the Internet node in Madagascar was front-page news. The article began: 'The French-dominated telecommunications subsidiary in Madagascar no longer has a monopoly.' These people want us."
You can't understand the tension between the U.S. and France today over NATO if you don't appreciate this cultural competition. It's clearly making the French a little crazy. How else can one explain their recent attempt to prevent Georgia Tech's overseas campus in France from using English on its Internet Web site? That's insane! But it's the act of people who feel the world is changing and they want to stop it, not master it.
The French can try to beat America at its own game, which they are quite capable of doing if they get focused, or they can play footsy with the enemies of America, who are often the enemies of modernity -- in which case France risks becoming increasingly marginal.

Study Cloning, Don't Ban It

BYLINE: By Daniel J. Kevles; Daniel J. Kevles directs the Program in Science, Ethics and Public Policy at the California Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif.

 BODY:
In "Songs of Innocence," William Blake asked, "Little Lamb, who made thee?" The answer for Dolly the sheep is Dr. Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh. Dolly, as the world now knows, is a clone, a duplicate of one genetic parent. Her birth marks a milestone in our ability to engineer animals for food and medicine. It also signals that humans can, in principle, be cloned, too. That prospect troubles many people, but they ought not be too concerned about it at the moment.
Dolly has provoked widespread ethical foreboding. The Church of Scotland suggested that cloning animals runs contrary to God's biodiversity. Dr. Wilmut himself said that cloning humans would be "ethically unacceptable." Carl Feldbaum, pres ident of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, urged that human cloning be prohibited in the United States. (President Clinton asked a Federal bioethics commission for a speedy review of the implications of mammalian cloning.) 
 The outcry over Dolly calls to mind the great biologist J. B. S. Haldane's "Daedalus," a slim book of reproductive utopianism published in 1924. Haldane held that Daedelus of Greek mythology was the first biological inventor (the first genetic engineer, we would say) because he was connected with the procreation of the Minotaur through the coupling of Pasiphae and the Cretan bull. Daedalus escaped punishment from the gods for his hubris, Haldane noted, but he suffered "the agelong reprobation of a humanity to whom biological inventions are abhorrent."
If Daedalus did not offend the gods of his day, many people have indicted biotechnologists for affronting God in ours. Yet Haldane, for one, knew that although biological innovations are often initially seen as perversions, over time, they become accepted as "a ritual supported by unquestioned beliefs and prejudices." As technologies improve, people recognize them as advantageous. Society, through its legislatures and courts, figures out how to resolve the problems they posed at the outset.
In this way, artificial insemination of humans, considered tantamount to adultery before World War II, has become widely accepted. So have reproductive methods like in vitro fertilization and surrogate motherhood. People abort fetuses with genetic disorders, administer growth hormones to smallish children and use insulin made by bacteria injected with a human gene.
Scientists have long speculated about manipulating genes to produce new Einsteins, Heifetzes and Hemingways. Now impresarios can dream of cloning Kareem Abdul Jabar and raising their own Dream Team.
The fantasies are endless, but they are just fantasies. People are the products not only of their genes but of their environments. Today an Einstein clone might grow up to be Steven Spielberg. Anyway, no one knows what genes contribute to the qualities we most admire and value, whether virtuosity of the pen, the pitch or the piccolo.
Still, Dolly heralds wondrous innovations with huge economic implications (that Dr. Wilmut held back the news of Dolly's birth until he could register a patent has been reported without comment). Someday an infertile couple might choose to have a child by cloning one or the other partner. A cancer victim might use his DNA to clone spare body parts -- liver, pancreas, lungs, kidneys, bone marrow.
For now, cloning should rightly be confined to animals. But as the technology evolves to invite human experimentation, it would be better to watch and regulate rather than prohibit. Outlaw the exploration of human cloning and it will surely go offshore, only to turn into bootleg science that will find its way back to our borders simply because people want it.
As with so many previous advances in biology, today's affront to the gods may be tomorrow's highly regarded -- and highly demanded -- agent of self-gratification or health.

Bond Prices Edge Lower After Auction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities bounced back from early lows yesterday, but investors resumed selling after results of the Treasury two-year note auction, although in line with expectations, were disappointing.
The 30-year bond slipped 1/32 to 99 21/32 to yield 6.65 percent, unchanged from Monday. 
 Analysts said the positioning for the $17.5 billion two-year Treasury note auction was impressive going in. Over all, when-issued trading in the two-year issue was about 44 percent better than normal. The yield on the two-year note was 5.885 percent, down from 5.984 last month and the lowest since December, when it was 5.874 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio, or the total number of bids compared with the size of the sale, was slightly below average as was retail demand.
Because of the slack demand, dealers almost immediately lowered the price of the new five-year note for sale today to make it more attractive to investors. The notes were offered at a price to yield 6.18 percent, up from 6.17 percent on Monday.
The one thing underpinning the market, analysts said, was that the Fed was buying various maturities in a technical operation known as a coupon pass. The purpose is to address a seasonal rise in the shortage of bank reserves. The Fed bought a total of $818 million of various coupons with maturities ranging from May 2002 to February 2007.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said yesterday's market was best characterized as showing a great deal of ennui.
"Most people are happy with their current position, whatever it may be," Mr. Donne said. "With the exception of when-issued trading, today and yesterday have been quiet. I think that is characteristic of trading within a still-defined yield range of 6.50 to 6.75 percent on the long bond."
He said the market was waiting for two things, Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, which begins today and ends tomorrow, and the monthly payroll employment report due next week. "Clearly everyone is focused on labor market conditions, which could raise inflation pressures," he added.
The Fed's vice chairwoman, Alice Rivlin, said yesterday at the Credit Union National Association's annual conference on government affairs in Washington that labor markets were tight in most regions of the country, and that workers at the low end of the wage scale were beginning to see their wages increasing.
Mr. Donne noted that relatively slack volume over the last couple of days indicated that investors were not ready to take a stronger position.
"If I can read anything about today, it is that yields in the shorter maturities have risen more relative to the longer maturities, indicating the market is still very much concerned about a possible interest rate hike by the Fed," he said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: The Drug-Certification Dance

 BODY:
This week President Clinton will decree which countries the United States deems uncooperative with American anti-drug efforts. The decision has been dominated by the question of whether Washington will be honest and deny full certification to Mexico, a close ally with a big corruption problem. The politicization of the debate is only one example of what is wrong with the whole certification process. It began in 1986 as a way to pressure supplier countries to fight drugs. It has not been successful and should be abolished.
Last year six countries were decertified: Myanmar, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Iran, Syria and Colombia, where President Ernesto Samper recently escaped impeachment on charges that he had accepted campaign contributions from traffickers. 
 Latin Americans' resentment of the certification process makes it counterproductive. Many Latin Americans believe that as the world's largest consumer of cocaine, the United States caused the drug problem. The more they feel attacked by Washington, the less they are willing to make the sacrifices involved in fighting drugs. When Colombia was decertified, President Samper rallied Colombian nationalism and his popularity rose.
The process does not capture the ambiguities of cooperation. How, for example, should the United States assess Colombia's performance last year? Coca production and drug corruption increased. At the same time, Colombia apparently took important steps to fight cocaine.
In fact, Colombia probably did more than Mexico, but is likely to be decertified. Because an announcement that Mexico is not cooperating would hurt a nation whose stability, good will and economic health matters greatly to the United States, Mexico has been able to count on America to exaggerate its efforts to fight cocaine.
Certification is ultimately dangerous because it contributes to the myth that America's drug problem can best be fought overseas. In both Colombia and Mexico, this task is shifting to the military. As relations with Colombia's civilian Government have deteriorated, Washington has increased aid and weapons sales to the country's military, which has the worst human rights record in the hemisphere and strong ties to paramilitary leaders who traffic in cocaine.
America's drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, says that anti-narcotics programs in the Andes have made little difference. He is right; they can only push the drug trade from one country to another. Some overseas efforts are needed, but the real hope for reducing drug usage in the United States lies in domestic treatment, prevention and law enforcement. President Clinton yesterday outlined a $16 billion domestic anti-drug plan, which contains a welcome but modest increase in funds for treatment and $175 million for an ad campaign warning teen-agers against drug use. Instead of international certification, Washington should examine how well its policies at home combat drugs.

HEADLINE: Remember the Neediest

 BODY:
A family burned out of its home is given help to avoid living in the street. A single mother receives money for food and shelter so that her child does not have to go into foster care. A onetime drug addict receives money for clothing so he can train for a job. These and other stories have stirred readers to respond generously to The New York Times Neediest Cases appeal for 1996-97, which ends Friday.
At a time when New York City is experiencing an economic boom, pressures on the city's most vulnerable people -- the sick, the elderly and the poor -- are greater than ever. In part that is because longstanding government programs like food stamps and disability payments are being cut back. The seven social-service agencies that receive contributions from the Neediest Cases Fund are finding it tougher to fulfill their mandates. 
 As of yesterday, the Neediest Cases Fund had received contributions this year of $4,690,188.96, much more than last year but still short of the record $5 million received in 1992. Along with contributions from celebrities and people of means have come extraordinary gifts from schoolchildren who contribute their allowances and from families who have suffered themselves and want to give others the chance they were given in a moment of crisis.
There is still time to contribute. Though this year's drive is ending, the institutions that receive the money operate year round and can receive gifts anytime. Any money received by The Times after Friday will go into next year's drive. All gifts go directly to help people in need. No money is kept to pay for administration or solicitation by agencies the fund supports. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

Bondholders Win a Round At Marvel

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Score one for the bondholders in the fight over Marvel Entertainment. But the final victor remains unclear.
The bondholders, who include Carl C. Icahn, the former chairman of Trans World Airlines, have been fighting to seize control of a dominant block of Marvel stock from Ronald O. Perelman, the financier whose empire includes Revlon. 
 Mr. Perelman, through holding companies, owns 80 percent of the stock in Marvel, the comic book and trading card company that is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings. Those shares are pledged to secure junk bonds issued by Mr. Perelman's companies. Yesterday, Judge Helen Balick of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware gave the bondholders permission to foreclose on the bonds, and thus take possession of the shares.
"The bondholders now have the power, if they choose to exercise it, to change the Marvel board and to compel that the current reorganization plan be withdrawn," said David Friedman, a lawyer for the bondholders committee. "But there has been no decision made to exercise that right," he added.
Mr. Friedman said he hoped that "this power will be significant to prompt meaningful negotiations toward a fair plan," with Mr. Perelman making concessions to the bondholders. "The ability of the bondholders to replace the board, hopefully, will be sufficient to impose some discipline on the board to act for the benefit of all parties, not just Perelman," he said.
Marvel's board and Mr. Perelman have proposed a complicated plan in which the Andrews Group, one of Mr. Perelman's companies, would buy the outstanding shares of Toy Biz Inc., a toy maker in which Marvel already owns a 27 percent stake; Andrews Group would then contribute them to Marvel in return for 80 percent of the shares of a new Marvel. Bondholders have denounced that plan.
A spokesman for Mr. Perelman, Michael Freitag of Kekst & Company, said that many legal avenues remained open to Marvel, which argued in court yesterday that the existing Marvel shares were worthless and thus there was no point to letting the bondholders seize them.
"We don't expect today's decision by the court to affect the ultimate consummation of the Andrews Group plan of reorganization for Marvel Entertainment," Mr. Freitag said. He declined to comment on whether negotiations were possible.
Mr. Freitag said that it was possible the plan would still be approved, with control of the company passing to bank creditors of Marvel, which would allow the reorganization plan to proceed.
The ruling came after trading ended yesterday, with Marvel shares down 12.5 cents each, to $1.875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in Toy Biz, a company with an exclusive license to make toys based on Marvel characters, rose 12.5 cents, to $18.75. Under its reorganization plan, Andrews Group is to buy those shares for $22.50, but that is contingent on the Marvel reorganization plan being approved. If it is in jeopardy, Toy Biz shares could suffer.
The fight for Marvel has been one of the most extraordinary in recent years, largely because of the odd way Mr. Perelman arranged to own it, with his shares pledged to support junk bonds. Effectively, he has no economic stake in the company but was still able to use those shares to control the company and get approval of his reorganization plan that would let him keep control.
By selling the bonds, Mr. Perelman has taken a profit of more than $50 million on his investment in Marvel, and could choose to walk away with a profit, leaving it to the bondholders to find a way to revive the company. Instead, he has proposed to recapitalize the company through the Toy Biz transaction, a deal that effectively lets him buy new Marvel shares for about 85 cents each.
Whether or not a better plan for existing shareholders could be financed if Mr. Perelman did not have control has not been clear. Mr. Icahn has said he would be willing to underwrite a superior reorganization plan, but details have been scarce.
Yesterday's ruling makes it at least possible that a superior plan could prevail, if people are willing to put up the money. At the least, it has made the fight a lot more interesting.

Albright Comes Home

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
"I'm deeply hurt that people think I'm lying," said Madeleine Albright yesterday afternoon, an hour after her plane touched down in Washington, bringing her home from her 11-day international tour. "I have never been secretive about anything in my life. If a shrink wanted to deal with me, it would be primarily about the fact I talk too much."
Ms. Albright had been pained to read in this space a week ago that I and others questioned the credibility of her account of how recently she discovered both her Jewish origins and her grandparents' fate as Holocaust victims. Calling to speak her piece -- "It may not make sense but it's the truth" -- she attributed the contradictions some of us heard in her previous public statements about her new-found history to her casual use of different adjectives. 
 "I didn't have a lawyer," she said. "I haven't written out my answers. I'm trying to piece it together myself. I am deeply regretful of having caused confusion on this. . . ." Then she addressed what many have found to be the fault lines in her story so far.
Ms. Albright said that though she had received letters from Czechoslovakia alluding to her Jewish background while she served as the United Nations delegate, she discounted them because they were factually inconsistent or contradicted either her parents' own accounts or their official papers. Other letters were from "Serbians who hated my guts and said I was a whore and I was Jewish; I figured that was invective. . . .
"Finally I stopped reading the mail," she said, citing the huge volume flooding her U.N. office. She says she simply never received the conclusive letters about her origins sent by the Mayor of her father's hometown -- or the letter her first cousin, Dagmar Sima, recently tried to give her bodyguards when Ms. Albright visited Prague. When Ms. Albright and her cousin met in Prague after the Berlin wall came down, Ms. Albright says, Ms. Sima never mentioned either the family's religious background or its concentration-camp casualties.
It was only in mid-November of last year that Ms. Albright says she saw new and more persuasive letters -- and "stuff in the Jewish press" -- detailing her family's roots. And so on the subject of her Jewish ancestry, she was not quite as shocked by The Washington Post's revelations as her first public statements suggested. "Was I totally surprised about my Jewish background? No. I had hints along the way. . . . I feel pretty stupid. It's like seeing a bunch of dots and when a person puts it all together, it makes sense. . . . I had not been sensitive enough to signs that my background was different than I thought it was."
But she says she was shocked to learn from The Post's Michael Dobbs that a number of members of her family had died in Terezin and Auschwitz. Given that she had already surmised her ancestors' Jewishness, and that the Holocaust has been central to her public world view, why didn't she immediately investigate or even guess the most likely cause of their wartime deaths? "I feel stupid and deeply regretful at not having seen things that are obvious, and I'm going to do my damnedest to make it up. . . . Had I not been immersed in the work I was doing, I probably would have put this two and two together. I wish to God I had. If I'd been a professor or unemployed, I would have looked at this."
Last night she met with her sister and brother to learn of their findings in Czechoslovakia, where they traveled last week to meet with Ms. Sima and others to gather facts. "I would like the definitive story to be written," Ms. Albright said, and then despaired whether anything she says now will put her "incredibly sad and complicated story" to rest.
Perhaps no closure is possible. Theodore Rabb, a historian at Princeton who is a Czech Jewish emigre born the same year as Ms. Albright, points out that the Holocaust's pull is deepening throughout the culture -- as seen everywhere from the international rise of university chairs for Holocaust studies to the struggle over Swiss gold to Sunday night's extraordinary network audience of 65 million Americans for "Schindler's List." Judging from my own response and those of so many vocal readers, even those well versed in the Holocaust have been roiled by the Albright affair in one way or another. The violent reactions to her story demonstrate that it's not only her relationship to the Holocaust that remains painful and unresolved.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
New Tenants for a Popular Silicon Alley Building

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
In July 1995, amid much hoopla, the Rudin Management Company renamed a nearly 400,000-square-foot office building at 55 Broad Street the New York Information Technology Center.
The idea was to spend $15 million on renovations to the vacant building, install telecommunications equipment and attract companies in the world of computers and the Internet, to revitalize an area that had been commercially moribund since the recession of the early 90's. The goal was to invigorate Silicon Alley as a counterpart to Silicon Valley. 
 It seems to be working. William C. Rudin, president of Rudin Management, said 57 leases have been signed and 8 others are about to be, totaling 315,000 square feet, more than 80 percent of the building.
Earlier leases had annual rents in the high teens a square foot, but Mr. Rudin said annual rents on more recent leases were from the high teens to the low $20's a square foot in the base of the building to the mid- to high $20's in the tower.
Among the more recent tenants are these:
I.B.M., an original proponent of the center, has taken a five-year lease for 10,000 square feet on the 27th floor to house the content and technical team for the I.B.M. home page on the Internet and for its internal Intranet network for its own employees. Fifteen to 30 employees from the headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., will work in the new space.
Certco, which develops software and legal contracts that enable banks to offer electronic products, has signed a 10-year lease for 20,000 square feet, the 21st and 22d floors, and will be moving from 280 Park Avenue, at 49th Street.
Spearhead Systems Consultants has signed a 10-year lease for 10,000 square feet on the 24th floor. Spearhead, which designs business software, will be moving its headquarters from Port Washington, L.I., but will keep the Port Washington office for administrative and support staff.
N2K, which operates a music-entertainment site on the Internet and was the building's first tenant, has taken two more floors, 25 and 26, for a total of 40,000 square feet.
Mr. Rudin has credited Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Downtown Revitalization Plan, which gives tax breaks to encourage development, for contributing to the leasing success. The building is eligible for the tax breaks, saving tenants money.
The 30-year-old building, at Beaver Street, south of the New York Stock Exchange, had housed Drexel Burnham Lambert. But after that firm went bankrupt, the building was vacant for more than five years.
Studio Archetype, a San Francisco company that develops and designs Web pages, whose clients include I.B.M., American Express and Nintendo, already has a small lease in the building, for 1,500 square feet. Now it is taking an additional 10,000 square feet on the 29th floor.
"We heard about the building from I.B.M.," said Amanda North, Studio Archetype's president. "They described the place as a collaborative environment, designed to attract technology companies and create a community to share ideas and network. We've always enjoyed the free and easy collaborative spirit in Silicon Valley, and 55 Broad tries to recreate some of that spirit."
 
Office Space Sublet
Two major companies, the Loews Corporation and Bank of America, have sublet large amounts of office space they no longer need.
Loews Corporation has sublet 95,000 square feet at 1 Park Avenue, the entire 15th floor and most of the 14th, to PSM Insurance Companies. Bank of America has found two subtenants: Instinet Corporation, an electronic stock-trading exchange that is a subsidiary of Reuters, and IBES Inc., a provider of investor information services, for 93,000 square feet at 1 World Trade Center.
Loews is giving up two of its three floors at 1 Park Avenue, a 20-story, 852,000-square-foot office building at 32d Street. The company recently leased 49,200 square feet at 655 Madison Avenue, at 60th Street, in a 15-year deal valued at almost $25 million, and plans to connect the space to the adjacent 667 Madison, its corporate headquarters.
Howard F. Fiddle of the Insignia/ ESG real estate company, who represented PSM with Glenn Isaacson and Peter Turchin, said the lease was for five and a half years. John Malino, vice president for real estate at Loews, said the average annual rent on the sublease was in "the low $20's" a square foot. Loews is keeping one floor at 1 Park Avenue for its computer installation.
In the Bank of America deals, Instinet has sublet 49,000 square feet, including the 12th floor, and IBES has taken 44,000 square feet on the 18th floor. IBES will be moving from 345 Hudson Street, Instinet from 757 Third Avenue.
Robert A. Constable of Cushman & Wakefield, who represented Bank of America in the transaction with Lawrence S. Tannenbaum, said that the bank had leased 343,000 square feet in the 110-story, 4.76-million-square-foot trade center building in 1993 for "various trust and processing-related operations," but at the end of 1995 it sold off several of the operations and put 230,000 square feet back on the market.
"These are the first two big leases for the space," Mr. Constable said. The subleases were valued at $20 million, $8.5 million for IBES and a just over $12 million for Instinet.

HEADLINE: Big Demand for Executives Last Year

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
The good times are definitely rolling for executive recruiters. But new industry statistics have a decidedly "good news, bad news" cast for the executives that recruiters place in jobs throughout corporate America.
The number of executive searches in the United States grew 14 percent last year, showing that executives are clearly in demand -- particularly high-priced ones destined for corner offices -- according to statistics that will be released today by the Association of Executive Search Consultants. But that increase is also an indication of increased pressure to perform. 
 The biggest demand was for chief operating officers, with that category showing a 56 percent increase over 1995 in the number of searches conducted by association members. Searches for chief executives increased 36 percent and for chief financial officers, 37 percent. Recruiting for board members jumped 43 percent from the 1995 level.
Nearly 90 percent of the jobs came with six-figure salaries, while more than a third offered annual pay topping $200,000.
And 46 percent of the searches were for newly created jobs, down a bit from 51 percent in 1995, the first year the association conducted its survey.
In part, the surge reflects the economy's continued expansion. But it is also a product of higher executive turnover, which is caused by the increased pressure on senior managers to produce results quickly, said Sheila Arvin McLean, president of the association.
The trend is alarming to some people. "A few years ago, the average tenure of a C.E.O. or C.O.O. was 5.5 years," said Thomas Kuczmarski, a consultant with his own firm in Chicago. "Now that has dropped, I'm sure. Executives have to make their numbers each quarter, and the implication is that we continue to focus too much on the short term."
Higher executive turnover is also occurring because a different kind of manager is needed now, according to Hank Conn, a vice president at A. T. Kearney, a large management consulting firm. "You can't tell people what to do anymore, you have to motivate them," he said. "Companies are looking for people that have the soft skills to manage and technological skills and leadership traits. They're looking for much more complete people."
The results of the association's survey accord with those of a global executive demand index compiled recently by Korn/Ferry International, the world's largest search firm. A survey of 2,600 Korn/Ferry clients in 38 countries found that the hiring of senior executives earning $100,000 or more a year grew 10 percent in 1996.
Korn/Ferry's report said that executive demand boomed most in the Asia-Pacific region, which showed a 15 percent increase. Growth in Europe came to 11 percent, while in both Latin America and North America it was 8 percent.
In the United States, according to the 125 member firms of Ms. McLean's association, the Northwest is the hottest region, with searches increasing by 114 percent from 1995. The Southwest came next, with a 24 percent increase. The Northeast (14 percent), North Central (13 percent), Southeast (6 percent) and Pacific states (4 percent) followed.
In terms of sheer volume, however, most of the job-hopping in both 1995 and 1996 was occurring in the Northeast, which accounted for a third of all recruiting assignments. The North Central states came next, with 20 percent, followed by the Southeast (17 percent), the Pacific (16 percent), the Southwest (10 percent) and the Northwest (4 percent).
Over all, the executive job market was strongest in service businesses and at transportation and utility companies, with searches in both growing by 15 percent for the year. Not far behind, demand for manufacturing executives increased by 13 percent. The communications industry showed a 5 percent overall decline in searches during 1996, though some segments of the business posted gains.
As for compensation, the newly created jobs are paying the most. While only 4 percent of all jobs in the survey fetched more than $500,000, 44 percent of the newly created positions paid that much or more.

HEADLINE: 2 Democrats Say Mexico Is No U.S. Ally In Drug War

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill objected today to the prospect that the Clinton Administration might certify Mexico as an ally in the war on illegal drugs as pressure to decertify Mexico grew. And even some senior Administration officials acknowledged that drug corruption had become so endemic throughout the ranks of Mexican law enforcement as to make cooperation difficult if not impossible.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, wrote separate letters saying Mexico deserved to be decertified, but with penalties waived in the vital national interest. 
 The President is required to notify Congress every year as to which countries are cooperating with the United States to fight drugs. Those who have failed to do so are consigned to a pariah status that renders them no longer eligible for investment credits from the United States and makes them subject to other trade penalties. The President's decision is due by March 1.
In a letter addressed to Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the Administration's director of national drug control policy, Mr. Gephardt said that "our 2,000-mile common border with Mexico demands that we get more support from the Mexican Government and that greater support for rooting out corruption be implemented."
And Ms. Feinstein wrote President Clinton, "I believe the evidence is overwhelming and can lead to no decision other than the decertification of Mexico."
Their concerns were motivated in part by the arrest last week of Mexico's senior counterdrug official, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, on charges of collaborating with the head of a major drug syndicate.
In announcing the latest national drug strategy today, President Clinton and General McCaffrey both avoided saying whether Mexico would be certified. Mr. Clinton said the Administration was committed to cooperating with its Latin American friends.
"We want to cooperate with them, but we want them to cooperate with us, as well," Mr. Clinton said. "We want to reduce our demand for drugs, but we are determined to reduce the supply as well."
General McCaffery said that the Administration was still discussing the question of certification. "This is not a cooked deal," he said. "There is going to be an intense analysis of the law."
But he stressed that the Administration wanted to keep working with the Mexican Government. "It is our belief that the United States and Mexico are trapped, economically, culturally, politically and because of drug crime, in the same continent, and we'd better figure out a way to work on it together," he said.
A bleaker picture was presented at a hearing on counternarcotics efforts in Mexico. Testifying before the House Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs and Criminal Justice, Thomas A. Constantine, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said General Gutierrez's arrest illustrated how deeply rooted corruption has become in Mexico. As a result, Mr. Constantine said, "There is not one single law enforcement institution with whom D.E.A. has a really trusting relationship."
Because General Gutierrez inherited the files of his predecessors as head of Mexico's National Institute to Combat Drugs, Mr. Constantine said, it had to be assumed that anything shared with the Mexicans had been passed by General Gutierrez to the drug traffickers.
Asked in an interview later about the state of cooperation, Mr. Constantine said that "virtually everything is frozen right there, in terms of sharing information."
In his testimony, Robert S. Gelbard, the Assistant Secretary of State responsible for matters related to drugs, described Mexico as "one of our most important allies in the struggle against international crime and drug trafficking." But he too spoke of "persistent and widespread official corruption."
When Representative Thomas M. Barrett, Democrat of Wisconsin, asked how much damaging material had been given to General Gutierrez," Mr. Gelbard replied, "I do not know." He said that investigators were still trying to find out.
Several members of Congress argued that Colombia, which looks likely to be decertified for a second year, had done more to fight drug trafficking than Mexico.
The subcommittee chairman, Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, said that if Colombia was not certified and Mexico was, "I, for one, will have a hard time not seeing this as a double standard -- a double standard that undermines the role of certification in our international drug strategy." If that happened, Mr. Hastert warned, "a close examination of this decision by Congress will follow."

HEADLINE: Mexico Says Critical Report On Drugs Would Hurt Ties

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Mexico warned today that any move by the United States to downgrade this country's standing as a partner in the effort to fight narcotics smuggling would jeopardize Mexico's future cooperation in the drug war.
Faced with a growing clamor in Washington about the corrupting influence of Mexican drug lords, Foreign Minister Angel Gurria issued a strongly worded appeal to President Clinton today, asking him to renew Mexico's certification as a cooperative ally in the fight against drugs when he files an annual progress report to Congress this week. 
 The Mexican Government believes it has made major advances in the war against drug cartels, Mr. Gurria said, and a negative rating would awaken keen frustration and resentment against the United States.
"The Mexican people would question the whole concept of cooperation," Mr. Gurria said.
Since the arrest of Mexico's chief drug-fighting official on narcotics charges, American officials have begun reconsidering the almost automatic endorsement of Mexico since the certification program began.
Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug coordinator, said the Administration is now contemplating a qualified endorsement that would stop short of the economic sanctions levied against uncooperative countries but would be a sharp diplomatic slap at Mexico.
Today a number of senior Congressional Democrats also called for downgrading Mexico.
Mexican officials regard the United States' annual reports on the drug campaigns of foreign countries, which are mandated by Congress, as unwanted intervention and normally do not comment on the process.
Mr. Gurria broke with past practice, acknowledging that a qualified American assessment of Mexico's anti-narcotics effort would seriously hurt the country's image.
In the past Mexico was easily certified without conditions, but Clinton Administration officials are hesitating this year because of the arrest on drug charges this month of Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the head of the national anti-drug agency.
Mr. Gurria warned that a diminution of Mexico's status would "make us doubt whether cooperating with the United States will bring anything other than a lot of grief."
In the past year United States cooperation with Mexico on drug issues improved with the creation of a contact group that brings together top officials from both countries, and a series of working groups. Mr. Gurria suggested that if Mexico receives an American rebuke it will be forced by political pressure to reconsider its participation in those groups.
Describing relations with the United States as "the best we've ever had," he called on Washington "not to sour the whole thing."
According to a joint report signed by Mr. Gurria and General McCaffrey as recently as a week ago, the Clinton Administration was in accord with with Mexico on its drug program. The two countries canceled the public release of the report after General Gutierrez's arrest.
"We know our achievements so far are significant," the two men wrote in the introduction. The report cites record seizures of heroine, cocaine and methamphetamines by Mexico in 1995 and 1996, as well as a record for destruction of marijuana crops. It points to more effective Mexican laws against organized crime and to the arrests of a number of cartel barons, including Juan Garcia Abrego, who was sentenced in January to life in prison in the United States.
In a separate initiative, Mexican officials today announced the start of a "top-to-bottom overhaul" of the justice system ordered by President Ernesto Zedillo, including the drug agency General Gutierrez headed.
Saying that Mexico faces "the worst crisis in the history of its justice system," Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said his office and the federal police he controls would be reorganized to stem corruption. While checks of the records of all employees continue, police and prosecutors' salaries are being increased to dampen the temptation to take bribes.
Forensic laboratories and intelligence-gathering offices will be modernized and isolated from the influence of prosecutors and outsiders, the Attorney General said.
Mr. Madrazo said the justice reform was not related to the United States certification.
In the central state of Jalisco, where General Gutierrez had been the top military commander, 300state police officers have been dismissed since last week in a purge of all security agents who worked with the general, Gov. Alberto Cardenas Jimenez announced today.
Hostility toward the United States has been amplified this week by two state Governors who were identified by The New York Times in an article on Sunday as having ties to drug traffickers.
The two Governors, Manlio Fabio Beltrones of Sonora and Jorge Carrillo Olea of Morelos, have dominated the Mexican press for several days with angry responses in which they charged that United States drug and intelligence agencies released unfounded information about them to discredit Mexico in advance of President Clinton's report.
Governor Carrillo called the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and the Central Intelligence Agency "the eternal enemies of Mexico's national interest."
Mr. Beltrones said the allegations against him were suspect because they were based on "things said in a foreign country."
To bolster his case, Governor Beltrones released a 1993 legal document showing that state authorities in Sonora sought federal help to close down several residences in Hermosillo, the state capital, belonging to associates of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a notorious cocaine trafficker.
In a full-page paid advertisement today in newspapers across Mexico, several hundred businessmen from Sonora said they were "indignant at attempts to sully the name of Governor Beltrones from outside of Mexico."

HEADLINE: New Report Indicates Consumers Remain Optimistic on Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Americans' confidence in the economy remained extremely high this month, a report by the Conference Board showed.
The research group said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence stood at 118.4 in February. Although that was slightly below January's level -- which was revised upward to 118.7 from 116.8 -- it exceeded expectations. 
 And the index that tracks consumers' assessment of present conditions advanced to 143.4, a 27-year high, from 141.2.
The consumer expectation index fell to 101.7 from 103.8, however, suggesting the respondents were wary about the coming months.
"Consumers continue to view current business activity as strong," said Lynn Franco, associate director of the New York group's consumer research center. The latest consumer readings "signal positive economic growth ahead."
Still, said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, an attitude of "cautious optimism" will prevail when it comes to buying. With the economy in its sixth year of economic expansion, much of the pent-up demand has been exhausted, while financial institutions are tightening lending standards and news of layoffs still shakes Americans' confidence in the job market.
"Things are hot in the labor market, but I suspect consumers may be taking somewhat of a breather in coming months," Mr. Chan said.
 Indeed, a survey released Monday by the National Association of Business Economists found that respondents expected economic growth to slow during the first quarter to a 2 percent annual rate from the 4.7 percent pace of the final three months of 1996.
Still, yesterday's report suggested that consumers were confident enough about their financial prospects to keep the economy moving forward in the months ahead. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL;
Clock Ticks Louder For Kings' Richmond

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

 BODY:
The best pro basketball player with the lowest national profile finished another shoot-around in another arena on another road trip in another season leading nowhere. Mitch Richmond dropped into a front-row seat under the basket for an afternoon chat yesterday at Continental Arena, still the heart and soul of a bunch of court jesters also known as the Sacramento Kings.
Bleeding heart, lost soul. 
 "I'm 31," Richmond said before pouring in 32 points in a 97-90 loss to the Nets last night. "The clock is ticking."
Another trade deadline came and went last week, with the most desirable shooting guard west of Michael Jordan still burying his jumpers, along with his championship dreams, at Arco Arena. Richmond heard about the trade winds from Miami, where Pat Riley was reportedly blowing hard to reunite Richmond with Tim Hardaway, his onetime running mate at Golden State. Riley wound up dealing instead for Jamaal Mashburn, missing out on Richmond, as he did when he was coaching the Knicks.
"The year they wound up with Rolando Blackman, Pat was trying to get me," Richmond said. "Draft day, I thought it was done."
How might history have been written had Patrick Ewing taken Richmond -- who has never averaged less than 22 points and shot less than 45 percent in 9 pro seasons -- to the 1994 N.B.A. finals instead of John Starks? Riley might still be ordering his post-game pasta at Elaine's. Richmond might be the most celebrated winter sport athlete in New York, as opposed to stretching his considerable professionalism to the limits while his biological clock ticks away, Pacific Standard Time.
Like Chris Mullin at Golden State (and unlike so many other National Basketball Association brats), Richmond made no public demands, didn't whine. He just crossed his fingers earlier this month. He happens to be from South Florida, but he also realized it was wishful thinking. In a Western Conference laden with losers, the 24-31 Kings are currently a playoff team. And as the trade deadline approached last Thursday, they were struggling for much more than the chance to lose in the first round this April.
The team's owner, the Los Angeles businessman Jim Thomas, had recently gone to Sacramento city leaders in the familiar pose of the contemporary sports owner: his hand out. His losses were mounting, Thomas said; he needed relief from the Arco Arena debt he inherited, and from the limitations of the small, luxury box-less Sacramento market.
"He had an offer to sell the team to a group that would have moved it to Nashville," said Bill Farley, the Sacramento economic development manager. "He said he needed a public subsidy."
That wasn't going to happen, Farley said, not in conventional terms. It hadn't been long ago that the city provided several million dollars to its struggling symphony. The symphony closed, anyway. The city council took up the issue of Sacramento's only major league sports team knowing that an unqualified handout was out of the question. Out of that came the proposal earlier this month of a 30-year, $70 million loan with the arena and a $20 million team note to be held as collateral, plus an agreement by Thomas to not move the Kings for at least 10 years.
Thomas liked this idea, especially when he bargained to repay the 7 1/2 percent interest loan mostly from a surcharge on tickets to the 200 annual arena events.
In other words, the taxpayers will front the Kings $70 million and pay themselves back by shelling out more for tickets. The litigation charging the city council with providing a subsidy via a tax has predictably begun. What it meant for Richmond is another lost season, for how could the Kings have traded their one All-Star, their 1996 Olympic gold medalist, while they were promising quality basketball in exchange for the city's largess?
"The timing wasn't very good," Richmond said. "But more and more you hear people in Sacramento say, 'Mitch deserves the chance to win a championship.' "
He has two years remaining on his contract, nothing but nice things to say about his teammates, the fans, the city. He is still tired of going to All-Star Games and having Charles Barkley chide him about endorsements, about what a hick town he plays in. He wants to go compete for a title.
That is not going to happen in Sacramento. Even Bill Farley, after looking over Thomas's books, said Sacramento will never truly compete with the big boys. "The salary cap is going up to $30 million and you can go as high as you want for your own players," he said. "These small-market teams don't have a chance."
Moribund as they have been, much as their home has been mocked, that is what keeps the Nets from bailing out of densely populated Northern New Jersey. There is revenue-generation potential the likes of Sacramento will never have. The N.B.A., Farley said, may very well be one slump, the next Jordan retirement, away from a small-market meltdown.
"It would be sad if the N.B.A. couldn't make it in Sacramento, because the fans come out every night," Richmond said. "I hope they stay."
He said "they." Not him.

HEADLINE: Piggy Banks With Muscles;
As Credit Unions Boom, Financial Rivals Cry Foul

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

DATELINE: FORT WORTH

 BODY:
As the Carswell Air Force Base shrank to the vanishing point, its credit union, set up in 1956 with $35 in assets and seven members, was growing into one of the biggest financial service providers in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.
Nearly six years ago, the announcement that Carswell was going to be shut, a victim of the end of the cold war, stunned the community and sent shock waves through the economy. But the announcement did not faze the Carswell Federal Credit Union. It simply changed its name to OmniAmerican and kept expanding. 
 Today, it counts 137,100 members employed at 1,300 businesses and organizations, ranging from the Boy Scouts of America to Pier One Imports. At the end of 1996, assets totaled $517.7 million, and OmniAmerican currently boasts 12 branches, from the original office at what is now the Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base to a spiffy $3 million office, complete with a baby grand player piano, abutting one of the city's toniest residential neighborhoods.
At a time of immense turmoil in financial services, credit unions -- once backwaters of American finance -- have moved aggressively to supplant commercial banks in many of their traditional businesses. They pay more interest on deposits, charge less on loans and provide free many of the services that banks have tacked fees on.
All in all, America's Depression-era experiment with financial socialism is thriving in these bullishly free-market times -- and bankers don't like it one bit. For years, they have been fighting, in the courts and in the halls of Congress, to turn back the credit unions' invasion of their territory. The threat to them is real: Since 1980, the cooperatives' membership has surged to 70.4 million, from 44 million, while assets have exploded to $316 billion from $69 billion.
[The conflict reached a new level on Monday with the Supreme Court's announcement that it would review a lower court ruling that placed sharp limits on membership in federally chartered credit unions, which number more than 7,000. The Court is expected to hear arguments in the fall and render a ruling sometime next year. And the issue will be on full display in Washington Wednesday, when a House subcommittee led by Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican, is scheduled to hold hearings.]
The stakes for both sides -- and for the American public -- are high. Credit unions like OmniAmerican promote themselves as friends of the consumer, grass-roots organizations that offer higher interest on deposits and lower rates on loans than commercial banks. But the banks do not see it that way. To them, credit unions are exploiting their tax-exempt status to grab market share.
Banks view their predicament as a result of the 1982 ruling by the National Credit Union Administration to allow credit unions to accept members from any number of employee groups instead of just one. The banks complain that the Federal regulatory agency's liberal reinterpretation of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 in effect gave credit unions carte blanche to sign up just about anyone, thereby transforming themselves into financial octopuses that threaten the banks' livelihoods.
And the bankers' view has found sympathy in the Federal courts. Thomas P. Jackson, a court of appeals judge, characterized the credit union agency as a "rogue Federal agency" and accused it of colluding with industry groups to evade a court order restricting credit union membership.
David L. Tapp, president and chief executive of Overton Banchares Inc., a $760 million institution with 14 branches in the Fort Worth area, sees the situation this way: "I think credit unions have a place in this world. But they should either be allowed to have a common bond or be forced to pay taxes and compete with us. If credit unions paid taxes and have the same regulatory burden banks do, I'll compete with them every day of the week."
Not surprisingly, the credit unions play on popular distrust of the banking industry as a profit machine indifferent to the needs of the little guy. "This movement is about serving people, not stockholders," said Dan Mica, a former Congressman from Florida who is now president of the Credit Union National Association, an industry group. "Our motto is people first, profit second."
OmniAmerican is one of the biggest and most efficiently managed of the nation's 11,900 credit unions, most of which remain what they always were: back rooms in small companies where employees deposit $50 a week in their savings account and take out car loans at below-market interest rates.
But banks fear that unless they prevail in court, or Congress steps in, sprawling credit unions like Omni-American will become the wave of the future -- a wave that could swamp the more vulnerable banks.
"On the consumer banking side, they are eating the banks' lunch," said Bill Strunk, chairman of Strunk & Associates, a financial consulting firm in Houston. "What they have done in this state is establish branch offices all over a city. In essence, they are like a consumer bank."
According to Mr. Strunk's figures, from 1991 to 1995 deposits at commercial banks in Texas shrank by $3.4 billion, while deposits at savings and loans in the state contracted $6.3 billion. In the same period, credit union deposits rose $4.6 billion.
Larry E. Duckworth, OmniAmerican's chief executive, is unmoved by banks' pleas for regulatory relief. He said Texans had grown "very, very scared" of banks and savings and loans. Besides, he says, credit unions are only providing a service -- banking for workers -- that banks refuse to touch.
"Many companies don't have the mass to make a credit union of their own commercially sound," Mr. Duckworth said. "If this ruling stands, most credit unions won't suffer. But these small and medium- sized companies will."
To attract and hold customers, institutions like OmniAmerican are offering an increasingly diverse array of products and services, from mortgages and auto loans to credit lines to automated teller machines. Two years ago, OmniAmerican began making business and commercial loans to its employer groups. In a promotional book, the list of products and services it offers is nine pages long.
"If credit unions transform into broader-based financial services cooperatives, then they start to become the low-cost competitive alternative to banks," said Edward E. Furash, chairman and chief executive of Furash & Company, a financial services consulting firm based in Washington. "That is where some of them are headed."
OmniAmerican has shown itself to be a master of marketing. In its literature, it says its potential membership exceeds 500,000 "locally, nationally and worldwide." At a number of its branches dotted throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area an electronic message flashes across outdoor screens 24 hours a day: "For the Truth . . . Ask About . . . Financial Freedom of Choice . . . Come Inside for Details . . . Join OmniAmerican."
It is hard for some people to sympathize with the banks in the dispute. After all, the industry enjoyed record profits in 1996 for the fourth consecutive year. And the banks' prosperity has not deterred them from adding fees for services and otherwise pumping up profits in ways -- such as First Chicago's experiment in charging customers for using human tellers -- that have outraged consumer groups. .
Moreover, with combined assets of $4.4 trillion as of last June, the nation's 10,000 banks dwarf their upstart nonprofit rivals.
But a disproportionately large percentage of those assets -- and profits -- are held and earned at a comparatively small number of banks. And while most credit unions are quite small, a growing number are not; roughly 1,000 have assets of $75 million or more. As these institutions have expanded, bankers say, they are unfairly taking business away from small banks that historically have been the backbones of local economies.
The American Bankers Association says the credit unions' tax exemption gives them the equivalent of a $1-billion-a-year subsidy.
According to some consultants to the financial industry, the tax break is one of several factors that provide credit unions with a cost advantage of as much as 2.50 percentage points compared with banks, an edge that enables them to charge lower rates on products like auto loans and home mortgages and to offer higher rates on things like certificates of deposit.
Credit unions say the cost to taxpayers is more than offset by the social good they create. A 1996 study by the Credit Union National Association, for example, calculated the benefits of membership in credit unions at anywhere from $200 to $500 a year, depending on the size of the account, mostly from lower fees. With the credit unions having 70.4 million members, that would mean a savings of $14 billion to $35 billion.
The advantage is not necessarily that clear cut, though. As of yesterday, OmniAmerican was offering to pay 5.75 percent on one-year certificates of deposit, beating the 5.25 percent at its commercial banking rival, Overton Bancshares. But rates for new-car loans were identical at 7.75 percent, though of slightly different durations. As for home buyers, they might be better off going to Overton, where a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a one point origination fee was offered at 7.125 percent, rather than OmniAmerican, with a fee of one and a half points and a rate of 7.375 percent.
Converts to credit unions sometimes have more than numbers on their minds, of course. Wendell Geiger, a former Air Force physician who now teaches at Texas Christian University, said bureaucratic intransigence at Bank One drove him and his wife into the arms of OmniAmerican a few years ago.
"My wife had an account at Bank One, and was charged all the fees and what not," he said inside an OmniAmerican branch on a recent morning. "But when she went for a loan, they needed me to co-sign it. That's when we said forget it. It's not like she works at McDonald's."
For all the plaudits credit unions get from their own customers, some financial analysts wonder whether they have not outlived their usefulness in an age when boundaries between financial institutions are tumbling, when H & R Block can offer home mortgages and when banks can sell insurance and brokerage houses can make commercial loans.
"The United States has a long, long history, particularly since the turn of the century, of forming financial institutions every time a special financial need had to be dealt with," Mr. Furash of Furash & Company said.
"None of these institutions have been subjected to a sunset, even though their social purpose may have disappeared or been replaced a long time ago," he said. "Is the social purpose of credit unions to become like banks, or is it to continue to service the special needs for which they should be created? That should be the basis of the issue."

HEADLINE: Evolving China Merely Resembles a Dynasty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You describe the Chinese Communist regime as a "dynasty" interested only in power ("The Communist Dynasty Had Its Run. Now What?" Week in Review, Feb. 23).
In fact, like other 20th-century regimes but unlike previous dynasties, the Communists have sought to enrich, strengthen and discipline China as a modern nation-state. And if some of the techniques of rule have not changed much (playing bureaucratic factions off one another, exiling opponents), others have (the highly centralized military, a national school system, the party apparatus). 
 Nor does it seem useful to call China "fascist," if only because that term implies a level of order and discipline currently beyond the Government's ability to achieve, even if it wanted to. As you point out, economic changes are leading slowly to a new kind of society. Already, while it tolerates a Government monopoly over political discourse, China's civil society accepts few other restrictions.

HEADLINE: Evolving China Merely Resembles a Dynasty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You assert that China's leaders still abide by the historical lesson that "a ruler can kill peasants to his heart's content, but tangles with students at his peril" (Week in Review, Feb. 23). In fact, Chinese rulers have become clever enough not to trifle with the welfare of the masses, whether peasants or workers.
Beijing's policy reformers have interpreted human rights in terms of jobs or other income-earning opportunities for everyone rather than political dissent. Whatever the tilt toward marketization and however flat-footedly, the Communist Party has tried to minimize unemployment. China's state-owned enterprises have restructured, but less by downsizing than by expanding fast enough to absorb the work force. 
 You predict that the next Communist dynasty will be doomed if it is unable to respond to the yearnings for political participation. Perhaps, but these alleged yearnings themselves will wither unless growth is kept up and unemployment is kept down by a policy mix of market and state.

HEADLINE: The London Tube, in the Dumps, Could Be Put Up for Sale

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Britain's Conservative Government today proposed selling off London's subway system, the oldest in the world and the transportation lifeline of a city built more for grace than for mobility.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Sir George Young, the Transport Secretary, said that letting private enterprise take over was the only way to restore the ailing and cash-starved network known as the Tube to its past glory. 
 Last week London Underground said it was shelving hundreds of restoration and improvement projects worth $1.2 billion scheduled over the next three years because of a lack of Government financing.
With a general election only months away, the announcement was seized on for political advantage by both Government and opposition speakers.
"What we have in mind will be very popular with voters, very popular with passengers because it will improve the quality of public transport here in London," Sir George told Parliament.
But Andrew Smith, transportation spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, derided the proposal as "more fortunes for the few, more misery for the many."
Tony Blair, the Labor leader, said the Government would be abandoning a key public service "at a fraction of its true value so that a few people make a vastly inflated profit with no guarantee of a proper service for the future."
"No, you're wrong," Prime Minister John Major said, asserting that the action would give the capital a "world class" subway network.
Then, to the laughter of Tory backbenchers, he added, "I find it extraordinary that the only two places in the world where privatization is reviled and state ownership preferred is the Labor Party and North Korea."
Labor, which is ahead by more than 20 points in the polls of voters for the election expected in May, has said it would like to maintain Government control of the Underground but to attract private investment through partnerships.
Fighting a battle for economic survival common to urban transportation systems, the London Underground charges riders roughly 30 percent more in fares than other cities and manages that way to cover all its operating and maintenance costs. New York, by comparison, pays only 88 percent of those same expenses with the sale of its tokens, Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group, said in a telephone interview.
London has regularly seen its capital budget slashed, with equipment breakdowns and derelict station conditions the result. Still the grumbling over the discomforts of traveling the Underground would seem positively quaint to New Yorkers. Asked today about crime on the Underground, one rider looked surprised and then chuckled, saying, "Nothing more than the occasional spot of bother."
When Mr. Blair mentioned the Government's past privatization performance, he was alluding to evidence that it greatly undervalued lines and rolling stock in the just completed selloff of Britain's railways, allowing investors and management buyout teams to resell the properties within months at multi-million-dollar profits.
Labor has asserted that the Government sold $30 billion worth of assets for less than $4 billion. Mr. Blair said today that the Underground might be worth as much as $20 billion but that the Government might let it go for as little as $1 billion.
Coincidentally, today was the day that the last train company in the 11,000-mile British Rail network -- Scotrail -- passed into private hands, marking the end to a busy 14-month period in which all 25 of Britain's train companies were sold to private concerns. Among the new owners are Richard Branson's Virgin Group of Companies, two large British bus companies, the shipping company Sea Containers and the French Compagnie General des Eaux group.
There have been immediate cosmetic improvements on the newly privatized lines, with conductors, porters and ticket takers in smart new uniforms and some preliminary statistics showing that the trains are running more punctually and attracting more passengers. The new owners are already turning profits and promising vast capital investment during the next five years.
Unions and passenger groups have protested the numbers of layoffs, and the first line to be sold off, South West Trains, caused a furor this month when it eliminated 39 commuter trips from its timetables because it had dismissed too many drivers to pilot its trains.
In their 18 years in office, the Tories have returned to the private sector the state-run industries in steel, water, gas, buses, electricity, telephones and coal. They have recently backed off rumored plans to sell the Royal Mail.
The notion of turning the London Underground, in public hands for the last 63 years, back to private owners was leaked to newspapers last month along with a memo from Sir George saying it "will be a unique and very difficult privatization to sell to the public." Today he argued that it would be a major part of the Conservative Party's agenda in the coming election.
The Underground, the oldest part of which dates to 1863, operates 20 hours a day over 255 miles of track and comprises 248 stations on 11 lines that provide 2.7 million rides a day. Most fares fall between $1.90 and $5.15. Londoners' complaints have grown in recent years at the increasing failures of signals and rolling stock and the deterioration of track and stations that 30 years of cutting capital investment to hold down spending has produced. A lot of attention has been paid in particular to problems on the Northern Line, which goes to neighborhoods of some prominent newspaper columnists.
In last week's announcement, the Underground warned passengers to expect congestion, delays and no station improvements. In recent months there have been a power breakdown that stranded passengers for two hours in darkness, a derailment that caused 200 theatergoers to walk to safety along a tunnel platform, a fire that led to the evacuation of two major stations and some overcrowding on platforms because of construction projects.
A rider of the New York system could be forgiven for asking what else is new. London stations remain cleaner than those in New York, announcements are audible, its well-known circle-and-horizontal-line logo is lighted and visible from blocks away and its passengers can even be courteous. Trains are more frequent, and electrified signs signal their arrival, destination and the location of trains behind them in the minutes before they reach the station.
The Underground gained a passenger this morning when Sir George left his ministerial limousine at Parliament and traveled one stop from Westminster to the St. James Park headquarters of the Tube to brief directors there on his upcoming talk in Commons. His eventful day almost came to a halt on the platform, but a quick-witted inspector got it back under way by pointing out that he was inserting his exit ticket in the wrong turnstile slot.

HEADLINE: Fence-Sitter Will Support Amendment On Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, one of two Senators who had not declared a position, announced today that she would vote for a balanced-budget amendment, meaning that the outcome of the vote in the Senate will probably be decided by the last holdout, Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey.
Mr. Torricelli, who, like Ms. Landrieu, is a freshman Democrat, seemed to enjoy being the center of attention and refused today to say how he would vote on a Republican proposal to amend the Constitution to require a balanced Federal budget. He scheduled a news conference for Wednesday. 
 Two years ago, when Mr. Torricelli was in the House of Representatives, he voted for an almost identical amendment. But he has said recently that he now had serious reservations about the matter.
Senate approval of a constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds' majority, or 67 votes, assuming that all 100 senators vote. All 55 Republicans and 11 Democrats have announced their support for the Republican measure. The other 33 Democrats, besides Mr. Torricelli, have declared their opposition.
At Ms. Landrieu's first individual news conference since she became a Senator, she said a constitutional amendment was probably the best way to impose the "fiscal discipline" she thought the country needed. But she conceded that the main reason for her decision was that she had promised in her campaign to support a balanced-budget amendment.
Asked whether that promise had been an educated one, she replied, "I know a lot more about the subject now than I did in the campaign."
Did that mean she would have decided against the amendment if it had not been for her campaign commitment?
"You could read that between the lines," she responded.
The proposed constitutional amendment would require a balanced budget two years after its ratification -- but not before 2002 -- and every year after that. It would have to be ratified by three-quarters of the state legislatures. If the amendment were ratified, the balanced-budget requirement could be overridden only by a three-fifths' majority in the Senate and the House.
The amendment has been an important part of Republican doctrine for years. In 1995, it was approved by the House, but it failed in the Senate by one vote. This year, the situation is even more problematic in the House than it is in the Senate.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said today he hoped that a final Senate vote could be taken next Tuesday.
The amendment's sponsors hold that a constitutional amendment is the only way to curb the tendency of politicians to overspend and run chronic budget deficits. The opponents counter that such an amendment would make it harder to respond to emergencies and would jeopardize Social Security benefits.
Mostly, the debate in the Senate has seemed driven more by politics than economics. Opinion polls show that when people are asked simply whether they favor a balanced-budget constitutional amendment, about 80 percent say they do. But fewer than half say they support such an amendment if it would require lower Social Security benefits.
Tonight, the Senate rejected in a 65-to-35 vote a substitute amendment offered by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, that would have required a balanced budget but would have excluded Social Security from the budget calculations. That amendment never had a chance of approval, but it provided political cover for Democrats who want to be able to say they favor a balanced-budget amendment but are determined to protect Social Security.

HEADLINE: Making a Star of Key's Spangled Banner

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
How do you clean a huge old piece of cloth that is a national symbol, the subject of the anthem that is sung, if with some difficulty, by every American?
Very carefully. Very slowly. And in Washington, you start by convening a conference of experts. 
 The object of all this attention is the very Star-Spangled Banner that waved over Fort McHenry and inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem that became the national anthem.
Since that day in 1814 when Key saw the American flag from the deck of a ship in Baltimore's harbor and knew the British had not captured the city, it has lost a star and several yards of stripes. In fact, it is now 270 square feet smaller, mostly because proud citizens have snipped pieces from it over the years.
But it has also gained a benign but mysterious red "V" sewn on a white stripe. And it has become a mat for dust, pollen, bits of leaves and soil, and errant fibers from paper, mops and the like. This is what Suzanne Thomassen-Krauss, a textile expert at the Smithsonian Institution, where the flag is displayed, calls "normal indoor pollution."
The flag has also put on weight, going from 80 pounds when it flew over the fort to about 135 pounds now, mostly because of a linen backing added to protect it years ago.
Ronald E. Becker, the Smithsonian official responsible for the cleaning project, described his problem this way: "What's the best approach to maximizing the life of the flag and still have it on display?"
So how do you clean a national icon? That's what Mr. Becker and his group are studying. They do know they aren't going to put it in a washing machine. But they may use a gentle vacuum cleaner.
In 1812, the young United States got into a war with Britain over trade and territorial disputes. Today, probably the most lasting memory of the war was that it gave birth to "The Star-Spangled Banner," and not that it resulted in the burning of the White House, which occurred just before the attack on Baltimore.
The flag that inspired Key was ordered in 1813 by Maj. George Armistead, the commander of Fort McHenry, who wanted an extraordinarily large flag that could be seen from a great distance. He hired Mary Pickersgill, a Baltimore flag maker, to sew the 42-by-30-foot flag for $405.60. Given the year of the contract, that might seem an enormous amount, but Prof. Robert Sahr, an Oregon State University political scientist who has studied the relative value of money, put it at about $3,000 in 1996 dollars because the War of 1812 caused a period of great inflation.
Ms. Thomassen-Krauss, the Smithsonian textile conservator, said of Mrs. Pickersgill: "She's an interesting lady, and her mother made a flag for George Washington's headquarters in Cambridge, Mass."
Mrs. Pickersgill may have bought the fabric from Capt. Jesse Fearson, her brother-in-law, who had a dry-goods store in Baltimore, Ms. Thomassen-Krauss said. She kept the flag-making even more of a family project by enlisting her 13-year-old daughter, Caroline, to help her with the sewing, which took place on the floor of a local brewery. And she probably got advice from her mother, Rebecca Young.
Except for the cotton stars, the flag was made of wool bunting that presumably originated in England, then the world's wool center. Perhaps the wool was seized from a British ship by an American privateer or was bought in a third country after being shipped there from England, Ms. Thomassen-Krauss speculates.
"Wool was typical material for flags in this country up until the Civil War," she said. "Cotton at that time -- before the invention of the cotton gin -- was a luxury item. Wool is good for a flag, being elastic and durable under wear and tear."
What's fairly certain is that the flag didn't shrink at Fort McHenry, because forts didn't fly their prized flags in the rain. Instead, in bad weather they flew a smaller and less valuable banner called a storm flag.
The blue dye for the star field was made of indigo, probably from India or Southeast Asia. The red dye was made of cochineal, which comes from the bodies of female insects of the same name, and madder from a plant probably grown in the Netherlands or France.
Bunting is a textile term for an open-weave fabric. For the flag, the warp (the yarn stretched on the loom during weaving) and the weft (the filling yarn that is woven into the warp) are roughly 30 threads per inch for the blue field and 41 for the stripes.
The flag has 15 white stars -- when the flag is hung vertically, they are in six horizontal rows of two or three each -- and 15 stripes (8 red and 7 white), instead of the 13 in the current flag.
Last November, Mr. Becker, who is the associate director for capital programs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, brought together 50 experts -- textile scientists, conservators, historians, curators, designers and flag specialists -- from the United States, Canada and Britain to discuss the flag's conservation.
It is hung vertically under low light near the museum's second-floor entrance. A reproduction has been added at the bottom to represent the missing area. It serves as the backdrop for a pendulum that demonstrates that the earth rotates, and many people are so intent on watching the pendulum swing back and forth that they do not even notice the huge flag behind them.
The scientists will decide on the proper micro-environment for the flag. They will also determine a level of light that will be bright enough for the public to see the flag but not enough to damage it.
Mr. Becker estimated that it will cost about $15 million to construct a new display area for the flag, including the costs of replacing the air-conditioning system and changing the linen backing if necessary. Another $15 million will be sought to establish an endowment to care for the flag in the future.
Some of that money will come from the Government, since the Smithsonian is a quasi-Federal agency. The museum is hoping that individuals, corporations and foundations will provide the balance.
The flag once had a huge protective cover that was raised with some ceremony every hour on the hour, accompanied by "The Star-Spangled Banner." But the cover broke in 1994.
Mr. Becker said, "We saw it as an opportunity to not just replace it but to renew our conservation efforts and study the condition of the flag today."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls and Then Rallies Against the Yen and the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied yesterday even as stock and bond markets slumped after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank might raise interest rates to thwart inflation.
The unusual bluntness of Mr. Greenspan's message in Congressional testimony took currency traders by surprise. Many who had sold dollars on fear of a Wall Street selloff scrambled to buy the currency, accelerating its rebound in what is known as a short-covering rally. 
 "This was much wilder than anticipated," said Roger Chapin, foreign-exchange manager at Bank One in Columbus, Ohio. "People had trimmed back and gone the other direction with the dollar. Then they found themselves short dollars and had to rush out and cover that stuff."
The dollar traded as low as 1.6700 marks before rising sharply to settle in New York trading at 1.6902 marks, up from 1.6719 marks on Tuesday and the highest level in a week.
Against the yen, the dollar traded just below 121 yen before rebounding to settle in New York at 122.13 yen, up from 121.60 Tuesday. The British pound traded at $1.6343, down from $1.6350.
The dollar initially weakened in Asian and European dealings on fear of increased Japanese corporate repatriation of yen into dollars before Japan's fiscal year ends March 31.
Further pressuring the dollar were remarks by two senior members of the Bundesbank that dampened prospects for lower interest rates in Germany.
Klaus-Dieter Kuhbacher, a member of the central bank's policy-making council, said lower rates would not help stimulate the German economy. Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank vice president, said lower German rates would make the dollar excessively strong.
But the main focus for currency traders was Mr. Greenspan's appearance in Congress to report on the Fed's monetary policy. Many traders were predisposed to sell the dollar ahead of his testimony.
But Mr. Greenspan said the United States economy was remarkably healthy and inflation was tame, which are underlying components of the dollar's strength. He further suggested the Fed may raise short-term interest rates soon in a pre-emptive move against inflation. Higher rates would attract investment flows into dollars.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Surprises for everyone in a new analysis of affirmative action.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WITH California's initiative against affirmative action, Proposition 209, on the books and other states pondering rollbacks in their own affirmative action programs for public higher education, you'd think policy makers clearly understand the consequences of the contemplated changes.
Wrong. Apart from rudimentary inferences about how many nonwhites would make the cut if California's universities adopted race-blind admissions policies, a lack of hard evidence has left both critics and defenders of racial preferences free to exercise their imaginations. That's why an analysis by Thomas Kane, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, is so striking. 
 Mr. Kane's as-yet unpublished analysis has some surprises for everyone. Affirmative action, he argues, has really had significant impact on racial composition only in the nation's elite universities and colleges, not the schools that educate the vast bulk of young Americans.
That's one surprise. Another is that diversity through affirmative action has produced some clear payoffs in the job market. Most important, perhaps, Mr. Kane debunks the voguish idea that affirmative action based on class rather than race could serve as a palatable means to the same end.
It has long been assumed that affirmative action drove admissions policies from the top of the higher education pecking order to the bottom. The gap in admissions standards in the most academically selective fifth of colleges is, indeed, large. Here Mr. Kane found that other factors held equal, black and Hispanic students with combined S.A.T. scores of 1,100 had the same chance of admission as whites with scores of 1,400.
Step down a notch, though, and race seems to play little part in the probability of admissions or in racial composition of the student body. Of course, much of the reason is that most colleges simply cannot afford to be picky about academic qualifications if they wish to fill their classes. In Mr. Kane's sample of some 36,000 students from 1,000 high schools, fully 90 percent who applied to schools in the bottom three-fifths were admitted.
This would hardly satisfy critics of affirmative action -- notably Charles Murray, co-author of "The Bell Curve" -- who argue that asking poorly prepared minorities to compete in the very best colleges reinforces racial stereotypes. Mr. Murray argues that affirmative action actually harms the intended beneficiaries by increasing their chance of failure. But here again, what seems obvious is apparently not true. While the nonwhites in Mr. Kane's sample did underperform their white counterparts at elite colleges even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, the performance gap was smaller than at unselective schools. Black or white, students from similar backgrounds who attended elite schools were more likely to finish school and had higher earnings if they did finish.
But that doesn't mean there aren't losers. Affirmative action may help nonwhites going to Berkeley or the University of Virginia, but perhaps at a cost to whites who must therefore settle for lesser schools. And no mainstream politician is eager to explain the virtues of racial diversity to parents of white applicants whose places are taken by nonwhites with lower test scores. That goes a long way toward explaining why "class based" affirmative action has become the moderate politician's policy flavor of the month.
The idea is simple. Discrimination is more palatable when it is linked to tangible economic disadvantage rather than to less tangible racial disadvantage. Thus many Americans who take the 14th Amendment literally would still be willing to give admissions preferences to children -- black, white, Hispanic -- from families with low incomes.
Class-based affirmative action would still favor nonwhites as a group because they are, on average, much poorer. But Mr. Kane throws cold water on the idea that it would serve as a substitute for racial preference. That's because so many of the minority students attending highly selective colleges are from the middle class.
Indeed, Mr. Kane's figures suggest that in order to replicate the current level of nonwhite admissions, elite colleges would have to grant preferences to six times as many low-income students. And this would fundamentally change the character of the colleges, sharply lowering average test scores and displacing huge numbers of high-scoring middle-income whites.
Where, then, is the middle ground? For Mr. Kane, "a more workable compromise" would be to maintain race-based affirmative action, but only for nonwhites who also qualify as economic minorities -- that is, those from poor families or poor neighborhoods. But that would certainly mean fewer members of minority groups would enjoy the advantages of an elite public education.
In the end, the much misused aphorism about free lunches applies here. Places in top colleges are limited. No amount of ingenuity can eliminate the sting of affirmative action for everyone.
