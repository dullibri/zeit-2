HEADLINE: NYC;
Straphangers Find a Friend In an Old Foe

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
WHO'D have thunk it?
Who would ever have cast Gov. George E. Pataki as a born-again friend of the New York straphanger? 
 The George Pataki we knew presided just two years ago over the largest subway and bus fare increase in the city's history. And gave the nod to the first cuts in mass-transit service in 20 years. And sliced tens of millions from the state's subsidy to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. And snatched $220 million from a transit reserve fund so that he could balance his own budget, a bit of fiscal legerdemain known to some as the Great Train Robbery.
Could this be the same George Pataki who talked yesterday about wanting to "empower the rider" with a menu of discount passes never seen here before? The same George Pataki who got almost misty-eyed talking about how he used to ride the New York subway as a young man?
This is a fellow juggling three mortgages for his Victorian mansion in Garrison and his estate near Lake George and his townhouse in Saratoga Springs. Yet what he spoke of yesterday was his time on the Upper West Side years ago, when he took the subway and wished he could simply hop on and off for free to sample the city's many cultural offerings.
(O.K., that was long ago. No one can remember when Mr. Pataki was last seen riding the New York trains, a point underlined yesterday at the news conference he called to announce the planned discount fares. For the benefit of the cameras, he held up a Metrocard. He had to borrow it from the man standing next to him.)
Given the Governor's record, it is awfully tempting to see his sudden championing of rider givebacks as a last-minute conversion on the eve of an election year. Could it be mere coincidence that he has done a neat end-run around the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who was looking to breathe life into his run for governor with calls for a different discount, one that would give straphangers 12 rides for the price of 10?
Only a few months ago, muck-a-mucks at the M.T.A. were insisting that the kind of special pass now being proposed was a loser. It would mean sacrificing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, they told rider-advocacy groups like the Straphangers Campaign, which had been appealing for unlimited-ride passes for years.
Be bold, Straphangers had urged. But it got nowhere with arguments that such passes work in other American cities, that discounts would enhance the environment by luring people out of their cars and into trains, that they might even pay for themselves some day because of the anticipated increase in ridership.
"If you offer fare discounts, they will come," predicted Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign. Yesterday, Mr. Pataki stood shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Russianoff. Count on M.T.A. board members doing the same when they meet next week to ratify the Governor's proposals. Collectively, they no more defy Mr. Pataki than Iraqi generals tell Saddam Hussein where to get off.
The discounts he now proposes will cost millions of dollars. Where will the money come from (the same money we were told not long ago wasn't there)? Not to worry. "We're very confident this can be sustained," he assured reporters.
IF he's right, perhaps it is time to set cynicism aside. Politics undoubtedly played a role. But in polite society, when someone hands you a long-sought gift, the only acceptable response is, Thank you.
Questions remain, of course. What will happen if Wall Street goes bust, taking New York's economy with it and that hoped-for subway boom as well? Hard times mean fewer people riding to work. What about the Transport Workers Union, which wants to see part of a surplus set aside for future wage settlements?
And what about using some of the spare money to undo the service reductions of 1995, then build from there? Mr. Pataki suggested there might be room to enhance services. But that came almost as an afterthought, even though many subway riders say that improved conditions are every bit as important to them as fare discounts.
No doubt, the experts will weigh in on these matters, and sure as there is a sunrise, the politicians will also have their say. But that's for tomorrow. Yesterday, the environmentalists and rider advocates had only one thing to say. It was a simple Thank you.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Study on Using Magnets to Treat Pain Surprises Skeptics

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

 BODY:
NO ONE was more skeptical about using magnets for pain relief than Dr. Carlos Vallbona, former chairman of the department of community medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So Dr. Vallbona was amazed when a study he did found that small, low intensity magnets worked, at least for patients experiencing symptoms that can develop years after polio.
Dr. Vallbona had long been fascinated by testimonials about magnets from his patients, and even from medical leaders. But his interest in magnet therapy became more serious in 1994 when he and a colleague, Carlton F. Hazlewood, tried them for their own knee pain. The pain was gone in minutes. "That was too good to be true," Dr. Vallbona said. 
 Dr. Vallbona knew that the power of suggestion can fool both patient and doctor. But he also wondered: could strapping small, low intensity magnets to the most sensitive areas of the body for several minutes relieve chronic muscular and joint pains among patients in his post-polio clinic at Baylor's Institute for Rehabilitation Research.
Valid studies could allow consumers to make informed choices. And if magnet therapy were found to be safe and effective, it could relieve pain with fewer drugs -- and their unwanted side effects.
Endorsements from professional athletes are one reason Americans spend large sums on magnets to seek pain relief. But most doctors take a "buyer beware" attitude because many claims lack scientific proof or explanation of how they might work. The Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors and manufacturers about health claims for magnets.
Aware of the medical profession's skepticism about magnet therapy, Dr. Vallbona sought to conduct science's most rigorous type of study. Participants would agree to allow the investigators to randomly assign them to groups getting treatment with active magnets or sham devices. But neither the patients nor the doctors treating them would know what therapy was used on which patient.
First, Dr. Vallbona informally tested magnets on a few patients. One was a priest with post-polio syndrome who celebrated mass with difficulty due to marked back pain that prevented him from raising his left hand. After applying a magnet for a few minutes the pain was gone, Dr. Vallbona recalled, and, "the priest said this was a miracle."
Then a human experimentation committee allowed Dr. Vallbona to test 50 volunteers with magnets that at 300 to 500 gauss, were slightly stronger than refrigerator magnets. They were made in different sizes so they could fit over the anatomic area identified as setting off their pain.
It was difficult to design a system to prevent participants from learning whether they were being treated with a magnet or a sham.
So Dr. Vallbona asked Magnaflex Inc., a magnet manufacturer in Corpus Christi, Tex., to prepare active magnets and inactive devices that could not be told apart. The devices were labeled in code.
As a further precaution, a staff member observed the patients throughout the 45-minute period of therapy to make sure they would not try to find out -- by testing with a paper clip, say -- what treatment they were receiving.
After the investigators identified the source of the pain and then pressed on it, the 39 women and 11 men in the study graded the pain on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (worst). Then after the experimental treatment, the participants rated their pain in a standard questionnaire. The volunteers were tested only one time.
The 29 who received an active magnet reported a reduction in pain to 4.4 from 9.6, compared with a smaller decline to 8.4 from 9.5 among the 21 treated with a sham magnet.
The Baylor scientists emphasized that their study applied only to pain from the post-polio condition. Nevertheless, their report in last month's issue of Archives of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, a leading specialty journal, has shocked many doctors who have scoffed at claims for magnets' medical benefits.
In an article about magnet therapy for chronic pain published five months ago, Dr. William Jarvis, a professor of public health and preventive medicine at Loma Linda University in California and president of the National Council Against Health Fraud, dismissed magnet therapy as "essentially quackery."
Now, Dr. Jarvis said in an interview, the Baylor study changed his mind. "But like any other pilot study, it needs to be replicated," he said.
Dr. Vallbona's findings have led him to try to carry out a larger study in several medical centers, and they are expected to lead other investigators to conduct their own studies.
Dr. Lauro S. Halstead of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, a pioneer in studying the post-polio syndrome, was among experts who said that further studies were needed to answer questions like: Will various strength magnets produce different degrees of benefit? How long does the pain relief last? Will the effect wear off after multiple applications? For what other conditions might magnets work?
At the University of Virginia, Ann Gill Taylor's team last month began recruiting 105 volunteers with fibromyalgia, a painful muscle condition of unknown cause, to test magnetic sleep pads.
Like the Baylor study, the volunteers and doctors are not told whether the subject will be sleeping on an active or sham magnet. Participants are told that if they try to determine whether their treatment is with a magnet or a sham one, it could ruin the findings of the study. But Dr. Taylor said there was no way to prevent cheating.
Dr. Taylor said she also planned to conduct studies of possible uses of magnets in relieving phantom limb and stump pain among amputees.
Dr. Vallbona said he did not know why magnets worked for many post-polio patients but not for others, or why some said they felt improvement in areas of the body far distant from where the magnet was applied.
Magnets' medical benefits have been proclaimed for centuries. So why has it taken so long to do studies to begin to answer the questions? The reasons involve economic, political, professional and human factors.
Many doctors criticize the lucrative magnet industry for not investing in studies the way drug companies often do. "They don't do simple research," Dr. Jarvis said, and "it is hard to imagine an easier study to conduct than a magnet one for pain."
Yet doctors share the responsibility to do such research, and only rarely have they reported undertaking the scientifically controlled studies needed to settle major disputes about reported therapies.
In many such debates, doctors demand a biological explanation for a therapy's benefits. Without documentation that satisfies them, doctors may summarily reject the claims. Yet in their everyday practices, the same doctors may use other therapies that lack scientific proof for why they work.
Scientists working in nonprofit medical schools and university hospitals are strongly influenced by economics because they need government grants to pay for their overhead. Since scientific success is measured in part by the dollar amount of their grants, doctors tend not to pay for their studies, even if they are relatively inexpensive.
The Baylor study was exceptional. It was done without a grant. Had it been done with government aid, Dr. Vallbona said, it would have cost about $50,000. Magnaflex provided the active and inactive magnets free, the doctors donated their time and insurance companies were not charged for magnet therapy.
Until recently government agencies and the scientists who judge applications to them have tended not to support studies on magnets and other therapies on the fringe.
The reluctance is well-founded. Over history, so many claims for popular remedies have failed to hold up that many doctors are reluctant to put aside a promising project of their own to study something that may well turn out to be a fad.
Scientists are heavily influenced by peer pressure. Senior scientists often discourage younger investigators from replicating another group's studies because doing so is less likely to advance their careers than making novel findings.
But in an age of medical consumerism, patient demand is changing some research agendas. For instance, the National Institutes of Health has created an office of alternative medicine, which is paying for the magnet studies at the University of Virginia.
In tackling fringe areas, scientists usually know that they are stepping in deep water, risking scorn from colleagues who believe that what they are studying is theoretically unsound at best and quackery at worst. Even so, many with the courage may not know how deep the waters are.

 CORRECTION:
The Doctor's World column of Science Times on Dec. 9, about a study showing that magnets relieved pain in patients who had had polio, included a researcher's erroneous description of the role of Magnaflex Inc. The company, a distributor of Bioflex magnets, provided them; it did not manufacture them.

HEADLINE: A Vry Brf Hstry of Phlnthpy

BYLINE: By Peter Dobkin Hall

 BODY:
Like any other activity, philanthropy has had its share of saints and rascals, some pursuing utopian visions, others cloaking self-interest in ennobling rhetoric. What follows are some hysteric, er, historic moments in the roadshow of American philanthropic life.
 Peter Dobkin Hall
 
1643
Introduction to Creative Fund-Raising
Harvard College administrators turn from learning to lucre long enough to devise a bedrock of fund-raising -- the matching grant. In a document titled "New England's First Fruits," which they dispatch to England, they cite the generosity of colonists as an inducement for giving by wealthy Puritans in the mother country. (But, after all, these folks were among the first to name a charitable enterprise after its lead donor, John Harvard.) 

1667
A First Scandal
 The English Puritan Edward Hopkins bequeaths a large sum in trust to give "Encouragement unto those forreign Plantations for the breeding up of Hopefull youth in the way of Learning"; in short, for building grammar schools in New England. The General Court at Hartford seizes the property and divides it among three Connecticut Valley towns, not one of which has a school building, let alone a school. Litigation over the Hopkins Trust continues for the next 130 years.
 
1710
The Solicitation Is Born
Perceptive fellow that he is, the Rev. Cotton Mather sets forth in a treatise on charity the golden rule of solicitation: "Get unto the Rich Men" and "put Rich Men in mind of the Opportunities to Do Good, with which the God, who gives Power to Get Wealth, has favored and obliged and enriched them."
 
1789
Building a Better Pyramid Scheme
Benjamin Franklin's will leaves trusts of ' £1,000 each to Philadelphia and Boston. Intrigued by compounding interest -- a new idea -- Franklin directs that income from these trusts be reinvested for 200 years. When distributed in 1989, Philadelphia's fund totals $2.3 million and Boston's, $4.7 million.
 
1819
Nonprofits at the Barricades
 It was the case of Dartmouth College, whose assets had been seized by the State of New Hampshire and its board replaced by government appointees. At stake, however, was the fate of the private sector. Daniel Webster pulls out every oratorical stop, declaiming, among many other things, that Dartmouth is "a small college -- and yet there are those who love it." Spectators weep. So do Justices. The United States Supreme Court declares private institutions constitutionally protected from government interference. The day is saved.
 
1831
And the Winner Is . . .
The Philadelphia multimillionaire Stephen Girard leaves his entire estate to create an institution for "poor male white orphan children" on the condition that no ecclesiastic, missionary or minister sets foot in it. Attacked by angry clergymen, opportunistic politicians and covetous relatives, the terms of Girard's will take more than 15 years of litigation and an 1844 United States Supreme Court decision before they can be carried out.
 
1838
Debate of the Century, and Beyond
A gift from the estate of the bastard son of the Duke of Northumberland and the niece of the Duke of Somerset -- 104,960 gold sovereigns to establish an institution "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men" -- sparks a vitriolic debate over private charity. A Southern Congressman warns that accepting it will encourage "every whippersnapper vagabond to have his name distinguished in the same way." Meanwhile, Treasury Department officials are looting the fund. Only an eloquent speech by ex-President John Quincy Adams shames Congress into restoring the missing money and establishing the Smithsonian Institution in 1846.
 
1887
Break a Trust and Make New York Culture Capital
 Samuel J. Tilden directs his executors to use his multimillion dollar estate for charitable, educational and scientific purposes that will benefit mankind. With covert encouragement from Governor David Hill, Tilden's improvident nephews successfully challenge the will. In the uproar that follows, New Yorkers rewrite charities laws that had made large-scale charitable giving almost impossible, enabling robber barons to pour their wealth into the city's hospitals, libraries, museums and universities.
 
1889
A Challenge From Carnegie
The steel magnate Andrew Carnegie urges other "men of affairs" to apply the same genius they had used in accumulating their wealth to the task of giving it away. Of those who don't, he says, "The public verdict will then be: The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."
 
1916
It Seems They Didn't Like Him
Combining hubris and chutzpah, John D. Rockefeller asks Congress to charter his proposed $100 million foundation. The request sets off a wave of criticism of "the most hated man in America," as the newspapers call him. Samuel Gompers, the labor leader, declares, "The one thing that the world could gracefully accept from Mr. Rockefeller now would be the establishment of a great endowment for research and education to help other people see in time how they can keep from being like him."
 
1947
The Macaroni Monopoly
Searching for ways to do well by doing good, New York University Law School alumni buy various business enterprises and donate them to their alma mater. Their acquisition of the C. F. Mueller Company, for one, makes the law school the largest noodle manufacturer in the world -- and the subject of hostile Congressional scrutiny.
 
1990
On Your Mark, Get Set . . .
Estimating the collective net worth of baby boomers' parents at $6.8 trillion, two Cornell economists, Robert Avery and Michael Rendall, predict "the biggest intergenerational transfer of wealth in United States history." Among the nation's charitable fund-raisers, the scramble is on.
 
1995
The Year of the Fraud
Is nothing sacred? First William Aramony, president of United Way of America, diverts $1.2 million of the charity's money to romance a 17-year- old. Then John G. Bennett, the founder of Foundation for New Era Philanthropy, is trapped in his own matching-grants Ponzi scheme that defrauds the Philadelphia Orchestra, American Red Cross, Salvation Army and many others to the tune of $354 million.
 
1996
Ted's Excellent Idea
As he turns $200 million over to favorite causes, the media mogul Ted Turner denounces Forbes's 400, the popular annual feature listing the nation's growing population of billionaires, declaring: "That list is destroying our country! These new super-rich won't loosen up their wads because they're afraid they'll reduce their net worth and go down on the list. That's their Super Bowl."
Peter Dobkin Hall is the director of Yale University's program on nonprofit organizations.

HEADLINE: Better Subway Plan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I agree with your Dec. 9 editorial that in addition to the monthly and weekly subway passes just proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, another transit pricing option that deserves consideration is reduced fares for riders who travel at times other than rush hour.
Suppose that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority charges $1.50 for peak rush-hour travel but decreases the fare to $1 at all other times. Some transit customers, particularly those who enjoy flexible schedules or who already travel early or late in the peak rush-hour periods, would shift their travel times to take advantage of the discount. 
 Because so much of the cost of providing mass transit is based on the capacity required at rush hour, even small declines in ridership at peak times provide significant savings. Customers who continue to travel at the height of rush hour would benefit from shorter lines and less crowded conditions.
Cutting the price for off-peak travel would encourage more New Yorkers, including more of our low-income residents, to use the transit system.

HEADLINE: Survey Shows Manufacturers Optimistic

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
United States manufacturers are optimistic about the coming year despite uncertainty over Asia's financial crisis, expecting stronger revenues, increased employment and stable prices, a group of factory purchasing executives said yesterday.
Manufacturers are "more optimistic about the next 12 months than they were in December 1996," the National Association of Purchasing Management said in its annual forecast. Four out of five companies surveyed said they expected business to improve over 1997. Fifty-nine percent expressed optimism about the coming year, the largest percentage expressing that sentiment since May 1988. 
 "We see growth in capital investment; we see prices very stable; we see a slight increase in manufacturing employment," said Norbert Ore, head of the association's business survey panel.
Moreover, the holiday sales outlook is the strongest since 1994, the report said, adding that 59 percent of those surveyed expected good sales, while only 1 percent expected sales to be poor.
Mr. Ore said the impact of Asia's economic crisis on the United States economy remained unclear. But so far, he said, the association has not seen evidence of order cancellations as a result.

HEADLINE: Asian Malaise Causes Stocks to Tumble

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Fear that Asia's economic turmoil will stall the corporate earnings of American companies that do business in the region pushed stocks lower yesterday.
Highlighting investors' concerns, shares of Oracle plunged 9 7/16, or 29 percent, to 22 15/16 on news released late Monday that fiscal second-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' expectations. The company cited weaker-than-expected sales in Asia and in the United States' telecommunications industry. So many shares changed hands that Oracle had the highest volume ever on the Nasdaq market, 172.5 million shares. 
 Its dismal performance infected other technology shares -- Microsoft was off 1 13/16, to 144 5/16, while Cisco Systems fell 2 5/16, to 87 7/16 -- and pushed the Nasdaq composite index down 1.8 percent, or 30.99 points, to 1,620.55. Oracle was also the leading decliner in the Standard & Poor's 500 company stock index, which fell 6.59 points, and the Nasdaq 100, which fell almost 3 percent.
Although the Dow Jones industrial average had a larger point decline than any of the broader market indexes, falling 61.18 points, to 8,049.66, analysts said the blue-chip average was largely unaffected by the Asian malaise that plagued investor sentiment yesterday. But, again, technology shares were weak. I.B.M. lost 2 1/2, closing at 110 3/8, and Hewlett-Packard fell 1 15/16, to 64 9/16.
But, the market's slump, in the wake of last week's peak of 983.79 for the S.& P. 500, should be a warning to investors not to become too complacent, traders and analysts said.
"I think we got a good wake-up call," said Arthur Hogan, a senior trader at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
After last week's market surge, and news of the International Monetary Fund's bailout package for South Korea, many investors felt the domestic stock market could reach new highs before year-end, Mr. Hogan said. "But we still have some real problems out there," which could hurt the market, he cautioned.
"It's a clear warning, whether it's overdone or not," Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company, said of yesterday's declines.
"The Asian slowdown will be much more than a short episode, and the surprises in technology are much more likely to be on the down side," he forecast. "Even though the system isn't going to fall apart, that doesn't mean the economic problems they are going to face are solved."
Mr. Pradilla is advising clients to focus on companies with more domestic exposure that should not be affected by the gyrations in Asia. He cited Eli Lilly, which closed at 63 3/8, down 7/8, and America Online, which closed at 86 1/2, down 3/4, as examples.
Many multinational companies, not only technology shares, can still be affected by Asia's trouble, he said.
Yesterday, Morgan Stanley's index of the 50 largest American multinational companies fell 4.82 points, to 538.69, posting its second consecutive loss after reaching a high of 544.85 on Friday.
Some analysts contend that the records reached by some indexes last week indicate that Asia's woes will not keep the market from moving higher.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Bond Prices Move Higher
 Prices of Treasury securities recovered yesterday from a three-day slump with a little help from the Federal Reserve and a weak retail sales report.
Bonds rose after the Federal Reserve entered the market as a buyer of coupon issues totaling $1.83 billion, with maturities running from Feb. 15, 2003 to Nov. 15, 2027. The Fed periodically buys Treasury securities to add money to the banking system.
Bonds then got an additional lift from the release of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim report of weekly chain-store sales, which showed sales fell a surprising three-tenths of 1 percent for the latest week. Later yesterday, the Redbook retail report, published by Lynch, Jones & Ryan, came in as expected, up 1.5 percent for the week ended on Saturday.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 10/32, to 100 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.11 percent from 6.13 percent on Monday.
Analysts said the Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim report in the morning suggested that the economy might indeed be slow enough to keep inflation from accelerating and restrain the Fed from raising short-term interest rates in the near term. Nevertheless, there are investors who believe recent signs of a strong economy are reasons to stay alert.

HEADLINE: The Family Truck

 BODY:
Every suburban parking lot is stacked with minivans and sport utility vehicles that do nothing remotely connected with commercial hauling or farming. Yet these vehicles of choice for a multitude of families and commuters are classified as light trucks by Federal regulators, allowing them to escape the Federal pollution and fuel economy standards that apply to cars.
The light-truck category was created decades ago when most vehicles in this category, such as pickup trucks, were indeed used for agricultural or commercial purposes. But when regulators classified the Chrysler minivan as a light truck in the early 1980's, they created a giant loophole that now threatens to compromise Government efforts to conserve fuel, control smog and reduce carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming. 
 In almost every way, Federal law regulates these vehicles -- which are mostly used as passenger cars -- more loosely than actual cars. While consumers like them for their power, less than 15 percent of all sport utility vehicles are used for towing or other truck-like activities.
Even so, most of these vehicles are allowed to emit nearly twice the smog-causing nitrous oxides as cars. They need only meet a fuel economy standard of 20.7 miles per gallon, compared with an average 27.5 miles per gallon for all the cars produced by a given manufacturer. They are exempt from gas-guzzler taxes that apply to cars getting less than 22.5 miles per gallon. The larger light trucks are also exempt from luxury taxes, which apply to cars costing more than $36,000, though many deluxe trucks can cost even more.
The regulatory and tax benefits of these vehicles, coupled with consumer demand for roomier transportation, have created an enormous light-truck market that now represents 40 percent of all family vehicles sold. Sales will probably reach 50 percent of the passenger market in the next five years, pushing up emissions from these less efficient, dirtier vehicles.
Even though there are still twice as many cars on the road as light trucks, the trucks produce as much total carbon dioxide as cars because they burn more fuel. By 2010 these trucks may produce up to 75 percent of the smog-causing pollutants and 63 percent of the carbon emissions coming out of personal vehicle tailpipes. Unless there is some regulatory change, light trucks will be the largest and fastest-growing contributor to transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.
Analysts at the Environmental Protection Agency have been tracking the problem for some time. Yet tightening the loophole has been considered so difficult politically that even environmentalists have shied away from joining the battle. But a global warming treaty that would commit the United States to reducing greenhouse emissions within 15 years may finally force Congress and the Administration to look at controlling the light-truck factor.
This would not mean doing away with the light-truck category. Regulators need to come up with a more discriminating definition for trucks, perhaps requiring them to have certain structural characteristics that many minivans and sport utility vehicles would not meet. If a light truck is nothing more than an extra-big family car, as is true of most vehicles in that category today, it should have to meet the pollution and efficiency standards that apply to cars. Anything less will leave a loophole big enough to drive a truck through.

HEADLINE: Japan Bank-Aid Plan Sends Dollar Lower

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday after the Prime Minister of Japan backed a plan to prop up the nation's banks and securities firms.
The dollar rose to a two-month high against the mark after a report showed German unemployment remained at its highest level since World War II and as German officials suggested that they were not bothered by the strength of the dollar, which has climbed 5 percent in the last month. 
 The yen, down 11 percent versus the dollar this year, gained after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto asked his Liberal Democratic Party to consider using $77 billion to assist the financial industry, burdened by as much as $600 billion in bad loans.
"There's been some good yen buying on expectation Japan will adopt a plan to save its ailing financial institutions," said Tatsuya Enomoto, manager of foreign exchange at Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
The dollar slipped from a 5 1/2-year high, settling in New York trading at 129.59 yen, down from 130.45 yen on Monday. The dollar rose to 1.7904 marks from 1.7893 marks. The pound rose to $1.6507 from $1.6483.
The Liberal Democratic Party is expected to outline its bank bailout package on Friday. A credible plan could help the yen by restoring confidence in Japanese financial assets.
To be sure, some analysts caution against putting too much faith in any bank bailout before seeing more details and more evidence that a plan will be put into effect.
"We've been set up for disappointment in the past," said Ken Nixon, a currency salesman at Svenska Handelsbanken. "There's been no package yet. Reality is another thing. I'm waiting till we get a clearer picture."
The dollar rose against the mark after a report showed German unemployment in November was at 11.8 percent for a second month. That suggested Germany is having trouble emerging from a long slump.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Rents in South Bronx Attract New Businesses

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
Behind the gaunt facade of an industrial building in the Port Morris section of the Bronx, Ben Nadorf manufactures boxing gloves and punching bags. His company, Everlast Sports Manufacturing Corporation, employs 165 people in the Bronx.
Nearby, Harvey Morgan makes the underwires that hold brassieres in place. His company, S & S Industries, has 70 percent of the world market, Mr. Morgan estimates. He employs 450 people. 
 Last weekend, Lesley Eysler arrived in this eclectic industrial environment from the Chelsea section of Manhattan. She took 20,000 square feet of space for warehousing and distribution for her company -- called Regal Jewelry, although its merchandise line consists mainly of gifts and novelties -- in a 120,000-square-foot building at 131 Walnut Avenue. The saga of the building itself tracks the ups and downs in the fortunes of the Port Morris industrial zone.
The down side has been the gradual departure over a generation of such famous names as Farberware Industries, whose abandonment of its premises at 415 Bruckner Boulevard after the sale of the business has left 415,000 square feet of industrial space on the market. The upside is the arrival of smaller businesses seeking low-cost space with excellent access to the regional highway system.
"In the older specialty buildings like Farberware's, we won't get pots-and-pans manufacturers, but we can reconfigure the space into smaller components that can be either leased or purchased," said Neil W. Pariser, senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a 25-year-old nonprofit development company known by area business people as Sobro.
One such building is 131 Walnut Avenue, once the home of Arrow shirts and Philips-Jones men's clothing. When the private real estate market was comatose in the early 1980's, Sobro obtained a $2.2 million Federal grant, took a long-term lease on the empty building from the city and redeveloped it for industrial use. Special Additions, a maternity clothing company, leased all the space.
Special Additions is still there, but it has contracted. Per Scholas, a nonprofit maker of computers for schools, took 20,000 square feet two years ago. That left two floors available, and now Regal has taken one, with an option for more.
"I went from a rent of $9 a foot to $3.50 a foot," Ms. Eysler said, "and the transportation is easier for my trucks. In Chelsea, the police were starting to give out tickets like crazy." The company will maintain its showroom at 366 Fifth Avenue.
The building Regal left is 425 West 15th Street, the former Nabisco factory on two blocks between 9th and 11th Avenues, which has been restyled the Chelsea Market. It was taken over in 1995 by A.T.C. Management, a developer-owner based in Long Island City, Queens, and is being leased out mainly to food-processing companies and other suppliers to the restaurant and hotel industries, many of which also operate retail outlets on the ground floor.
The Port Morris industrial zone is a horseshoe-shaped area at the southwest corner of the Bronx, most of it between East 138th Street and Bruckner Boulevard, but running as far north as East 149th Street on its western and eastern perimeters.
Most of the area is within the Federal Government's South Bronx empowerment zone, and all of it falls within a New York State economic development zone. An employer can get as much as $4,500-a-year in combined Federal and state tax credits for each employee living within the boundaries of the zones.
A generation ago, 30,000 people worked in the Port Morris industrial area, Mr. Pariser estimated. By the early 80's, employment had sunk to 15,000 to 18,000. Now it is up to 24,000, he said.
Among the newer arriving companies, some are expanding. One is Milea Truck Sales, one of the East Coast's largest GMC truck dealers, which arrived in 1981 from Brooklyn. It took over an abandoned garage at 885 East 149th Street and built 40,000 square feet of space with the help of an Industrial Development Agency loan from the city. Now Milea employs 150 people at three Bronx locations.
The company intends to add a 10,000-square-foot extension to its East 149th Street building, to be used to manufacture truck bodies. The expansion requires the removal of a rock estimated to weigh 10 million pounds, lying in the bed of a mapped but never-built street.
"We will buy the rock from the city, demap the street, and build," said Barry Milea, a principal in the company. In this endeavor it has the collaboration of Sobro, which will apply for a state grant of $300,000.
But the factors that keep tenants in place extend beyond public grants. Mr. Nadorf, the 78-year-old president of Everlast, occupies 200,000 square feet at 750 East 132d Street, and two years ago he took an additional two floors of 35,000 square feet each in an adjacent building.
Everlast also operates in Moberly, Mo., 35 miles north of Columbia, where it has built a 304,000-square-foot manufacturing building. But its headquarters is staying in the Bronx.
"I live in New Rochelle and I'm a Bronx boy," said Mr. Nadorf, who took over the business after the death two years ago of his partner, David Golomb, son of Jacob Golomb, who founded the business in 1910. "I'm not going anywhere."

HEADLINE: After Rwandan Terror, Albright Promises Greater Vigilance

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, on the first stop of a weeklong visit to Africa, said today that the United States and other nations share the blame for massacres that have taken place in Central Africa.
The West waited too long to respond to Hutu killings of Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994 that left 500,000 people dead, she said. Some of the fighting involved Hutu who rearmed themselves from United Nations refugee camps operated at a cost of $1 million a day. 
 "We, the international community, should have been more active in the early stages of the atrocities in Rwanda in 1994 and called them what they were -- genocide," Ms. Albright said in a speech to the Organization of African Unity, whose delegates applauded her words.
She promised that the United States would control future funding "to insure that humanitarian aid is not used to sustain armed camps or to support genocidal killers."
She also promised "to find more effective ways of preventing conflict and reconciling former adversaries, to achieve justice and accountability in the aftermath of large-scale human rights violations, and to resist the emergence of new tyrannies."
"The United States has made a strong commitment to supervise our refugee assistance far more closely and to work to keep humanitarian aid from falling into the wrong hands," she added.
Ms. Albright said that Washington would help rebuild Congo, but only if President Laurent Kabila showed a commitment to democratic reform. In May, Mr. Kabila's rebel movement ousted Mobutu Sese Seko, ending nearly three decades of corrupt rule in the country, formerly called Zaire, that made Mr. Mobutu rich but left his country in tatters.
Ms. Albright said the United States would contribute $10 million to a World Bank fund to support reconstruction in Congo, and she promised to seek aid from Congress.
The Clinton Administration is also promoting a $30 million package of assistance in eastern Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, partly to train judicial and police officials.
Ms. Albright will meet with Mr. Kabila this week.

HEADLINE: A Chef Spices Up Hospital Life;
His Illness Is No Deterrent to a Taste for His Own Cooking

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
When the chef Patrick Clark checked into Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center the day after Thanksgiving for a long-awaited heart transplant, he knew dining would be an issue.
"I mean, we all know the stereotype: hospital food, airplane food," said Mr. Clark, 42, whose poor health forced him to step down recently after three years as executive chef at Tavern on the Green. 
 But, he added yesterday about the hospital fare, "I really thought I could tough it out."
He did not count, though, on the bone-dry roast pork with mock applejack sauce. Or the mushy fish fillet with lemon. Or the veal loaf -- the last straw -- which arrived like an insult on a plastic plate last Monday. "They brought it dry, no sauce at all, and it had been microwaved at least twice," said Mr. Clark. "I started thinking that I may be here two months, three months, waiting on a heart. I have to do something."
So Mr. Clark became probably the only Columbia-Presbyterian patient ever to have his meals specially prepared, in his room, by a former executive chef of Tavern on the Green.
Last week, his publicity agent sneaked a tabletop steamer into his private room at the Milstein Pavilion. His wife smuggled in a small electric grill and simple provisions in plastic bags. And last Sunday night, he successfully made his first meal: grilled chicken with lemon and herbs, and cauliflower steamed with garlic.
"The nurses came by and said, 'Boy, it sure smells good in here,' " he said. "I think they thought my wife brought me some food. They didn't know I was cooking in here."
Until yesterday, when a reporter called hospital officials to ask about Mr. Clark's meals, his culinary protest had gone undetected by nurses and doctors. But it had been viewed with a kind of jailbreak admiration by his fellow patients, six of whom recently formed a committee to complain about constantly bungled orders and the blandness of their low-fat, low-sodium meals.
"What the hospital bureaucracy doesn't realize is that heart-transplant patients stay here a very long time," said George Tokieda, a 56-year-old schoolteacher. "And we give this hospital a tremendous amount of positive public relations. But on the food, we feel like we're being ignored, big time."
"Maybe Patrick's going to get all that changed," he said.
Allen Hyman, the hospital's chief of staff, visited Mr. Clark yesterday afternoon and later said he would try to capitalize on the chef's dissatisfaction.
"His complaint was that the food was bland," Dr. Hyman said. "And he may be right, and I said I would be happy if he would talk to our chef, and maybe we could come up with some ways to improve it."
Dr. Hyman would not say whether he planned to shut down Mr. Clark's makeshift kitchen. The hospital does not have a specific policy barring cooking in one's room, but hospital officials said they would be forced to respond if other patients complained or if nursing supervisors judged that the cooking posed a safety concern.
Yesterday, Mr. Clark seemed much more concerned with eating than with starting a revolution.
A friend from Tavern on the Green delivered a 5-ounce piece of salmon marinated in olive oil, sliced garlic, basil, thyme and crushed peppercorns as Mr. Clark had requested the night before.
Gazing at his sweeping view of the Hudson River, Mr. Clark placed the salmon in the tiny grill for two minutes, used the tip of a knife to drizzle it with roasted-garlic oil, which he keeps in a Styrofoam cup, and again accompanied the main dish with steamed cauliflower.
His only concession to his circumstances was to pepper the salmon from a paper packet. ("I forgot to ask my wife to bring my pepper mill," he explained.) But it did not dampen his joy when he took the first bite.
"Now, you can't get salmon like that in a hospital," he said, smiling. Joseph Gay, a sous-chef from Tavern on the Green who had dropped by, shook his head, saying, "You're out of your mind!"
But then Mr. Clark has always been something of a maverick. He grew up in Canarsie, Brooklyn, and did not attend a high-powered cooking school. (He graduated from the department of hospitality management at New York City Technical College in Brooklyn, whose alumni also include Michael Romano, the chef at Union Square Cafe.) But by the early 1980's he was a star, part of a team that created Odeon in Tribeca and Cafe Luxembourg near Lincoln Center.
In the teeth of the recession in 1988 he opened his own restaurant, Metro, on the Upper East Side, and while it closed only two years later, his star was only slightly dimmed. In fact, in early 1993, he had the privilege of being asked to be executive chef at the White House. He turned down the offer.
Mr. Clark said that while he initially wanted to keep his bedside cooking a secret, he sought attention because he hoped it would help to force an improvement in the hospital food. (His agent also just happened to mention that Mr. Clark was working on a book.)
As he sat in his plaid pajamas and finished his cauliflower yesterday, Mr. Clark professed not to be worried about a crackdown. "It would look pretty bad for them, right?" he said. "And they sure can't kick me out of here."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Many Players, Many Losers;
How and Why Asian Currencies Tumbled So Quickly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
In early May, Japanese officials, concerned about the decline of the yen, hinted that they might raise interest rates. The threat never materialized. But it proved to be the first sign of an Asian flu that six months later is still spreading and has already prompted around $100 billion in international pledges for a cure.
The Japanese threat shifted the decisions of global investors, who immediately began to sell Southeast Asian currencies, setting off a tumble not only in the currencies but in the local stock markets as well. Leapfrogging from Thailand to Indonesia to Hong Kong, the financial shivers eventually shook Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down a record 554 points on Oct. 27. From its sickbed, Asia is now faced with a new year that promises very slow, if any, growth, painful bankruptcies and rising unemployment. 
 Speculators -- and the hedge funds they manage -- have been singled out by Asian politicians and others as the proximate cause of the turmoil, which spread to South Korea and continues to rattle Japan.
But the real story is much more complex, filled with bankers, corporate treasurers and mutual fund managers from the region and around the world who, unlike speculators, were not trying to profit from the fall of the currencies but still contributed significantly to their declines. Joined by many local companies, these agents actually had very strong vested interests in keeping the currencies stable.
There is no way to re-create the exact train of selling that pushed the currencies beyond the brink. But in interviews with bankers, economists, currency traders, portfolio managers, hedge fund executives and corporate treasurers in Asia and elsewhere, a picture has emerged of the sequence of events and the players who were central to the drama.
First, the talk of a Japanese interest rate increase raised fears among commercial bankers, investment bankers and others about the safety of big investment positions that were predicated on currency stability.
As these investors scurried to liquidate holdings in local currencies, the anxiety spread. Big foreign companies operating in the region became frightened, too, and scrambled to convert local revenues into dollars. And finally, local companies rushed to get yen and dollars. With everyone running for the exits, the Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah and other regional currencies were trampled.
"Big movements in asset markets don't tend to happen unless all the actors move from one side of the ship to the other," said Peter Fisher, head of market intervention at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech in Malaysia on Dec. 2 that the I.M.F. had been studying the impact of speculators in all this. "But from what we know so far," he said, "it would be a mistake to blame hedge funds."
Among the first to take the stage in the summertime drama were the bankers and treasurers, and a financial technique of theirs known by some as the carry trade.
For years, because of rock-bottom interest rates in Japan and low rates in the United States, banks, investment houses and insurers had borrowed in yen and dollars and put the proceeds into short-term notes in Southeast Asia that were paying far higher rates. These are the carry trades.
The trades attracted so many investors because the Southeast Asian currencies had been stable for years. Still, the trades did not come without risks. Should foreign interest rates rise, or the currencies start to lose value, the profits would diminish -- or might turn into losses.
Indeed, just the threat of a Japanese rate rise was enough to cause some investors to unwind their positions. That meant they sold their Asian notes and, in the process, the local currencies.
"If you had 50 banks doing it, that could create some pressure," conceded David Puth, head of foreign exchange in New York for Chase Manhattan, which had been involved in carry trades. "There are big forces in the market that are totally separate from speculators making a bet."
American companies that do big business in Asia, like the Dell Computer Corporation, added to the pressure as they rushed to protect themselves against further declines in the value of the local currencies in which they were paid. They did this by hedging, which allows an investor to lock in an exchange rate.
Mutual funds, like the T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund, moved, too, selling Asian securities and converting the proceeds back into dollars, further driving down the value of Asian currencies.
But chief among the participants were the many local companies and banks in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea that had borrowed billions of dollars at low rates abroad. Some used that money to expand; many banks used it for lending in overheated real estate markets. As their currencies fell in value, the amount the companies and banks owed in dollars and yen skyrocketed. To make their payments, these players also scrambled to get into dollars or yen.
What makes a currency move "is the enemy within, the corporates," said Chris Tinker, regional head of economics and debt research at ING Barings Asia in Hong Kong. Mr. Camdessus of the I.M.F. said, "The most important factor in the depreciation of exchange rates was the rush by domestic corporations to buy foreign exchange."
The underlying cause of the rout, Mr. Camdessus contended in his speech, was the mistaken faith of millions of investors in the stability of the smaller Asian currencies. Such misplaced faith makes the Asian decline similar in its origins and its unfolding to the European currency crisis of 1992 and 1993, when sudden surprising declines in the British pound, the Italian lira and other currencies ended a long period of stability there.
In Southeast Asia, the frame of mind that led investors to rely on the stability of currencies was shaped by the prevalence of "pegs" -- direct and indirect -- that local governments put in place to tie, or effectively fix, their currencies to the movements of the dollar. So certain were many investors of that stability that they refused to pay the cost of insurance, through hedging, against a currency fall.
"You had banks and financial institutions that believed so much in the peg because they made money on the peg," said Ang Thiam Huat, the group treasury manager at Natsteel Ltd. in Singapore. "So over time, it is deemed to be riskless," he explained, adding. "Peer-group pressure in the financial community is so strong that if you said it was risky, people would look on you as an outcast."
A currency trader based in Singapore for a major American investment bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "Nobody is going to admit that they did not hedge well. We have people who are still lying about their exposure."
Dell Computer, which is based in Austin, Tex., was in the same position as hundreds of local companies in Asia, taking advantage of currency stability but without insurance against a fall.
"We didn't implement the hedge in many countries because of the peg and the low volatility," said Mark Stevens, the controller of Dell's Asia Pacific Group. Slightly more than 6 percent of Dell's annual revenue of $11 billion comes from Asia.
Not until June, when the Thai baht had been under strong pressure for a month, did Dell begin to hedge against a decline in the currency. Mr. Stevens first bought insurance in the form of options, which for a fee gave Dell the right, but not the obligation, to turn baht into dollars at a set rate. Before long, however, it did actual trades that would convert the next several quarters of baht revenue into dollars at set rates.
Dell made a similar move in Malaysia in July, Mr. Stevens said, because the negative economic news there made the company feel that the currency, the ringgit, could not resist the pressure to fall.
But the problems in Southeast Asia did not make companies rush immediately to hedge their currency exposures elsewhere. Dell, for example, did not hedge in South Korea until October, in part, Mr. Stevens said, because of the high cost -- about 10 percent of the amount being hedged. In Hong Kong, Dell hedged on Oct. 23, the day the stock market there fell 10.4 percent. Dell had waited because the Hong Kong dollar's tie to the American dollar was the most secure.
As the turmoil worsened, Mr. Stevens said, Dell increasingly relied on hedges. Its coverage in the region is now nearly 100 percent for the next several quarters.
At the T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund, which has holdings throughout the region, withdrawals by individuals began to mount in the summer after the sharp decline in local stock markets. At the end of June, the fund had $1.9 billion under management. But between July 2 -- when the baht was devalued -- and the end of November, withdrawals exceeded new deposits by more than half a billion dollars, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund performance. That outflow, together with the sharp fall in the stocks in its portfolio, left the fund with just $844 million.
Chip Wendler, a vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming, which manages T. Rowe Price international funds, said his funds did not have to do too much selling at the market low points. But he acknowledged what he called the "marginal" impact that the selling of local securities and the conversion back into dollars had on Asian markets when the entire mutual fund industry is taken into account. Still, he argued, such transactions alone "would never have cracked the currency."
Certainly, the speculators played a role, too. "I am sure that there were specs shorting the rupiah in Indonesia," said a top analyst at a major hedge fund, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "They saw what the corporates were doing and joined in."
To short a currency, an investor borrows an amount in local money and converts it to a stronger currency, betting that the local currency will decline in value, and thus can be bought back at a lower price when it comes time to pay off the loan. The investor profits on the difference between the two prices.
But, said Jeffrey Lim, director of structured products at the American Express Bank in Singapore, "The speculators would never have been as successful as they have been unless everyone jumped on the bandwagon."
That view -- of the speculator as just one of the players on the field -- was echoed by Mr. Camdessus in his Dec. 2 speech in Malaysia.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult," he said, "to distinguish between the activities of hedge funds and other institutional investors."
The I.M.F. report on the European currency crisis of the early 1990's summed up that situation in a strikingly similar way.
"The difference between hedging and speculation becomes blurred when most market participants become convinced -- rightly or wrongly -- that a nontrivial change in exchange rates is coming, and that the change is likely to be in one direction," it said. "In that circumstance, everyone gets into the act."

When Thailand devalued the baht in early July, much of the region was quickly engulfed in a currency crisis and economic distress. Chart tracks the Thailand baht, Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah, South Korean won, and Hong Hong dollar to the U.S. dollar, since May. Scales have been inverted to show falling values.
 
THAILAND
The fall that started it all. Too many loans and an overbuilt real estate market caught up with the economy. The International Monetary Fund stepped in with a $17 billion bailout.
 
MALAYSIA
Malaysia has avoided a bailout, but it has halted big public works and the economy has slumped. The Prime Minister blames currency speculators for the problems.
 
INDONESIA
As part of a $15 billion bailout, President Suharto has agreed to clean up corruption, including ending projects that were enriching members of his family.
 
SOUTH KOREA
South Korea will receive the largest bailout in history, now estimated at $57 billion. But it must clean up its accounting practices and end support for insolvent banks.
 
HONG KONG
It's still standing. The Government fought off currency speculators, but at a price. The stock market lost a third of its value and Hong Kong's exports now look very expensive.

U.S. Is Split On Prosecutor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY 

 BODY:
The American public is sharply divided over whether an independent counsel should be appointed to investigate 1996 Democratic fund-raising activities, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Forty-six percent of 1,016 adults interviewed on Saturday through Monday said an independent counsel should be appointed, while a statistically indistinguishable 49 percent said the investigations being conducted by Congress and the Department of Justice were enough. 
 The nationwide telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
There is a strong strain of partisanship in the public's feelings on this issue. Two-thirds of Republicans in the poll favor an independent counsel, while two-thirds of Democrats say the current investigations are sufficient.
Americans are also evenly divided on whether President Clinton did anything wrong in his 1996 fund-raising. Forty percent said Mr. Clinton did nothing wrong, while another 40 percent disagreed. Those who perceived wrongdoing were asked whether they thought Mr. Clinton's activities were either unethical or illegal. Twenty-one percent said the activities were illegal, while 19 percent said they were unethical.
In the six times this question has been asked since March in polls by The Times and CBS News, this was the first time that the perception of some type of wrongdoing by Mr. Clinton has reached as high as 40 percent.
But the divisions in opinion have not diminished the President's job approval rating. Fifty-nine percent of Americans approve of the way Mr. Clinton is handling his overall job as President. It has remained near this level throughout the past year.
One reason for his approval rating is that 80 percent of the public currently pronounce the national economy as good. That is the most positive rating the economy has received in the 11 years this question has been regularly asked in Times/CBS News polls.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
Hoops Hall and High Hopes

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Temple University performed live at the Apollo tonight, opening a new basketball arena in an ambitious attempt to use the drawing power of entertainment as a force for urban renewal.
Leaving the cramped, 3,900-seat McGonigle Hall for the 11,000-seat Apollo facility complete with obligatory luxury suites, giant scoreboard and throbbing sound system, Temple officials aspired to much more than winning tonight's inaugural game over Fresno State, 76-61, and its coach, Jerry Tarkanian. 
 It is the university's aim to use the on-campus arena to anchor and help revitalize a frayed North Philadelphia neighborhood that was devastated by riots in 1964 and left desolate. The arena will draw such basketball powers as Duke and Indiana, but the goal is for the Apollo, with its sporting events, concerts and other cultural events, to also attract new residents, diners and shoppers to the blighted residential and commercial district surrounding Temple.
The project "is not only about hoops, it is about hopes," said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who attended an afternoon ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Construction of the arena, known officially as the Forum at the Apollo, did not come without a bare-knuckled fight between Temple and the city. And no one in the neighborhood believes that one project can solve all the problems of vacant buildings, unemployment, drugs and crime.
But the arena, along with planned retail and entertainment endeavors, represents a tangible investment in an area that has heard mostly talk for decades. Until recently, the words were as vacant as many of the surrounding buildings.
"This is a sign of believability, that money can come back to the community and that the complex can be used to the advantage of people who live here," said Floyd Alston, president of the Philadelphia Board of Education and a community developer.
The Apollo of Temple is a complex of buildings consisting of the basketball arena, a theater that can seat up to 2,500, a student recreation center, an entertainment and community education center, a 1,200-car parking garage and a hall that includes the athletic department as well as restaurants and retail businesses.
"It is a world-class facility for a world-class university," said Temple's president, Peter Liacouras. Its most famous alum, Bill Cosby, said on Monday that the Apollo would allow Temple to "come out of the closet" by showcasing itself as a university committed both to the neighborhood and a global reach.
The $107 million complex was financed partly with $37.5 million from the state and about $40 million in private donations. Tonight, the Forum opened with fireworks; a laser show, and the dedication of the center-jump circle to John Chaney, who has coached the Owls since 1982, and to Harry Litwack, who coached the team for two decades beginning with the 1952-53 season.
A group of Chaney's former players saluted their collegiate coach by renting a luxury suite at the Broad Street arena for him for five years at a cost of $150,000.
"I feel very small tonight," Chaney said before the game. "This project means everything to the people in the community. I've never known a university that has been as committed to a community as Temple -- a children's hospital, a law school, med school, dental school. They have stayed the course while others have opted for white flight. If it weren't for Temple, there may be nothing but a hole in the wall on Broad Street."
The Apollo project was nearly derailed in 1995 because of a bitter fight between Temple and the city over control of $5 million that the university committed to building and rehabilitating 500 homes in the neighborhood. Chaney accused John Street, president of the Philadelphia City Council, of blackmail in holding up the project.
The matter was settled when Temple agreed to funnel the money to a city housing agency, where it would be disbursed by 20 community groups. Unraveled relationships have since been mended to the point that Street attended tonight's grand opening game, along with Mayor Ed Rendell. Street was booed, but he and Chaney hugged at midcourt.
"We were never opposed to building the Apollo," Street said in an interview. "But we said to Temple, 'You can't build a $90 million arena across from one of the most blighted areas of the city and not make arrangements for the neighborhood.' We believe things will work out for everybody."
Once a thriving center for commerce and jazz in the 1930's, 40's and 50's, the neighborhood is seeking a renaissance with a home ownership project, a restaurant row, a jazz center, clothing stores, a sporting goods store and a radio station. There are also plans for a movie theater and perhaps a hotel. All anchored by Temple's Apollo.
"I don't expect the Apollo will be a panacea for all our problems; that would be a stretch," said Alf Muronda, executive director of the area's Cecil B. Moore Avenue Community Development Corporation. "But we believe it will be a momentous dynamo. You hear some people say it's not going to work. And if Temple doesn't promote the area and help maintain security, we will both fail. We are joined at the hip. We believe the neighborhood is coming back; it just takes investment. Is the Apollo enough? Not by a long shot, but it's a good start."

HEADLINE: Accord on Shoring Up Landmark Law

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Seeking to better preserve the thousands of historic buildings scattered across the city, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council leadership agreed on legislation yesterday that would bolster the city's landmarks law by adding penalties that are easier to enforce.
Under a bill that the Council's Land Use Committee approved unanimously yesterday, store owners who have covered up historic facades with garish business signs, or apartment dwellers who have replaced prewar windows with unseemly modern ones, would face civil fines that range from $500 to $5,000. 
 Preservationists have complained for years that the city's 30-year-old landmarks law was practically useless because it comprised only criminal penalties that have been virtually unenforced. Given the many more serious crimes they must contend with, police officers and prosecutors have been loath to pursue such crimes as a chiseled cornice or a jackhammered sidewalk.
The creation of civil fines would allow the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to issue a summons that would be referred to an administrative tribunal, which would be much more likely to issue a fine than a criminal court would.
City officials also said that the bill would help reduce the backlog of outstanding landmarks violations from its current high of more than 4,000. The landmarks law covers about 20,000 buildings within 70 different historic districts.
The bill, which was introduced at the request of Mayor Giuliani, is expected to be approved by the full Council at its meeting next week.
City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher compared the criminal fines of the landmarks law to the death penalty in a complicated trial. "If your only remedy is the death penalty, the jury won't convict, but if a lesser penalty is an option the jury will probably apply it," he said. "The civil fines are a way to get the attention of property owners who would otherwise just ignore the law."
Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said she believed the civil fines would be an extremely useful tool in deterring and correcting violations. "This legislation sends a message that we're serious about compliance," she said. "We're here to work with you, but you can't just paint a historic building bright pink or put up flashing lights in the middle of Brooklyn Heights."
She noted that the fact that the administration had worked closely with Council members to draft the legislation "sends a message of how important our historic districts are to our quality of life and to the economic well-being of the city."
In addition to the civil fines, the bill would increase the highest criminal fine from $1,000 to $10,000, but Ms. Raab said the criminal fines would probably remain infrequently enforced.
The bill would also make a building owner who demolished a landmark structure, or who altered more than 50 percent of two facades on a building, liable for the fair market value of the land.
Brendan Sexton, the president of the Municipal Art Society, called the bill long overdue. "The current situation is intolerable," he said, noting that the 4,000 outstanding violations in a pool of just 20,000 buildings would be unheard of under any other city law.
"With this bill, there's a chance at least that property owners will now treat their responsibilities under the landmarks law as seriously as they do the building code," Mr. Sexton said. "It may take a while for the message to get out, but people will eventually see that it's no longer cheaper to violate the law than to comply with it."
Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, another strong advocate for the bill, stressed that it included grace periods for compliance and was not intended to be punitive.
Before the Landmarks Preservation Commission even issued a violation under the bill, a building owner or a commercial tenant would be notified in writing that a renovation violated the landmarks law or that the owner or tenant was making a change without a proper permit. The owner or tenant would then be given a grace period to either alter the renovation or apply for the permit before a citation was issued.
There would also be the possibility of correcting the problem after a violation was actually issued. If an owner or tenant could prove that he had taken steps to cure the problem, the fine would be waived and the violation would be dropped.
"The whole point of the bill is to just get violations fixed," Ms. Breen said.
"If you live in a historic district and you're doing the right thing, it's pretty frustrating to see someone do an illegal addition or change something without a permit," she said. "This should help maintain the quality of life and property values for everyone."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
The Bank Of America

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
South Korea's call today for billions of dollars in direct financial help from the United States and Japan, and the immediate rejection by Washington, was the latest example of the brewing tensions between the United States and its ailing Asian allies over how to quell a financial crisis that refuses to be tamed.
Time and again, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has said that the United States would put American taxpayer dollars at risk only as part of a "second line of defense," backing up the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions. There will be no repeat of the Mexican bailout, Mr. Rubin has made clear, during which President Clinton made a risky end run around Congress, committing $12 billion in direct aid to America's southern neighbor. 
 But throughout Asia, and particularly in South Korea, Washington's insistence on setting tough conditions for financial changes and its refusal to put much of its own money at risk is breeding hostility. Now, with its currency in free fall and despite a huge bailout package announced last week, South Korea is seeking an unequivocal show of resolve from the world's biggest superpower -- the financial equivalent of the 45,000 American troops that have kept North Korea contained for 45 years.
Mr. Rubin has plenty of reasons for hesitating to give that unconditional support. Ever since 1995, when Washington provided the first relief in the Mexican bailout, Mr. Rubin has feared that the United States is on the verge of becoming the world's lender of last resort, the financial superpower every country would turn to in time of extraordinary distress. He has spent three years shifting that role to the I.M.F., the World Bank and other institutions -- and insisting that countries agree to sharp fiscal discipline before receiving the lifeline.
In Korea, though, that approach may be about to face its first critical test. Talks began this week in Geneva over a peace treaty that would finally end the Korean War, and the United States has a lot riding on a stable and prosperous South Korea. If the country's financial health continues to deteriorate, the diplomatic pressure on Washington to step in could become excruciating.
Moreover, the economic cost could be enormous if the I.M.F. fails to rescue Korea. "We have regarded Korea as a firewall that could not be breached," one Administration official involved in the internal debate over what to do next said several days ago. "It is not at all clear that we can just say to the Koreans, 'Hey, we've done what we can. The rest is up to you.' "
The problem is not just Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy. Other dominoes are teetering. Russia is rumored to be quietly exploring whether it will need a bailout, though it insists it can survive on its own -- exactly what South Korea said until three weeks ago, when it began to acknowledge the depth of its troubles. Japan, American officials say, refuses to face up to the pain it will endure to pull out of a seven-year downturn that threatens to worsen. And the markets are clearly spooked about Indonesia, whose currency hit a record low today after the Government said that President Suharto, who is 76 and has a history of heart trouble, would be taking a 10-day vacation to restore his health. The last change of power in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous nations, led to a half-million deaths.
In public, officials trying to calm the markets are putting the most optimistic spin on events that they can, suggesting that the run of bankruptcies and bailouts is gradually slowing down. The No. 2 official of the I.M.F., Stanley Fischer, said today that there could be "a few more hiccups" but that "the worst is over." In private, however, few are that sanguine.
One reason that South Korea's financial nightmare will not end is that the country is finally abiding by the I.M.F.'s requirement that it disclose financial data that until now have been guarded as a state secret. The result is a regular trickle of more bad news. On Monday, for example, Seoul acknowledged that its short-term debt exceeded $100 billion, nearly double the figure it gave the I.M.F. a few weeks ago when negotiations for the bailout began. That helps explain why the Korean currency, the won, lost 20 percent of its value in the last two days.
The South Koreans say that they were not dissembling last month but were simply using a different accounting method, one that excluded $51 billion in debts held by overseas subsidiaries of Korean companies.
Nor was South Korea aided by its belated acknowledgment today that its foreign reserves fell to $6 billion last week, meaning that without the I.M.F.'s aid the country was within days of bankruptcy. Even with these revelations, the markets still believe that South Korean officials have not disclosed the true depth of their problems -- and so for now investors are steering clear of the country the way many New Yorkers drive blocks out of their way to avoid a bad neighborhood.
That, in turn, is adding to Korea's pain. If Japanese and American banks refuse to roll over the debts of Korean companies, Seoul must choose between letting the bankruptcies climb or shoring up its companies by providing them with dollars to pay their foreign debts. With the won continuing to plummet tonight, the cost of obtaining those dollars is rising every day. "These cycles feed on themselves," Clyde Prestowitz, the head of the Economic Strategy Institute here, said on Monday after returning from a long trip through Asia. "No one knows how long it will take before the private money begins coming back in."
In Mexico's case, it took more than a month and a half -- a period that Mr. Rubin once described as the most agonizing of his three years as Treasury Secretary. For a while, it seemed as if the Mexican bailout would fail; private investors simply could not be persuaded to put their money at risk, no matter how high the interest rates. Only when they became convinced that Mexico was serious about its austerity measures did the money begin to flow.
That could happen in Korea. But it might not. A presidential election there is only 10 days away, and already unions have threatened strikes if the Government complies with the I.M.F.'s conditions -- which many in South Korea view, accurately, as American conditions.
So for now Seoul and Washington are locked in something of a standoff, each waiting for the other to blink. South Korea's Finance Minister, Lim Chang Yuel, wants cash first and reforms later. Mr. Rubin insists that the order must be reversed. The question is whether he can stick with that position if one of America's biggest military allies in Asia once again finds itself on the verge of financial meltdown.

HEADLINE: Art(?) to Go: Museum Shops Broaden Wares, at a Profit

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Rodin had pasta first. Now Warhol has pasta, too. Monet has Provencal soup, olive oil and absinthe. Rauschenberg has no food, but he has dinner plates.
The topic is not lunch, but what's for sale in museum stores. American museums have been hawking merchandise for more than 125 years, ever since the Metropolitan Museum of Art began selling etchings in 1871. But increasingly, objects you'd never expect to find in the nation's cultural cathedrals are being sold right alongside the art books and note cards and reproduction sculptures. 
 The trend horrifies art purists even as it delights consumers in search of a different gift this holiday season or a little bit of culture to take home. So what if the connection is tenuous? Museum stores bring in as much as a quarter of the money museums earn, outstripping admissions, membership and other revenue-producing activities.
The store at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where "The Warhol Look/Glamour Style Fashion" is on view, sells Campbell Tomato Soup watches, Campbell Soup cans stuffed with crayons and pasta shaped like lips from Warhol's 1950's ink drawing, "Lips." Merchandise for the Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Monet and the Mediterranean" exhibition includes soup mixes and bottles of olive oil that have no link with the art or the artist, save their association with the Mediterranean, too.
And visitors to the "Best Dressed: 250 Years of Style" exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art will find red tomato-flavored pasta in the shape of boots and bustiers in the museum store, not far from the green spinach-flavored pasta that looks like Rodin's "Thinker," leftovers from the "Rodin and Michelangelo" exhibition last spring.
Those six-ounce pasta packages, labeled "Food to Think About," are causing even more stir in the art world because they were dreamed up by the trend-setting Philadelphia museum, which created several hotly debated items for its 1996 Cezanne retrospective, most notably, bright yellow baseballs emblazoned with Cezanne's signature. Never mind that no one knows whether Cezanne ever heard of the great American pastime. The museum sold 8,750 balls for $9.50 each.
Baseballs, pasta and who knows what else are now turning up in other museums.
"The reason we make these products is so that we relate to everyone," said Stuart D. Gerstein, the Philadelphia museum's director of wholesale and retail operations.
Perhaps. But the bigger reason for this unabashed commercialism is simple economics.
At a time when money from government sources is declining and the largesse of corporations, foundations and private donors comes with many strings attached, art museums are looking for new ways to pay for mundane expenses like electricity and security. Some are increasing general admission fees or imposing fees for special exhibitions. Others are organizing exhibitions from their permanent collections to lend to smaller institutions and charging them for the privilege.
And just about every museum is looking to squeeze more money from the store. Even the wealthiest, the Getty Museum: when the doors of its new $1 billion complex in Los Angeles are thrown open to the public on Dec. 16 the main store will occupy 1,700 square feet, five times the space occupied by the old museum store in Malibu, and there will be three satellite shops elsewhere in the building. The museum expects sales to reach $5 million in the first year and $1 million in profits.
Unlike general retailers, museum stores enjoy their profits tax-free as long as their products are somehow related to the museum -- an edge that rankled with other retailers a few years ago. Now, "most stores have accepted it and gone onto something else," said Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a consultant in New York. Even rival businesses like the Museum Store, the big chain that sells museum-related goods in shopping malls, are not grumbling, partly because they buy or license many of their products from the museums.
Around the country, museum stores are undergoing a metamorphosis. Many have started spicing up their merchandise mix, sometimes hiring managers from the retailing industry to do it. They have shed their old ideas of what is appropriate, to the dismay of some art lovers.
"I'm in favor of museum shops; I'm in favor of the appropriate use of reproductions," said Nicholas Fox Weber, a cultural historian. "But you don't take a great image and put it on a tote bag. It takes people away from the real issues of looking at art."
Mr. Weber declined to muster a reaction to the very idea of artistic macaroni. But the critic Deborah Solomon did. Before actually reviewing the Rodin exhibition for The Wall Street Journal last April, she chastised the museum for going too far with "Thinker" pasta.
Yet given the financial environment museum stores are unlikely to be stopped by carping. Membership surveys taken by the Association of Art Museum Directors and the American Association of Museums show that profits from museum stores contribute 18 to 26 percent of a museum's earned income, topping all other sources.
At the Metropolitan Museum, one in five visitors leaves with a bag in hand. Total revenues from its 39 stores in the United States and overseas in the fiscal year through June 39 came to $87.4 million, up slightly from five years ago.
And though most museums will not disclose store profits, Mr. Lagnado said, "these stores do well." A new survey, taken by the Museum Store Association, found that the average gross profit margin is 48 percent, some 10 points above that of respected department stores.
There's little wonder, then, that since 1992, while gallery space at 185 of the nation's largest museums increased by 3.3 percent, the space devoted to museum stores jumped 28.7 percent. Retailing managers have more room to offer more goods and to be creative about them.
"What's happening is that more and more museum administrators are paying attention to the gift shop," said Rena Zurofsky, a veteran of store management at four art museums, including the Metropolitan and the Brooklyn Museum. "And what retailing managers are hearing from them is not just a question of revenues or profits. It's 'Why don't I see in our shop what they have in that shop?' " Ms. Zurofsky is now chief of retailing at the American Museum of Natural History.
At the same time, administrators now know that some people come to museums specifically to shop, and then maybe hit the galleries. The Museum Store Association survey shows that 97 percent of art museum stores are outside the admission barriers. "Twenty years ago, we were loathed as much as we were loved," Ms. Zurofsky said. "Now we're welcomed not only because of the money we bring in, but also because we draw people in."
Museums have also learned that shoppers can help spread the art gospel simply by carrying bags decorated with a logo. That is why more and more museums are offering products with their brand name. T-shirts and tote bags printed with museum logos, already common, have been joined by baseball caps that allow people to broadcast their cultural loyalties just as they do their favorite teams.
 
Using Playthings As Links to Art
The Philadelphia Museum of Art put its own name as well as Cezanne's on each baseball, and its "Thinker" pasta included shapes of the museum's classical facade as well as Rodin's sculpture. The new Getty store will offer rubber toys modeled on the tram that delivers people to its doors and chunks of travertine marble, a material used throughout the six-building complex, labeled "The Getty Center" ($4.95 to $6.95, depending on size).
In a twist on the brand-name strategy, the Metropolitan recently expanded the role of its unofficial mascot, William, a faience hippopotamus well known to fans of the Egyptian galleries. He has already appeared in the museum store as a print, a ceramic sculpture, a T-shirt and a tie. Now he is a stuffed toy ($13.95) and a Christmas ornament, and is featured on a new T-shirt and tie. William may never rival Mickey Mouse in reach, but the intent to capitalize on a friendly, familiar image is unmistakable.
This search for the new is spreading fast. Come February, the Cleveland Museum of Art will be peddling angel-shaped pasta for its "Vatican Treasures: Early Christian, Renaissance and Baroque Art From the Papal Collections" exhibition. For its current show, "When Silk Was Gold," an exhibition of ancient Asian textiles, the Cleveland museum is selling silk robes ($150).
Elsewhere, museumgoers can find stuffed animals, needlepoint kits, rugs, refrigerator magnets, cookbooks, umbrellas, soaps, furniture, playing cards, kites, candles, clothing, razors in the shape of frogs and mermaids and, of course, loads of jewelry. Computer mouse pads and screen savers are popular.
Smart museums have found that they can spread their business more evenly through the year, instead of relying on the boost they get during December gift-buying, by offering merchandise keyed to special exhibitions. At the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the ubiquitous museum mug has been finessed by the Robert Rauschenberg dinner plate. The Whitney Museum sells bongo drums -- salt and pepper shakers, really ($30) -- made for its 1996 "Beat Culture" exhibition. And Museo del Barrio offers a baseball cap promoting its current "Taino" pre-Colombian art exhibition.
But even among items that have become old hat, like scarves and neckties, the number of selections is growing, with motifs from Klimt, Mondrian, Ingres, to name a few, or the image of an entire painting.
The Philadelphia museum even sells temporary tattoos of artworks ($2) from its collection. "Our idea is that people are walking around with art on their bodies that is not good, and we're giving them good art to wear," said Mr. Gerstein, citing tattoos of van Gogh's "Sunflowers" as an example.
Not every institution is succumbing to the trend. About 80 percent of the merchandise available at the Museum of African Art in Manhattan is authentic craft work from Africa. And the Museum of Modern Art, which plans to double its store space to 24,000 square feet when the museum is expanded in a few years, intends to stick with its strategy of offering distinctive, upscale objects.
"We will not put rubber-stamp images on every product we can get our hands on," said James D. Gundell, the new president of MOMA Retail, who was brought in this year from Bloomingdale's. Instead, he wants to tap artists to develop objects especially for the Modern.
 
M.V.P.: Renoir Or van Gogh
But only a few museums seem to have the luxury of peddling class, not mass. Mr. Gerstein, from the Philadelphia museum, defends the choice. "Our audience is changing, and we are looking for new ways to educate the public and promote the building and promote the collection," he said. In fact, he is so happy with the Cezanne baseball sales that he has a new one, an "Artists All-Star" baseball with 15 signatures by the likes of Renoir, Homer and van Gogh.
He defends the pasta equally adamantly. "You can make 'Thinker' pasta, put it in a bowl and tell your kids about Rodin and 'The Thinker,' " he argued. And he parries questions about good taste with humor: "The pasta tastes good."
More seriously, he added: "I don't look at things as being not tasteful. I look at it as a matter of quality." He said that Philadelphia was also producing items that should appeal to more sophisticated tastes, like a series of CD's with musical selections that artists might have listened to. Among them are "Music, Russia and Kandinsky," with folk songs, cafe music and orchestral music from 1914 to 1921, and "Music, Portraits and Picasso," with ballet, jazz and Catalonian folk music as well as classical French pieces.
That does not appease Mr. Weber, the cultural historian, who wishes that more museum stores offered local handicrafts and honest reproductions. "I think you want something that will perpetuate the exhibition so that you can take it home with you and be reminded of it on a Sunday morning sometime," he said. He regrets his own decision, as director of the Albers Foundation, to allow the Guggenheim to use an Albers painting on a tie a few years ago.
At the Metropolitan, John Curran, the vice president for merchandising activities, is taking neither side. The Met, he said, will never do baseballs or pasta, though it has baseball caps ($18). But, he added, some museums have little choice.
"How should museums stay open: should we raise taxes or raise admissions?" he said. "The most democratic thing to do is to let museums help themselves. No one is twisting anyone's arm to buy these things, and taste is a very subjective thing."

Byzantine Alliance

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Two meetings are taking place this week that will affect the power balances of tomorrow's Middle East.
Most eyes are on Teheran's Islamic conference, where leaders of 55 mostly Muslim nations listen impassively to a radical Ayatollah -- whose internal theological authority they know is crumbling -- rail at the "poisonous breath" of the United States and Israel. 
 Less observed abroad, but far more significant, is Turkey's answer to fundamentalists and dictators: the first official visit to Turkey of an Israeli Defense Minister, accompanied by a large delegation of military officials, technicians and business executives.
Turkey is a secular Muslim country. As its neighbors that are Arabs -- led by Iraq, Syria and Egypt -- passed a resolution in Teheran denouncing the Turks for their growing ties to Israel, the Defense Minister of Turkey coolly replied, "We respect the Islamic conference, we belong to it, but we cannot allow it to dictate our relations."
The man who has done most in the past eight years to bring about this tectonic shift is the former Israeli Air Force general David Ivri. Reached by telephone in Ankara yesterday, the nonpolitical General Ivri told me that "despite the passionate statements from other countries, this strategic tie is stabilizing. It's not directed against anybody."
Except aggressors.
Turkey needs some new friends in the world. It sees Syria playing host in Damascus to the P.K.K. Kurds trying to break off a large piece of Turkey. It sees Iraq and Iran developing fearsome new weapons and the missiles to deliver them. It sees Germany and Greece selfishly blocking its entry into European integration, and its importance to NATO diminished with the temporary reduction of the Russian threat.
What can Turkey get from its new bonds with Israel? It has already contracted for a $630 million modernization of its air force: 54 of its outdated fighters will be equipped with the latest avionics and radar systems, and a new deal is in the works for 48 more. That doesn't turn them into F-15's, but will enable them to knock down what nasty neighbors might send aloft.
Also, Israelis know how to build advanced tanks; talks are under way on a joint design for production in Turkey. Ground-to-air missiles are on the shopping list. Because the U.S.-Israeli military tie is not subject to political vicissitudes, Turkey will look to Israel to get American permission to sell Arrow anti-missile missiles (a joint U.S.-Israel defensive weapon coming on line in 1999), and to urge the U.S. to help Ankara.
Israel's interest in the Byzantine bond goes beyond a chunk of future billions in military spending. Its airmen can now train in airspace that offers a land profile of battle sorties. Mit-Mossad intelligence cooperation is a prospect. And a nation of six million is more willing to take risks for peace with a nearby nation of 60 million as a strategic partner.
The Israelis will leave it to the Americans to remind Ankara, cracking down on Kurdish separatists and closing up the religious party, about the value of human rights.
The Turks know the U.S. will do that, too, despite our need for Turkish bases to maintain our no-fly zone over northern Iraq. Before Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz visits the White House next week, I expect him to throw the outspoken Kurdish dissident Leyla Zana out of prison, though that member of Parliament prefers to remain locked up for dramatic impact.
As General Ivri foresaw, the geopologic of Turkish-Israeli military, economic and technological ties (it's impolitic to call the new relationship an alliance) is greater than Islamic solidarity or European clubbiness. Common threats create mutual interests, and growing trust develops comrades in more than arms.
In ancient times, the Jews and Greeks lost to the Romans, who were swallowed up into the Byzantine Empire, which was broken up by the Turks, Persians, Russians, Arabs and Venetians.
In modern times, the Turks and Jews are protecting themselves against the Persians of Iran and Arabs of Iraq and Syria, who are supported by the Russians, Greeks, and Goths and Romans of Europe. The Venetians seem to be out of it, as are the Americans.

HEADLINE: Kyoto Meeting Moves Closer to an Agreement to Cut Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Wednesday, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Negotiators from more than 150 countries moved closer today to an agreement requiring reductions in the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrial countries, but a firm deal continued to elude them.
With a deadline looming later today, the discussions focused on a proposal put forth by Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the talks, that would cut average emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases during the period 2005 through 2010 by 5-percent below the level of emissions in 1990. 
 In meeting the overall target, different countries and groups of countries would be assigned different targets according to their economic profiles. Thus, while the United States would cut its emissions by 5 percent and Japan by 4.5 percent, for instance, emissions of the European Union would be reduced 8 percent. But all would fall within a narrow band ranging from that 8 percent reduction to increases of 5 percent permitted in Australia and Norway.
"The trend is a very positive one," Mr. Estrada said after the talks recessed at 2:30 A.M.
At issue are emissions of six greenhouse gases. The most important is carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The others are methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride, but various proposals on reductions would leave decisions on some gases for another conference.
All trap heat in the atmosphere, and some scientific advisers at the talks say the gases will raise the average global temperature by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions are not reduced.
By comparison, the world has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last Ice Age, and these scientists say the predicted warming would cause widespread climatic and environmental disruption.
On the sticky question of how developing countries can be brought more closely into the effort to control emissions, the proposal suggested setting up a special fund to serve as a conduit for the transfer of money and technology from rich countries to poor ones, so that the latter can adopt appropriate technologies.
The United States "welcomes" this concept, said Stuart Eizenstat, the chief American negotiator, who called it "exactly the kind of bridge both worlds should hope for."
Mr. Estrada's proposal also provides for developing countries to submit to binding controls on emissions at any time, at their option; some countries, including Chile, have expressed interest in this.
The developing countries have been insisting that they will not accept any further commitments under the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change, beyond general ones already binding them to take measures to cut emissions, until the rich countries submit to binding reductions.
But Dr. Mark Mwandosya, chairman of the developing-country caucus in the talks, said on Tuesday that "we will not be a stumbling block" to Mr. Estrada's efforts to forge a deal.
The United States signaled that it was moving in the direction of Mr. Estrada's plan on at least one key element, that of the emissions-reduction target. Mr. Eizenstat said the United States had proposed going below 1990 levels. Earlier reports from the European camp that the proposal involved a cut of 2 percent were "understated," he said.
Mr. Eisenstat said the revised American target was contingent on the acceptance of a package that includes the "trading" of emissions among countries and regions, and the Estrada proposal includes this feature. In emissions trading, a country or industrial company would be able to meet its target by cutting emissions itself, by buying reductions from a country or company that achieved excess cuts, or by both approaches.
Proponents of the approach argue that it provides an incentive for companies and countries that find it easier and cheaper to cut emissions to reduce them below the target and then sell the excess reductions, at a profit, to companies or countries that find it harder or more costly to reduce emissions on their own.
The Americans say this results in cheaper and more effective reductions, but the Europeans worry that countries might be able to buy their way out of their obligations.
The Americans proposed on Tuesday that the United States join with a group of countries including but not limited to Japan, Russia, Australia, New Zealand and Canada in an emissions-trading group.
This would potentially make it easier for the United States to achieve its commitments because Russia's economic troubles have reduced its emissions drastically. The European Union has long insisted that its 15 countries be allowed to band together to achieve a common target.
The Estrada plan would allow countries to meet part of their obligation by counting natural features, mainly forests, that absorb carbon dioxide. The Americans favor this, but the Europeas are skeptical.

Worried South Korea Seeks Expedited Relief
Alarmed that the international rescue package for its economy had failed to restore investor confidence, South Korea said it wanted quick access to cash originally pledged as a last resort from the United States and Japan.
The request from Lim Chang Yuel, Finance and Economy Minister, left, suggested that the depths of South Korea's financial crisis have yet to be seen. But Clinton Administration officials said they had received no formal request and that any early transfer of American funds would be rejected. Page A1. 

South Korea's call for billions of dollars in direct financial help from the United States and Japan, and its immediate rejection by Washington, reflect the brewing tensions between the United States and its ailing Asian allies over how to quell a financial crisis that refuses to be tamed. News Analysis. A1.
 
Stocks Weaken on Asia Fears
Growing worries about Asia's economic woes pushed down the stock market, led by drops in companies heavily dependent on the region. The most notable loser was the stock of Oracle Corporation, which dropped 29 percent in record Nasdaq volume of 172.5 million shares and was an important reason why the Nasdaq composite index fell 30.99 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,620.55. The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the second straight day, down 61.18 points, to 8,049.66. D12.
 
Despite the turmoil in Asia, United States manufacturers expect stronger revenues, increased employment and stable prices in 1998, the National Association of Purchasing Management said in a year-end outlook. D4.
 
Philip Morris to Overhaul Unit
Philip Morris announced a makeover of its languishing international food business, which is concentrated in Europe, and will take a $630 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings. The company will shed 2,500 jobs and close some factories. D6.
 
Hasbro to Cut Jobs and Close Plants
Hasbro unveiled a global restructuring program that includes plant closings and a reduction of 2,500 jobs, or 20 percent of its work force, to enhance shareholder value. The company, the No. 2 toy maker, after Mattel, will take a one-time pretax charge of $140 million. D19.
 
Gold Hits 18-Year Low
Gold dropped to $282.75 an ounce, the lowest since 1979 and the latest in a series of price declines this year. The loss of gold's value reflects the power of the world's central banks, which are selling, or threatening to sell, their hoards of gold and lending it cheaply to producers and speculators. D19.
 
Swiss Bankers Outline Goals
The two executives who will run the United Bank of Switzerland, the world's second-largest bank, set a profit goal of $8 billion by 2002 and said the merger enabled them to win Swiss Government approval for cutting 7,000 jobs. D5.
 
Europe Wants Better Boeing Rival
Leaders of France, Germany and Britain called for an integrated European aerospace and military electronics industry capable of competing with Boeing and other American giants that dominate both the defense and civilian aviation markets. D5.
 
U.S. Surgical Buying Pfizer Division
U.S. Surgical said it would acquire Pfizer's Valleylab division, maker of electronic surgery and ultrasound products. The $425 million purchase strengthens U.S. Surgical's business in instruments for minimally invasive medical procedures. D4.
 
One That Got Away
Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur, has found success in the music business, in retailing and in airlines. Balloons, alas, are another story. His effort last year to lead the first nonstop round-the-world balloon flight ended in failure.

HEADLINE: Officials Unsure About Cost and Effect of New Transit Fares

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
The day after the announcement of the biggest change in fare policy in the history of New York City mass transit -- a system of monthly, weekly and daily passes good for unlimited travel -- officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority acknowledged many uncertainties yesterday about how the system would work.
Answers to even the most basic questions -- how much the pass system would cost the transportation authority to run, how many people would use the passes, and how many new buses and trains would be needed to accommodate an expected increase in ridership -- were inconclusive. 
 Although the authority has estimates for most of the problems, it conceded that they had to rely on old data and possibly outdated surveys.
The authority's current estimate of the cost of the pass program -- $236 million a year -- is at least 40 percent lower than one it made in April for a slightly less ambitious hypothetical program.
Estimates of the number of people who would buy the passes -- an increase of about 100 million rides a year, or about 6 percent, is anticipated -- are based on surveys conducted five years ago, when the authority was planning the present Metrocard system that New Yorkers have only grudgingly come to embrace.
And while officials said yesterday that the need for additional trains and buses would be "minimal to nothing" because ridership would increase most during off-peak hours, they acknowledged that the effect of new fares was notoriously hard to anticipate, especially ones intended to cause what an official called "real behavioral changes."
A much less radical change in policy -- the free bus-to-subway transfers introduced in July -- was so unexpectedly popular that the authority had to add 200 buses, a number that transit advocates said has not been enough to relieve overcrowding.
Asked why the transportation authority had not updated the surveys, Marc V. Shaw, the executive director, said, "Surveys are very expensive to do, and unless you have reason to believe that there's been big demographic changes, which we don't, why do a new one?"
Even transit advocates who have praised the new passes said that the authority seemed, to a certain extent, to be flying by the seat of its pants.
"I think this thing is being driven more by the desire to offer discounts than by any sound fiscal planning," said Alan Foster, associate director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Council to the M.T.A., a watchdog group. "But that doesn't mean they won't be able to find a way to pay for it."
"They're making it up as they go along," said Gene Russianoff, the staff attorney for another advocacy group, the Straphangers Campaign, who may be the most vocal proponent of the monthly pass.
The $236 million estimated cost of the pass program, officials said, is the difference between the amount they expect riders to pay for passes and the amount of revenue the authority would have received if those riders had paid for their trips one at a time.
To cover the cost, the authority is counting on this year's surplus, which comes from increased ridership and dedicated tax revenues, becoming part of its permanent revenue stream -- even though the increase in tax revenue is a result of the city's booming economy (a fraction of sales and other taxes goes to the M.T.A.), which could cool off in future years.
To make up the $49 million difference between the surplus and the total expected cost of the pass program, the authority plans to cut its administrative costs. Officials would not say yesterday where they planned to make the cuts, but said that it would not be difficult to pare $49 million from a $3 billion budget.
Transit officials said that a certain amount of uncertainty was inherent in any planning, and that they felt confident the monthly passes would not encounter any problems that could not be handled in the long run.
"This plan is the result of real professional people doing this for a living, really trying to do what they think is best," Mr. Shaw said. "Forecasting is always based on assumptions, but you're trying to use your best estimations based on all the information you have.
"Given all that, and given that behavioral changes are incredibly hard to predict, we think this is going to lead to a better subway system and a better usage of the subway system in the City of New York," he said.
The pass program, which could be introduced by next summer, would offer riders unlimited travel for $63 a month, $17 a week or $4 a day.
It was announced on Monday by Gov. George E. Pataki after two months of mounting public pressure on the transportation authority to use its 1997 budget surplus, which officials said yesterday was expected to hit $185 million by year's end, to give riders a break. The transportation authority board, which is controlled by the Governor's appointees, is expected to approve the plan formally Dec. 18.
In an interview, Mr. Pataki described the plan as the result of a struggle between his staff members and transportation authority staff members who questioned whether the plan was too risky.
"There's no question that we had to push the bureaucrats at the M.T.A.," he said. "Too many bureaucrats view the transit rider as a captive of the system, rather than as a customer."
Yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani continued to call for a different pricing structure, urging that riders be given 12 rides for the price of 10.
"We will press it, see if we can get the M.T.A. board to agree with it," the Mayor said. "It looks like they're not going to agree with it right now. But all of these benefits go into effect in the middle of June or July, so we have a lot of time."
By the time the pass system put forward by Mr. Pataki is a year old, the transportation authority expects it to have transformed New Yorkers' travel habits.
Officials said yesterday that by 1999, they expected that 53 percent of all trips would be taken by people holding some form of pass -- 39 percent by monthly passholders, 7 percent by weekly passholders and 7 percent by daily passholders.
About 33 percent of all trips would be taken by Metrocard users who would buy in bulk and get a 10 percent bonus, and 9 percent would be taken by users of the standard Metrocard, officials predicted.
Tokens, which still account for nearly half of all trips, would be used only 5 percent of the time, officials said. Mr. Shaw said that the projections for pass use, based on 1992 telephone surveys, were conservative.
Even if the passes turn out to be so popular that the system is overwhelmed with riders, Mr. Russianoff said, worse things could happen.
"It's great to be in a situation where your biggest problem is that you have too many customers," he said. "The problem with the transit system for the last 50 years is that they keep having a dwindling number of riders, a dwindling amount of political support. It'll be a challenge for them, but it's a good challenge."

HEADLINE: On Madison, a Crumbling Wall Is Scrambling Lives

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
It was quiet once again yesterday on Madison Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets.
Quiet, because no customers were sliding their feet into the brown leather shoes at Johnston & Murphy. The store was closed. Quiet, because no one was petting the teddy bears at the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, which had also been shuttered. And quiet, because no one was flipping burgers at Burger Heaven. 
 While drivers and pedestrians in midtown Manhattan struggled to cope with the mess created by bricks raining down from 540 Madison Avenue, a 39-story office building, there was a much more personal element to the disruption. An actress who lived in a nearby building said she was in her nightgown on Sunday when she was evacuated, and has not been allowed to return to pick up additional clothing. A business owner said his plans to retire had been thrown into jeopardy. And merchants said they were losing business at a critical time.
"This is a disaster," said Peter J. Morrell, the chairman of Morrell & Company, a wine retailer at 535 Madison that he said was losing about $100,000 a day in sales. "This is like the Grinch who stole Christmas."
For many, the worst part of the situation was that no one knew when things would return to normal. While other Manhattan stores were enjoying the fruits of a booming economy and the surge in tourism, Sunday's accident was a painful reminder of how fate can interrupt at the most unexpected of times.
"It's a calamity," said the owner of a leather-goods store, Hides in Shape, who would identify himself only as V. Kurdian. He said that while his business, which is just north of the cordoned-off area, was still open, he had suffered a 90 percent drop in sales. "This is worse than mid-February, and that is our deadest month."
Usually, of course, December ranks as the height of the retail season. And for many of the businesses on Madison Avenue, the holiday season had started out promisingly: the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, for instance, on Saturday recorded its busiest business day since Valentine's Day.
But at 12:44 P.M. Sunday, a section of the south wall of 540 Madison came loose, showering debris on holiday shoppers and dropping graphite-colored bricks into a safety net. The net then sagged and collapsed into a work platform, sending more debris to the street. Two people were injured in the accident, neither of them seriously.
Yesterday, workers constructed a steel beam that was supposed to be wedged under the weak portion of the wall. But late yesterday, officials decided that the wedging method was not feasible. So a new tack was planned for dawn today: lowering workers down the side of the wall to insert wooden planks as a temporary shoring device.
As a result, city officials said that Madison Avenue would not be reopened today, and possibly not tomorrow, depending on how the work goes and the weather conditions.
Left closed to vehicular and pedestrian traffic was the part of the avenue between 53d and 55th Streets, while 54th Street was closed to traffic for about one block. All stores within that area were closed as well.
As of late yesterday, tenants who had been evacuated from several smaller buildings south of 540 Madison -- including 538, 536, 534 and 532 Madison -- had not been allowed to return to any of those buildings.
Yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani urged patience. "I understand and sympathize tremendously with the businesses there," he said. "But the people working on this are working on it as fast as possible. What we should do is make sure they get it done safely, because what we don't want is for people to do it too fast and not make sure all the bricks are secure."
In the meantime, economic misery has become a common denominator on one of Manhattan's swankiest blocks.
Frederick Kahn, a dentist with an office at 538 Madison, pleaded with emergency officials to let him back in his offices for five minutes -- just five minutes -- to retrieve his appointment book and Rolodex. No luck.
"They said, 'If we give you five minutes, we'll have to give everyone five minutes,' " Dr. Kahn said yesterday from his home. "And they said, 'We're afraid to send an emergency person in with you, because we might have two dead instead of one.' "
It was the same story with Barbara Spiegel, an actress who is one of a handful of people who live on the block. She was wearing her nightgown on Sunday afternoon when fire officials came to her top-floor apartment at 534 Madison and told her she had to leave, and she was still wearing it yesterday.
She decided to go to the home of a friend; other residents of the block were staying in hotels, with the costs to be paid by the Macklowe Organization, the owner of 540 Madison Avenue.
Stores in the surrounding area felt the impact. Some, like Schumer's Wine & Liquors, on East 54th Street between Madison and Park Avenues, could not get deliveries because of the traffic barriers. Others, like the restaurant Bice on East 54th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, saw a 50 percent drop in business because of the traffic barriers and a lack of walk-in business. At Parviz Nemati Oriental Rugs on the corner of 53d Street, where prices for rugs and tapestries start at $20,000, Mr. Nemati, the owner, was anxious. His lease runs out at month's end, he said, and he had intended to liquidate the store's holdings to raise $2 million, then retire. But yesterday, he was not sure.
"People call from all over the country, and they say, 'Oh we are afraid to come in,' " said Mr. Nemati, who did not receive his first customer of the day until 4:30 P.M. If the street remains closed for much longer, he said, "I don't know if I can retire."
And there were the customers.
Mary Goldstein, who manages a restaurant, gets her hair done twice a week at Le Rebelle, at 532 Madison. But last night, Ms. Goldstein confronted blue police barriers and was told that the salon was closed. She approached a reporter.
"I was hoping you were a hairdresser and you were going to save me," she said. When told otherwise, she quietly turned away and left the area.

HEADLINE: KOREANS PRESSING U.S. AND JAPANESE FOR SPEEDIER AID

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 9

 BODY:
With investor confidence again starting to erode despite the international rescue of its economy, South Korea's Government called on the United States and Japan today to quickly provide some money that they had pledged only as a last resort.
But within hours, Clinton Administration officials made clear that any early injection of American funds would be firmly rejected. The Japanese Finance Ministry said its funds would only be available as a backup and the original terms of the bailout should be honored. 
 Both Governments said they had received no formal request from the South Korean Government, and they seemed surprised that Seoul would float such a request before it had been conveyed to Washington and Tokyo.
The Korean request, made by the Finance Minister in an interview today, came less than a week after the rescue agreement was announced and reflected growing signs that the International Monetary Fund bailout has not restored confidence in South Korea's shaky financial system.
With its holdings of dollars running low, both the country's currency and its stock market have been plummeting. Indeed, the won is in free fall, having lost 16 percent of its value against the dollar the last two days. The stock market rallied immediately after the announcement of the bailout but has almost completely given up the gain it had recorded.
"If the U.S. and Japan are committed to supporting the Korean economy, they should support the economy at the early stage, rather than waiting," Lim Chang Yuel, the Minister of Finance and Economy, said today. "This will stabilize the markets here," he added.
Mr. Lim denied that he was, in effect, suggesting that the $57 billion bailout would have to be increased. "I think we can make it," Mr. Lim said. But, he added, some of the money from Tokyo and Washington should be "front loaded."
There have been growing fears among investors that the bailout might be insufficient, especially after Seoul acknowledged Korea's $66 billion in short-term debt dominated mainly in dollars does not include $50 billion owed by the overseas operations of South Korean companies.
Under the rescue package, the United States pledged $5 billion and Japan $10 billion. But their contributions, along with those of other countries, constituted only a backup source of funds if the $35 billion from the I.M.F., the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank -- was insufficient.
The Clinton Administration, which played a leading role in orchestrating the bailout, has tried to make the contribution more politically palatable in the United States by saying there was a chance the American money would never be needed.
"They should implement the reforms that are needed to get Korea back on the right path," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who has directed the American response to the series of Asian bailouts, said in a telephone interview today. "I think the overall structure of the I.M.F. program is a strong one, and is supported by the second line of defense commitments by the other countries," he said.
But the direct financial participation of the United States and other nations in aiding South Korea, he said, "only comes later."
 Mr. Lim is not waiting only for Washington and Tokyo. On Wednesday morning, he moved up the timetable for allowing foreign shareholders to own half the stock in a Korean company, up from 26 percent currently. The limit will be raised on Thursday rather than by year-end.
 Mr. Lim also announced that the Government was suspending the operations of five more merchant banks in addition to the nine suspended last week. the merchant banks, tend to specialize in short-term lending, and Mr. Lim said commercial banks would be allowed to take on some of their functions to avoid a credit squeeze for Korean companies. The won continued to plummet on Wednesday, falling to the maximum daily limit before trading was halted.
Meanwhile, more details emerged today about just how close South Korea was to defaulting on its debt payable in dollars before the bailout was announced.
A report by the I.M.F. released by the Government said its holdings of foreign currency, mostly American dollars, were only about $6 billion on Dec. 2, the day before the agreement was reached, according to Reuters.
One Finance Ministry official said the Bank of Korea was burning through its reserves by as much as $2 billion a day to help South Korean banks that needed cash because they had lost their short-term loans from foreign banks. That indicates that the country had only a few days left before a default.
Before that point, the last official Government figure for holdings of foreign currencies was $30.5 billion as of Oct. 31, which the I.M.F. said shrank to $23.9 billion by Dec. 2. But the I.M.F. said $17.9 million was unusable because it was tied up in the foreign banking subsidiaries of Korean banks, which needed it to pay off short-term debt as their lenders demanded payment.
Without those funds, one Finance Ministry official said, the Korean banks would fail.
Mr. Lim, who holds the title of Deputy Prime Minister, said he had not yet asked Washington or Tokyo directly to speed their contributions, and he did not say how much money he wanted now.
The I.M.F. has already given South Korea $5.5 billion, with another $3.5 billion due this month followed by $2 billion in January. The Asian Development Bank will give $2 billion this month, and the World Bank is expected to chip in its first $2 billion. The money is being given in stages to insure that South Korea carries out a number of changes to pump more capital into its banking system, open South Korea to greater foreign investment and reduce political influence on the corporate sector.
One of Mr. Lim's motives for seeking American money now reflects the hostility in the country to demands by the United States to revamp its economy. He said he wanted to see dollars injected into the country now from Washington and Tokyo when it is urgently needed -- not merely as a backup down the road. "If not, they are just servicing by words," he said. "They are advising on policies and not really putting their money in at all."
Mr. Lim added, "What will the Korean public's response be? You can imagine." Similar complaints were made against the United States in the I.M.F. bailout of Thailand, to which Washington contributed no money.
Mr. Lim, 53, who became Finance Minister on Nov. 19 and led Korea's negotiations for the bailout, also said the United States and Japan should contribute because the falling won means that it takes fewer dollars and yen to buy South Korean products.
The minister spoke on a day when the Korean currency plunged to a record low close of 1,460 against the dollar. The dollar was at 1,196 won the day the bailout was announced and at 844.20 at the end of last year.
The stock market's KOSPI index plummeted 6.47 percent, to 388.00, today. And interest rates on three-year corporate bonds surged to 24.95 percent, a hair less than the legal limit of 25 percent.
"In a sense the market is telling the Government that the conditions the I.M.F. originally set are not enough," said Richard Samuelson, director of research and manager at the Seoul branch of SBC Warburg Dillon Read, a brokerage firm. "I would reckon there's some serious hair-pulling in the Blue House and the Finance Ministry," he said. The Blue House is the South Korean equivalent of the White House.
Ideally, the funds Mr. Lim seeks would be used to make short-term loans to South Korean banks to repay depositors and lenders and avert a series of bank runs and defaults. Also, a larger amount of dollars on hand would impart a greater sense of confidence among international money managers. One other use of the funds might be to buy won on the open market, thereby lifting demand and propping up its value. But the I.M.F. has opposed that strategy for fear that the money would be wasted because it might raise the value of the currency only temporarily.
Officials at the I.M.F. said they were unaware of Mr. Lim's comments, but that they saw no need for the United States and Japan to provide any additional money to South Korea now.
"Nothing has happened on the external side that suggests they need more money," said an I.M.F. official who insisted on anonymity.
The official said that South Korea had properly allowed its currency to fall sharply in value the last several days rather than using the money provided by the fund to intervene in the foreign exchange market.
The continuing devaluation of the won could worsen the crisis, however. For one thing it means that South Korea's short-term debt, officially estimated at about $66 billion, would become that much more expensive to pay back because it would take more won to repay a fixed amount of dollars. Also, foreign banks, which helped precipitate the crisis by cutting off credit lines to Korean banks, could do so again if they thought their loans would not be repaid.

New Car-Lease Protections
New Federal rules on car leasing, to take effect in 1998, will require dealers to give car buyers basic information about costs and other terms of leasing, allowing consumers to compare different leases or decide that they might be better off purchasing instead.

Constitution and Car Chases
The Supreme Court heard arguments on whether a high-speed police chase that results in accidental -- although perhaps foreseeable -- injury or death violates the Constitution. A lawyer for a California sheriff's deputy said the deputy should be immune from a damage suit brought by the family of a 16-year-old motorcycle passenger who died in 1990 when the deputy's patrol car skidded into him after a motorcycle chase at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h.

Clue to Fraudulent Story
A clue that M.

But Mr. Lawrence said he had been injured in March 1945, while serving on a United States merchant marine ship in the Arctic Ocean. A27

Boeing to Change Design Because of T.W.A. Crash
In an effort to prevent explosions like the one that caused the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, Boeing officials said that the design of the company's jetliners needed to be changed to guard against the build-up of flammable fumes. Although the cause of the explosion on the Boeing 747 has still not been determined, the company's statement was a clear departure from a 40-year-old principle of commercial aviation design. Boeing said that it was now researching possible ways of reducing the accumulation of dangerous vapors in fuel tanks. A1

Pataki Receives $17,000 For Talk to Corporation

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki went to Milwaukee last night to give his fifth paid speech of the year, receiving about $17,000 for a talk to a mutual fund management company about the post-industrial economy.
The Republican Governor's practice of giving paid speeches has come under fierce criticism from Democrats and watchdog groups who contend it exposes him to conflicts of interest with groups that conduct business with the state. Mr. Pataki has given nine paid speeches since he began the practice last year. 
 Aides to the Governor say he must supplement his salary of $130,000 because he is carrying a heavy debt load from real estate investments and has a daughter attending Yale. During the 1994 campaign, Mr. Pataki's campaign advisers frequently criticized Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for giving paid speeches.
Mr. Pataki addressed employees of Strong Capital Management, said Zenia Mucha, his director of communications. Ms. Mucha said he would be paid his standard fee, which recently rose to $17,000.

HEADLINE: $400 Million Hotel Expansion Is Planned by Mohegan Sun

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

DATELINE: NORWICH, Conn., Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Mohegan tribe, which owns one of the nation's largest casinos, plans to add a $400 million-plus hotel and convention center to the gambling palace on its eastern Connecticut reservation, tribal leaders said today.
Mohegan Sun, the tribe's casino, has made millions of dollars by attracting more visitors than the Statue of Liberty this year, and since it opened in October 1996, roughly 20,000 day-trippers, usually from New York and New England, have come every day to gamble there. But the tribe wants to transform the casino, which has an Indian theme, into a destination resort like Las Vegas, and it intends to begin this new project as early as April, completing the job by the year 2000 at the latest. 
 The casino is in Uncasville, Conn., about a two-and-one-half-hour drive from Manhattan -- closer than Atlantic City.
The tribe made its announcement here this morning at a meeting of the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, after months of anticipation as to when the Mohegans would expand their enterprise.
"In regards to what it's going to be -- and I've heard everything from a ferris wheel to a Six Flags theme park -- what the tribe is looking for is something that will be more than just gaming," Roland Harris, the tribal council chairman, told the business group. "We understand that gaming may not be forever, and that it may be cyclical like everything else."
Mr. Harris explained that the tribe wanted to "diversify the facility" by building one to three hotels that would offer 1,200 to 2,200 rooms and that might have a nautical theme that reflects the Mohegans' heritage as whalers. There also would be a 5,000-to-10,000-seat entertainment center, a 75,000-square-foot convention center and more gaming space added to the giant $300-million casino, which already houses 3,000 slot machines and 180 gaming tables.
The tribe is also planning to build a marina next to the casino, which is on the west bank of the Thames River, though it will not be part of the hotel and convention center proposal.
The planned expansion is the latest example of how the Mohegans and their neighbors, the Mashantucket Pequots, who own and operate the Foxwoods Resort Casino, have become the engine driving the economy in this region of the state. While eastern Connecticut once relied heavily on military contracts, downsizing in the defense industry has cost the region thousands of jobs, and tourism has emerged as the area's fastest-growing industry.
By making this move, the Mohegans are following in the Pequots' foot-steps. The Pequots, whose casino in nearby Ledyard is the nation's largest, have been operating two hotels for several years and have recently opened part of a 17-story hotel. The rest of that hotel is scheduled to be completed by April, giving the tribe 1,400 rooms.
The Mohegans continue to work with a partnership headed by a Sol Kerzner, a South African casino developer who has created some of the gambling industry's most opulent resorts. He has built Sun City, a lavish African casino resort with man-made lakes and golf courses.
State officials have estimated that the Mohegan slot machines will generate $370 million in revenues from July 1, 1997, to June 30, 1998. Slot machines generally account for about 65 to 70 percent of a casino's take. Foxwoods earns roughly double the amount of Mohegan Sun.

HEADLINE: 52 Charged With Fraud As Tenants

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
State and city prosecutors announced fraud charges yesterday against 52 residents of city housing projects and other subsidized apartments, who are accused of stealing nearly $900,000 in housing and welfare benefits by lying about their jobs, income and assets.
One Brooklyn couple hid $500,000 in assets from the New York City Housing Authority, prosecutors said. Others sublet their Housing Authority apartments while living elsewhere, or concealed employment, including city jobs. 
 Edward Kuriansky, Commissioner of the city's Department of Investigation, who announced the charges along with the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, noted that there was a six-year waiting list to get into subsidized housing.
"Our interest is in protecting the honest people who are deprived, who are more needy," Mr. Morgenthau said. "All those who stand in line to try and get in those housing projects but can't."
Prosecutors said the defendants stole benefits worth $2,870 to $43,000. These were some of the accusations:
*David K. Simms, 32, holder of an apartment at the Harlem River Houses in upper Manhattan, had actually lived and worked in Philadelphia since 1989, holding jobs at two hospitals and a Pizza Hut, while collecting rent from a subtenant in New York. Prosecutors said he received welfare benefits as well.
*Tibor Gelb, 43, and his wife, Blanche, 41, failed to report interest on more than $500,000 they had in bank accounts, and also failed to report several real estate transactions, while they were Housing Authority tenants from 1984 to 1995.
*Gwendolyn Patton, 40, an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs who held an apartment at the Edgemere Houses in Queens, concealed her income from that job while receiving $11,990 worth of rent subsidies and $27,804 in welfare.
The investigation, reported yesterday in The Daily News, was part of a series of inquiries into welfare and housing fraud. Prosecutors said several arrests resulted from a comparison of computer data from city, state and Federal payrolls with lists of housing and welfare recipients.

HEADLINE: 'Shareholder' Model Demeans Marriage

 BODY:

To the Editor:
When Lorna J. Wendt claimed 50 percent of family assets as an "equitable distribution" in a divorce settlement from Gary C. Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital Corporation, she argued that she had earned it as an economic helpmate in her husband's career. A Connecticut court awarded $20 million, out of their estimated wealth of $100 million. 
 You note (editorial, Dec. 5) that the award, though not half, was still a "grand sum." Furthermore, incomes in the highest zones now bring extravagant wealth to some people whose "earning power is based on unique talents that have nothing to do with their marriages." Outgoing spouses should therefore be able to claim some of that wealth insofar as they contributed to it. Your headline, "Spouses as Shareholders," with its overtones of limited liability, reinforces this rejection of a connubial partnership in which all belongs to both.
Mrs. Wendt had only one rightful claim, which had nothing to do with being an entrepreneur: she was a wife. What is left of marriage if partners can claim talents or handicaps, income or losses, assets or liabilities, homes or offspring "that have nothing to do with their marriages"?

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A new look at bank reforms to cut inefficiencies and risk.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
JAPAN'S financial system, built around giant banks with fingers in every economic pie, is collapsing along with real estate and stock markets -- and in the process dragging Japan to the brink of depression. Why, then, should America abandon the legal barricades that have separated banking from other financial services and inhibited the rise of nationwide branch banking since the New Deal?
The next time the White House tries to maneuver comprehensive banking reform past a skeptical Congress -- a futile exercise for the last two Administrations -- the Treasury will have to come up with convincing answers. Check that; it already has. 
 As if in anticipation of the mess in Asia, the Treasury quietly issued a report last month on "American Finance for the 21st Century." Drafted by Robert Litan, a former Clinton Administration budget official who now directs economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and Jonathan Rauch, a journalist retained to keep it short and jargon-free, the report elegantly summarizes where the financial services industry has been and compellingly argues for where it ought to go.
Financial services -- banks, insurers, brokers, investment underwriters, mutual finds -- generate just 6 percent of America's gross domestic product. But the businesses producing the other 94 percent thrive or languish on the financial services industry's efficiency in processing payments, playing matchmaker between savers and investors and spreading risk.
Largely self-regulated until the stock market crash in 1929, the industry imploded early in the Great Depression. Nine thousand banks failed and lending shriveled. Even the payments system -- the vital, workaday capacity of banks to process checks and to store working capital -- was critically wounded.
Americans blamed the natural excesses of capitalism in general, and banking in particular. They devised a new regulatory regime around tight Government control of banking and securities markets, generous deposit insurance and assured access to credit.
This system -- driven by what Mr. Litan calls "prevention of failure at all cost" -- worked well enough (if not well) until the late 1970's. But it was slowly undermined by innovation and political lobbying, as financial players saw how much money could be made via end runs around regulations or loopholes through them.
Private, uninsured money market funds drained deposits from banks by paying higher interest. Insured lenders fought back, getting permission to pay market-rate interest and invest in whatever they pleased. Unregulated lenders grabbed much of the traditional corporate business from banks and forced them into higher-risk loans to real estate developers and foreign governments.
Government was left with ineffective controls on insured lenders, but unlimited responsibility for depositors. The result was financial folly -- Latin American loan defaults, savings and loan insolvencies. The waste proved only a minor drag on economic growth. But taxpayers took a $150 billion hit. Ominously, the Government's reflexive response was to patch the obsolete regulatory structure, strengthening bank supervision and raising capital requirements.
Mr. Litan calls for a fundamental rethinking of financial regulation. "Periodic upsets in financial markets are inevitable," he argues, and the goal ought to shift from "preventing upsets to containing them." That means identifying and isolating trouble early, rather than suppressing market forces and leaving the taxpayers responsible when regulation fails. Indeed, open-ended deposit insurance is the enemy of this containment strategy. "If market participants know the Government will always be there to bail them out," Mr. Litan argues, "they have nothing to lose by taking reckless risks."
The report offers specific recommendations ranging from the utopian (international harmonization of accounting rules) to the mundane (faster payments clearing). But one in particular illustrates the general thrust of harnessing markets to excise inefficiency and contain risk. Mr. Litan would require large banks to create a thick buffer of subordinated debt -- uninsured bonds -- between bank stockholders and insured depositors. This would not only reduce potential losses to Government deposit insurance but also create a class of hostage investors to safeguard against imprudent lending. What's more, the market interest rate on this debt would give regulators an alternative way of measuring the riskiness of a bank's portfolio.
While Congress has balked at comprehensive financial reform, markets are driving change independently -- much the way they have in health care. This report is unlikely to break the interest-group gridlock that has prevented Congress from acting. But as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin suggests in the preface, it "presents an extremely useful analytic framework," a matrix for assessing proposed changes, whether they be comprehensive or piecemeal.

HEADLINE: Broadest Measure of Trade Deficit Widens

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The nation's deficit on the current account, the broadest measure of international trade, widened in the third quarter as Asia's economic crisis weakened United States exports.
The current account, which measures trade in goods, services and investments, widened to a seasonally adjusted $42.156 billion in the third quarter, up 11.4 percent from a revised $37.852 billion in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said today. 
 While weaker Asian demand for American-made goods and a surge in cheap imports from Asia accounted for a part of the ballooning current-account gap, investment flows to the United States also slowed.
"We're going to see even more pronounced weakness in exports in this quarter and in 1998," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York.
Net foreign purchases of Treasury securities and dollars declined to $43.5 billion in the third quarter from $49.9 billion in the second quarter as Japanese investors bought fewer bills, notes and bonds. The decline was offset in part by a rise in purchases from Western Europe.
Over all, the United States deficit in merchandise trade rose 9.4 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter to $51.5 billion, while the surplus in services rose 2 percent, to $21.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Line Item Languor

BYLINE: By John McCain; John McCain, a Republican, is a United States Senator from Arizona.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With the enactment of the line item veto in 1996, President Clinton became the first chief executive to have the power to eliminate the billions of dollars in wasteful spending that Congress adds to appropriations bills each year. Unfortunately, he has completely missed this historic opportunity.
The President used the line item veto to eliminate only $491 million from more than $800 billion in spending in the 13 appropriations bills for the 1998 fiscal year. That amounts to less than one-tenth of 1 percent, leaving billions of dollars' worth of low-priority, unnecessary or wasteful projects. 
 Look at some of the projects the President chose not to veto:
* A $3 million grant from the Agency for International Development to the International Fertilizer Development Center.
* $300,000 to establish a dedicated commuter lane on a highway in El Paso, Tex.
* A provision requiring the Army to build a bridge across the Bull River in Alaska and provide two 6 x 6 vehicles so that students from the University of Alaska can have access to the Golden Zone Mine. This project could cost tens of millions of dollars and will benefit fewer than 8,500 students.
* $26 million from the defense budget for nondefense purposes, including automobile technology development at the National Automotive Center in Michigan, electric vehicle research and development, and a Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean Sciences. (Tapping into the defense budget for projects that belong somewhere else is a favorite trick of pork-barrelers.)
* $100,000 to preserve a Revolutionary War gunboat discovered on the bottom of Lake Champlain on the Vermont-New York border.
* $400,000 each for research on the Preble's Meadow jumping mouse and the Alabama sturgeon.
* $500,000 for the "fine hardwoods tree improvement project" at Purdue University.
* $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness.
* $6 million to complete construction of a building at the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture in Leetown, W.Va., and another $250,000 to initiate a program there.
* $3.3 million for shrimp aquaculture research in Arizona, Hawaii, Mississippi, Massachusetts and California.
* $540,000 for various agriculture-related research efforts, including dairy and meat goat research in Texas, poult enteritis mortality syndrome research in Georgia, hops research in Oregon and phytophthora root rot research in New Mexico.
Some of these projects are as absurd as they sound. Others may have merit but could and should be financed by local government or private industry. All of them and dozens more were on a list I formulated using criteria developed in cooperation with government watchdog organizations like Citizens Against Government Waste -- a list that totaled $8 billion. The President, though, left the vast majority of those projects unscathed.
I will not venture an opinion as to why some projects were not vetoed by Mr. Clinton while other, similar projects were eliminated.
Some claim partisan politics played a role, since the President eliminated more Republican-proposed projects than Democratic-backed ones. Others point to a flurry of deal-making in the last days of the first session of this Congress, in which the White House supposedly promised not to veto certain projects if the affected members of Congress would vote for particular legislation.
I have not seen compelling evidence of either claim. However, the Administration's refusal to establish objective criteria for exercise of the line item veto helped give these claims a certain credibility. And the seemingly random nature of the Administration's veto decisions left Mr. Clinton vulnerable to criticism, which may have made him reluctant to make more extensive use of the power.
The director of the Office of Management and Budget says the Administration believes that the mere existence of the line item veto power acts as a deterrent to pork-barrel spending. But threats alone will not curb Congress's appetite for pork. Actually using the line item veto will enhance its deterrent effect and, more important, eliminate any wasteful spending that is not deterred by the veto threat.
The Republican Congress passed the Line Item Veto Act last year after 10 years of dedicated effort. President Clinton, who supported the measure and could have established a vigorous first-year precedent, instead has made that 10-year struggle seem like a waste through his unwillingness to use the veto effectively.
Sadly, the people who will pay the price are the taxpayers, who in the coming year will have to pony up $7.5 billion to finance the pork-barrel habits of the politicians in Washington.

HEADLINE: Preventing Another Flight 800

 BODY:
Aircraft manufacturers, airlines and their Federal overseers understandably like to identify the cause of an air disaster before developing changes in design, operations or training to enhance safety. But that is highly unlikely in the case of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, where investigators, after an exhaustive inquiry, have been unable to determine just what caused the plane's center fuel tank to explode. Even so, testimony this week at hearings on the 1996 crash suggests that reasonable and novel steps can be taken to prevent a recurrence.
In their testimony in Baltimore at the National Transportation Safety Board hearings, Boeing engineers essentially said that technical changes aimed at protecting the 747's fuel tank from sparks -- the traditional approach to preventing such explosions -- were not enough. There must also be a search, they said, for ways to reduce the flammability of fuel vapors in the tank so that they will not explode even if a spark is generated. That approach was recommended by the safety board nearly a year ago but was initially opposed by the industry and the Federal Aviation Administration, which preferred to concentrate on eliminating ignition sources. The manufacturer's testimony may now drive the search for solutions increasingly toward vapor reduction. 
 Boeing says its search for ways to cut the flammability of fuel has been under way for months and involves talks with others in the industry. Its efforts appear analogous to its decision to alter a part of the rudder on its 737 airliner after crashes near Pittsburgh in 1994 and near Colorado Springs in 1991, even though regulators have yet to rule on the precise causes of those accidents.
Most Americans have neither the time nor expertise to sort out the sometimes conflicting safety recommendations made by the safety board, whose mandate is to enhance safety, and the Federal Aviation Administration, which concerns itself with safety and cost-benefit analysis. But watching the two agencies feud over which changes the industry should adopt in the aftermath of Flight 800 has been unsettling. The comforting development at this week's hearings was to find both Boeing and the F.A.A. moving closer to some of the safety board's positions. That can only enhance safety and consumer confidence in commercial aviation.

HEADLINE: 8 Countries Join in an Effort To Catch Computer Criminals

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Acknowledging a need to confront computer crime more forcefully, the United States and seven other countries pledged today to search for and prosecute high-tech criminals from each other's countries even when extradition laws do not apply.
A communique signed by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Justice and Interior Ministers of Russia, Germany, Japan, Britain, Canada, France and Italy promised to coordinate efforts to combat industrial espionage, money-laundering, child pornography and other wrongdoing in cyberspace. They also agreed to develop new crime-fighting technologies like video links to obtain and share testimony from witnesses. 
 The ministers offered few details about tactics or budgets. But the fact that the first meeting ever held among the senior law-enforcement officials of the eight countries was devoted to computer crime underscored the growing concerns that world leaders share about security in cyberspace.
"We're using 19th-century tools to face a 21st-century problem," said Jack Straw, the British Home Secretary, after the two days of talks. "One person can stay in the same place and commit crimes in several countries without leaving his armchair."
Ms. Reno said, "Somebody can sit in his room in Washington, D.C., and steal from a bank in another country, or attack a computer of some private industry and disrupt the data available to that company, data that may be critical to that company."
She gave particular emphasis to the agreement to step up prosecutions of criminals who cross borders. "Too often, a criminal will flee a country and return to his or her own homeland, hoping to escape justice," she said.
The Justice Department estimates that thieves with sophisticated computer skills steal $10 billion a year from financial institutions in the United States, and American companies are believed to suffer even greater losses from foreign economic sabotage.
British law-enforcement authorities say the dimensions of the problem relative to the size of their country's economy may be even greater.
The Colombian and Mexican drug cartels that control most cocaine trafficking in the United States are using the World Wide Web to launder money in increasing amounts, law-enforcement officials say.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Enters A Sanitarium, The Victim Of a Virus

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 10

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin has a respiratory infection and will stay at a sanitarium for 10 to 12 days, the Kremlin said today.
Russian officials, painting a picture of business as usual, said Mr. Yeltsin was not bedridden and was doing paperwork at the Barvikha sanitarium outside Moscow. 
 "An acute respiratory viral infection has developed out of a cold," Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, said at a briefing today. "The doctors do not exclude influenza developing and have recommended a stay in a sanitarium."
Clinton Administration officials said they knew of no reason for alarm.
Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the American heart surgeon who came to Moscow last year to advise on Mr. Yeltsin's coronary problems, said in an interview that he had not been consulted this time.
He said that if Mr. Yeltsin had a serious heart problem, he would probably have been taken to the hospital where he was operated on last year and not to the sanitarium.
But it was difficult to ascertain the condition of Mr. Yeltsin, who is 66, because the Kremlin has a record of hiding the severity of the President's medical problems.
The surprise announcement did little to help the health of the Russian economy, which is already buffeted by the global currency crisis. Stock prices, which have fallen precipitously since early October, dipped again today after the reports of Mr. Yeltsin's illness.
Investors seemed nervous not only because of the reports of the President's illness, but also because his autocratic style magnifies the problem of an infirm leader.
He has established competing factions within his own Government and assumed the role of the supreme arbiter, and when he has been ill in the past, major decisions have been left untaken and Russia has tended to drift.
The lack of a clear successor is another concern.
If Mr. Yeltsin were to die in office, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin would take charge for three months while elections were organized. There is a plethora of potential candidates, and the pro-Yeltsin camp has not been able to agree on a successor.
Until this setback, Mr. Yeltsin seemed to be having a good year. His health reached a low point in 1996 when he was found to have coronary artery disease, and in November 1996 he underwent heart surgery in which Russian doctors placed five bypasses to remedy blockages in the arteries supplying oxygen to his heart.
Mr. Yeltsin then caught pneumonia and did not return to a full work schedule until February of this year.
Since his recovery, however, he has appeared to be vigorous and fit -- at least until last week. On his recent trip to Stockholm, Mr. Yeltsin appeared drawn and made several gaffes, implying, for example, that Germany and Japan had nuclear arsenals.
Mr. Yastrzhembsky said Mr. Yeltsin caught a cold on that trip and still had a slight temperature.
Mr. Yeltsin was last seen in public on Tuesday at an awards cermony at the Kremlin. In a display of his authority, he strode before an audience and somberly announced that he could not hand out the honors at a time when victims of a plane crash in Irkutsk, Siberia, on Saturday were being buried.
Earlier today the Kremlin insisted that Mr. Yeltsin was firmly at the helm and was overseeing the Government's handling of an abortive hijacking of a passenger plane. Then came the announcement that he had fallen ill.
Because of Mr. Yeltsin's illness, the Kremlin has postponed a meeting with political and trade union leaders on land reform planned for Thursday.
Nor will Mr. Yeltsin lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Friday, Constitution Day.
Those events may have forced the Kremlin's disclosure today: it would have been difficult for Mr. Yeltsin to cancel those appearances without causing alarm.
But Mr. Yeltsin plans to make his weekly radio address to the nation on Friday, his aides said.

HEADLINE: Albright, in Uganda, Steps Up Attack on Sudan's War of Terror

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: GULU, Uganda, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Madeleine K. Albright cradled an orphaned infant in her arms today and for a moment she lost the demeanor of the Secretary of State on official business and became motherly.
"It will be all right now," she soothed the month-old girl, Charity, whose mother was killed in an attack by Sudanese-backed rebels two weeks ago. Then Ms. Albright turned to an aid worker. "It will be all right," she said. "Won't it?" 
 On the second day of a seven-nation tour through Africa, Ms. Albright came to northern Uganda to focus attention on the victims of a brutal campaign by the Lord's Resistance Army, a bizarre Christian rebel group that receives arms and aid from the fundamentalist Islamic Government in the Sudan.
She also used her visit to Uganda to step up America's verbal assault on the Sudanese Government, blaming it for the carnage in northern Uganda in recent years. Several times during the day, she vowed that the United States would continue its campaign to isolate the Sudan.
Since 1993, the State Department has accused the Sudan of exporting terror. Last month the United States imposed new economic sanctions on the country, barring American businesses from investing there. The United States has also provided about $20 million in military aid other than weapons to Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda, all of which in turn supply the rebels with arms.
Hours before touring a hospital and a center for traumatized children here, Ms. Albright met in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, for the first time with six leaders of the main Sudanese rebel alliance.
The meeting marked the highest level of contact so far between the United States and the Sudan's rebels, led by John Garang, the head of the Sudan People's Liberation Army. It appeared intended to send a message to the Sudan's Islamic Government that America supports the rebels efforts to establish democracy.
For more than a decade, Uganda and the Sudan have sponsored rebel movements inside each other's territories. Under President Yoweri K. Museveni, Uganda has provided arms and safe haven to Mr. Garang's troops, who are fighting for more autonomy and religious freedom for the mostly Christian south. In response, the Sudan has sponsored the Lord's Resistance Army in northern Uganda and two Islamic rebel movements in the west of the country.
In northern Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army initially grew from an secessionist movement by the Acholi tribe in the mid-1980's that opposed the military takeover by President Museveni, who comes from a southern ethnic group.
In recent years, however, under the leadership of Joseph Kony, the rebel army has become a cult-like organization that says it wants to overthrow Mr. Museveni and establish a government based on the Ten Commandments.
Those who have escaped Mr. Kony's army say boys the rebels abduct are forced to become porters and soldiers, while the young girls are repeatedly raped and given as concubines to officers.
It was the victims of this conflict whom Ms. Albright visited today at the Gulu Children of War Center, a rehabilitation camp run by the Christian relief organization, World Vision.
"You are the future of Africa," she told about 200 children at the center. "You are God's gift to the world and we will do what we can to help you."

HEADLINE: Serbs Pull Out of Talks on Bosnia to Protest Warning on Kosovo

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Dec. 10

 BODY:
An international meeting intended to promote peace in Bosnia ended here today with a walkout by Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb delegates and a renewed threat of firmer action, including economic sanctions, to press Bosnia's hostile ethnic factions into unity.
The Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb delegates abandoned the two-day gathering of the Peace Implementation Council, set up after the 1995 Dayton peace accord, to protest a reference in its final communique to "increasing ethnic tensions" in Kosovo. That is a region of the truncated Yugoslavia ruled by Belgrade to the resentment of a restive ethnic Albanian majority. 
 The Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb delegates said the Bosnia conference had no mandate to discuss the situation in Kosovo. Dragomir Vucicevic, the director of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, called the reference to Kosovo interference in his country's internal affairs.
The walkout came shortly before the end of the annual conference, which grouped 51 countries, including the United States and Russia, and 21 international agencies.
Russia, the United States and Germany had all supported the idea of using the conference to issue a warning about Kosovo, which many outsiders see as a tinderbox of ethnic passions that can only be made more flammable by heavy-handedness from Belgrade.
Without specifically mentioning the Yugoslav authorities, the communique urged "those concerned" to "refrain from activities that might exacerbate existing difficulties."
Momcilo Krajisnik, who led the Bosnian Serb delegation out of the conference in support of the Yugoslav delegation, said the reference to Kosovo was an attempt to "try to sneak the Kosovo issue through the back door."
Mr. Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb representative in Bosnia's collective presidency, is seen as a hard-liner. Biljana Plavsic, the Bosnian Serb president, also left the conference.
The protest overshadowed decisions to set deadlines for a series of supposedly unifying moves, like common auto license plates throughout Bosnia, and to empower the conference's top official in Bosnia to impose nation-building measures on the country's divided Serbs, Muslims and Croats if they cannot agree among themselves.
"If they do not do their job, we have to do it in their place," said the top official, Carlos Westendorp, a former Spanish diplomat who has the title of High Representative in Bosnia.
Bob Gelbard, a special United States representative, said: "The message to the parties from Bonn is unequivocal: get on with it. Stop these unacceptable delaying tactics."
Since the American-brokered Dayton peace accord, Bosnia's ethnic groups have shown no readiness to regard themselves as part of the same country. There is no national currency, no common passport and no common flag. Bosnian Serbs have different license plates from Bosnian Muslims, and the country is split on ethnic lines.
The gathering backed its new powers for Mr. Westendorp with the threat that factions standing in the way of peace would forfeit crucial economic aid. His new powers include the ability to dismiss Bosnian politicians who do not attend meetings to promote peace and unity.
"Those who help us reach our goals will receive help," said Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister. "Those who refuse exclude themselves."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Rise in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities, particularly shorter maturities, moved higher for the second consecutive day yesterday on a flight to quality by investors concerned over Asian market turmoil and Federal Reserve activity in the market.
Traders noted that in times of uncertainty investors often sought the safety of the Government securities market, particularly the bill sector. Even year-end buying cannot be ruled out as managers add Treasury securities to their portfolios. 
 The Fed was in the market for a second day buying securities and adding cash to the banking system. The process is called a coupon pass, and the central bank announces that it is buying various securities and maturities. Yesterday it bought close to $3 billion in securities with coupons dated to mature from Dec. 31, 1999, to Nov. 30, 2002.
The 30-year bond gained 21/32, to a price of 100 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.07 percent, from 6.11 percent on Tuesday, the lowest since 6.05 percent last Thursday.
Market participants are avoiding aggressive moves, while they wait for more economic data this week and hope it will show that economic growth is not threatening to accelerate inflation and cause interest rates to rise.
Today retail sales data will be reported for November. Some economists expect a four-tenths of 1 percent increase over all, but a more modest one-tenth of 1 percent gain is expected if autos are excluded.
Tomorrow November's Producer Price Index should prove more favorable, according to analysts. They expect the prices paid by factories, farmers and other producers to be up only one-tenth of 1 percent, both in the overall number and when the more volatile energy and food components are excluded.
Regardless, the talk is that the Fed will not change rates at next Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said: "The debate at the upcoming F.O.M.C. will center on the outlook for 1998. Prior to the Southeast Asian currency crisis and the global stock market turmoil, a case could have been made that a policy adjustment was a prudent action, given the rapid pace of growth during 1997. At this juncture, all policy makers will agree that the best policy action will be to leave the status quo."
Ken Logan, a managing analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said, "Once again overseas concerns have captivated the attention of U.S. Treasury traders," particularly the disclosures that Korea's financial problems are much worse than first thought.
Mr. Logan predicts this flight to quality buying will continue as the disarray in Asia is sorted out. This, he added, along with year-end balance sheet constraints, is likely to support the market for the balance of the week.
Despite the Asian problems, as of late yesterday the Korea Development Bank still planned to sell a $2 billion issue, either today or tomorrow.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Sees Earnings Hurt Abroad

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Another shock wave caused by economic turmoil in Asia reached Wall Street yesterday as J. P. Morgan & Company said earnings in October and November were hurt by "unsettled market conditions" abroad.
Morgan declined to quantify the damage, only saying the downturn resulted from decreased client activity and lower trading revenue. Traders and analysts said the bank was not stuck with a huge emerging-market trading setback of the sort that recently caused the Chase Manhattan Corporation to disclose a $160 million trading loss primarily related to its Brazilian operations. 
 In fact, analysts and traders said Morgan's trading and client problems were centered in Asia, Europe, and the United States and revolved around the bank's equity derivatives and fixed-income businesses. Morgan enjoys close financial relationships with some of the world's biggest corporations and governments, and its announcement that client activity had slowed reflected the queasiness many are feeling about economic uncertainty here and abroad.
The result of Morgan's announcement was a 4 percent drop in its stock, which helped pull down other bank stocks and contributed to a downturn in the broader market, echoing what happened earlier this week on news that earnings of companies ranging from Coca-Cola to Oracle were hurting because of Asia's economic travails.
One example of the kind of problem facing Morgan can be found in South Korea. The Korea Development Bank, South Korea's largest Government-owned bank, has encountered a lack of investor interest in a $2 billion bond offering by the bank because of the country's severe financial troubles. If that bank is forced to postpone the offering it would hurt Morgan, which is managing the sale.
There had been speculation recently among bankers that Morgan might be exposed to heavy losses on a $600 million loan related to a large investment by Enersis S.A., a Chilean utility that is the largest privately owned electricity company in Latin America, in another Chilean utility, Endesa S.A. Banking sources said this was not a factor in Morgan's announcement and that losses from the loan, while significant, were not expected to be material. Morgan and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation are by far the most active trading houses among America's big banks, and the performance of both can be a barometer of market sentiment overseas. Bankers Trust declined to comment on its trading business.
Trading-related assets make up about 72 percent of Morgan's balance sheet, which gives the company a profile more like an investment bank than a commercial bank. It also means the bank's results can be more volatile than those of its more staid peers.
"This seems to happen every now and then at J. P. Morgan and it's in the nature of their business -- it's not a breakdown in risk management," said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "We've yet to hear from Bankers Trust, but I expect to see a weak fourth quarter there."
Trading accounted for 40 percent of Morgan's revenue and 30 percent of Bankers Trust's revenue during the first nine months of this year. In comparison, trading accounted for 15 percent of Chase's revenue, 10 percent of Citicorp's, and 8 percent of the BankAmerica Corporation's over the same period. Chase and Citicorp declined to comment on whether they were seeing a softening in client activity or their own trading revenue.
But at a conference in New York on Tuesday, Chase's chairman and chief executive, Walter V. Shipley, told analysts that the bank's trading revenues stabilized in November after a disastrous October. In an interview yesterday, a BankAmerica spokesman said the bank's trading operation was profitable in October and November, but below what it had earned in previous months.
Big bank stocks swooned yesterday. Morgan's shares plummeted $5, to $117.875; Bankers Trust dropped $1.625, to $127.5625; Chase fell $3.625, to $112.25; Citicorp fell $5.875, to $132, and BankAmerica fell $2.3125 to $78.50, all in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts had been expecting Morgan to earn $1.97 in the fourth quarter according to consensus estimates gathered by First Call, which analyzes Wall Street earnings predictions. But Morgan's unpredictable trading operation caused the range of fourth-quarter estimates to run from $1.70 to $2.16. Analysts are expected to significantly reduce fourth-quarter earnings estimates in light of Morgan's announcement.
While Morgan's problems are in the fixed-income and equity derivatives businesses, fixed-income is a more important part of its business. In the third quarter, Morgan had $416 million in fixed-income revenue and only $51 million in revenue from equity derivatives.
Morgan displayed confidence in its prospects yesterday, despite the market's doubts. The company said that it would increase its quarterly dividend to 95 cents a share from 88 cents, and that its board had approved the buyback of as many as seven million shares of its stock.

Martinez's $75 Million For 6 Years Raises Bar

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Greg Maddux's run as the player with the highest salary in baseball history ended yesterday after only four months. The new No. 1 is Pedro Martinez, who won the National League Cy Young award a month ago, then was traded by Montreal a week later, another player whose pay level was getting too rich for the Expos.
Martinez reached agreement with the Boston Red Sox yesterday on a six-year contract for $75 million. The average annual value of $12.5 million exceeds by $1 million the average of the five-year contract Maddux agreed to with the Atlanta Braves last Aug. 10. 
 The total value of the Martinez contract falls just short of the highest total of $80,662,000, which Frank Thomas agreed to for nine years with the Chicago White Sox. But as astronomical as the Martinez figures are generally, perhaps most remarkable is the salary he will have in 2004 if the Red Sox exercise their option for a seventh season.
It will be $17.5 million.
"And the guy doesn't even have a good jump shot," one baseball lawyer said, alluding to the similarity between Martinez's contract and those that have proliferated in the National Basketball Association.
However it is measured, it is a stunning deal for Martinez, a 26-year-old right-handed pitcher from the Dominican Republic, and it comes at a time of bizarre economics for baseball. On one hand, clubs are paying inflated salaries for free agents, like $35 million over five years for Wilson Alvarez by the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays; on the other, the Florida Marlins are dismantling their World Series championship team because they want to halve their payroll.
Martinez was not a free agent, but he could have been one after next season, and the Red Sox gambled when they traded a highly prized minor league pitcher for him. But the Red Sox were also intent on retaining Martinez as a way of signaling to their players and fans that they are serious about winning.
The Red Sox did not acknowledge that the deal was done. Kevin Shea, the club's communications director, quoted General Manager Dan Duquette as saying he was still working on the deal and "hopes it will be finalized in due time." Duquette had been scheduled to travel to the Dominican Republic yesterday, but Shea said he changed plans and did not go. "But I don't know where he is," Shea said.
Jim Bronner, who with Bob Gilhooley represents the pitcher, declined to comment on the contract.
News of the deal initially came from Martinez himself. He revealed it in the Dominican, telling Radio Universal in an interview, "I'm a little ashamed to say how much I signed for."
Martinez, who earned $3,615,000 this year, said the contract included two option years, but the lawyer who knew about it said it had only one option year that called for a $17.5 million salary or a $2.5 million buyout, which is part of the $75 million guaranteed. If the Red Sox pick up the option, the deal will become a seven-year contract for $90 million.
Martinez is one of three brothers who pitch professionally. His older brother, Ramon, plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and his younger brother, Jesus, was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the expansion draft, then traded to the Marlins for center fielder Devon White.
"I thank God that I was chosen to show the people that with effort, they can do anything," Martinez said in the Dominican interview. "I come from a world of much poverty."
When Maddux signed his five-year, $57.5 million contract, he had won four Cy Young awards as the best pitcher in the National League in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995. Martinez won his first Cy Young award last month after a season in which he compiled a seemingly modest 17-8 record but led the league with a 1.90 earned run average, 13 complete games, an opponents' .184 batting average, 8.73 base runners per nine innings and 11.4 strikeouts per nine innings (305 total).
The difference between Martinez's earned run average and the e.r.a. for the rest of the league last season was 2.33, the fourth biggest differential since World War II.

HEADLINE: Swiss Bank Says Big Merger Won't Affect Stamford Office

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
When United Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation announced a merger on Monday, forming the world's second-largest bank, the news shook not only Wall Street, but also Stamford, Conn., where the corporation recently opened a $200 million main office for North American operations.
Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said he received several faxes from Swiss Bank the day the merger was announced, stating that the deal "was not envisioned to mean any significant changes for Stamford." 
 He also said that the merger, along with Swiss Bank's recent expansion -- it recently absorbed Dillon, Read, a Wall Street investment bank -- may mean that the bank may exercise its option to build another one million square feet of office space at the 563,000-square-foot complex.
"We see upside potential," Mr. Malloy said, sounding more like a stockbroker than a politician.
That bullishness is echoed, cautiously, by bank officials. Matthias Beckmann, a senior press officer, said no decision had been made on the location of the principal office for North American operations for the newly merged bank, which will have its worldwide headquarters in Zurich and, perhaps, Basel. But the logical place for its principal North American office -- the bank does not call it a headquarters -- would be in Stamford, in southwestern Connecticut, an hour from mid-Manhattan, he said.
"Clearly, we want to grow in the United States, and Stamford is the place to grow," Mr. Beckmann said, adding that the bank has built a new high-technology trading floor, the size of a football field, on top of a parking garage next to the 13-story structure, which sits next to the Stamford train station.
Though it seems unlikely, any moves by the bank to reduce its staff in Stamford, or, worse, abandon plans to move its main operations there would represent a severe blow to the city's economy and prestige. The Swiss bank's plans for the city have already sparked a mini-boomlet in the real estate market in the area, as bankers and traders hunt for housing en masse.
When bank officials announced that they were moving from New York City to Connecticut in 1994, it was a coup for Connecticut, but it also ignited controversy, since the state had lured the bank by granting huge tax credits -- $120 million over 10 years, $60,000 for each worker -- tied to how many people it employed in Stamford. Already, though, the bank, which opened last month, has met its obligation to garner the maximum amount of tax credits. It has moved 1,800 employees to the new location and another 400 are expected to move in over the weekend.
Under the agreement with the state, if the bank employs 2,000 people, it will receive a 50 percent credit. The bank could even receive another 25 percent tax break after 10 years if employment levels rise to 3,000.
Still, Swiss Bank and United Bank employ almost 6,000 people in the United States. And the combined bank, second in the world only to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, has said that it intends to cut its global work force by about 25 percent over several years, as many as 13,000 people, to 43,000. Those cuts are expected to include 7,000 jobs in Switzerland and 6,000 elsewhere in the world. Analysts have speculated that more than 2,000 jobs in New York City and Stamford might be eliminated as the companies consolidate.

HEADLINE: Stocks Drop a 3d Day as Dow Falls 70.87

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market was rattled for a third consecutive session yesterday after investors got fresh reminders that the turmoil in Asia could dampen corporate profits.
Technology shares continued to plummet after the Oracle Corporation's huge slide on Tuesday, a day after the company reported disappointing earnings. And yesterday, shares of J. P. Morgan, one of the nation's largest banks, fell 5 points, to 117 7/8, after the company said that it expected its earnings to be hurt by the crisis in Asia. 
 "There's this worry that the financial problems in Asia are going to extend further," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "And until investors become comfortable that the Asian situation is not explosive, the market will have trouble."
Those festering concerns helped drag all the major stock indexes lower yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average -- which fell as much as 126 points late in the day -- closed down 70.87 points, to 7,978.79. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 5.99, to 969.79.
But technology shares took the brunt of the selling. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 23.94, to 1,596.61, and the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index dropped 6.70, to 295.52.
Among the worst hit were I.B.M., which fell 3 7/8, to 106 1/2; Cisco, down 2 1/16, to 85 3/8, and Microsoft, which lost 2 1/16, to 142 1/4.
Oracle, which fell 9 7/16 Tuesday, rose 1/2, to 23 7/16.
Wall Street analysts contend that investors are once again punishing an entire sector for the sins of a few companies.
"They're extrapolating that this is endemic to the whole sector," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. "Then the financial numbers come out and they're pretty good. That's the pattern."
But even Mr. Cripps concedes that the technology sector may be more liable to suffer from weakening demand for computer parts in Asia. Yesterday, for instance, one analyst lowered his estimate for the computer maker Compaq and shares fell 3 3/8, to 60.
Despite yesterday's setbacks, though, stock market indexes are up near record levels, and the possibility of merger and acquisition activity continues to drive certain issues.
For instance, shares of Hambrecht & Quist -- the investment bank that specializes in technology stocks -- fell 3 13/16, to 38 3/4, after reports that the firm is no longer in talks to be acquired by Merrill Lynch.
Meanwhile, shares of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette soared about 5 percent, or 4 1/8, to 87 5/8, on heavy volume after reports that Chase Manhattan Bank might acquire the brokerage firm.
In the broader market, however, the selloff of the last three days might be simply a sign that investors are pausing after a huge surge in buying in the last six weeks.
After slipping as low as 7,161.15 on Oct. 27, the Dow soared nearly 14 percent before tumbling this week. Some analysts call this an "overbought" market, a period when investors accumulate stocks so rapidly that there is bound to be a brief selloff, or a temporary lull in buying.
"The market had a pretty good run from the October lows to the recent highs," said Richard McCabe, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. "The market had gotten a little overbought, so the least bit of worrisome news was seized upon."
Indeed, many analysts believe that the market setback is temporary, and that the economy and prospects for profits remain robust.
"There will be an impact, and we could see a modest adjustment in corporate growth, but not enough to derail the expanding economy or this bull market," said Mary Farrell, senior investment strategist at Paine Webber. "We're a global economy, and we can withstand some weakness in one part of the globe as long as you have strength in other parts."

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Journal;
Cemetery to the Stars Wins a Court Reprieve

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 10

 BODY:
In the sunken gardens and weather-beaten marble mausoleums of Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, the ghosts of the great ones linger: Cecil B. DeMille, Tyrone Power, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and even Mel Blanc, the inimitable voice of Porky Pig, whose headstone proclaims with wry finality, "That's All Folks."
But the 100-year-old cemetery in the heart of old Hollywood, so close to the backlot of Paramount Studios that the brownstone facades of its "New York street" peep over the rear wall, fell into bankruptcy nearly two years ago, a casualty of aging and inattentive owners. Buildings shaken by the 1994 Northridge earthquake went unrepaired, broken stained-glass windows went unreplaced and water seeped into crypts in the shadow of the famous Hollywood sign. 
 Things got so bad that the State of California even revoked the cemetery's license to sell its remaining plots, and no buyers wanted the headaches of fixing the place. The only bidder at a public auction last month offered just over half the $500,000 asking price of the bank that holds the mortgage, and a court-appointed trustee sought permission to padlock the gates and abandon the graves to the fates.
But today, at a hearing in Federal Bankruptcy Court that could have been directed by Frank Capra (who is not buried at Hollywood Memorial), a new buyer stepped forward and a Hollywood ending seemed all but assured. Judge Thomas B. Donovan approved the sale of the cemetery for $375,000 to Callanan Mortuary, an 85-year-old local Hollywood funeral home whose owners vowed to take good care of the legacy.
"This thing has years of deferred maintenance," said Thomas McDonald, who works in the business run by his wife, Eileen Callanan, who inherited it from her father. "We're very pleased at all the community support."
Indeed, local officials including City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, had rallied in recent weeks to try to stave off the worst, trying to get help from nonprofit groups or the Hollywood studios whose former titans are buried in the cemetery, along with Hollywood's favorite mobster, Ben (Bugsy) Siegel. There was talk, but no action.
"There has been some openness to trying to step in and help out," said Roxana Tynan, the Councilwoman's deputy for economic development, "but it really required that every other option be exhausted."
The new owners still have their work cut out for them, and the sale is contingent on a satisfactory inspection of the cemetery's books, buildings and soil, where fuel tanks from an unused crematorium must be removed.
Some state historic preservation money may be available to restore vintage buildings, and a $2.5 million maintenance endowment generates more than $150,000 a year in income that can be used on upkeep, but that is barely enough to get by.
The reflecting pool in front of Fairbanks's tomb, where the silent-screen swashbuckler's profile appears in bronze bas-relief, is muddy and stagnant and waterlilies struggle to grow. A couple of stands of bedraggled begonias surround the white marble bench that doubles as Tyrone Power's headstone, engraved, like Fairbanks's, with the "Good night, sweet prince" soliloquy from "Hamlet."
Yet unlike the other great Hollywood celebrities' cemetery, Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, where the Great Mausoleum is guarded and off-limits to the merely curious, Hollywood Memorial is open daily, and tourists armed with a free map available at the gate can trace the footsteps of the mysterious "Lady in Black" who used to leave a single flower in the bronze vase beside Valentino's crypt, No. 1205 in the grand Cathedral Mausoleum by the lake. Across the hall, a bronze plaque marks the crypt of Peter Finch, "distinguished actor, loving husband and father."
"Nine million tourists come to Hollywood each year because they want to experience the place where movie stars lived and worked and played and died," said Leron Gubler, the executive director of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. "This is the real thing, this is our heritage, this is history."
But state law prohibits charging admission at cemeteries, so it is difficult to make money by exploiting this particular kind of history, though Mr. Gubler and others said the new owners could probably charge for maps, or for memorabilia or some kind of interpretative program for visitors.
In the short term, the sale is some comfort to family members of those buried in the cemetery, where in recent years scores of Russian and Armenian emigres and gay men killed by AIDS have joined stars like Janet Gaynor, who won the first Academy Award for best actress, in 1927. At the hearing today, Judge Donovan stretched protocol to let several family members speak town-meeting style, including Louise Haines, 80, who buried her husband of 60 years, Bernard, at Hollywood Memorial when he died at 87 in October.
Mrs. Haines said she went to her husband's crypt in a rainstorm last weekend, only to see water pouring in from a leaky roof "like a waterfall."
"What a terrible thing to have to see," she said.

The sale is contingent on a satisfactory inspection of the cemetery's books, buildings and soil, where fuel tanks from an unused crematorium must be removed.

HEADLINE: Dominican Sex Scandal Mars Big League Dreams

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
Over the past 25 years, this sugar mill town of 85,000 people has been one of the most prolific producers of major league baseball players in the world. Although a billboard at the edge of town boasts this is "the cradle of shortstops," all-star outfielders and pitchers have also been manufactured here -- some 100 players in all.
But now scandal threatens to disrupt that pipeline to the big leagues. 
 In a case that has provoked anger throughout this impoverished, baseball-crazed Caribbean nation of eight million people, Luis Rosa, who has scouted in Latin America for the San Francisco Giants and other teams, has been imprisoned on charges he demanded sex from 15 young minor league players here as a condition for playing time. (No major leaguers have made any accusations.) Mr. Rosa has also been charged with embezzling part of the players' signing bonuses and salaries.
"Like most players here, all of us come from poor, humble families, and dream of getting to the big leagues, or at least the United States, so that our parents and siblings can have a better life," said Yan Carlos Ravelo, a 20-year-old right-handed pitcher who filed the initial criminal complaint in June. "Luis Rosa took advantage of our poverty and our desperation for an American visa to make us his slaves."
In a country where the code of machismo prevails and homosexuality is still regarded with revulsion, the players' accounts of sexual abuse and harassment have prompted demands that Juan Marichal, the Hall of Fame pitcher and former Giants star who is now the Government's Secretary of Sports and Recreation, impose more control and supervision over players' signing and training.
That the Giants, of all teams, find themselves at the center of the case has added to the sense of betrayal. (Mr. Rosa has also scouted for the Seattle Mariners, the San Diego Padres, the Chicago Cubs and the Texas Rangers.)
"This is a team with a long and respected tradition in our country," Juan Ortiz, the Dominican Republic's commissioner of baseball, said in an interview. "This is not some new expansion team. This is the team that signed Ozzie Virgil, the first Dominican to play in the big leagues, and took the three Alou brothers and Juan Marichal to the major leagues."
The Alou brothers, Felipe, Matty and Jesus, were star outfielders in the 1960's and 1970's. Felipe Alou is now manager of the Montreal Expos and his son Moises played a leading role in the 1997 World Series.
In the quiet world of baseball scouts, Luis Rosa was just as much a star. In a career that has spanned two decades, he has signed so many of baseball's best Latin American players, among them Roberto and Sandy Alomar, Juan Gonzalez, Ivan Rodriguez, Benito Santiago, Wilson Alvarez and Ozzie Guillen, that, he boasts, "if you put them all together, they would make one hell of an all-star team."
Interviewed in the jail cell here where he has been held since late October, Mr. Rosa, 51, denied any wrongdoing and said he was being made "a scapegoat" both by the Giants and his former players. He attributed their accusations to a desire for revenge, set off by inadequate performances on the diamond.
"They just didn't cut it, and I had to let them go," said Mr. Rosa, an American citizen who came here voluntarily from Puerto Rico to defend himself. "Now they have been recruited by a group of unscrupulous lawyers to defame my name and destroy my career in what is nothing more than an extortion plot."
Two of the original 15 complainants, Gabriel MacDonald and Miguel Mota, have retracted their accusations. Sitting at Mr. Rosa's side, Mr. MacDonald, a 20-year-old center fielder, described himself as so poor and confused after his release, the death of his mother and the birth of a son that he invented the story in hopes of making some money.
But in a sworn statement to Dominican prosecutors, the former major league star Joaquin Andujar, a San Pedro de Macoris native who was pitching coach for the Giants development team Mr. Rosa managed during the 1996 season, contradicted that version of events.
"One of them told me he couldn't get to pitch because Luis Rosa had said that unless they went to bed together he wouldn't be allowed to take the mound," Mr. Andujar testified under oath.
Mr. MacDonald, he said, "told me that Luis Rosa had said that unless he went to bed with him, not only would he never get to play, he would not be allowed to travel to the United States."
No trial date has yet been set for Mr. Rosa. Each count of sexual harassment carries a maximum prison term of two years and each charge of embezzlement can result in a 10-year sentence.
Like many other major league organizations, the Giants maintain a farm team and training complex here. Players are scouted as early as 12, signed to contracts at 16, given three years to polish their skills and then, if deemed promising, granted a visa to play in the United States.
For the players who do not make the cut, the alternatives are few. The Giants' complex here adjoins a sugar mill called El Porvenir, or The Future, serving as a constant reminder that if they fail to make it to the big leagues, their destiny is a lifetime of menial labor.
On a visit here in late October, Jack Bair, the Giants' general counsel, issued a statement saying the team had begun its own internal investigation into the players' accusations. In a telephone interview from San Francisco, he declined to discuss that inquiry's findings, saying it would be "inappropriate to comment while judicial authorities in the Dominican Republic are processing the allegations."
Belkys Nataniel, a lawyer for several players, said she planned to file civil suits against the team both here and in the United States, since "the Giants are responsible for the conduct of their employees, and Luis Rosa was not just an ordinary employee, he was the boss." Mr. Bair, however, argued that since "Mr. Rosa and the players are in the Dominican Republic and a case has already been filed there, in our view that appears to be the appropriate venue."
Law enforcement and baseball officials here said they could recall no other instance in which a manager was accused of sexually molesting his players. But they described financial abuses, like overstating the bonus prospects are paid and pocketing the difference, as widespread.
"The majority of the scouts have their hands in the cookie jar, and I can't blame them, since most teams are trying to do things on the cheap," said Mr. Virgil, who succeeded Mr. Rosa as manager of the Giants' farm team here. "The organizations should get wise and hire good people and treat them right, so scouts don't think they have to steal equipment and sell visas to make money."
A lot of scouts here, Mr. Virgil added, no longer even bother to go out to the sugar mill settlements that have traditionally been the richest source of players. Instead, they rely on so-called buscones, freelance "searchers" who scour the bushes for prospects, sign them to personal service contracts and then auction them off to the highest bidder, taking a percentage of the player's small signing bonus as payment.
Mr. Marichal did not respond to repeated phone calls seeking an interview, but Mr. Ortiz, the Dominican baseball commissioner, said that as a result of the Rosa case he is once again pressing major league baseball to require all contracts signed in the Dominican Republic to be registered with his office. That would cut down on financial chicanery, he said.
Yet even as irregularities are investigated and the court case drags on, the hunger to reach the big leagues continues unabated. On a scorching Saturday afternoon this fall, dozens of young boys, part of the 20-team youth league that Rafael Mercedes Castro has run here since 1976, were enthusiastically practicing their fielding and hitting. Boys begin playing at 5, and by their teens the best of them are being monitored by local scouts for major league teams.
But the hunt is driven by more than the ample size of the talent pool here. Unlike American players, Dominicans are not subject to the baseball draft, which means any team that finds a promising player can sign him to a contract, usually at a bargain price.
"When the Orioles signed me in 1989, I got a $3,000 bonus," said Manny Alexander, the former Mets shortstop who was traded to the Cubs late in the 1997 season. "If I had been born in the United States, I would have been a first- or second-round draft choice, and they would have had to pay me $200,000."
Prospects here accept that arrangement not only because they have no choice but also because they dream of a big payoff down the line. Every family in town knows that Sammy Sosa, a native son, signed a five-year, $42 million contract with the Cubs earlier this year.
"Look at that kid over there," Mr. Sosa said, pointing to a shoeshine boy as he led a visitor on a tour of 30-30 Plaza, a shopping mall he has built here as an investment. "Fifteen years ago, that was me. I shined shoes and washed cars but I knew that baseball was the only way I was going to be able to lift my family from poverty."
Recently, even unproven players here have begun to wrest bonuses equal to those of American players. After a bidding war with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Baltimore Orioles, the Toronto Blue Jays this year signed a 16-year-old shortstop named Josean Bernhardt for $1.1 million.
As a result, "now even middle-class parents who used to urge their sons to become lawyers or architects are coming to me," Mr. Mercedes said. "Everyone knows that nothing in this country changes your economic situation as quickly as baseball."

HEADLINE: Last Laugh for the Philippines;
Onetime Joke Economy Avoids Much of Asia's Turmoil

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
Christmas roars into the Philippines with sacks of red ribbons and plastic fir trees festooned in frosted and sequined glass bulbs. Streets are lathered in glowing stars, six-foot candles and light displays of Santa's sleigh dashing through the tropical humidity.
Determined not to be left out, the central bank on Roxas Boulevard has draped its office block in a lighted display of its own: four mammoth line charts tracking the country's inflation, foreign exchange reserves, economic growth and the rate on 91-day Treasury bills. 
 Merry Christmas.
Indeed, in the Philippines, long regarded as a comedic, boisterously democratic laggard, the turmoil afflicting other Asian economies has left many people feeling a bit merrier than usual at this time of year. The thunder of collapsing banks and the cracking of economic hubris elsewhere are even making Filipinos a bit smug.
The Philippines has been hit by a fall in its own currency and stock market in recent months, yet it has not experienced the more damaging banking and real estate chaos that has afflicted other countries in East Asia.
Unlike Bangkok and Jakarta, where cranes stand frozen over dozens of abandoned building sites, Manila is a hive of construction; with occupancy rates in the business districts at 98 to 99 percent, the thirst for new buildings remains strong. And while Bangkok's projected light-rail line is just a procession of silent concrete pillars, workers swarm over the site of Manila's new overhead light-rail line, work that has turned one of the city's main arteries, Edsa Boulevard, into a monumental traffic jam.
The Philippines has proved the exception mainly because it has not tried to leap ahead as suddenly as its neighbors, taking a conservative tack at least partly mandated by the International Monetary Fund.
"There's a bit of truth to the case of the turtle and the hare," laughed Washington SyCip, the 75-year-old founder of SGV Group, the country's largest insurance conglomerate, and widely regarded as the dean of the country's financial sector. By moving slowly, he said, the nation did not "make all the mistakes of our neighbors."
Foreign investors, rather than shying away in alarm, as they have elsewhere in the region, are still coming in. Acer, Taiwan's largest computer maker, is building a huge manufacturing center at Subic Bay. Intel, already the country's largest exporter, is expanding its production. And Seagate, an American maker of hard-disk drives, is planning to open a plant here.
Indeed, while countries across Asia, from Thailand to Indonesia to South Korea, are begging the I.M.F. to rescue them, the Philippines is toying with the notion of leaving I.M.F. supervision this month after 34 years, having successfully met the fund's targets for economic stability.
"We learned our lessons much earlier, and the past five years have been a time of resolute and pervasive correction and reform," President Fidel Ramos said during a visit to the United States last month. "In the Philippines, we have felt the lash of the turmoil, although we have not been guilty of the mistakes" made by other Asian countries.
"The Philippines," Mr. Ramos argued, "has passed third base and is heading for home plate, meaning an exit from our I.M.F. program."
In a sense, it hardly matters whether Manila leaves fund supervision; the mere discussion of such a step sets the country apart from its neighbors and provides evidence of an economy distinctly better off than the savaged economies nearby.
 Indeed, the Philippine central bank announced on Wednesday that its economy is stable enough to allow it to cut its key overnight borrowing rate to 11 percent, the lowest level since the currency turmoil began sweeping through the region in July.
In some ways. to be sure, the Philippines has mimicked the problems that have sparked the Asian crisis. The peso has plunged nearly 30 percent in value, and the Manila stock market, perhaps because many outsiders fail to distinguish it from its neighbors, has tumbled about 35 percent since July.
But the Philippines has resisted the impulse to erect the world's tallest building, to make a "national" car (while imposing high tariffs on competitors), to build a "national" airplane or to create a new capital. In short, it has eschewed the hubris that has infected many Asian tigers.
"We've gotten away from trying to devise a national car, or steel plant, or an aircraft industry," argued Victor S. Limlingan, a senior professor at the Asian Institute of Management, a leading business school. "We have liberalized the economy. There are virtually no tariff protections. What's saving us is the liberalization program. Growth has spread out."
Decades of I.M.F. supervision have, virtually all economists concur, set the country's economy firmly on rails leading to steady but unostentatious growth. In the last six years, under President Ramos, the Government has divested itself of everything from the national airline to electric power systems, banks to water supplies -- or is in the process of doing so. The Government's budget is in surplus, and sweeping reforms that would simplify the tax code while increasing revenues are on the brink of passage. And unlike Thailand, where banks are straining under a rate of bad loans over 20 percent, Philippine banks boast a rate of only 3.4 percent.
"We are more conservative fiscally," said Jose Antonio League, an official of the World Bank in Manila. "Monetary policy wasn't too bold. And the structure of the economy is not like Thailand, for example, which borrowed huge amounts externally."
Matthew S. Sutherland, head of Philippine research at Paribas Asia Equity, added: "I don't think we have the systemic problems of the rest of Asia. The property sector is not overblown; banking is not in trouble; there has not been a lot of borrowing in U.S. dollars. We don't need three years of a tighter belt and severe austerity."
After the collapse of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, a lot of the flagrant cronyism and corruption he nurtured died as well. And though corruption still exists, the privatization of much of the economy and an increasing openness in economic decision-making have wiped out a fair amount of the cronyism in business and government.
In part, it is from the factories of people like Victoria Reyes that the Philippines is drawing its strength. From a desire to earn enough to carpet her house, Ms. Reyes built a large textile business, Remerco Garments Manufacturing Inc., which at its height employed more than 800 people. And all her production was exported.
North and east of Manila, in Quezon City, in what used to be rice paddies and is now a warren of cement-block-walled factory compounds, Ms. Reyes and her children live and work on land that has been in the family for generations. Under a corrugated roof, with the walls open to the languid humidity of the tropics, 250 women hunch over Taiwan-made sewing machines churning out Chicago Bulls jackets, children's dresses, multicolored flannel jackets and denim children's pants.
"Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka are our big competitors," Ms. Reyes said. "Of course China is big, too. In 1980, with China taking off, our European buyers dropped us like a sack of potatoes. But when they didn't get deliveries they came crawling back. I said no." In those days, the waning days of Marcos's martial law regime, days when the country's economy was stagnant, Ms. Reyes was one of the top 10 exporters in the Philippines.
A strike by workers in 1990 almost destroyed the business, and even Ms. Reyes acknowledged that she shared some blame. "Our pride got the better of us," she confessed. But by 1995, she was back, buoyed by the firm support of her two major American buyers and a Hong Kong garment house. Today, she said, "it's a big small operation."
The operation is more efficient than ever. "We're doing production levels we had with 600 people," she said. Still, as at all businesses in the Philippines, the falling peso and often usurious interest rates have required fast footwork. "We had about a $1 million loan in pesos," explained her son, Rufino A. Reyes Jr., the company's vice president. "Loan interest was 30 percent. It was too much for us to pay. I went to the bank and said I wanted to swap the peso loan to a dollar loan, since all our income is in dollars. So they did, and the interest rate is now 11 percent -- still high, but we can make it."
With $7 million to $8 million in sales, Remerco is relatively small next to the electronics giants -- electronics constitute about 51 percent of the total exports of the Philippines -- and competition remains fierce throughout the region. "Right now we're banking on our long-term relationship with our buyers," Mr. Reyes said. "But we have to be realistic that competition will be more."
And with companies from Remerco to Intel expanding, Philippine exports have climbed more than 25 percent in the last year. Many analysts expect foreign and domestic investment to continue to grow.
"A lot is going on in industrial zones," said Jose Mario I. Cuyegkeng, research director at ING Baring Securities. "And while we have one of the highest wages in the region, we have the higher productivity. Many people here speak English, and we have one of the cheapest middle-management salary structures anywhere."
For companies with domestic markets, things are likely to be tougher in the coming year. One tile maker, who insisted on anonymity, explained that with domestic business loan rates so high, he would have to put off his expansion plans for a while.
There are already signs that consumer spending is waning. The most recent data available indicate that sales of many larger items began to fall in July, particularly televisions, fans and washing machines.
Even so, Roberto C. Benares, who runs a small investment bank here, the Asian Alliance Investment Corporation, said that while he foresaw more mergers and acquisitions as some companies faced difficulties (there have been almost no initial public offerings on the Manila exchange since July), he remained confident that the country's fundamentals and its corporate base were sound. "If you look at the property groups, they're slowing down a bit," he said. "But they will survive. The banking sector is going to be O.K. They have been through so many troughs, they're overcautious, unlike Thai banks. Everybody is still upbeat."
Most frustrating, said Mr. SyCip of SGV, is the tendency of bankers and investors outside Asia to lump the region into one pot. "All countries in the region do have problems," he said, "but not serious enough for 50 percent declines in stock markets -- except for Thailand. Here, building is still going on. Our banking system is much more transparent. Our export figures are comfortably up, and a lot of plants are coming on line. It's a failure to distinguish one country from another."

Economists expect economic growth to slow next year all across Asia as a wave of financial crises take their toll. But the Philippines stands to suffer less distress and sustain growth better than its neighbors.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Many Proud South Koreans Resent Bailout From Abroad

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Kim Bong So stood beside his pushcart, occasionally stirring his wok, fretting that the economic crisis here is so severe that customers are unwilling to pay even for a cup of his crunchy silkworm larvae.
But Mr. Kim's main concern was not his personal difficulties making a sale. Rather, it was the International Monetary Fund's $57 billion bailout of South Korea last week. 
 "It's a national humiliation," said Mr. Kim, shaking his head morosely. He compared the rescue to Japan's seizure and occupation of Korea early in this century, and he added, "I feel so ashamed."
These days Mr. Kim has plenty of company. Many Koreans now refer to Dec. 3, the day the I.M.F. accord was reached, as a "National Humiliation Day." Some refer to the aid package as the "Second National Disgrace," after the Japanese colonization.
Of course, not everyone feels quite so humiliated or accepts the parallel with the Japanese occupation, which lasted from 1905 to 1945.
But Korea is as proud and prickly a nation as any on the globe. For an over-achiever and A-plus student like South Korea to be sent to the corner with what feels like a dunce cap is a torture more psychological than economic, and the heartbreak here on the frosty streets of Seoul is almost palpable.
This sense of humiliation may have far-reaching consequences, shaping the presidential elections later this month and profoundly affecting -- and perhaps upsetting -- diplomatic and economic ties with the United States and Japan. Already there is a deep anger in South Korea at Washington because of the conditions imposed as part of the bail-out.
"It's quite possible that next year we will experience growing anti-American sentiment," reflected Hyun Hong Choo, a former South Korean Ambassador to the United States. "The U.S. -- whether Government, industry or the people -- might make a very convenient target. That's what I worry about for next year, unless it's addressed by the political leadership."
Americans may find it puzzling that they should contribute their tax dollars to rescuing South Koreans and be blamed for it. To be sure, there is also gratitude for the American assistance, but it is often mixed with resentment and a profound irritability that arises from the embarrassment at being broke.
"I'm angry at the American and Japanese demands," complained Kim Soon Hwa, a 53-year-old woman selling hot coffee from a cart in a street market in Seoul. "If you really want to help us, don't make us buy your things. Just buy our things."
Mrs. Kim, who for all her anger was as sweet as the sugary coffee she urged on a visitor, reflected the anxiety about what is often described here as the "loss of economic sovereignty." In particular, the I.M.F. effectively forced South Korea, as a condition of the aid, to admit foreign banks and allow the import of Japanese goods that had been banned.
"Of course we feel angry," said Lee Eun Jung, a 21-year-old political science student at Ewha Women's University. "Even if the I.M.F. is an international organization, everybody knows it's run by the U.S. and the U.S. is using it for its own interests."
To the West, these conditions simply mean that South Korea will play by the rules of the international game, but here there is profound unease at the control that will be lost -- an echo of the angst that many Americans felt in the mid-1980's when Japanese companies started buying banks and properties in the United States.
"We won't have the chance to express our own opinions, to decide our own affairs," complained Yun Hye Yon, a 26-year-old sales clerk, as she mused that the I.M.F. monitoring will be like the Japanese occupation. "We've opened the road for foreigners to come in and impose their own culture on us, to exercise administration over us."
In most of Asia the anxiety has been focused on personal fears about unemployment, tumbling stock prices, lost savings. In South Korea, the sense of injury encompasses all that but is centered on something broader and vaguer -- the sting to national honor, the fear that Korea itself has lost face before the world.
"We look foolish, right?" asked Lee Hye Ok, 37, a manager of a vase shop. "So I feel especially embarrassed in front of the Japanese people, because I have many Japanese customers."
Mrs. Lee was asked if her Japanese customers now look down on her because of the bail-out. She paused for a long time, looked down, and nodded.
The passionate sense of Korean national identity perhaps arises from the nation's long history in a rough neighborhood dominated by China on one side and Japan on the other. If Koreans were not so fiercely concerned with national honor and independence, then Korea would long ago have simply become one more province of China.
Of course, the anger and humiliation are not universally felt. Some merchants note that they borrow money all the time and that it is common for lenders to set conditions.
"I don't think this is a humiliation for Korea," said Bae Ki Sup, 58, a fruit salesman with a cigarette hanging precariously from his lips. "And we can't blame other countries. It's good that they lent the money to us."
Korean newspapers have picked up this debate with vigor. The initial coverage was particularly hostile to the United States and Japan, but in some newspapers that has been tempered in the last few days.
"In the process of obtaining the bail-out loan, Korean pride was wounded, but pain and anger should not explode into unreasonable behavior," warned the Chosun Ilbo, a leading newspaper. "Already an atmosphere of anti-American sentiment has developed over the U.S. Government's alleged involvement in the I.M.F. negotiations. However, most of the current recommendations presented by the U.S. and the I.M.F. are those that we should have accepted when we joined the O.E.C.D. last year." South Korea joined the O.E.C.D., the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of industrialized nations, with a burst of national pride.
While many Koreans are angry at Washington, they tend to be angrier at their own Government. Politicians are calling for economic officials to be investigated and perhaps prosecuted, and many people say those responsible for the economic mess -- perhaps even including President Kim Young Sam -- should go to prison. This is not very likely, but many Koreans seem to find the discussion cathartic.
"Some people have to go to prison," said Ahn Sung Hye, an 18-year-old high school girl. "Like politicians and rich people. On the news I saw how some rich people were hoarding a lot of dollars in their homes when the country didn't have any. Those people should go to jail, too."
One diplomatic risk is that while Koreans are resentful of Americans, the United States may become annoyed at "Buy Korean" campaigns and at the growing nationalist hostility here to foreign luxury products. Many Koreans said that they would scold a friend who purchased expensive imports, although it is difficult to gauge how seriously to take such comments.
Lee In Kyu, 25, a student at Yonsei University, said he would now stop buying foreign candies or other foreign-made gifts for his girlfriend. But his girlfriend, Kim Hyung Sun, 25, seemed less impressed by his patriotism than amused by it.
"Actually, there's no possibility of his getting me a foreign-made gift," she laughed, as he looked on dejectedly. "He never gets me any presents at all."

Seoul Crisis Worsens As More Banks Close
South Korea closed five more banks, accelerated its promised foreign access to domestic stock and bond markets and pledged to infuse money into beleaguered securities companies, but the moves did little to arrest the country's financial crisis.
In a strong sign that investors are losing confidence that the $57 billion I.M.F. rescue package for South Korea will work, the Korean won fell its daily allowable limit for the fourth straight day, raising the possibility that more rescue money may be required. The won is now worth about half what it was against the dollar at the beginning of 1997. And the Korean stock market resumed falling this morning after a gain yesterday. Page D4.
 
South Koreans now regard Dec. 3, the day the I.M.F. accord was reached, as "National Humiliation Day," a telling barometer of the resentment the rescue effort has caused. A1.
 
Asia Problems Hit Stocks Again
Wall Street was rattled for the third consecutive day on fresh reminders that the economic turmoil in Asia could erode corporate profits in this country. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.87 points, to 7,978.79, but the biggest losses were in technology stocks, which are viewed as more vulnerable to Asia's weakness. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 23.94, to 1,596.61, and the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index dropped 6.70, to 295.52. D16.
 
Bond prices advanced for the second straight day on a migration to the safe-haven of Treasuries by investors concerned over Asia's crisis. The gains pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.07 percent from 6.11 percent Tuesday. D23.
 
A $975 million purchase of Corning's housewares business by AEA Investors was scrapped over the buyer's concern about slow sales due to Asia's turmoil. D4.
 
Boston Edison Sells 12 Plants
Boston Edison sold 12 of its 13 power plants to a French-controlled company, Sithe Energies, for $657 million. Boston Edison plans to cut rates by 15 percent for its 650,000 customers, starting in March, when Massachusetts is to open utilities to competition. D2.
 
A Setback to BellSouth Hopes
The Justice Department recommended that the F.C.C. not allow BellSouth to offer long-distance service in Louisiana, another obstacle in the aspirations of the regional Bell telephone companies. D2.
 
Current Account Deficit Widens
The nation's deficit on the current account, the broadest measure of foreign trade, widened 11.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted $42.156 billion in the third quarter. Asia's economic crisis weakened American exports. D2.
 
Japan's current account deficit tripled in October due partly to the yen's decline against the dollar in currency markets. D15.
 
The dollar fell on warnings from Japanese officials they would sell dollars to defend the yen. In New York yesterday the dollar cost 129.28 yen, down from 129.59 Tuesday. D14.
 
Energy Futures Prices Tumble
Crude oil and gasoline futures prices fell almost 3 percent on signs that exports from Iraq could resume by January, just as OPEC increases production. D14.
 
No Moose on Mercedes' Bonnet
In a one-day advertising blitz, Mercedes-Benz proudly announced it had fixed the car maker's new A-Class subcompact so that it now passed the "moose test." The company sought to restore confidence in the bubble-shaped four-seater after test drivers for a Swedish car magazine flipped it over during a high-speed evasion maneuver known as the "moose test." D11.
 
A New Front in Burger War
Burger King keeps trying to chip away at McDonald's fast-food dominance. A few months ago, it was the Big King challenge to the Big Mac. Now Burger King is planning a huge promotion focused on its new french fries. A $70 million advertising campaign will feature Mr. Potato Head as spokesspud. For those unswayed by Mr. Potato Head's charms, Burger King will give away fries. D12.

Won Continues to Plummet Despite Government Efforts

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The Government struggled on Wednesday to stem the free fall of South Korea's currency and prevent a chain reaction of bankruptcies as the country's financial markets moved closer to desperation.
The Finance Ministry suspended the operations of five more banks on Wednesday and accelerated the promised foreign access to the stock and bond markets in a bid to attract overseas capital. The ministry also said it would inject money into beleaguered securities firms. 
 But the moves failed to arrest the decline in the Korean won, which fell its maximum daily limit of 10 percent today -- three minutes after the market opened -- for the fourth consecutive day.
The dollar closed at 1,719.8 won, compared with 1,565.9 at the end of trading on Wednesday. The dollar is now 72 percent stronger against the won than it was a month ago and 104 percent stronger since Jan. 1.
The Korean Stock Exchange's composite index also dropped quickly, falling 5.4 percent in early trading, more than erasing a 3.1 percent gain on Wednesday.
President Kim Young Sam, in a brief televised speech this morning, urged people not to "kneel to despair" and accepted responsibility for the crisis. "Every day I whip myself when I think about the hopelessness felt by heads of families who have lost their jobs and business owners who have gone bankrupt," said Mr. Kim, whose term ends in February.
In a further sign of lost confidence, Moody's Investors' Service downgraded the quality of South Korean bonds and other debt today, saying the country may require more foreign currency than previously thought. The move will raise South Korea's borrowing costs.
The free fall in the currency reflects frantic attempts by Korean banks and corporations to buy dollars with won to pay foreign debts.
But it also showed the $57 billion rescue announced by the International Monetary Fund last week has not calmed anxieties.
Lim Chang Yuel, the Minister of Finance and Economy, publicly called upon Japan and the United States on Tuesday to give some immediate financial assistance. His plea was rebuffed, but there were indications South Korea still might ask Japan for a short-term loan. Analysts say foreign investors and lenders not only lack confidence in the bailout package but also have little faith in the Government's ability to strengthen and liberalize South Korea's financial system.
"The Government really doesn't know how to deal with it themselves," said Kang Tae Hil, deputy general manager of international sales at Daewoo Securities, referring to the plunge of the won.
The big problem is a liquidity squeeze that threatens to create a vicious cycle of bankruptcies. As financial institutions teeter on failure, they are calling in loans to highly indebted corporations, forcing the corporations into bankruptcy. Corporate bankruptcies in turn compound the debt problems of the financial institutions.
On Wednesday, in what was called a financial stabilization package, the Government suspended the operations of five merchant banks, which are smaller than commercial banks and specialize in short-term lending. That brought the total number of suspended merchant banks to 14, nearly half of the 30 nationwide.
Korean officials said that any talk of a financial meltdown was exaggerated and that the mood was not panicky. But in a reflection of the frayed nerves this turmoil has caused, the Government deployed police officers in riot gear outside some of the suspended banks to prevent any disturbances as depositors gathered to withdraw money.
The Government also moved up the greater opening of the stock market to today from next Monday. Foreign investors will now be able to own 50 percent of a Korean company's shares. Until now, the limit has been 7 percent for an individual investor and 26 percent for all foreigners combined.
On Friday, the corporate bond market will be opened to foreigners, who will be allowed to buy up to 30 percent of an issue.
Both moves are designed to attract foreign capital. Foreign investors must buy won with dollars to invest in the market.
It is unclear whether foreign investors will plunge into the market. Nevertheless, analysts said some investors were probably willing to gamble that the won would rise and that some blue-chip stocks might be bargains.
A South Korean Finance Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Seoul might ask the Japanese Government for a bridge loan that would be repaid when Seoul received its next installment of money from the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: Japan Rivalry Puts Banking Plan in Limbo

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The Japanese Government seems committed to bolstering the nation's ailing financial system with public funds, but a mystery is intensifying over precisely how such money would be used.
A proposal to raise money for a financial-stabilization package by issuing 10 trillion yen in Government bonds -- hailed on Tuesday by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and the stock market as a potential solution -- foundered today. 
 It ran into problems on hints that the money raised -- currently equivalent to $77.5 billion -- might not go entirely to strengthening weak banks and other financial institutions. Lawmakers said that some of the funds might help finance a tax cut or some other economic stimulant, a contradiction of Government vows not to use deficit financing to cure Japan's economic problems.
In an editorial here today, a leading daily, Asahi Shimbun, called the plan "a sham."
And the Nikkei 225-stock index, which reflected investor approval of the idea on Tuesday with a 3.4 percent jump, retreated 1.25 percent today as signs increased that the plan was faltering. The slide continued Thursday, with the Nikkei index dropping an additional 298.30 points, or 1.8 percent, by early afternoon, to 16,179.82.
Further adding to uncertainty was the Government's vagueness over when it might announce a formal program for strengthening the banking system. The Finance Ministry hinted recently that the plan would be set forth as early as today, along with a broader design for invigorating the economy. Now it is unclear when either will be announced.
The proposal for bolstering the banks seems to have been caught up in political rivalry between Seiroku Kajiyama, its champion and a leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and Koichi Kato, the party's powerful General Secretary and a strict proponent of fiscal austerity.
"Mr. Hashimoto and others jumped on this plan without the usual consultations with other party factions," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston here, "and now those groups are offended."
Ms. Sasaki-Smith and other analysts were also concerned that the Kajiyama plan, which would inject capital into the financial system through Government purchases of preferred shares in ailing institutions, would inhibit a much-needed contraction in banking.
Such a program would be similar to that of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in the United States, established under the New Deal to recapitalize weak banks during the Depression. After the banks regained their footing, the Government liquidated its holdings in the market.
A string of failures last month of four large Japanese financial institutions -- the Sanyo Securities Company, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the Yamaichi Securities Company and Tokuyu Bank -- was regarded as a measure of Tokyo's resolve to allow market forces to reshape the system, however painful that might be.
"The R.F.C. operated under very strict guidelines as to the type of bank and under what circumstances it was recapitalized -- so that it wasn't used to sustain the life of just any old bank," Ms. Sasaki-Smith said. "I've been saying for years that we have excess capacity in the banking system. This should not be a plan to sustain weak and undeserving banks."
Sei Nakai, deputy director general of the Finance Ministry's Banking Bureau, said the Government would not support any bank without seriously assessing its future, although he added that he did not think Japan's banks were insolvent at the moment. "I think this is a very good way to restore the financial system," he said.
He also noted that the Kajiyama plan would force banks to disclose the extent of their bad-loan problems more fully and would open their executives to prosecution for contributing to the loan crisis, though how far the Government would push such a house-cleaning is unclear.
"The executives of a bank receiving new capital would have to take responsibility for the problems," Mr. Nakai said. "They may not want to raise their hands, even if it means saving their bank."
Skepticism about the plan ran high today. For one thing, the original version, a five trillion yen, or nearly $39 billion, bond offering, that Mr. Kajiyama proposed last week, had been intended to support tax cuts, and many feared that it was still a tax-cutting wolf disguised as a finance-stabilizing sheep.
The collateral proposed for the new bonds also raised questions. The plan suggested that the bonds be backed by shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Japan Tobacco held by the Government. But the capital gains on those shares have already been pledged to service and redeem other Government bonds.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall in Hong Kong and Malaysia

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Thursday, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled here and in Hong Kong as turmoil continued to sweep Asian markets.
Malaysian stocks fell 6 percent in morning trading on concerns over the country's weakening currency, higher interest rates and a slowing economy. 
 The slide in stocks accelerated after the Malaysian news agency Bernama quoted Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as warning that some Malaysian banks might face bankruptcy.
Mr. Mahathir, speaking at a conference of Islamic countries in Iran, said, "We are flattered when people say we shall prevail but they do not know how difficult things are now as many companies are half-dead and when people are not able to repay bank loans, banks may go bankrupt," according to the news service.
In Hong Kong, stocks fell for a third day as local interest rates rose sharply.
Hong Kong's three-month interbank offered rate -- the rate that banks lend to each other -- rose as high as 11.5 percent this morning, from 9.8 percent on Wednesday. At midday, the Hang Seng index of 33 shares was down 6.07 percent.
Also pressuring Hong Kong stocks was concern that speculators might again attack the Hong Kong currency's link to the United States dollar.
Thai stocks were also sharply lower as Thailand's currency, the baht, plunged to new lows. In the first hour of trading, the main Thai index slid 16.55 points, or 4 percent, to a new nine-year low.

FLUOR CHIEF TO RETIRE EARLY AFTER DISAPPOINTING YEAR

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Fluor Corporation said yesterday that its chairman and chief executive, Leslie G. McCraw, would take early retirement, effective Jan. 1. His retirement follows a year of disappointing earnings for the construction and engineering company, which is based in Irvine, Calif. The company also faces uncertain prospects in Asia as a result of the economic turmoil there. Mr. McCraw, 63, recently underwent surgery for the removal of bladder polyps, which were diagnosed as malignant. A director, Peter J. Fluor, who is chairman and chief executive of Texas Crude Energy Inc., will serve as nonexecutive chairman of Fluor. Fluor said it had hired an executive search firm to seek candidates to replace Mr. McCraw.

HEADLINE: MEETING REACHES ACCORD TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Thursday, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Negotiators from around the world agreed today on a package of measures that for the first time would legally obligate industrial countries to cut emissions of waste industrial gases that scientists say are warming the earth's atmosphere.
But details on one contentious issue -- the possible trade or sale of emission permits between countries -- remain unsettled, and may remain unsettled for months, and the United States has said it wants this issue resolved before it signs the treaty. Any treaty is subject to approval by the United States Senate. 
 The agreement reached by delegates from more than 150 nations creates a landmark environmental policy to deal with global warming, and innovative new mechanisms to carry it out.
The nations would have a year to ratify the treaty, starting next March. Talks on "trading" of emissions are expected to take place next November.
Despite the uncertainties, some environmentalists hailed the agreement as a remarkable political and economic innovation, in that it would establish a global system for dealing with what many scientists believe is the overarching environmental concern.
Opponents of the treaty condemned it as economically ruinous.
The accord -- known as the Kyoto Protocol -- would require the industrial nations to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping greenhouse gases to 5.2 percent below those of 1990. The United States would be required to cut emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels, on average, in the years from 2008 through 2012.
The agreement appears to represent a significant concession by the United States, which previously had insisted on the less stringent course of reducing the emissions to 1990 levels, not below them. It is also a measure of the flexibility in the American bargaining position that Vice President Al Gore said he had ordered negotiators to adopt on a visit here Monday.
It remains to be seen, however, whether the White House can persuade the Senate to accept the agreement, or even whether the United States will sign it.
Many Senators had already expressed reservations about the less stringent Administration proposal. By 2000, emissions of greenhouse gases by the United States are expected to be about 13 percent higher than they were in 1990. They are expected to be perhaps 30 percent higher in 2010, if trends in energy use continue and no other action is taken.
Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican observing the talks, said here today, "Any way you measure this, this is a very bad deal for America." He predicted the Senate would not approve it.
For his part Stuart Eizenstat, the senior American negotiator, said the United States was still waiting for more signs of flexibility from developing nations on the question of emission trading.
"We do not yet have that meaningful commitment coming out of Kyoto," he said. But, he added, the possibilities for such a commitment "are certainly pregnant."
President Clinton, visiting New York, said in a statement that he was "very pleased" by the agreement, which he said was "environmentally strong and economically sound." But he said developing nations had to do more.
And in Washington, Vice President Gore called the agreement a "vital turning point." He added, "Clearly, more work is needed. In particular we will continue to press for meaningful participation by key developing nations. We are confident that can be achieved. "
Under the accord, different countries would be assigned different targets, depending on their national circumstances and economic profiles. The European Union's target was set at a reduction in emissions of 8 percent below 1990 levels, and that of Japan at 6 percent. Other targets, albeit within a narrow range, also applied to other developed countries. Some countries may be allowed to increase emissions, but globally, emissions are to be reduced by 30 percent from the levels currently projected for 2010.
After an all-night session that ran into an unscheduled 11th day of discussion, the protocol was approved by representatives of more than 150 countries.
The countries were modifying an agreement, negotiated in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, that called for voluntary efforts to limit emission of greenhouse gases. The burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil is responsible for most emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas.
As a means of promoting reductions in developing countries, the delegates established a special mechanism for transferring energy-efficient technologies and nonpolluting forms of energy production from richer nations to poorer ones. Greater efficiency means fewer emissions, and alternative energy sources like solar and wind power mean none.
The Clean Development Mechanism, as the new arrangement was named, is intended to encourage companies in industrial countries to invest in emissions-reduction projects in developing countries -- modern, fuel-efficient power plants, for example -- and get some credit for reducing their own emissions.
But the agreement was held up for hours last night and this morning by the resistance of some developing countries, including China, India and Saudi Arabia, to the inclusion of a provision enabling the industrialized nations to trade or purchase emissions rights. The United States considers this arrangement the cheapest and most efficient way of cutting emissions. Without it, American negotiators said, it would be impossible for the country to meet its emission targets.
In emissions trading, a country or industrial company will be able to meet its emissions reduction target by cutting some of its emissions itself, while at the same time purchasing part of its required reduction from another country or company that achieved excess cuts.
Based on its success with trading emissions of sulfur dioxide, a chemical implicated in acid rain, the United States argues that larger and cheaper reductions can be achieved with this mechanism.
The objectors said that the mechanism could lead to shifting the burden to less developed countries, and that countries and companies might be able to buy their way out of their obligations.
After hours of argument, delegates agreed to allow the parties to the 1992 treaty to postpone negotiations on the principles, rules, guidelines and operations of the trading system until November.
Experts advising the negotiators here say that if emissions are not reduced, the average surface temperature of the globe will rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century, causing widespread climatic, environmental and economic disruption.
Philip E. Clapp, president of the the National Environmental Trust in Washington, who has been observing the talks here, called the agreement "a historic landmark in environmental protection." He said it would be remembered "as a central achievement of the Clinton-Gore Administration."
But representatives of the American fossil fuel and heavy manufacturing industries saw disaster in the agreement.
"It is a terrible deal and the President should not sign it," said William K. O'Keefe, chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group. Mr. O'Keefe said that "business, labor and agriculture will campaign hard and will defeat" the treaty if it is submitted to the Senate for ratification.
The protocol is generally viewed only as an early step in a continuing attempt to deal with the question of climate change. It is generally acknowledged that any attempt to deal with the problem requires a global solution involving all countries.

HEADLINE: Warm Globe, Hot Politics

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
In the end, Bill Clinton and Al Gore could not walk away.
They faced unpleasant political options as talks in Kyoto, Japan, wound done, and as more than 150 nations neared agreement on a treaty to cut the emissions that lead to global warming. Under the agreement that emerged, which the Administration plans to sign, the United States will have to take more drastic steps than the White House had hoped to cut greenhouse emissions. Heavy industry, from cars to coal to steel to electricity, has already joined with organized labor to fight the proposal. 
 But walking away from the treaty -- as Mr. Gore said he was willing to do last week -- would have enraged the environmentalists who are key constituents for him and Mr. Clinton. It would have isolated the United States -- which just refused to sign a treaty banning land mines -- as the leading emitter of greenhouse gasses and the only industrial nation unwilling to address the problem jointly. And it would have been contrary, their aides said, to a belief shared by the President and Vice President that global warming presents grave dangers.
But now the Administration has a larger fight on its hands, a fight that will help define not only budget negotiations next year but the 1998 Congressional elections and even the next Presidential race.
Even before the treaty was worked out, Democratic allies of the Administration were warning the White House not to seek approval in the Senate. "What we have here is not ratifiable in the Senate in my judgment," Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a telephone news conference from Kyoto.
Before the Kyoto meeting began, the Senate voted 95 to 0 to pass a resolution that the United States would not agree to a treaty that did not provide a role in cutting emissions for developing nations. That became a negotiating goal for the Administration.
In Kyoto, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said flatly, "There is no way, if the President signs this, that the vote in the United States Senate will even be close. We will kill this bill."
The treaty emerging in Kyoto tonight (Thursday morning, Kyoto time) includes a new program sought by the Administration to funnel capital and environmentally friendly technology to developing nations. But White House aides said that, while they considered the provision a victory, it was not strong enough to win ratification.
The White House is also planning to propose tax incentives to encourage cuts in greenhouse-gas emission as part of its budget proposal next year, but that, too, will be subject to Congessional approval.
Two officials said that, judging by the early criticism, the public would get a positive impression of the Administration's actions. "We figured that we would probably be criticized by both industry and environmental groups," one of them said, "which has the effect of saying, 'Well, they must have ended up in a place that's pretty sensible.' "
Indeed, in Kyoto, one industry coalition went as far as to issue a statement denouncing the agreement hours before the deal was final. And the World Wildlife Fund attacked the plan, saying that the outcome was "a flawed agreement that will allow major polluters to continue emitting greenhouse gasses through loopholes."
But Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said: "There's still much more work to be done to assure that the protocol's targets are met" but "Vice President Gore should be commended for coming to Japan and opening the doors to an agreement."
In recent polls the public has expressed solid support for action on global warming. Two weeks ago, in a poll taken by The New York Times , 65 percent said that the United States should take steps now to cut its own emissions "regardless of what other countries do." Only 17 percent agreed that cutting emissions "will cost too much money and hurt the U.S. economy."
Four years ago, Mr. Clinton promised to reduce United States emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. But such emissions are now more than 10 percent above 1990 levels and rising. Mr. Clinton rarely mentioned the issue until early this summer, when, in anticipation of the Kyoto meeting, he began warning of the dangers of global warming.
But, even as he began addressing the subject again, Mr. Clinton has repeatedly said that the United States can meet what amount to rigorous emissions targets with little or no economic pain.
"I am convinced that we can demonstrate to the American people that we can substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and fulfill our global environmental responsibilities as well as our responsibilities to our own people without giving up economic growth," Mr. Clinton said in an interview with The New York Times last Thursday. "But it will require a very disciplined, organized, coordinated effort to do it."

HEADLINE: U.S. Would Need to Cut Use of Fuel Drastically

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
For the United States to meet the promises agreed to at the global warming conference in Japan, Americans would have to make significant, sustained cuts in their use of fossil fuels, beginning immediately and lasting well into the next century.
The nation's consumption of coal and oil would have to decline by as much as 30 percent from the levels now projected for 10 or 15 years from now, marking the first step toward what proponents of the treaty say would be a radical restructuring of the economy's patterns of energy use later in the 21st century. 
 In the short term, it would require car makers to sell more efficient vehicles, power companies to give up coal and people to learn to be miserly when choosing light bulbs, air-conditioners and appliances. In the long term there could be a wholesale turn to novel devices like combustion-free fuel cells and solar and wind power. Economists and advocates may dispute whether the economy would be better or worse off as a result, but it would have to be markedly different.
The country has made no sacrifices remotely like this since the oil shocks of the 1970's. At the moment, the American appetite for fossil fuels, and therefore emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is growing.
Last month the Energy Department reckoned in its long-term forecast that this trend, fed by cheap fuel and strong economic growth, was likely to continue for decades.
So as exhausted delegates straggle home from rancorous all-night talks in Kyoto, the question is whether the United States -- where per capita emissions of carbon dioxide are more than double Japan's, triple France's and 10 times Brazil's -- has the economic strength, the brainpower and the political will to put into practice what its negotiators have promised.
The least of the problems is technology. Although expensive, substitutes for carbon fuels are already available.
But the political barriers look formidable. Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, called the treaty's prospects bleak even before the ink was dry, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Democrat who favors the treaty, cautioned against rushing to seek Senate approval. Not only would the Senate have to consent to the treaty, but both houses of Congress would have to approve any legislation to carry it out, like emissions caps, a permit-trading plan, tax incentives, research budgets or reorganization of the utility industry.
As for enforcing a national energy diet, no one knows what combination of rewards and punishments might be needed to change course and head toward the targets that would be imposed under the new regime.
The Energy Department has projected that emissions of carbon from energy use will rise 1.2 percent a year until 2020. Between 2008 and 2012, when the treaty calls for reductions to be achieved, emissions are headed toward 1.8 billion metric tons a year, the agency said. The new goal under the treaty would be 1.25 billion tons during the same period.
Only a small part of the reduction -- at most 160 million tons a year, American negotiators say -- might be achieved by trading credits with Russia, whose emissions dropped sharply when its economic output collapsed along with Communism.
To meet these goals, most analysts say governments would have to put caps on emissions. But the Clinton Administration favors market-based mechanisms like trading pollution permits, rather than rigid regulations, to let companies decide for themselves how to meet the limits.
"President Clinton is right that getting to anything below 1990 levels in the U.S. is going to be a big stretch," said Christopher Flavin, an energy efficiency expert at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group. "Even if we are partly to buy our way there with credits from Russia, there is still going to have to be a lot done at home."
Opponents of the treaty agreed with that assessment.
"The energy use curbs needed to comply with the climate treaty are far deeper than expected," said the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a pro-business research and advocacy group. It said provisions to allow international emissions trading and other offsets would only "disguise the pain."
But there are several approaches, some buried in the treaty text and others being developed by the Clinton Administration as unilateral actions, that might help.
For example, the treaty makes allowances for trading pollution control credits among countries if that would provide cheaper ways of reducing worldwide emissions for what is, after all, a global problem.
The treaty also would allow countries to receive credit for certain changes in land use and forestry practices against their emissions limit, on the ground that trees take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow and store the carbon for decades in the form of wood.
The Clinton Administration is working on a package of tax incentives and research subsidies that would accelerate the introduction of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, which do not emit carbon, and energy-efficiency technologies that use far less fossil fuels.
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and other conservation advocates have called for tax incentives for any vehicle, whether a compact car or a lumbering sport utility vehicle, that achieved double the fuel efficiency of today's comparable models.
Any car could double its fuel efficiency by using hybrid gas-and-electric technologies that are just coming onto the market.
Another crucial opportunity for reducing fossil fuel consumption may come with the opening of the electric utility industry to nationwide competition.

HEADLINE: Clinton Praises Bronx Renewal As U.S. Model

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
Sweeping through a sodden New York yesterday, President Clinton visited a South Bronx neighborhood risen up from despair, then roared into Manhattan for a pastrami on rye, a Christmas shopping excursion and two evening fund-raisers that produced as much as $1.55 million.
Mr. Clinton and his sprawling caravan forced already heavy holiday traffic onto side streets and into detours, creating pockets of gridlock over much of midtown and the east side of Manhattan. 
 The symbolic high point of the trip came in the morning when Mr. Clinton visited the Charlotte Gardens neighborhood in the South Bronx. Now a tree-lined street of suburban-style houses, Charlotte Gardens came to symbolize urban blight in the aftermath of the arson fires that devastated the South Bronx in the 1970's.
But over many years, the neighborhood was rebuilt, largely with city money. Yesterday, shortly after 11 A.M., Mr. Clinton walked slowly along Charlotte Street, greeting residents and an impromptu receiving line of local officials. Later, he hailed the South Bronx as a model for renewing inner-city areas, a once-unthinkable statement.
"If you can do it," Mr. Clinton told an audience at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in the South Bronx, "everybody else can do it."
Citing empowerment zones, the Federal tax credit for low-income housing and the Community Reinvestment Act as examples of his urban policy, Mr. Clinton announced he would release $96 million to New York through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Innovative Home Program for more housing. He also said the Small Business Administration would make available $50 million in loans to small-business owners in the Bronx.
But after the President's speech, the HUD Secretary, Andrew M. Cuomo, said the $96 million did not actually represent additional money for New York but instead was already included in the 1998 Federal budget. "It's not a special program for New York," Mr. Cuomo said, "but New York gets more money than any other city in the nation."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had planned to attend the Bronx rally but canceled to attend the funeral of a Staten Island boy who died of an accidental gunshot wound. Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro attended in his stead.
Also absent was Representative Jose E. Serrano, who represents the Charlotte Gardens area in Congress. Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said the Congressman felt snubbed because the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, was Mr. Clinton's host in the Bronx and because Mr. Ferrer had heard about the President's visit first. "We failed to to do a good job in the notification, and that's my understanding of why the Congressman failed to attend," Mr. Lockhart said. Phone calls left for Mr. Serrano last night were not returned.
Later in the evening, Mr. Clinton attended two fund-raising events, first a $10,000-per-couple gathering sponsored by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at the Waldorf-Astoria that was also attended by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. It was the first meeting between the two Democrats since Mr. Gephardt criticized White House campaign fund-raising practices. They shook hands but beyond that barely made eye contact.
The event was expected to raise $800,000 to $1 million, bringing to $3 million the total amount of money Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have raised in seven events for the Democratic Congressional group this year.
The President then attended the Democratic National Committee Hispanic Gala at the Rainbow Room, where many of the 200 guests made $5,000 contributions for a meal of lobster salad and beef with asparagus. Organizers expected to raise $550,000.
Mr. Clinton's visit earlier in the day to the South Bronx made him the third President to visit Charlotte Street in the last 20 years. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter paid a surprise visit to the South Bronx, stepping out of his limousine to walk through piles of rubble and trash on Charlotte Street. City crews had razed almost every building on the block after a rash of arson fires. In all, roughly 100,000 housing units were lost to fires in the South Bronx during the 1970's. Calling his visit a "a very sobering trip," Mr. Carter pledged to help rebuild the area.
Ronald Reagan, campaigning for the Presidency in 1980, visited Charlotte Street, too, lambasting Mr. Carter for failing to revive the neighborhood. Mr. Reagan posed in front of the destroyed street, saying he had "not seen anything that looked like this since London after the blitz." Jesse Jackson, a Democratic Presidential hopeful, slept in the apartment of a South Bronx family during the 1984 primaries to draw attention to the area's lingering poverty.
"My No. 1 message here is, 'Look at where the Bronx was when President Carter came here in despair,' " Mr. Clinton later said. "Look at where the Bronx was when President Reagan came here and compared it to London in the Blitz. Look at the Bronx today."
Heavily subsidized by public money, the neat, single-family houses on Charlotte Street sold for $49,500 in 1985. Started under the city administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, the project almost died in 1983, after the first 10 houses were built. The city flirted with cutting off financing, but, prodded by the South Bronx Development Organization, it did not, and construction of all 89 houses was completed in 1986.
Today, the homes are valued at $185,000, underscoring the newly found stability and desirability of the area. Overall, more than $2 billion in state and Federal housing money also has been poured into the South Bronx since 1986, helping to create 30,000 new and renovated housing units.
The middle of the President's day was dedicated to filling his stomach and his shopping bag.
With rain turning to a light snow, Mr. Clinton's entourage left the Bronx and sped down the cleared southbound lanes of Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive for lunch at Katz's Delicatessen on Houston Street on the Lower East Side. He ate a pastrami on rye with mustard while dining with Mr. Cuomo; Aida Alvarez, Small Business Administrator; Representatives Nydia M. Velazquez, who represents parts of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan, Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn and other elected officials. His entourage of dozens of vehicles idled outside, closing down much of Houston Street.
With lunch finished by 2:30 P.M., Mr. Clinton left Katz's to go Christmas shopping. Though there were reports that the President planned to shop along Fifth Avenue, his motorcade instead went to the South Street Seaport, a decision aides attributed to logistics and a desire to minimize the disruption of local traffic.
The President spent about an hour and a half shopping, escorted by a former aide, Wendy Smith. Dipping in and out of several stores, Mr. Clinton bought $400 in jewelry, including three pillboxes and five amber pins made in Poland. He also bought six sweaters, three soft-sided leather briefcases and two trinkets from a Western store.
Mr. Clinton's presence brought commerce to a screeching halt, as shoppers abandoned stores to gawk from the railings. More than once, the President waded into crowds to shake hands.
"Is it really you?" Diane Schneider, a shopper, asked when she suddenly found herself shaking Mr. Clinton's hand. "He looked at me and said, 'Why yes it is.' He sounded like Elvis Presley."
The crowd at Charlotte Street also reached out for handshakes and photographs. Raymond Gonzalez, 57, a retired transit worker, let his 17-year-old daughter play hooky to she could photograph the President outside their home. "I shook his hand and said, 'Welcome to Charlotte Street,' " Mr. Gonzalez said. "Actually, I shook his hand four times."
Mr. Gonzalez said many of his friends regretted not applying for a house in Charlotte Gardens. "A lot of people were skeptical," he recalled. "There was nothing but rubble and brick. They figured nothing would grow here."

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Galleries, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan and are open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 or 11 A.M. to 5 or 6 P.M.; gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"ART ON THE EDGE: FRAMING 19TH-CENTURY AMERICA," National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Jan. 11). An imposing frame, preferably gilded, was an important part of the "sell" of a 19th-century painting. The right frame in which to dress a painting for its all-important easel display was a must for artists, who purveyed works to patrons directly from their studios. Often, they designed their own. This selection, ranging from 1860 to the 1890's, presents a variety from the collection of Eli Wilner & Company, makers of period frames. They range from elaborate Barbizon-style models used to echo natural forms in paintings, to those reflecting the taste for Moorish designs in the 1880's, to a classically ornamented gilt frame by Stanford White with an outer shadow box of wood. But the show, pegged to the rising interest in frame connoisseurship, could use much better labeling about the how and why of these elaborate mounts, and especially the design elements that went into them. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; Fridays to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3.50 for children under 16, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck). 

THE ARTIST'S EYE, National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Dec. 28). For the National Academy's biennial series, Will Barnet, a member, has selected a motley show of 50 portraits from the academy's permanent collection. Highlights include a great self-portrait by Thomas Eakins, a horrific self-portrait by Ivan Albright, a small but richly painterly self-portrait by Lois Dodd and an etched self-portrait of fuzzy little dots by Chuck Close. Also on view are nine of Mr. Barnet's distinctively linear paintings. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; Fridays, noon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3.50 for the elderly. (Ken Johnson).
"THE DRAWINGS OF FILIPPINO LIPPI AND HIS CIRCLE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 11). The first major presentation of the work of this important Florentine artist brings together more than 100 drawings, most by Filippino Lippi himself, but also by his father, Fra Filippo Lippi; Raphael; Botticelli, and Piero di Cosimo. Although primarily known as a painter, Filippino was an ardently inventive draftsman, mastering line in pen and metalpoint to push drawing to its limits. He became a wizard at the use of metalpoint, a technique of incising the lines of a drawing on prepared paper. Among other rarities in the show is a first-time pairing of Filippino's pen-and-ink cartoon for a painting showing the dead Jesus at his tomb with the painting itself, the only full-scale Filippino drawing that can be matched to an extant painting. More than most, this rich presentation brings you close to the artist's intimate arena, where with mind and hand he struggles to get it right. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Suggested admission: $8 for adults; $4 for students and the elderly (Glueck).
"FAIR AND FREE: IMAGES OF CHILDHOOD, 1824-1992," National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 360-6795 (through March 8). Even a curmudgeon who agrees with Scrooge and W. C. Fields on the subject of children could warm to this show. In paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures, it presents some 65 views of the blissful stage of life before adolescence takes over. The work, most of it by academy members, reaches back to the year before the academy's founding with a mawkish pre-Victorian painting of 1824 by Frederick Stiles Agate that shows a mother lamenting over her dead baby. But it goes on to more spirited offerings. Children playing, making mischief, doing chores, fondling pets, picking flowers or just being children are the subjects of works by Cecelia Beaux, Mary Cassatt, William Merritt Chase, Thomas Dewing, Eastman Johnson, Winslow Homer, Jerome Myers, James McNeill Whistler and lesser lights. The 20th-century components of the show are far less distinctive than the earlier part. But embellished with antique toys borrowed from various sources, the show has a lot going for it. Take the children. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; Fridays to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3.50 for children under 16, students and the elderly (Glueck).
* "FLOWERS UNDERFOOT: INDIAN CARPETS OF THE MUGHAL ERA" (through March 1) and "KING OF THE WORLD," a Mughal manuscript from the Royal Library, Windsor Castle (through Feb. 8), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710. These ravishing exhibitions are devoted to work from the reign of the Mughal emperors of India, and they complement each other superbly. "Flowers Underfoot" is a gathering of some 50 carpets, with images ranging from grotesque animal heads to refulgent floral patterns. The finest of them are woven of Himalayan goat's wool; the colors are magnificent. Painted versions of these treasures can be found in "The Chronicle of the King of the World," a book commissioned by Shah Jahan, builder of the Taj Mahal. The book's miniatures are being displayed outside their binding for the first time. An extended exercise in dynastic propaganda, they combine supreme naturalism with an almost preposterous jewel-like richness. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Admission: $8; $4 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
* "NEW CONCEPTS IN PRINTMAKING 1: PETER HALLEY," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400 (through Feb. 8). From a famously intellectual 80's art star who hasn't been too visible lately, a big, jazzy installation that shows his signature cell image -- variously interpreted as a jail, a battery or a power plant -- exploding or melting down. Its demise is clocked in a nine-panel comic-book sequence that recurs in several kinds of prints, including acres of wallpaper hung with art, a la Warhol. A wall painted radioactive yellow adds to the nuclear-accident tone. In addition, prints, illustrations and maps from the artist's collection -- for example, an 18th-century diagram of a sewer system -- further explicate his interests and inspirations. This is one of Mr. Halley's best efforts and certainly his most revealing. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $9.50; $6.50, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
MONA HATOUM, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Feb. 22). This survey of work by the artist Mona Hatoum -- born in Beirut of Palestinian descent, now living in London -- was to mark the New Museum's re-opening after a major interior expansion. Things happen; the reburbishment isn't finished. But the show is in place, and Ms. Hatoum's spare, evocative sculptures and installations look good. This is a deeply emotional art, one that often speaks quietly but hides very little: the body is relentlessly explored; the psychological wounds of lost childhood and of adult displacement probed. At bottom, the vision is of a world at war, even when the battle is a private and internal one. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 P.M.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3 for artists, students and the elderly; free for those 18 and under (Cotter).
"MONET AND THE MEDITERRANEAN," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 4). Yet another Monet show, this one with 65 mostly lesser-known paintings inspired by several trips he took, the first in 1883 to the Riviera, the last to Venice in 1908. In general, these Mediterranean views have been overshadowed by his other paintings for a reason. They're pretty, and occasionally boring, though one sees Monet adjusting to a new landscape, contriving a palette appropriate to the warm, enveloping southern light and to the tropical locale and pushing toward the sort of serialism that was to be his most creative reaction to Seurat and the other Post-Impressionists. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Sundays, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Holiday hours: 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Dec. 26 and 28, Jan. 2 and 4.; 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Jan. 1. Admission: $8; $4, students; $2, the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
"ROMANTICISM TO REALISM: 19TH-CENTURY GERMAN DRAWINGS," Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0610 (through Jan. 4). Caspar David Friedrich and Philip Otto Runge are the stars of this gourmet exhibition, drawn largely from the Morgan's own holdings. Trying to show the Divine in earthly manifestations, the two produced deeply spiritual imagery inspired by nature. Friedrich's was on the melancholy side; Runge's more life-affirming. Besides Friedrich and Runge, the show includes the work of some 40 other artists, realists as well as romantics, and a group of fancy palace interiors that catered to the tastes of viewers in the Biedermeier period. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Suggested admission: $6; $4 for students and the elderly; free for children under 12 (Glueck).
"THE WARHOL LOOK/GLAMOUR STYLE FASHION," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Jan. 18). Andy Warhol remains one of the most provocative American artists of the postwar years. It is almost impossible not to have complicated feelings about him, but his impact has been immense. Unfortunately, little of his importance is conveyed in this tame, patchy exhibition, organized by the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, which sets out to examine how fashion influenced Warhol and how he influenced it. Elaborately installed, this is basically a show of ephemera rather than of art. But no encounter with Warhol can be without interest, and this one has its moments: the section on drag is good; the Factory-era material in general is great. Hours: Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. Admission: $8; $7,students and the elderly; free on Thursdays, 6 to 8 P.M. (Cotter).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
* "FRANZ KLINE: ARCHITECTURE AND ATMOSPHERE," Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 988-6870 (through Jan. 17; closed Dec. 20-Jan. 5). By all accounts, the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Franz Kline reflect his complex, attractive personality. He was an American-style romantic: a gregarious melancholic with the wit and grace of a ballroom dancer, a kind of Wagnerian Fred Astaire. It's great to have him back in town in something like representative form in this scrappy but ambitious exhibition, which traces his career from drawings of city streets in the 1930's to his late color abstractions. Most of the work included is small: studies and experiments, hung salon style in clusters. But there are large pieces, too, topped off by the artist's noble last painting, "Scudera" of 1961 (Cotter).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
JOSE BEDIA, George Adams Gallery, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665 (through Dec. 20). Most of Mr. Bedia's new work, influenced by children's toys and folk carving, is modest in size and light in tone but full of complex ideas. The show includes animal fables, mythological vignettes and political dramas, as well as a series of visionary drawings of Afro-Cuban deities in this artist's incisive graphic style. Don't miss the little box in the center of the gallery: modeled on a shaman's medicine chest, it is divided into little rooms fitted with miniature altars, icons and ritual paraphernalia, everything necessary for the spiritual journey that is the basic theme of everything Mr. Bedia does (Cotter).
* LEONORA CARRINGTON, Brewster Arts Ltd., 41 West 57th Street, (212) 980-5373 (through Dec. 23). This incomparable artist, now 80, began life as an English debutante with artistic ambitions, ran with off Max Ernst at the age of 20 and never looked back. She has lived in Mexico since 1943, making tiny paintings in a fantastic Surrealist style that draws on Goya, Bosch, the Sienese painters and Egyptian art, with just a pinch of Edward Gorey. Scenes of mysterious rituals conducted by elaborately costumed spirits and equally fanciful animals reflect a fertile and original imagination, but it is the palette of glowing, misty colors and the whispering passion of the delicate yet turbulently painted surfaces that give this work its power (Smith).
SEIICHI FURUYA, "Memoires," Robert Miller Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 980-5454 (through Dec. 19). In a kind of visual diary, highly personal and often enigmatic, running from 1978 to 1997, the photographer mixes the events of his own world and the larger one. Nature photographs of worms and flowers, a view of the former concentration camp at Sachsenhausen, Germany, and other "outside" phenomena mingle with touching photographs of his troubled wife, caught in many moods and poses, until her suicide in 1985. Her sprawled body is also recorded by the photographer in a chilling shot from the window she exited, but it is reticently shown here on a color contact strip with unrelated subject matter. The intensity of the show is diminished by a few too many random memories, but as the evocation of a life, with the pains and pleasures that accompany the franchise, it's compelling (Glueck).
GEORGE RICKEY, Maxwell Davidson, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7555 (through Dec. 20). New, mostly small works by the 90-year-old master of the Modernist mobile. Along with his familiar swinging blades, tilting planes and twittering machines, there's something new: small works called Pagodas in which rooflike forms, hand painted in multicolored patterns, balance on central posts (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
BRYAN CROCKETT, Fotouhi Cramer Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-1304 (through Jan. 17). In his first solo exhibition, Mr. Crockett, whose monstrous balloon sculpture was one of the hits of the last Whitney Biennial, shows only one fully realized balloon work along with various high-tech procedures to which he subjects his sculptures. He records their deflation on video, he makes Rayograms of them, and he puts one under glass in a vacuum machine, which makes it rhythmically and suggestively swell and shrink (Johnson).
* ANNA GASKELL, "Wonder," Casey Kaplan, 48 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 226-6131 (through Dec. 20). In this impressive debut, Lewis Carroll, writer, is fused with Lewis Carroll, photographer of blossoming young girls, as his classic story of Alice and her travels is cryptically recast in a series of bright, seemingly innocent color photographs of a pair of twin teen-age girls costumed in the requisite pinafores and Mary Janes. Changing in size and camera angle, the images evoke various events, characters and lines from the story, capture the scary, tumbling chaos of the trip and its sexual undercurrents, and from a point of view that is distinctly Alice's own. More than ever, it is a coming-of-age tale, about the wonder that a girl can feel on the brink of womanhood (Smith).
"LANDSCAPE U.S.A.," Bronwyn Keenan Gallery, 3 Crosby Street, (212) 431-5083 (through Dec. 24). This lively painting show mixes styles and generations while stretching the definition of landscape in several directions. There are good recent works by Verne Dawson, David Deutsch and Karen Kalimnik, as well as exemplary earlier efforts by John Wesley and Forrest Bess. The juxtaposition of Lari Pittman's bright, labor-intensive imagery with a similarly wound-up painting made by Steve Wheeler in the late 1940's is especially rewarding (Smith).
ERIC MAGNUSON, Thomas Nordanstad Gallery, 476 Broome Street, (212) 274-1508 (through Dec. 20). Square, monochromatic canvases covered by rows of neatly lettered "found neologisms," new forms of jargon and slang gleaned form the Internet, the corporate workplace and various other sub- or mass-culture sources: "Dilberting," "Body Nazis," "Gapgeist," "Kleptocrats" and so on. Like Ed Ruscha's word-based pictures, Mr. Magnuson's paintings are fun to read, and they open up dizzying views of our contemporary collective mindscape (Johnson).
* BEATRIZ MILHAZES, Edward Thorp Gallery, 103 Prince Street, (212) 431-6880 (through Jan. 10). Ms. Milhazes, who lives in Brazil, has come through with a dazzling second New York solo show of abstract paintings. Her forms, often circular, seem to derive from textile patterns, architectural ornaments and the lacelike haloes and vegetal filigree found in the colonial-period Baroque religious art of the Americas. Her surfaces, which suggest stamping, embossing and collage, deliberately keep the artist's personal touch at a slight remove, but only slight: the result is a sense of exhilarated, erotic concentration (Cotter).
CARL PALAZZOLO, "A Personal History of Italian Film," Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through Dec. 20). The golden era of Italian film, when directors like Fellini, Visconti and Antonioni were at the peak of their powers, is the subject of these recent paintings and watercolors. Mr. Palazzolo's sketchily composed canvases include fragmentary images, words and names intended to evoke particular films or directors. In "No. 6," for instance, a partial post-Crucifixion image of Jesus is seen at the right of a gray ground across which the name "Pasolini" is also faintly stenciled. Mysteriously, a series of trompe l'oeil white cards covers sections of Jesus's body and the director's name. And so it goes through eight other anemic paintings, each making arch and veiled visual references to Mr. Palazzolo's heros and heroines and their work. Paying homage to film and filmdom in another visual medium is tricky work at best; here it borders on the silly (Glueck).
* SHAHZIA SIKANDER, Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300 (through Dec. 20). With the rigorous tradition of Persian and Indian miniature painting as a base, this talented young artist from Pakistan achieves a heady mix of East and West, and past and present, switching media, styles and scales with remarkable ease. Her most original works are the fluid, dreamlike wall paintings and watercolors, which provide a terrific foil for the refined, hyper-alert technique of the miniatures. Everything is connected by recurring images of female forms and personages, especially a tribe of red goddesses. The hauntingly beautiful narratives that result are at once declarative and mysterious (Smith).
"THREE PAINTERS," CRG, 93 Grand Street, (212) 966-4360 (through Dec. 20). In this exhibition of three young realists -- Kiki Lemars of Rotterdam, Margherita Manzelli of Milan and Sandra Scolnik of New York -- the subject of childhood or adolescence is coupled with meticulous technique, and an unsettling eeriness seems to be the common ground, one that is worth examining (Smith).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
JOHN BEARDMAN, Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, (through Dec. 20). Paintings that look as if they were made in an immediate, Abstract Expressionist manner but were, in fact, made by means of an elaborate, indirect process. Mr. Beardman applies paint to wax slabs, peels it off when dry and adheres the skin of paint to canvas in rectangular sections. The resulting fields of gesture and texture are not as remarkable as the tricky technique would lead you to expect (Johnson).
 RITA McBRIDE, Alexander and Bonin, 312 10th Avenue, near 19th Street, (212) 367-7474 (through Dec. 20). Ordinary pieces of architecture or furniture are transformed into subtly ironic model-scale sculptures: the shells of a pair of parking garages cast in bronze; the framework of an awning made of clear sections of Murano glass fastened together by brass plates; a bentwood chair made of dark amber glass, the parts joined by plastic wrap (Johnson).
KUNIE SUGIURA, Leslie Tonkonow, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-8450 (through Jan. 10; closed Dec. 23-Jan. 1). In a darkroom, using minimal means, Ms. Sugiura takes a new approach to the traditional Japanese art of flower arranging. Composing blossoms and sometimes bits of string on photographic paper, she briefly exposes her arrangements to light, then manipulates the developing material to create painterly effects. The result: photograms and color-toned positive prints of delicate but arresting imagery that often have emotional resonance. In one print, blossoms dance on taut strings in an empyrean space; in another, four blossoms, each at the end of a slack vertical string on a dark, swirling ground, push forlornly at the top edge of the print as if seeking escape. In a more Minimalist composition, Ms. Sugiura stacks bunches of tulips in a repetitive vertical pattern, contrasting their free organic shapes with the formality of their placement. A lovely show (Glueck).
SHELLBURNE THURBER, Jack Shainman, 513 West 22d Street, (212) 645-1701 (through Dec. 20). This excellent, Boston-based photographer presents a selection from 20 years of her work in her first solo show in New York. Other than an occasional portrait within a picture, there are no people in Ms. Thurber's photographs; but in her rich yet understated, large-format images of rooms -- from the comfortably appointed interiors of her grandparents to the most depressingly run-down motel cubicles -- she evokes palpable human presences (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Other
 
PAULA HAYES, AC Project Room, 15 Renwick Street, off Spring Street, West Village, (212) 219-8275 (through Jan. 17; closed Dec. 25-Jan. 1). In a Duchampian move, Paula Hayes offers potted plants as artworks. If you buy one, you must sign a contract promising to care for your living sculpture properly. Also on view are a lush terrarium and a section of grassy turf in a canvas-covered box; the latter is given the literally descriptive title, "Selling a Piece of My Family Land" (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
ED BAYNARD, Dillon, 431 West Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-2977 (through Wednesday). Along with the whimsical, flattened, candy-colored flower paintings for which he is known, Ed Baynard shows some portraits made in a cloying, faux-ingenuous style and some curiously schizoid still-life pictures. The latter incorporate televisions displaying bad news, like a scene of people investigating an airplane crash site (Johnson).
MARGARET CURTIS, Arena Gallery, 313 Clinton Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 624-1307 (through Sunday). Call Ms. Curtis a pastoral feminist. Her wry, airy drawings, full of feminine flourishes, often depict the wide-open spaces disrupted by a bit of down-home satire: a lascivious female scarecrow or the back of a road-side sign in the shape of a curvaceous woman. Earlier drawings review the artist's development, while suggesting that her barbs are sharper and her aim improved (Smith).
ALAN DAVIE, Joseph Rickards, 1045 Madison Avenue, near 79th Street, (212) 924-0858 (through tomorrow). A handful of gouaches by the Scottish artist who emerged in the 1960's as a painter of playful, splashy abstractions. These colorful works on paper from the 70's combine painterly spontaneity and pictographic images. They are not unpleasant, but the studied simulation of childlike naivete does not wear well (Johnson).
NICOLAS DE STAEL, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 79th Street, (212) 744-7400, (through tomorrow). De Stael (1914-55) was at the forefront of French avant-garde painting in the years immediately after World War II. He enjoyed considerable success in the United States in the 1950's, but his Cubistic easel painting was eclipsed by Abstract Expressionism. This survey of his work from the 50's is the first de Stael exhibition in America in 30 years. His best paintings are the most thickly painted ones and the smallest ones. They offer not the expansive optical field of Abstract Expressionism, but a concentrated, tactile physicality (Johnson).
* "40 YEARS OF EXPLORATION AND INNOVATION," the artists of the Castelli Gallery Part 2, Leo Castelli Gallery, 420 West Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 431-5160 (through tomorrow). Less can indeed be more, as this selection of one work each by nine Castelli artists variously associated with Minimalism vividly demonstrates. It's the interaction between works as much as individual pieces themselves that accounts for the beauty of the show. A Mondrianesque arrangement of painted rectangles by Nassos Daphnis, a classic Frank Stella black stripe painting and a Donald Judd wall relief in which bright orange slats are sandwiched between galvanized-steel moldings counterpoint one another like members of a jazz trio (Johnson).
ALLAN McCOLLUM, Susan Inglett, 100 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0573 (through tomorrow). In Mr. McCollum's sly installation, 1,152 colored concrete bars, into each of which the word "Thanks" is molded, are stacked like gold ingots on six tables. Thus he equates the artwork and the commodity, stamps it with the mark of gratitude that so often punctuates transactions of money or power, and once again succinctly makes the point that for all its esthetic, spiritual or intellectual aspirations, art can never fully extract itself from the lowly muck of commerce and politics (Johnson).
"MONDRIAN AND REINHART: INFLUENCE AND AFFINITY," Pace Wildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292 (through tomorrow). In this museum-quality show, the abstractionist Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967) is paired with one of the painters who influenced him, Piet Mondrian (1872-1944). The exhibition explores the relationship between these two hard-edge sensibilities, focusing on what Reinhardt took from Mondrian before going off on his own path. Reinhardt shared with Mondrian a feeling for painting as a spiritual discipline without worldly reference. Seeking a "pure" abstraction, he began in the late 1940's to take cues from the older painter's early "plus and minus" phase, the reduction of subject matter to an allover pattern of short horizontal and vertical strokes. By the 50's Reinhardt was involved with the shifting planes of color that Mondrian developed in his work after 1917. Then Reinhardt began to simplify his canvases, turning toward larger geometric blocks of color in closer values, finally arriving at his "ultimate" paintings, calm works that demand intensity of vision to see the barely perceptible colors that lie under their dense, dark surfaces (Glueck).
SUSAN ROTHENBERG, Sperone Westwater, 142 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 431-3685 (through tomorrow). Ms. Rothenberg continues to explore the relationship between image and surface, bringing her subjects closer to her own everyday life and setting them increasingly in motion. The action gets metaphorical in "White Poker," the most ambitious work here, which shows a big tilting table piled with human limbs, as if the card players were literally betting "an arm and a leg" (Smith).
JULIAN SCHNABEL, Pace Wildenstein, 142 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 431-9224 (through tomorrow). Mr. Schnabel's portraits of friends dressed up in Old World costumes project a typically imposing combination of aggression and sensuality. But there's a niggling uncertainty in the way the figures are made, especially in their wooden faces and clumsy hands, that undermines their dramatic impact. In several pictures, Mr. Schnabel has spilled puddles of white paint across the surface. In the best painting, he does away with the ironic role playing and gives his naked 10-year-old son a rough-hewn Cezannesque monumentality (Johnson).
MIKLOS SUBA, "Precise Impressions," James Graham & Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through tomorrow). Settling in Brooklyn after leaving his native Hungary, Suba (1880-1944) painted buildings and industrial scenes in a hard-edged style that put him in company with Precisionist artists like Charles Sheeler, Charles Demuth and Ralston Crawford. Their simplified, geometricized forms and sharply outlined contours were part of the Americanization of Cubism. Suba's work, though not as strong as the others, is seen at its best in canvases like "Factories: Manhattan Bridge" (1938), in which the view is framed by the edges of buildings, seen close-up at either side of the canvas. Suba also painted barber poles and detailed shop windows, closing in on his subjects with a tight focus. Altogether, a very engaging show (Glueck).

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Portrait of Black Life, Minus the Bad News

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
There are many ways to approach history. You can look on the bright side and talk about what worked. Or you can concentrate on everything else. Or, with a little patience, you can go with a textured, light-and-dark picture that is often closer to the way things are.
The photographs of the brothers Morgan and Marvin Smith, now seen in a superbly presented show at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, represent a deliberately selective, best-foot-forward portrait of urban black life in America from the 1930's through the 50's. 
 Poverty, violence and catastrophe are left out. Accomplishment of every kind is celebrated. Yet woven throughout the preponderance of up-tempo images are harsher stories -- of rejection and exclusion, of battles lost and others only narrowly won -- and in some ways they are all the more moving for their discreet, oblique delivery.
The 150 photographs on view were the work of a pair of identical twins born in the rural town of Nicholsville, Ky., on Feb. 16, 1910. Children of sharecroppers, they moved with their parents to Lexington in 1922 and attended the city's only black high school. Their interests in painting and photography were encouraged, and after graduation, they made their way to New York.
Even during the Depression, Harlem sustained the close-knit creative network that had coalesced in the Harlem Renaissance a generation earlier. The Smiths landed day jobs with the city parks department and studied art in the free school founded by the sculptor Augusta Savage. But it was in commercial photography that the Smiths found a career, which, whatever the divisions of labor, they regarded as collaborative.
Their first pictures from the 1930's were on-the-spot shots of local political and social events and of human-interest street scenes, which they submitted to black newspapers. In 1937, a shot by Morgan titled "Robert Day Playing Hi-Li" won honorable mention in a national amateur photo contest, and he was hired by The Amsterdam News as its first staff photographer.
A few years later, however, the Smiths opened their own photo studio next to the Apollo Theater on 125th Street, a location that insured a steady and often illustrious clientele. Entertainers, community leaders and aspiring actresses alike sat for portraits. At the same time, the brothers continued to document the world around them -- its nightlife and politics, weddings and celebrity visits -- and in the process distilled an extraordinary panorama of American life.
"Harlem: The Vision of Morgan and Marvin Smith," culled from the Schomburg Center's photographic archives and the Smith family collection, captures the shape and tenor of their output, beginning with street-level images of uptown life. A subway conductor leans, smiling, from the A train, smartly dressed churchgoers crowd a sidewalk on Easter Sunday, gravity-defying Lindy hoppers shake up the Savoy Ballroom.
It would be difficult to know from these pictures alone that the 30's and 40's were a bad time for black people in America, socially and economically, though elsewhere hints of that reality come through. They are evident in the image of strikers picketing against discriminatory hiring and housing practices, and in an unforgettable portrait of the actress and writer Fredi Washington, wearing an anti-lynching arm band with the chilling emblem of a silhouetted head in a noose.
Portraits like Washington's make up the bulk of the Schomburg show. Many are in classic studio format, scrupulously lighted and posed; others were taken on the fly. But there's no question that a virtual Who's Who of black America at mid-century is on hand.
Counted among the political icons, for example, are W. E. B. DuBois, George Washington Carver (elderly, shy, bright-eyed), the historian Carter G. Woodson and Mary McLeod Bethune, the daughter of former slaves and founder of the National Council of Negro Women.
The writers and performers include well-known figures: Langston Hughes at his typewriter, performance shots of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Fats Waller. But especially memorable are the off-beat surprises: Bill "Bojangles" Robinson tapping his way up Broadway on his 61st birthday, Josephine Baker distributing candy to children, a lithe young Maya Angelou in her days as a Pearl Primus dancer.
Pictures of athletes form a third celebrity category, from Jackie Robinson intently teaching his young son how to hold a bat, to the heavyweight champ Joe Louis sparring in a ring at a training camp. But this shot, like many others, hides a disturbing subtext. Because black journalists were barred from the press box at public athletic events, training camps were the only places the Smiths could observe Louis in action up close.
In fact, despite the cosmopolitan embrace of the Smiths' photographs -- Pablo Picasso, Albert Einstein and Marlene Dietrich are among their subjects -- the world they had immediate access to was narrowly restricted. And while their portraits of New York "firsts" (the city's first black police trooper, first black telegram messengers, first black woman juror) were clearly intended as proud salutes to achievement, they are also sobering reminders of racial barriers slow to fall.
And yet these portraits of precedent-setters are wonderful. Direct, unsentimental, they present their subjects as exactly what they were: everyday heroes, citizens, neighbors and friends down the block who, through a combination of circumstance, intelligence and stick-to-it-iveness, ended up as stars in the ways that really matter.
One gets the same impression of the Smiths themselves in the documentary record of their lives installed in the Schomburg's lobby gallery by the exhibition's curatorial team of Howard Dodson, Retha R. Onitiri, Monica Smith Jr., Roberta Yancy and Mary Yearwood. It includes family photos, paintings, sculptures, journals and documents of the brothers' work in film beginning in the 1950's. There are even examples of needlework produced by Marvin Smith since he retired in 1975. (He still lives in Harlem; Morgan died in 1993.)
Altogether, "Harlem: The Vision of Morgan and Marvin Smith" makes a fascinating tale, and the Schomburg has done a fine job telling it. Most of the photographs are accompanied by succinct, fact-filled texts drawn from a collection of the Smiths' work recently published by the University Press of Kentucky. (The book, lovingly produced, with essays by Gordon Parks Sr. and James A. Miller and a wealth of historical information, is a beauty.) In short, to everyone involved in organizing the project, congratulations are extended, and to the artists, many thanks.
"Harlem: The Vision of Morgan and Marvin Smith" remains at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the New York Public Library, 515 Malcolm X Boulevard at 135th Street, Harlem, through March 29.

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International;
Sports Cars Europe Keeps for Itself

BYLINE: By JAMIE KITMAN 

DATELINE: NORFOLK, England

 BODY:
NOT long after it was invented, the automobile became a prime instrument of human expression. For almost a century, motorists have selected personal transportation in the belief that what they drove held meaning beyond its function.
Today, sport utility vehicles are imagined to confer an aura of action, adventure and environmental awareness on their owners, even if most of their time is spent idling in traffic jams. In an earlier age, drivers who wanted to stand apart often chose sports cars, typically two-seat roadsters with superior handling, performance and economy. 
 Before World War II, the sports car was a toy for the wealthy and a prop for Hollywood stars. But in the postwar years, English marques like MG, Jaguar, Triumph and Austin-Healey, along with Italian nameplates like Alfa Romeo and Fiat, brought affordable sporty motoring to the masses.
With their emphasis on efficient packaging, sure handling and responsive controls, these cars were anomalies in an era of ever-heavier land yachts, Sensing the emergence of a new market, Chevrolet responded with the 1953 Corvette. Ford followed two years later with the two-seat Thunderbird.
The two-seat sports car faded in the 70's and 80's, but signs of its wide-scale return are plentiful. Mazda's nimble Miata was introduced with virtually no competition in 1989 and went on to become the best-selling sports car in history, a development that seems to have switched on the industry's recessive sports car gene. Recent, highly successful introductions of the BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster and Mercedes-Benz SLK suggest that some of the world's leading manufacturers believe the pendulum will reverse.
 Paradoxically, in light of Americans' stature as the world's largest consumers of sports cars, European enthusiasts have some wonderful choices not available in the United States, and more are on the way. A few may eventually make it across the Atlantic in somewhat modified form, though for now a passport is required to sample any of these diminutive driving machines. Furthermore, the huge expense to certify European-market cars for American safety and emissions standards makes it nearly impossible for individuals to buy these cars overseas and bring them home.
 
ALFA ROMEO SPIDER -- Alfa Romeo pulled out of the United States in 1995, and there is no evidence that it plans to come back. Still, a weekend in England in a four-cylinder Spider convinced me that if Alfa ever chose to reverse course, this would make a credible vehicle to spearhead a return.
Front-wheel drive now, with a striking convertible body from the Pininfarina design house and a chassis derived from a Fiat cousin, the Tipo hatchback, Alfa's latest Spider is a roomier, wider and considerably more comfortable car than the rear-wheel-drive machine it replaced. While Alfa's ergonomics were once the butt of jokes, the new Spider can comfortably accommodate a variety of human bodies.
Not as exquisitely precise as the finest rear-wheel-drive cars, including some of the great Alfas of the past, the Spider is nonetheless very satisfying to drive. Its 150-horsepower, variably timed four-cylinder engine offered brisk acceleration and smooth operation on English country lanes, with none of the flat spots or tuning mysteries of its predecessors. The lead-footed will prefer the optional V6, but the added performance comes at the expense of extra weight and slightly less agility.
The new Alfa sells in Britain for the equivalent of $30,000. Its lines are modern Italian design at its most kinetic, offering a vision of a modern sports car with nary a nod to retro cliches, a remarkable achievement in a segment largely consumed with visual tributes to the past.
 
FIAT BARCHETTA -- Alfa's parent company, Fiat, is remembered fondly by some Americans -- and less so by others -- for its 124 and 850 Spiders and the mid-engined X 1/9. Fiat has now returned to the sports car fold with the retro-looking but up-to-the-minute Barchetta.
It, too, is a treat to drive, with the looks and moves of a sports car, the thrifty ways of an economy hatchback and none of its ancestors' tendency to start rusting on the showroom floor. Based on the floor pan of the front-drive Fiat Punto subcompact and featuring the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine from the larger Bravo, the Barchetta has sold well in Europe at around $20,000.
It will not be sold in the United States at all. In spite of American sales that once exceeded 100,000 a year, Fiat withdrew from the market in 1983. Although Fiat's high-end brand, Ferrari, has done well in North America, the small profit margins of a car like the Barchetta make it too costly for Fiat to meet Federal requirements and re-establish a sales channel.
 
LOTUS ELISE -- This light, Spartan car has a gloriously retro skin of molded fiberglass. Beneath the surface, however, lies a clever and notably modern machine that sets new standards for road-holding and inspires considerable technical interest to boot.
With an extruded and bonded aluminum space frame, it is the boldest expression ever of Lotus's signature devotion to light weight. Partly as a result, lowering one's self into the car is a formidable task for those over 25 years old. The seats, also in the name of heft excision, are barely cushioned.
With just 1,570 pounds to lug around -- some 500 less than a Miata -- the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, mounted transversely in the middle of the car, puts the Elise's off-the-line acceleration in the muscle car league. And that is despite its mere 120 horsepower.
The Elise may make make it across the Atlantic in a few years, though company managers are said to be debating what added luxuries Americans would want and what type of redesign this might require. If the build quality is good -- and it was on a car I drove last year -- and if the Elise's basic price in Britain of $27,300 makes the journey overseas, the Elise could do nicely in America.
 
MGF -- Perhaps the best of Europe's practical new sports cars is the MGF, which has sold well in Britain at a starting price of around $24,000. Despite its petite size and demure silhouette, it is quite the best MG ever built. Its road-holding and handling are extraordinary, thanks to the mid-engined placement of its 1.6-liter four-cylinder and an unusually rigid body.
BMW, which acquired rights to the MG name (along with those of Triumph, Austin-Healey and several other British golden oldies) when it purchased the Rover Group, has said it is considering returning to the United States with the MG nameplate in the new century. But the MGF -- which was designed before the BMW takeover -- will not make the trip.
BMW says the car cannot be made to comply with Federal standards. But the company also has its own roadster, the Z3, for which it does not need more competition.

HEADLINE: Pope's Unanswered Request: Put Christmas Back in Cuba

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 11

 BODY:
When they met for the first time a little more than a year ago at the Vatican, Pope John Paul II asked Fidel Castro for a Christmas present: the restoration of Dec. 25 to Cuba's calendar of public holidays.
Since then, one Christmas has gone by. Now, with another less than two weeks away, and only one month to go before the 77-year-old Pope makes his long-awaited trip to one of the world's last Communist redoubts, Mr. Castro has yet to reply. 
 "I don't know if next week we will have a response," said Enrique Gonzales, a spokesman at the Cuban Embassy to the Holy See. "We can't say whether it will be a reality. It is a political decision that will be taken at a high level."
In the intervening silence, the Vatican seems to be stepping up the pressure on the Cuban Government on this and other outstanding details about the Pope's five-day visit, which is to start on Jan. 21. At a news conference in Havana on Tuesday, Jaime Cardinal Ortega repeated the Pope's request for a Christmas holiday, and asked again for live access to the state-run media during the Pope's tour.
As a master of the political surprise, Mr. Castro may make his decision on the Christmas holiday at the last minute, Cuba experts say. "I wouldn't be surprised if the President, as a gesture of good faith, makes these changes to the calendar," said Bishop Roberto Gonzales, of Corpus Christi, Texas, a close observer of the Roman Catholic Church's lurching recovery in Cuba.
The Cuban Government has already ceded on some points pressed by the Vatican before the Pope's trip. It has granted more visas to visiting priests and nuns, and has agreed to let Cardinal Ortega appear on state television to explain the scope of the Pope's coming visit.
The Pope, who will spend each night of his stay in Havana, is scheduled to make day trips to Santa Clara, Camaguey and Santiago de Cuba, and to conclude his visit with a Mass in Havana's Revolution Square. He is due to have a private meeting with Mr. Castro on Jan. 22, at the Palace of the Revolution.
One key issue, raised by church officials during negotiations between the Cuban Government and the Vatican over details of the trip, is the provision of public transportation to and from the Pope's far-flung Masses and public appearances, in a country of uncertain bus service.
But of all the final points still awaiting an answer from Havana, none has the symbolic power of Christmas -- a holiday that was excised from the Cuban calendar in 1969, at a time when the island was pushing to bring in a record sugar-cane crop.
Now, unlike in every other country in the Western Hemisphere, on Dec. 25 Cuban children go to school and their parents to work.
Before the 1959 revolution, Cuba was predominantly Catholic. In the Communist era, the Cuban church has been stifled by the one-party state; its properties were nationalized, its schools were closed, many of its priests were jailed.
Still, Cuban authorities insist that dropping Christmas from the calendar was not intended as a blow against the church. "It was a problem of 30 years ago, when the revolution was still under way," said Mr. Gonzales. "It was also for economic reasons," he added, noting that the celebration of the revolution takes place a week after Christmas, on Jan. 1. "It was difficult to have people not working for so many days."

HEADLINE: Asian Import Prices Plunge By Extremely Strong 1.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
As holiday shopping reaches full swing, the Asian financial crisis is helping drive down the price of imports to this country, with goods from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore dropping by an exceptionally strong 1.2 percent in November, the Government reported today.
These products account for 11 percent of all imports to the United States. Japan, whose products were three-tenths of 1 percent less costly last month, accounts for an additional 17 percent. 
 "For American consumers, it's a great deal," said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist at the Fleet Financial Group in Hartford.
With inflation already down to about 2 percent -- even less when allowance is made for overstatement -- the Federal Reserve has been able to avoid raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay.
And the turmoil in Asia is another reason for the Fed to make no change in interest rates, despite the tight labor market, because lower American exports to Asia should cut economic growth next year by half a percentage point or more.
Higher rates, analysts said, would not only aggravate the Asian distress by further weakening Asian currencies but would also risk slowing the American economy too much.
Indeed, more evidence emerged that the economy was slowing on its own. Retail sales climbed a lackluster two-tenths of 1 percent in November, the Commerce Department said. This was only enough to erase a same-size decline the month before.
"The consumer has slowed down a good bit from the third quarter," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist for Prudential Securities. He added, however, that while pent-up demand for cars and other vehicles had been satisfied, strong consumer confidence and ability to buy were likely to prevent a slump.
Still another Government report today showed that the labor market remained tight. First-time claims for jobless benefits totaled 311,000 last week, with the four-week average edging down 500, to 318,250.
But it was the falling cost of imported goods that captured much of the attention. Over all, these prices retreated three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the most since some sharp declines at the beginning of the year because of a skidding price of oil. Not counting petroleum, import prices edged down one-tenth of 1 percent last month to bring the 12-month decline to 2.3 percent.
The biggest change was the 1.2 percent drop in Asian prices, which was the biggest since the Labor Department began keeping monthly records in 1992 and four times the average decline for August through October.
"There is a great deal of incentive for these countries to export their way out of trouble," said Greg Mount, international economist at First Chicago NBD. The dollar's strength relative to their currencies makes this possible.
China, the chief foreign source of toys and holiday decorations, is lumped in the statistics with "developing countries," a category that showed a nine-tenths of 1 percent price decline last month. A worldwide product grouping of toys, games and sporting equipment showed no price change last month after small declines in the three preceding months when the bulk of seasonal goods arrived.
Importers of the goods, some of which are only components, might pass on part or all of their lower costs to consumers.
The retail sales results, covering one-third of the economy, showed increases of two-tenths of 1 percent for both durable goods -- cars and other items designed to last at least three years -- and nondurables. Total spending was $213.82 billion in November, 3.8 percent more than in November 1996 without any adjustment for inflation.
Before seasonal adjustment, however, sales last month declined slightly. The Commerce Department's tally showed a 1.3 percent sales gain for merchants selling furniture and other home equipment, a two-tenths of 1 percent gain for automotive dealers and an eight-tenths of 1 percent decline for stores selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes.
Among nondurables, drugstores gained 1.8 percent, clothing stores 1.2 percent, food stores four-tenths of 1 percent and department stores and other general merchandisers one-tenth of 1 percent.
Receipts at gasoline stations fell five-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting lower prices, while those of restaurants and bars eased three-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Transformation in the Bronx

 BODY:
The new South Bronx was on display this week when President Clinton visited spanking-clean neighborhoods that were burnt-out relics as recently as 15 years ago. Dismembered by highway construction in the 1950's, abandoned by the middle class in the 60's and torched by arsonists in the 70's, the Bronx was salvaged by community groups that rousted drug dealers and reclaimed the borough street by street. Nonprofit organizations then developed thousands of affordable homes and apartments, using state, city and Federal funds in concert with programs that allow corporations to reduce tax liabilities by contributing to projects for the poor.
Mr. Clinton was right when he called the Bronx a national model for urban revitalization. But with all levels of government doing less in housing, the tax credit program has had to carry more and more of the burden. The obvious success in the Bronx has encouraged participation from banks that would have avoided the borough in the past. Financial institutions have now contributed $250 million to an equity fund jointly developed by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the Enterprise Foundation, the country's two largest operators in the low-income housing business. In partnership with New York City, these two organizations will build 5,000 new units over the next three years. In addition, they are now exporting Bronx know-how to other communities in New York City and across the country. 
 In the Bronx itself, the next step is to employ Federal loans in an attempt to replace businesses that fled during the fire and chaos of the 1970's. Creating businesses is more difficult than building houses. But if the participants work as diligently during the next decade as they have in the past, the enterprise has an excellent chance.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Clock Ticks at Trade Talks With Focus on U.S. Demand

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 11

 BODY:
All eyes are now on the United States, as negotiators from more than 100 countries try to hammer out a global trade agreement here to remove national barriers in banking, insurance and securities by midnight Friday.
In a role that is becoming almost typecast, the United States is once again playing the world's bad cop by threatening to walk away from a treaty unless it gets what it wants. The United States is demanding that countries in Asia and Latin America make it easier for American financial companies to do business there. 
 Today, trade officials and business executives here predicted that the countries would reach a deal. Having walked out of the last round of talks two years ago, the United States has already pressured dozens of countries to sweeten their commitments on opening their markets.
American officials said that at this point the odds favored a deal, but that a successful outcome was by no means a certainty. They said they had received encouraging offers from a number of countries, but that they still had problems with others, including Japan and Malaysia.
But this time the gamesmanship has been clouded by two new problems: the financial crisis sweeping Asia and anger among some American politicians toward the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based organization that would enforce the trade agreement. Last week, a panel of the W.T.O. infuriated members of Congress when it rejected the Eastman Kodak Company's high-profile complaint about barriers to the Japanese film market.
A lot is at stake. International bond offerings have doubled in the last five years and will probably total $1 trillion in 1997, according the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Companies now list their shares on stock exchanges around the world, institutional investors have ballooned in size and international currency trading runs to more than $1 trillion every day.
Although the United States, Europe and Japan now have relatively open financial markets, countries in Southeast Asia and Latin American giants like Brazil remain much more closed. It is still illegal for foreigners to have majority control of banks or brokerage firms in Indonesia, and many countries hinder foreign companies with regulations from which local operators are exempt.
The Asian crisis may actually nudge countries toward agreement. With currency and stock markets plunging from Indonesia to South Korea, leaders from Asia and the United States worry that a collapse of the talks might further alarm investors.
Though a few countries like Malaysia have angrily blamed international currency speculators for their problems, most Asian countries have offered more liberal terms for an agreement out of heightened desperation to increase confidence among foreign investors.
The Asian crisis has also complicated the American bargaining position. The biggest fights as the deadline approaches are between the United States and countries like Korea and Malaysia. But trade negotiators say the American negotiators have not been as truculent as usual, apparently because they are worried about pushing too hard on behalf of United States business.
The second new complication arises out of American politics. Spurred in part by the ruling against Kodak, which had complained that Japanese business arrangements prevented it from obtaining a bigger market share in that country, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, warned the Clinton Administration not to enter any deals that would "unwisely handicap" American companies.
Negotiations have also been bogged down in a fight involving Malaysia and the big American insurer American International Group Inc. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who has stridently blamed international speculators for derailing Asian currencies, has steadfastly refused to let foreign companies own more than 51 percent of Malaysian insurance carriers.
A.I.G., based in New York, owned 100 percent of several insurance companies before that restriction ever went into effect. Though A.I.G. has not been told to reduce its ownership, it has insisted that Malaysia include an explicit "grandfather" clause in its trade proposal -- a demand that Malaysia has refused.
Under the negotiation process, each country puts forward its own offer of the rules it will adopt within its borders. The countries do not have to agree on the same rules; they simply make a legal commitment to stick by the rules they put forward. The agreement goes into force if the countries attending find each other's proposals acceptable.
Because the American market is so big, the operating premise for all negotiators is that there can be no agreement without the United States. If the countries fail to reach an agreement by midnight Friday, they can revoke their offers and the negotiations will come to an end.

HEADLINE: Havel's Silver Tongue Lashes Out at Czech Political Scandals

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Vaclav Havel, the Czech President, is one of the world's most sought-after speechmakers. He has made speeches, with soaring ideas and rich language, before European business leaders, American students and Asian human-rights advocates.
But this week, when Mr. Havel turned toward the political crisis at home, what he had to say was anything but lofty. 
 In his annual speech to Parliament on Tuesday, according to a transcript, Mr. Havel directly attacked a situation in which power was "again in the hands of untrustworthy figures whose primary concern is their personal advancement instead of the interests of the people."
He lamented a state in which the "biggest success could be achieved by the most immoral." And he questioned the "strange role" of Czech banks: "They indirectly own companies that are operating at a loss, and the more the companies lose, the more money the banks lend them."
Mr. Havel did not mention Vaclav Klaus, the Prime Minister, who was forced to resign last week because of a financial scandal in his Civic Democratic Party. But it is clear that Mr. Klaus, who has been criticized by financial experts at home and abroad for privatization policies that have led to widespread corruption, was his prime target.
Soon after Mr. Havel finished speaking, Mr. Klaus hit back, saying the President failed to understand "the functioning of a market economy and a free society eight years after the fall of Communism."
Mr. Havel's searing speech was almost as much of a political sensation as the fall of Mr. Klaus.
Not all of the President's admirers approved of it. The former Interior Minister, Jan Ruml, who like Mr. Havel was a dissident during the Communist era, said the speech was too harsh. "We are not all criminals," Mr. Ruml said, referring to the Civic Democratic Party, of which he is a member.
Others asked why Mr. Havel had not tried to influence Mr. Klaus's economic strategies two years ago when corruption among Czech business executives involved in the privatization of state companies became evident.
In a vexed tone that he maintained through his hourlong speech, Mr. Havel chastised Czech politicians for excessive pride and unnecessary provincialism.
But Mr. Havel did not limit himself to the economic and political turmoil. He emphasized what he called the poverty of "human relations" and "culture" in the Czech Republic.
"I am afraid this is a sphere where we have most of our debts to pay and most of our work to do," he said. "Culture in the broadest sense is not measured by the number of splendid rock stars who visit this country, or by the beauty of dresses by prominent designers presented here by world-class models."
Instead, he said, culture is measured by what is "chanted by skinheads in a pub, by the number of lynched or murdered Romany people, by the dreadful behavior of some of our people toward their fellow humans simply because of the different color of their skin." Romany is what many Gypsies call themselves.
He also criticized the Government for failing to convince Czechs of the wisdom of joining NATO. "It is all the more unfortunate that we have so far seemed unable to convey this message to our citizens convincingly enough," he said. "Maybe this was also due to the unfortunate emphasis on pure economy."

HEADLINE: Worry on Asia Sends Stocks Down Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market tumbled for the fourth straight session yesterday as worries spread that the economic slowdown in Asia would depress corporate earnings. But some stock analysts argued that other, potentially bigger problems were beginning to arise in the United States.
Before Wall Street opened, sharp declines in the world's major stock markets set the tone for the day. Investors looking to reduce their risk helped push the yield on the 30-year bond, a traditional haven, briefly below 6 percent. It ended the day at 6.00 percent, down from 6.07 percent. 
 In the stock market, technology issues accounted for much of the pain. I.B.M. fell 4 7/8, to 101 5/8; Intel Corporation was off 2 7/8, to 71 13/16, and Microsoft declined 3 3/16, to 139 1/16. After the market closed, a Federal judge ordered the company temporarily to stop a controversial market practice that antitrust officials are seeking to halt. General Electric, down 1 1/4, to 72, also led the stock market lower. All of these companies get a significant portion of their revenues from abroad.
But Asia did not do all of the damage. The Quantum Corporation, the disk drive maker, said its third-quarter earnings would be well short of expectations because of falling prices for hard drives, something analysts attribute in part to oversupply and a decline in domestic demand for computers. Quantum's stock fell 3 7/8, to 19 15/16.
Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, acknowledged that Asia's slowdown would be a drag on big corporations that do business there, but said he is more worried about the United States next year. Slower sales growth here and rising costs, like wages, could reduce earnings.
"I see a lot more bombs in domestic companies," he said, referring to companies that derive most of their earnings in the United States. Earnings disappointments being pinned on Asia may really be a result of problems in the United States, he added.
For example, he said he was surprised by the problems in the United States business of the Oracle Corporation, whose stock fell 29 percent after announcing on Monday that its earnings would not meet expectations. Oracle fell again yesterday, ending at 21 15/16, down 1 1/2.
No one is denying the impact of Asia's financial crisis, which some economists are saying could shave a full percentage point off United States economic growth next year.
Among the industries considered vulnerable are financial services. Bank stocks tumbled again yesterday as investors considered a stream of reports, including J. P. Morgan's on Wednesday, that showed an earnings disapointment.
Mr. Acuff noted that stocks were coming under additional pressure from portfolio managers who were trying to protect their good returns for the year. This means that many of them are selling now to avoid losing any more of their gains if the market continues to tumble.
In trading yesterday, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index got the worst of it, plunging 2.4 percent, or 38.07 points, to 1,558.54. The Dow Jones industrial averge fell 1.6 percent, or 129.80 points, to 7,848.99. And the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 1.5 percent, or 14.85 points, to 954.94. In the last four days, the S.& P. has lost all it gained last week when the index reached a new all-time high Friday.
In Asia, South Korea's composite index slumped 5.6 percent, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong plunged 5.5 percent. In Japan the Nikkei index dropped 2.6 percent. The major markets in Europe were down about 2 percent or more, with the Financial Times index in London off almost 95 points, to 5,035.90; the DAX index in Frankfurt down 100 points, to 4,016.70, and the CAC index in Paris almost 104 points lower at 2,828.45.
For the last several weeks the battle in the stock market has been between hope versus Asia, and this week Asia has won out.
The rally that took the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks to a high last Friday seemed to be built on the hope that Asia's woes would slow U.S. economic growth enough so that the Federal Reserve would not have to raise interest rates but not so much as to hurt corporate earnings.
But this week investors have heard warnings from Oracle, Quantum and J. P. Morgan.
The Asia story, said Douglas R. Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, was "front-loaded with good news but backloaded with bad news."
James Clunie, the investment manager at Murray Johnstone International in Glasgow, said, "The markets want to go up because there is a lot of money to be put to work, but they are now facing harsher and harsher fundamental news."
Though off from the October pace, inflows into stock mutual funds were strong last month. The Investment Company Institute yesterday estimated the net inflows at $13.5 billion, down 26 percent from the previous month. The report attributed part of the decline to withdawals from international stock funds.
The report also showed heavy buying of bond funds, with an estimated net inflow of $8 billion in November, up from $3.7 billion in October. The conversion of some unit trusts to bond funds contributed to the $8 billion increase, the I.C.I. noted.
Robert Adler, the president of AMG Data Services, which also tracks mutual funds, said he had also picked up a strong surge in bond funds, with the pace picking up to an average of $1.2 billion a week for the four weeks ended Dec. 3.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Presses Democrats to Focus on the Needs of Families

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Senator Edward M. Kennedy called upon Democrats today to use the nation's economic vigor to help struggling families secure higher wages, good educations and basic health care.
The Senator from Massachusetts scoffed at reports of a rift between the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, and President Clinton, saying the party's internal differences were trivial compared to its differences with the Republicans. 
 "The American people don't care about New Democrat or Old Democrat," said Mr. Kennedy, the party's best-known liberal, adding there is room for differing views. "They care about the quality of their lives."
"If this country can't fulfill the hopes and answer the needs of average families in a time of peace and prosperity, when will we ever do so?" Mr. Kennedy asked. "If as Democrats, we are true to our principles, we will seize this opportunity to shape a common agenda that unites us across any differences around the values that are the very ground of our party's being."
Speaking at the National Press Club, Mr. Kennedy proposed a Democratic agenda in Congress next year.
First off, Mr. Kennedy said, he plans to push for increases in the minimum wage, which was raised to $5.15 an hour two years ago after battles between Democrats and Republicans. Under his plan, the minimum wage would be increased to $6.65 an hour by the year 2000, and then be tied to the cost of living.
Mr. Kennedy said inflation continues to outpace the minimum wage, making it almost impossible for families to make ends meet. Full-time minimum-wage workers earn $10,712 a year, he said.
"I'm optimistic that we will succeed," Mr. Kennedy said, "because Republicans have learned that it is dangerous to resist a Democratic increase in the minimum wage in an election year."
As lawmakers maneuver to stake out positions on next year's ground-breaking tobacco legislation, Mr. Kennedy renewed his push to raise the Federal tax on a pack of cigarettes by $1.50 to help curb teen-age smoking.
That increase, Mr. Kennedy said, would raise $20 billion a year for medical research and children's programs, including Head Start, but would also set off a blitz by the formidable tobacco lobby.
This summer, Mr. Kennedy along with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, beat back the tobacco lobby to win a 15-cent tax increase on tobacco to help finance children's health insurance.
Mr. Kennedy said he would re-introduce a bill that would require every employer to contribute to the cost of health insurance for workers and their families. The initiative would be tied to a health care "Bill of Rights" meant to protect patients from the more egregious aspects of managed care, he said.
It is one issue that Republican leaders believe "is getting away from them," Mr. Kennedy said, referring to abuses in managed care.
The Senator also attacked a showcase Republican proposal to simplify the tax code by creating a flat income tax or a national sales tax.
Mr. Kennedy advocated a saving of a different kind, zeroing in on the Social Security payroll tax. At present, all wage-earners pay a tax of 6.2 percent into Social Security on wages up to $65,400 a year. He proposed removing the cap, so all wages would be subject to the tax. The move would lower the tax rate by 5.3 percent, he said, and provide a tax cut for people who earn less than $80,000 a year. Wealthy people would contribute a higher share.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Talk of Tougher Medicine for Korea's Ills

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
A week after the world came to South Korea's rescue with $57 billion in emergency aid, the country's economic troubles have worsened so rapidly that officials here fear that far more drastic steps may be needed to stop financial hemorrhaging that is already threatening world markets.
The initial financial bailout organized by the International Monetary Fund, with the United States and Japan agreeing to provide a second line of defense if needed, was called a "stabilization package." But so far, the result has been closer to financial panic. By late tonight, the South Korean currency, the won, had fallen 34 percent since Dec. 3, the day the bailout was announced -- more than it fell for 1997 through the beginning of this month. 
 Because the I.M.F. required officials in Seoul to disclose monetary statistics that were previously hidden -- forcing them to acknowledge that the country was nearly out of cash to pay short-term debts -- credit-rating agencies downgraded Korean debt to a level close to junk-bond status.
That, in turn, is undercutting the main objective of the I.M.F. in the country's rescue program: to convince private investors that it is safe to lend money to South Korea and to its humbled industrial giants. Without that confidence, the Korean Development Bank was forced to back away today from a $2 billion bond offering intended to alleviate an acute repayment crisis.
In public, American officials maintain that markets always go to extremes and that if South Korea enacts the financial changes it promises, investors will be back.
In private, though, they are rattled. When the United States bailed out Mexico in 1995, the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo quickly took Draconian steps. But South Korea is seven days away from a presidential election, in which leading candidates are promising in newspaper advertisements to renegotiate some of the terms of an international deal that many Koreans regard as humiliating.
And until a new government is assembled, a senior Clinton Administration official said, "there is almost no one in authority to talk to."
Instead, there is growing distrust -- and sometimes open hostility -- between Washington and a seemingly paralyzed Government in Seoul.
"In Mexico, we were dealing with an economic team that was outstanding, with a longstanding relationship with the country's President and economic decision-makers who were competent, well knit and long established," said Jeffrey R. Shafer, former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and a key official in arranging the Mexican bailout. "They played a major role in reassuring the markets by taking some very stiff steps."
No one in the Clinton Administration is using such phrases to describe the lame-duck Government of President Kim Young Sam. Relations between President Kim and American officials have been strained for years, chiefly over Mr. Kim's wavering about how to deal with a suspected North Korean nuclear program.
But relations have reached new lows in recent days, especially after Seoul's new Finance Minister, Lim Chang Yuel, used an interview with The New York Times to appeal to the United States and Japan to provide their backup financing immediately. That created a sense in the markets that the South Korean financial situation had turned dire.
Such statements have prompted many investors -- including some in South Korea -- to move their money out of the country quickly. The result is a cycle in which bad news begets a faster rush for the exits, which in turn worsens Korea's cash squeeze.
So far, the country's immediate problem lies in the crushing debts of its banks and huge industrial groups, known as chaebol, rather than in Government debts. The Government itself, experts note, is relatively free of debt, making this situation dramatically different from the crises that afflicted Mexico in 1994-95 or several Latin American countries in the 1980's.
Yet there is talk about the possibility of a national default, out of fear that the Korean Government will cave in to political pressure and rescue failing institutions -- a step toward which Japan is headed. The difference is that Japan has a war chest of more than $230 billion in Treasury bonds and other reserves to turn to. South Korea has none.
To market professionals, the answer seems obvious: Officials in Seoul have to let failing enterprises fail, the first step toward rationalizing a bloated economy and insuring that investors who made poor decisions pay the price. But market professionals do not have to worry about Korean politics, pride and culture, as Korean politicians do.
In Seoul, the capital, it has always been difficult to discern the difference between the Government and the giant steelmakers, car companies, semiconductor producers and banks. The businesses have long been directed by South Korea's industrial planners. And in turn, they have financed the country's military leaders and, for the last decade, the two Governments that were freely elected.
Those connections are not easily broken, especially in a country like South Korea, where economic strength and national strength are considered inseparable.
And with an election seven days away, there is a clear expectation there that the new government should step in to prevent bankruptcies and mass layoffs. That is exactly what the I.M.F. wants to head off.
American officials were alarmed when the Finance and Economy Ministry said this week that it would invest nearly $1 billion in two failing banks, giving the Government 59 percent ownership in those institutions.
"It was one of a series of dubious decisions," an American official said today, "that have been surrounded with a lot of ill-though-out pronouncements."
Investors are responding to a flood of disclosures about South Korea's low foreign-currency reserves, misleading statements about the size of its foreign debt, and hesitation to take politically unpopular steps before the election.
If there are no more surprises, and no major bank failures that begin to shake other emerging markets, the worst could be over.
A more pessimistic possibility is that more surprises are buried inside a Finance Ministry known for extraordinary secrecy, and that Korea's new government may balk at the possibility of a public backlash against austerity. In that case, last week's $57 billion package could come to be known as the first South Korean bailout.

HEADLINE: THE CLIMATE ACCORD: THE OUTLOOK;
Despite Pact, Gases Will Keep Rising

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In a corner of the tiled tunnel leading from a subway stop to the Kyoto International Conference Hall, the kindergarten children of Kyoto left a message for delegates to the climate conference here this week.
Their message was an assemblage of miniature trees and flowers accompanied by a small sign. "The Kyoto people are praying for the success of this conference," the sign said. "The future of all people, especially the children, depends largely on the outcome of this conference." 
 But even if it is ultimately ratified, the agreement to cut emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that emerged today from 10 days of high-stakes politicking will not secure those children, or their children, from the climatic disruptions that mainstream scientists say lie ahead. Participating countries could obey its emission limits to the letter, and atmospheric levels of the gases, produced chiefly by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, would continue to rise.
The Kyoto Protocol does make a start, however. It would establish at least the foundation of an institutional framework and accompanying mechanisms for dealing with the problem in coming decades. And it signals business and industry that the issue is here to stay, that the ways in which energy is produced and used must change, and that these issues should be taken into consideration in planning and investing for the long term.
The burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the energy mainstays of the modern economy, produces waste carbon dioxide that remains in the atmosphere, trapping heat. If nothing is done to limit emission of these gases, scientists advising the delegates here say, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if the world pursues business as usual. (By comparison, the world is now only 5 to 9 degrees warmer than in the depths of the last ice age.) The scientists say this much warming would bring rising seas, more severe droughts, rainstorms, heat waves and floods, together with broad shifts in climatic and agricultural zones that would benefit some regions but seriously harm others.
The Kyoto Protocol legally binds industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse emissions, collectively, by an annual average of about 5 percent below 1990 levels for the period 2008 through 2012 -- a 30 percent reduction below what they would otherwise be. Some are to cut more than that, some less, and a few will be allowed to let their emissions grow because of special circumstances. Among the industrialized big three, the United States must reduce its emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels, the 15-nation European Union 8 percent and Japan 6 percent.
But even if the countries adopt and adhere to these standards, an uncertain prospect, they will only be slowing the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. As a result, many experts believe that it may already be too late to avoid serious climatic disruption, that the task ahead is one of keeping it from becoming truly catastrophic.
Although there are dissenters, many scientists now predict that unless far more drastic action is taken, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, the major contributor to climate change, will double sometime late in the next century from the pre-industrial levels of the late 18th century.
Atmospheric levels of cardon dioxide are now about 360 parts per million, and many experts say it will be difficult, if not impossible, to stabilize them at 550 parts per million, close to a doubling of pre-industrial concentrations. Though it is difficult to predict exactly what climate changes would result from such a doubling, there is wide agreement that they would be highly disruptive.
Predictably, the fossil fuel industry warned that the Kyoto cuts would bring economic pain, while some environmentalists said they did not go far enough. Other environmentalists and many business interests hailed the protocol as a solid agreement that would make the economy more efficient and boost growth in the long term. Only time will tell who is right.
What seems clearer is that ordinary Americans will notice little immediate impact on their everyday lives. If it is able to win Senate approval of the agreement, the Clinton Administration intends to phase in domestic measures to meet the Kyoto target over time, starting with the provision of financial incentives, tax cuts and cooperative government-industry efforts to accelerate the use of energy-efficient technologies.
After a decade or so of experience, according to the Clinton plan, the United States would inaugurate the centerpiece of its emissions-cutting strategy and a principle hard-won here: emissions trading. Under this arrangement, a cap would be set on permissible carbon-dioxide emissions. Companies that reduce their emissions more than required could sell the excess emissions, at a profit, to those that exceed the cap.
The Administration argues that use of this mechanism for reducing industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide has shown that it achieves more emissions cuts at lower cost.
But emissions trading emerged as one of the most contentious items here, almost torpedoing the talks. After a bitter 11th-hour debate, the developing nations agreed to an international trading mechanism for developed countries. But they fear that trading would allow rich countries to buy their way out of reduction obligations, so it remains to be seen whether they will agree to the regulations necessary to make it work. The issue will be debated in the next round of climate talks, scheduled to begin in Buenos Aires in November.
Another innovative mechanism approved here is an international fund through which rich countries could invest in specific emissions-saving projects in developing countries. The two countries involved would share in the resulting emissions credits.
Apart from that, the Kyoto agreement did little about the future involvement of developing countries. While everyone recognizes that their growing greenhouse emissions will ultimately require them to submit to binding limits, the poorer countries have refused to accept them until the richer countries show the way with action. The question remains a subject for future negotiations.
Because the new protocol does so little about developing countries, it is unclear whether the Administration will sign it, and there are very grave doubts that the Senate would approve it. But President Clinton has said he will proceed with his domestic plans for emissions reduction in the meantime. Beyond that, the Kyoto Protocol is about the long term, and the United States could join it at any time in the years immediately ahead if conditions are right.
The 10 days of sleepless negotiations may well have established a adjustable instrument that in coming decades can respond to emerging new knowledge about both the science and economics of the problem -- if the governments of the world buy into it seriously.
Should they do so, the descendants of those Kyoto kindergartners and others like them throughout the world may have cause to be grateful.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "AT A GLANCE: The Climate Accord"
REDUCTIONS -- Thirty-eight industrial nations are required to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. The European Union would reduce emissions by 8 percent, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6 percent. Some countries would face smaller reductions, and a few would not face any now. As a group, the nations would cut emissions of such gases by slightly more than 5 percent below 1990 levels.
GASES INVOLVED -- Emissions of six gases would be affected: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and three halocarbons used as substitutes for ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons.
TRADING EMISSION RIGHTS --Countries that do not meet their own emission targets can strike deals with nations that do better than required, to buy the excess quota. This may encourage reductions to be made where they are most cost-effective. Details of this plan will be negotiated at a meeting next November in Buenos Aires.
ENFORCEMENT -- A later meeting of the treaty parties will decide on appropriate and effective ways to deal with noncompliance.
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES -- Developing countries, including major greenhouse-gas emitters like China and India, are asked to set voluntary reduction targets.
RATIFICATION -- The accord approved by the Kyoto conference takes effect once it is ratified by at least 55 nations that represent at least 55 percent of 1990 carbon dioxide emissions. The terms are binding on an individual country only after its government ratifies the accord.

Korea Delays Bond Sale, Rattling World Markets
The crisis in South Korea worsened as the country's largest state-owned bank abruptly postponed an important bond sale, meaning that South Korea must come up with other ways to pay or renegotiate billions of dollars in debts coming due in the next few weeks.
 
 The delay of the $2 billion bond sale rattled financial markets around the world and raised the possibility that South Korea might become the first Asian nation to default on its debts since an economic crisis began in the region last summer. Page A1.
 
Asian Import Prices Fall
The Asian financial crisis reduced the price of imports to this country from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore by 1.2 percent in November. It was the sharpest drop since the Labor Department began keeping monthly records in 1992 and four times the average decline for August through October. Products from the four account for 11 percent of all imports to the United States. Another Government report said retail sales climbed a lackluster two-tenths of 1 percent. D2.
 
Bank Wins New Power on Bonds
A Salt Lake City bank, Zions Bancorporation, has won approval from Federal regulators to use a new system to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. The system allows national banks to establish or expand subsidiaries to market new products and services, which could include securities and insurance products. Zions's application could be the model for other banks to follow. D2.
 
Japan Bailout Plan Gains Support
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan appears to have prevailed in winning over support in his party for a plan to raise 10 trillion yen to bolster the Japanese banking system. Opposition to the plan within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party faded after Mr. Hashimoto promised that none of the money would be used for a tax cut or some other stimulant that violated the party's pledge of fiscal austerity. D4.

Global Finance Trade Pact Advances
Negotiators from more than 100 countries are trying to work out a global trade agreement to end barriers in banking, insurance and securities before the deadline Friday. Trade officials and business executives in Geneva predicted yesterday that the countries would reach a deal. D5.

Kyoto Accord's Impact
The Kyoto agreement on controlling gases that contribute to global warming will, if approved by the Senate, have a sweeping impact on business and consumers. Solar and wind power and other alternative energies may become more cost-effective if fossil fuel prices rise sharply. A16.
 
Nasdaq Reins in Bulletin Board
The National Association of Securities Dealers moved to impose new rules on OTC Bulletin Board, the forum for the shares of almost 7,000 tiny companies. The Bulletin Board is also home to most of the stocks that have played starring roles in some highly publicized securities frauds in which investors have lost millions. Market Place. D8.

Safety Conference on Light Trucks
Many vexing problems concerning the safety of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks were discussed at a two-day meeting of nearly 200 auto industry engineers and regulators in Dearborn, Mich. A1.

HEADLINE: Diamond District Tries to Dispel Its Private Bazaar Image

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
It is just a block of 47th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, but its importance in the international diamond trade has been equated for 50 years to that of Wall Street in stocks and bonds and Broadway in the musical theater. So is the luster of 47th Street fading?
Apparently so, according to several of the more than 100 diamond merchants, cutters and industry executives who braced against a chilly bluster yesterday to watch Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani inaugurate the city's newest, and by far its smallest, business improvement district. 
 Like the more than 35 other districts established by commercial property owners around the city, the 47th Street Business Improvement District will pay for several new services -- private security guards, street cleaning and the installation of new diamond-shaped street lights -- that are intended to enhance property values.
But the comparisons basically end there.
Executives said the impetus for such a designation on 47th Street, where more than 2,500 diamond industry companies are crammed into a single block, has less to do with real estate values and more to do with image.
They point to a block still perceived by many as a seller's bazaar, where zealous merchants employ a centuries-old sales technique: using price tags as a mere starting point for bargaining and sometimes leaving customers uneasy with such traditions feeling shunned or exploited.
Several merchants said yesterday that one of the chief purposes of the new district is to make 47th Street more attractive to retail customers, who in the past have been far outnumbered by wholesale buyers.
"We have been too closed," said Richard Winick, a partner in Manny Winick and Son, one of the block's retail staples. "There are a lot of people who would walk into Tiffany's and pay $15,000 for a diamond without even visiting 47th Street, and that is something we have to address."
The president of the newly formed district, Howard Herman, one of the street's most prominent diamond merchants, said the image of 47th Street as a bastion of Jewish control and tradition has become both inaccurate and harmful to business.
"The problem is not who we are," Mr. Herman said. "The street is a very diverse place, with people from India, China, Puerto Rico and other countries, but somehow there is a lasting impression among the public that in order to be in the diamond business you have to wear a long black coat and a beard."
Such was the subtext among those who gathered for what has become a typically boisterous appearance by Mayor Giuliani, this one featuring praise for the improvement district's founders while he posed for the assembled news photographers in an offbeat version of a ribbon-cutting.
Instead of a ribbon, the Mayor went through the motions of cutting a large diamond, one which had been so painstakingly prepared for him by 47th Street's professionals that he needed only tap it like a boiled egg for it to split neatly in two.
"We plan to make the diamond district sparkle once again," he said, unable to resist the pun.
But perhaps more symbolic of the district's approach is the background of the executive it has hired as the only full-time staff member: Terrence Clark, an African-American whose 20-year career has been in jobs programs and economic development agencies of New York State and the Federal Government, not in the diamond industry.
"The major idea is to make this a better business environment and a friendlier place for buyers," he said yesterday. Mr. Clark said that part of his job would be to field questions from tourists and shoppers who are unfamiliar with the dense layout of 47th Street's shops and showrooms, many of them two or three stories above street level.
Among the immediate plans of the district, whose members have agreed to pay $900,000 for street improvements and services, are to erect four 30-foot-high pylons -- two at each end of the block -- that would support large diamond-shaped lights.
Mr. Clark said those fixtures, and other new street lights along the extent of the block, would be installed in the spring.
The district has hired a four-member private security force to patrol the block during business hours, he said, and will soon employ a sanitation worker to pick up litter.
But while those services are similar to what are being offered by other business improvement districts, where property owners simply augment the work of the city, other projects planned by the 47th Street group go further. In order to attract wholesale diamond buyers who attend trade shows at the Jacob K. Javits Center, Mr. Clark said, the group plans to provide shuttle buses when the shows are in session.
And to attract retail buyers from outside New York City, he said, it plans a marketing campaign to encourage travel agencies and tour companies to include the diamond district on the itineraries of visitors.
"Why not include 47th Street on tours just like Lincoln Center or Madison Square Garden?" he said.
To be sure, the 47th Street diamond merchants have not lost their distinction as one of the nation's most highly concentrated industries.
According to the Diamond Dealers Club, a group of 2,000 executives, most of them based on 47th Street, more than 95 percent of the diamonds imported to the United States last year were first handled on the street, either to be cut into finished jewelry or sold in the street's retail shops and wholesale showrooms.
For those who know the rules of the street, the sheer volume can mean bargains. "From what I can see, you are paying far less than retail here," said Margaret Ruden, a Manhattan cosmetics industry executive who was shopping for jewelry on 47th Street late yesterday.
"But you have to be an educated buyer," she said. "People can be deterred if they are not familiar with New York City."
And the diamond merchants who have created the new 47th Street district said it is precisely those who are not familiar with the city -- or at least the rules of their street -- whom they need to attract.
"If you just look up and down this street you find an unparalleled selection," said Michael Eigen, a diamond merchant whose grandfather and great-grandfather preceded him on 47th Street. "But we have to find a way to attract more new faces."

Korea Situation Deteriorates, Raising Specter of a Default

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
South Korea plunged deeper into crisis yesterday when its largest state-owned bank abruptly postponed an effort to raise $2 billion to help pay billions of dollars in debts due in the next few weeks.
The postponement raised the specter that South Korea might become the first Asian nation to default on its debts since an economic crisis began to engulf the region last summer. 
 Reaction to the postponement was swift and brutal in the financial markets, which viewed it as another sign of lost confidence in South Korea and alarm over Asia's spreading malaise. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.80 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,848.99, its fourth-straight decline. At the midday break today in Seoul, the Korean stock market's main index was off 6.1 percent to its lowest level of the year, following a 5.6 percent drop yesterday, and the Korean won fell to its fifth-straight record low.
 Officials in Washington now fear that far more drastic steps may now be needed to stop the hemorrhaging that is threatening world markets. News analysis, page D1.
The decision by the Korea Development Bank to delay the sale of bonds came barely a week after the nation signed a record $57 billion bailout agreement designed to restore global investor confidence.
South Korea must quickly come up with other ways to pay or renegotiate billions of dollars in debts coming due before the end of the year, because it is only entitled to a small portion of the International Monetary Fund bailout money for now.
The Korea Development Bank's $2 billion offering had gained great political significance over the last two days, becoming a litmus test for investor confidence in the fundamental health of the South Korean economy.
Up until yesterday afternoon it looked as if the bank would proceed with the sale. But it suddenly changed course because of indications that few buyers were willing to buy the bonds, at least without a double-digit interest rate usually associated with the sale of risky, speculative-grade "junk bonds." That was evidently too onerous or embarrassing for the influential bank to stomach.
The fact it was shelved was a strong indication that despite the I.M.F. rescue plan signed Dec. 3, the investment community still does not believe South Korea has addressed the welter of economic and political problems that have produced the country's most wrenching financial crisis since it first emerged more than a decade ago as one of Asia's fast-growing "tigers."
To make matters worse, the Thomson Financial Services Company, the world's largest bank credit rating agency, downgraded South Korea's sovereign risk rating, noting a "deepening liquidity crisis" and the "increasing prospect of the recent I.M.F. emergency package being insufficient to meet the country's short-term financial obligations."
"As a result of these intensifying volatilities and mounting short-term liquidity problems, domestic money and capital markets have become nearly paralyzed and credit lines have become virtually frozen," Thomson said.
Standard & Poor's, another major credit rating agency, also downgraded the debt ratings of once seemingly stellar South Korean corporations like the Pohang Iron and Steel Corporation, the Korea Electric Power Corporation, SK Telecom, Hyundai Motor and Samsung Electronics.
A glaring weakness in South Korea's finances is a lack of foreign exchange to pay loans denominated in foreign currencies. The South Korean won has lost more than half its value against the dollar this year, declining by 30 percent in December alone.
Thomson justified its downgrade partly from I.M.F. estimates that put South Korea's usable foreign exchange reserves at just $6 billion, down from $30 billion at the end of October.
Finance Minister Lim Chang Yuel, in a news conference with foreign news media in Seoul yesterday, tried to talk up the value of the won, saying the currency had overshot its appropriate level.
Mr. Lim also said South Korea's situation was not as dire as analysts said. The nation now has about $10 billion in usable foreign currency reserves, he said, up from $6 billion on Dec. 2. By the end of this month, he said, South Korea will have received another $3.5 billion from the I.M.F., $2 billion from the Asian Development Bank and at least $2 billion from the World Bank. In addition, foreign banks operating in Korea have committed $2 billion in securities transactions known as swap deals.
But amid this tangled crisis came K.D.B.'s unsuccessful bond offering. The proceeds from that offering were part of South Korea's financing plans.
There was no lack of initial blue-chip support for the offering. It was managed by J. P. Morgan & Company, a premier investment house, with assistance from the Chase Manhattan Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company, two other titans of American finance.
But despite the willingness of such powerhouses to get behind the bond offering -- an international conference call with 600 participants, including K.D.B. representatives and officials from South Korea's Ministry of Finance, was convened yesterday morning to pitch it to investors -- the interest rate needed to get it off the ground did not sit well with K.D.B., according to people close to the offering.
The bond offering was structured so that the securities would mature in 10 years but permit investors to exercise a one-time option after three years of selling the bonds back to K.D.B. at face value. That alone was had considerable allure for investors skittish about South Korea's prospects.
Some investors and analysts said the bond offering, coming amid such market uncertainty, was poorly timed. There was also frustration that K.D.B. and Ministry of Finance officials were not apparently ready to disclose more details to investors about all of the fundamentals affecting South Korea's economy.
A banker close to the transaction, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the offering was a "screw-up" because the officials did not recognize a "need to be completely forthcoming about the situation in South Korea."
During the conference call, a Ministry of Finance official told participants that South Korea had $116 billion in external debt at the end of November, with about $62 billion of that short-term debt, compared with $122 billion in external debt at the end of October, of which $68 billion was short-term. Nonetheless, the official was unable to provide details about exactly when South Korea's short-term debt comes due, other than to say he believed that less than $2 billion would mature by the end of this month. The lack of detail frustrated at least one participant on the call, who was concerned that the Government did not have a better grasp of its debt schedule.
Although Morgan declined to comment, people close to the offering said that K.D.B. was advised last week not to pursue it because of pricing problems. These people said the Korean bank insisted on following through with the transaction until it became apparent that the bank could not avoid paying high interest for it to work.
In Seoul today, Kim Won Geun, deputy general manager of K.D.B.'s international finance department, said the failure of the bond issue would not put the bank in danger of default on roughly $1.6 billion in short-term debt, providing its credit lines stayed open and the loans it made to Korean companies were repaid. But he conceded that many industrial companies were in a bad position to repay loans. Indeed, some of the money from the bond offering was to be injected into the industrial companies.
All of this occurred against a backdrop of mounting concern about the dimensions of South Korea's problems and a weak response to other changes the country was making to attract foreign investors and capital.
As of yesterday, foreign investors were allowed to own 50 percent of a Korean company, up from 26 percent.
It has been estimated that South Korea has about $20 billion in short-term debt coming due by the end of the year. Mr. Lim, the Finance Minister, while not mentioning any figures, told reporters in Seoul that he had talked to foreign banks and that some were now committed to renegotiating the debt.
If foreign banks forego calling in their loans, South Korea should at least get through December without defaulting. "Foreign bank sentiment has turned for the better," said Kang Tae Hil, deputy general manager of international sales at Daewoo Securities in Seoul, who said he talked with some foreign banks yesterday afternoon.
One factor continuing to make foreign investors nervous is a suspicion that South Korea will not adhere to the I.M.F. agreement, which calls for more market forces to be introduced into a state-directed economy. Seoul recently pumped more than $2 billion into two ailing commercial banks to avert their failure, an action some analysts say violated at least the spirit of the I.M.F. agreement.
Foreign investors have also been spooked by the fact that Kim Dae Jung, a front-runner in the race to become the next president, has taken out front-page ads in major newspapers vowing to renegotiate the I.M.F. agreement if he is elected on Dec. 18.
Mr. Kim, hoping to capitalize on popular resentment toward the I.M.F., backed down a bit after newspapers and other politicians criticized his stance as contributing to financial market turmoil.
Lee Kyong Shik, governor of the central Bank of Korea, was reported to have tendered his resignation yesterday. Mr. Lee himself would not confirm it.
One government official in Seoul said the announcement of the resignation was put off because it coincided with a nationally televised speech by President Kim Young Sam accepting responsibility for the crisis, and would have been awkward for him to dismiss the central bank governor the same day.

HEADLINE: THE CLIMATE ACCORD: THE IMPACT;
Whether It Creates Jobs or Joblessness, the Agreement Will Affect Everyone

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
To Scott Sklar, the executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association, nothing could be better for business than an agreement on controlling gases that contribute to global warming.
Already, the solar business is booming, and with tax and research subsidies its growth might go from 27 percent a year to 40 percent, he predicted, and the price of clean electricity from the sun could drop by 25 percent. 
 In the niche of the economy that aims to replace coal, oil and other sources of carbon dioxide, the main gas implicated in global climate change, "the United States could create 400,000 new jobs by 2010, equal to the largest U.S. corporate employer," he said.
But Mary H. Novak, vice president of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, an economic consulting firm engaged by industry groups opposing the climate change treaty, says her forecasts predict job losses in the millions.
"The coal mining industry in this country will be wiped out," she predicted. "Agriculture, manufacturing and transportation will all be seriously affected. Farm incomes could be cut by as much as 50 percent."
Whoever is right, every American uses energy, almost everybody wastes it, and its price affects every product's costs. So nobody can escape the repercussions of the treaty that was emerging in Kyoto -- assuming that the binding new protocol is signed by the United States, after it is approved by the Senate.
The Energy Department, in a study by five national labs, found that with aggressive research, new technologies aimed at meeting Kyoto's goals could be brought to market. But for many of them to be cost-effective, fossil fuel prices would have to rise the equivalent of 12.5 cents per gallon of gasoline to help stimulate most of the emissions savings the treaty envisions. Further price increases would bring even more exotic technologies into play.
Wind power, for example, is getting more cost-effective and in some places is close to under-pricing fossil fuels, said Terry Peterson, manager of green power marketing at the Electric Power Research Institute, an organization financed by the energy industry.
"The prospects of getting the costs down through a combination of further technology development and larger scales of production are very good," he said.
But asking how much energy will cost in 10 or 15 years, or which technologies will win the race to replace coal, is like predicting the price of a cellular phone in the year 2010.
Perhaps in the future all new schools will use geothermal heat pumps for cooling and heating, the way the new Choptank Elementary School in Cambridge, Md., did this year. The devices can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent compared with conventional technology, and Dorchester County, Md., expects to save $400,000 in energy and maintenance costs at the school in the next 20 years, according to a consortium of businesses that is pushing the technology.
Perhaps the American Power Corporation, a Boston utility, and the Electric Power Research Institute of Palo Alto will achieve a breakthrough in the field tests they announced last week of a small fuel cell to produce electricity at home. Fuel cells cleanly and efficiently convert natural gas and other fuels to electricity. Their device is expected to cost $5,000 and is big enough to easily provide the energy needs of a typical household.
More energy consumers and producers will make such novel choices, presumably, if the cost of fossil energy goes up in the next 10 or 15 years, when the treaty's terms would effectively put a lid on the nation's emissions of carbon dioxide.
The auto industry would be profoundly affected, since gasoline consumption is the biggest single factor, and the fastest growing, in American emissions of carbon dioxide.
And the industry might risk billions of dollars in losses if emissions are capped, because virtually all its profits come from making large sport utility vehicles and light trucks that use much more gas than cars.
But even a big vehicle can be made more fuel-efficient.
The Ford Motor Company predicted in a recent study for the Energy Department that it could make an electric van using fuel cell technology that would get 32 to 34 miles a gallon, more than twice the Econoline model's current performance. And the engine, the study said, could be mass-produced at a price competitive, if not quite on a par, with today's internal combustion engines.
The other big source of carbon emissions is coal burned by electric utilities, which generate 56 percent of the nation's power that way.
The Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group that represents most of the private utilities in the nation, estimated in a study that it would cost the industry close to $30 billion to convert most of the coal burning capacity to plants that would produce power by burning natural gas, which would produce steam to drive turbines.

Energy Department projections of United States carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Following the Kyoto guidelines, the U.S. would have to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. This represents a 30 percent reduction from projected levels. Graph shows projected carbon emissions compared to the 1990 level of carbon emissions (1.35 metric tons), from 1995 to 2015.
To meet the Kyoto guidelines, the United States would have to reduce its annual carbon emissions to 1.25 billion metric tons by 2008-2012.

HEADLINE: THE CLIMATE ACCORD: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON ADAMANT ON 3D WORLD ROLE IN CLIMATE ACCORD

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The White House, beginning the arduous task of selling an accord to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases, said today that it would not submit the proposed treaty for Senate ratification until developing countries agree to participate in the global environmental effort.
But developing countries at the global climate-change conference that just ended in Kyoto, Japan, said they would not act until they see the rich countries succeed in cutting their own emissions. And many members of the Senate are already saying it has no chance of passage. The accord is dependent on Senate approval. 
 At the insistence of China and other developing countries, the Kyoto conference imposed no requirements on newly industrialized countries and created only limited mechanisms for their inclusion in global efforts to curb so-called greenhouse gases.
The developing countries delayed a compromise that would have allowed the United States and other major polluters to buy or trade emission credits from countries whose emissions are within acceptable levels, and therefore avoid making significant cuts in emissions in a compressed time period.
With Senators denouncing the accord as not tough enough on developing countries, the stage was set for a yearlong political fight with the Clinton Administration, which has embraced the outlines of the deal.
The developing countries' objections provide Mr. Clinton with additional time to muster his arguments in favor of the treaty and an opportunity to portray himself as a defender of the United States' interests. For the next year -- an election year -- he is in the risk-free position of being able to make a strong pro-environmental political pitch while not having to face a damaging vote in the Senate.
President Clinton defended the agreement as "environmentally strong and economically sound," even as Administration officials were admitting that its flaws made it unacceptable to the Senate.
Mr. Clinton is likely to either win credit for tackling a difficult problem or pay a huge political cost for misjudging the public's appetite for sacrifice, even if doled out in small portions over many years.
The outcome of the debate and the political impact on Mr. Clinton and Vice President Gore are yet to be seen. But it is certain that Congress and the American people will be subjected to millions of dollars worth of lobbying and advertising in the next months by powerful coalitions that support and oppose the proposed treaty. Already, both sides are making sweeping claims about the dangers of global warming and the high cost of proposed solutions. Among the President's most difficult jobs will be to help the public decipher those assertions and bring pressure on Congress to take action on a matter over which there is still wide disagreement.
"The game is afoot," a senior White House aide said today.
In an appearance at a Coast Guard station in Miami, the President acknowledged that he faced the difficult political and diplomatic job of persuading the American people and leaders of developing countries that the threat of global warming is real and requires immediate action.
"There's still a lot of challenges ahead," Mr. Clinton said.
Even if the countries that agreed to the targets set in Kyoto begin taking steps to reduce so-called greenhouse gases that mainstream scientists believe are warming the earth's atmosphere, concentrations of these emissions will continue to rise for many years. Mr. Clinton and others say that a potential catastrophe in the next century will be averted only by concerted global action beginning now to cut emissions.
Officials in Washington said the Administration would not put the treaty before the Senate before 1999 at the earliest, after a meeting in Buenos Aires late next year aimed at persuading developing countries to accept the Kyoto agreement's limitations on emissions of greenhouse gases. That timetable would also postpone some of the ratification debate beyond the 1998 Congressional midterm elections. President Clinton has until March 1999 to decide whether to sign the proposed agreement.
"As we have said from the very beginning, we will not submit this for ratification until there's meaningful participation by key developing nations," Vice President Gore said at a Washington news conference today. Administration officials did not define "meaningful participation," saying that it was a matter for months of bilateral and multilateral discussions.
Mr. Gore added that the Administration had ruled out tax increases to meet the obligations of the treaty. And he said that the Administration would soon propose a $5 billion package of tax incentives and research grants to move the country onto a more energy-efficient path.
One senior White House official, who insisted on anonymity, said it was possible that the treaty would not be ready for submission to the Senate during the remainder of Mr. Clinton's term in office.
Despite the Administration's go-slow approach, domestic opponents of the accord continued to rail against its terms, saying that it meant colder homes, a shrinking economy and higher gasoline prices.
The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said the United States "surrendered" to pressure in Kyoto and called the proposed treaty "an outrage." He said the accord would cripple the American economy.
"Early reports from those in attendance indicate that on 10 critical issues such as cuts in emissions, future developing country commitments and new U.S. commitments, we sacrificed the future well-being of the country based on environmental correctness and inconclusive science," Mr. Gingrich said. "It is profoundly wrong that approximately 134 countries were allowed to vote on a treaty by which they will not be bound."
"Mr. President," the Speaker asked, "is this putting America's interests first?"
Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of oil-rich Oklahoma, called the Kyoto accord "a political, economic and national security fiasco" that will never be ratified by the Senate in any form.
Mr. Inhofe, in a news release, said that the failure to secure binding commitments from developing countries meant that the agreement fell far short of the standard set in a 95-to-0 Senate vote earlier this year. Among its flaws, he said, was the lack of an exemption for military vehicles and operations.
"They went to Kyoto determined to get a treaty for its own sake, regardless of the content," Mr. Inhofe said. "What they have come back with is scientifically dubious, economically disastrous and militarily stupid. Yet I don't doubt their determination to try to make it all politically saleable."
Indeed, that is the challenge facing the President and the Vice President as the debate over global warming moves into a new phase that will likely keep the issue before the public well into the 2000 Presidential campaign.
Mr. Clinton insisted that the United States can make a start toward reducing its emissions without disrupting the economy or reducing the country's standard of living.
"I see already the papers are full of people saying, 'The sky is falling, the sky is falling, it's a terrible thing,' " Mr. Clinton said. "Every time we've tried to improve the American environment in the last 25 or 30 years, somebody has predicted that it would wreck the economy. And the air is cleaner, the water is cleaner, the food supply is safer, there are fewer toxic waste dumps. And the last time I checked, we had the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years.
"So don't believe the skeptics" Mr. Clinton said. "Give us a chance to make the case."
Congressional committees are preparing now for hearings next year on the Kyoto accord and the broader question of the severity of the peril of global warming and how to address it.
Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said United States negotiators failed in Kyoto to achieve any of their major objectives and came home with a document that makes unacceptable demands on the domestic economy for questionable benefits.
Mr. Lugar compared the climate negotiations with Mr. Clinton's defeat on "fast-track" trade negotiating authority, which the House last month rejected because a majority of Democrats did not believe the President's promises to insure environmental and labor protections in future trade agreements.
"The President needs to spend some time explaining to the American people the validity of his arguments on global warming," Mr. Lugar said. "He didn't make the case on fast track and he hasn't even begun to make the case on climate change. And now he has to explain how the U.S. negotiators botched it in Kyoto."
Mr. Gore, whose presidential ambitions will hinge in part on how the public perceives his role in the global warming debate, appeared mindful of the political risks of the coming months and made an effort to move the issue out of the partisan arena.
In a White House news conference, the Vice President said: "In the coming days and months, it will be critical that we avoid looking at this effort through a narrow political lens. Too much is at stake. We must focus instead on the longer-term future of our planet and our economy, and on the health and well-being of our families and communities.
"This is not a Democratic or a Republican problem, nor is it a problem for any one nation alone," Mr. Gore continued. "It is a problem for the entire world. The stakes are simply too high, environmentally, economically and morally, for us to allow the special interests to get in the way of the common interests of all mankind."

HEADLINE: Don't Ignore Immigration's Benefits to the U.S.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
George J. Borjas and Richard B. Freeman, in their Dec. 10 Op-Ed article on the economic impact of immigration, write as if the United States economy operated in isolation and American immigration policy could be constructed as if its major influences stemmed from within our borders. In fact, the United States must respond to global pressures. The skills, contacts and labor of immigrants help assure the viability of American companies, securing employment for both newcomers and native-born workers.
Mr. Borjas and Mr. Freeman also exacerbate social tensions when they write, "The critical issue is how much we care about the well-being of immigrants compared with that of the Americans who win and the Americans who lose." It is divisive and inaccurate to posit an inevitable competition between immigrants and Americans. 
 Immigrants are part of the same families as natives and become part of our society. The businesses they create benefit us all. Only by falsely conceiving of them as outsiders can Mr. Borjas and Mr. Freeman focus on the problems rather than on the contributions they have made and will continue to make to this society.

HEADLINE: Don't Ignore Immigration's Benefits to the U.S.;
Glue of Our Society

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Leave it to two economists to reduce the immigration issue to economic growth factors and natives versus immigrants (Op-Ed, Dec. 10). Certainly the United States cannot admit immigrants without regard to economic considerations. But why do American politicians persist in presenting immigration in almost exclusively economic terms?
American society is largely held together by the glue of shared ideals that are political, not cultural. Most of this country's finest universities seek out international students because their unique perspectives foster intellectual growth. Why not then view immigrants as potential invigorators of the democratic system and as people who bring cultural offerings that cannot be measured monetarily? 
 If there is one "critical issue" in the immigration debate, it is not relative material well-being but that the debate reveals a country where making money has supplanted political ideals. The country of immigrants has become a country of capitalists.

City to Sell Parcels of Land

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
New York City is about to sell a little bit more of itself.
Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, announced yesterday that the city will sell 1.2 million square feet of land and commercial space in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. 
 "By privatizing city-owned land, the city is encouraging development, increasing its revenues and creating jobs for residents," Mr. Millard said.
He said many of the sites are in a federally designated empowerment zone or state economic development zone, which means significant tax abatements and other incentives are available for developers.
The sites are eligible for the city's Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, which is a tax exemption-abatement program based on the value of improvements to the land. Most of the sites are eligible for Federal and state wage tax credits, investment tax credits, utility rate reductions, employee training benefits and tax-exempt bond financing.
About a quarter of the sites, or about 277,000 square feet, are in central Harlem. The Bronx sites are near the Whitestone Bridge and in Morrisania. In Brooklyn, several industrial sites are being sold in the East New York In-Place Industrial Park.
Since July 1, 1995, the city has sold 48 pieces of property for $408 million as part of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's privatization agenda. NICK RAVO

'Lines of Loss'
Artists Space
38 Green Street
SoHo
Through Jan. 10
Mexico is producing a staggering amount of new art of all kinds, and bit by bit some of it is trickling into New York. The five participants in this show, all of whom are making their local debuts, were selected by the artist Gabriel Orozco, and like him they offer a witty, materially economical conceptual art with, here and there, a melancholic edge and a mild political bite. 
 Damian Ortega, who has worked as a political cartoonist, is represented by two videos. In one, he slices into a golf ball so that its innards writhe out as if disemboweled; in the other he dresses in a funky black-and-silver Christopher Columbus-as-Darth Vader outfit to wave to motorists from a highway bridge in Mexico City.
Mr. Ortega's sendups of death and history find an echo in Gabriel Kuri's piece, which uses withering funeral bouquets to spell an abbreviated form of the word abbreviation (i.e. abbrv.). Guillermo Santa marina evokes a sense of existential malaise in a plastic chaise lounge that emits a mournful cascade of notes when stroked, and in a volume of poetry by the 60's guru R. D. Laing, whose psychological mind-twisters get a reality check in the form of bookmarks made from laboratory slides of human and animal tissues.
The brothers Manuel and Mauricio Rocha concentrate on ambiance rather than objects. The first, Manuel, fills the gallery's bathroom with the sounds of retching, burping and flushing, as if the plumbing had indigestion; the second, Mauricio, cuts holes in the gallery walls so the Artists Space staff and visitors have no place to hide. Like their irreverent colleagues here, the Messrs. Rochas get a lot out of a little. With luck, they'll make a return trip soon. HOLLAND COTTER

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Portrait of the Machine Age, With Guessing Game

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
The exhibition "Images From the Machine Age: Selections From the Daniel Cowin Collection," at the International Center of Photography, opens with a photograph of one large-toothed gear attempting to mesh, improbably, with a small-toothed gear. The picture, "Out of Mesh," taken by Mannie Lovitch, an amateur photographer from the Bronx, serves as a metaphor for the whole show: here is a machine whose parts do not fit together but that is nonetheless intriguing in its misfitting parts.
Chronologically, the machine age runs from the 1920's through the 30's, and esthetically it includes anything having to do with machines and manufacture. It has ties to Surrealism, Constructivism, Futurism, Art Deco and Bauhaus design. And its characteristic subjects are gears, smokestacks, factories, cities, workers, repetitive patterns, machine-made artifacts and machine-made angst. This exhibition embraces every one of these types and definitions and then throws in the kitchen sink for good measure. 
 No kidding about that kitchen sink. Inexplicably, the show includes Marion Post Wolcott's photograph of "Mrs. Rosa Wilkins Making Biscuits, Granville County, N.C.," a woman working near a kitchen sink. The only thing machine-age about this picture is that it was taken in 1939. And it is not the only oddity exhibited here.
The show also includes a close-up of a cactus, a snapshot of a chain gang, a picture of a sleepy street in Cody, Wyo., and a moody portrait of a woman veiled in lace. Such misfits, though, are not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, some of the fun of seeing the show is trying to guess why in the world certain objects were chosen.
Some of the misfits expand the concept of the machine age. Others simply reflect the tastes of Daniel Cowin, an investment banker and collector of photography, Art Deco objects and American folk art, who died four years ago. The show includes his brass bookends, colored buttons, papier-mache busts and wooden tea trays as well as his photographs, drawings and lithographs.
Many of the photographs are just what you would expect to find in a machine-age show: pictures of cranes and lathes; playful photocollages of mechanical bodies; photograms of manufactured objects; vertiginous shots of the Empire State Building, including one spireless view by Man Ray; Berenice Abbott's spectacular night picture of New York taken from the top of the Empire State Building; Brassai's view of cars on a Paris street; a Constructivist book cover by El Lissitzky; William Rittase's comical picture of a tiny mechanical object taking a bow before gears, and a few slickly shot pictures of slickly manufactured objects, including a pair of Bausch & Lomb binoculars and a pointy can of Eel-Skid oil, both casting long, suggestive shadows.
The grand obsession of the era was mechanical reproduction. And there are some beautiful examples here: Albert Renger-Patzsch's detail of a cheese grater with its deep black holes and surface scratches; George Daniell's picture of the construction of the George Washington Bridge with reinforcing rods poking up repetitively out of the concrete; Josef Sudek's endless loop of stacked teacups and, best of all, Wynn Richards's grid of wooden matchsticks on a flat white surface, backlit so powerfully that, in a curious reversal, the heads of the matches look dull, while the sticks glow.
Mass production was clearly the order of the day. So how did Georg Trump's still life of a misshapen orange get into the act? And what about Jack Delano's picture of a trompe l'oeil cow enclosed in a trompe l'oeil barn?
The show includes not only various thematic misfits but a handful of chronological trespasses, too: Frantisek Drtikol's dreamy shot of figures ascending a stair in 1911; Ilse Bing's bird's-eye shot of a street sweeper in Paris in 1947, and Charles Pratt's sea of men in coats and ties walking onto the Hoboken ferry in 1955. But at least these anachronisms feature faceless workers.
One of the recurring worries of the machine age was that workers themselves were beginning to look like mass-made objects. Hans Casparius's photograph of shadows descending a staircase shows the workers as shades. And Dorothea Lange, by shooting one of San Francisco's unemployment lines from above, turned the men into hats and coats.
These were not the only rips in the neat fabric of manufacture. The exhibition includes a number of photographs of posters torn in significant ways. One of Walker Evans's photographs is of a minstrel poster whose rips reveal the tigers and lions of a Barnum & Bailey poster underneath. And John Vachon photographed an advertisement that was ripped to show a woman's face with its two halves rearranged: her smiling teeth at the top and one smiling eye at the bottom. The most violent dismemberment in the show, though, is Hans Bellmer's hand-colored photograph of the pieces of a doll, lying near a caliper in what appears to be blood.
The machine age was all about smooth efficiency. Documenting it never was.
"Images From the Machine Age: Selections From the Daniel Cowin Collection" is at the International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, through Feb. 22.

HEADLINE: John Fitting Jr., 81, Executive At Dreyfus and a Fund Pioneer

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
John Fitting Jr., a Dreyfus Corporation executive and pioneer in the creation of no-load mutual funds in the early 1970's, died Wednesday at his retirement home on Marco Island, Fla. He was 81.
The cause of death was prostate cancer, said his wife, Judith Kingsley Fitting. 
 In 1973, Mr. Fitting became the first head of Dreyfus Asset Management Inc., the company's first mutual fund. It was known as a no-load fund because there was no load, or sales commission, charged up front. The fund was sold directly to customers instead of through brokers.
When Dreyfus Asset Management and other funds like it were buffeted by the high inflation and economic dislocation of the mid-70's oil embargo crisis, Mr. Fitting was active with other fund managers in trying to reassure clients that the funds were not at risk of collapse from withdrawals by nervous investors.
The new mutual fund Mr. Fitting led required a minimum investment of $50,000 and charged a minimum management fee of $1,000 a year, high by today's standards. At the time, Mr. Fitting said he expected his fund to produce an average 9 percent annual return, compounded over five years.
Following his retirement from Dreyfus in the early 1980's, Mr. Fitting worked as a consultant to the American Can Company in its transition to the Primerica Corporation, the financial services company. In 1986, he joined the National Securities and Research Corporation, a mutual fund management company, as chairman and chief executive. He retired from that position in 1988.
Mr. Fitting was born in New York City, grew up in Westchester County and attended Dartmouth College but left before graduating to join the Marine Corps in 1939. He was a fighter pilot and a decorated squadron commander in the Pacific during World War II, his family said, and he earned his college degree from the University of Miami.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Fitting is survived by a daughter, the Rev. Wendy Fitting of Gloucester, Mass.; a son, Keith Fitting of Basking Ridge, N.J.; a brother, Paul Fitting of Pittsburgh; a sister, Virginia Demetrius of New York; four grandchildren, and two stepdaughters, Melinda Kingsley Nester of New York and Ellen Kingsley Hirschfeld of Houston.

HEADLINE: Honesty on Immigrants

 BODY:

To the Editor:
George J. Borjas and Richard B. Freeman, in their Dec. 10 Op-Ed article on the National Academy of Sciences report on immigration, attribute statements to me that I never made. They assert that I fail to mention that the bulk of the increase of the gross national product from immigration goes to the immigrants themselves. In fact, I go out of my way to make precisely that point. 
 They claim that I have argued that the drop in wages in low-skill jobs caused by immigration are good for the less skilled because it gives them an incentive to finish school. While these wage cuts do provide such an incentive, it would be absurd to argue that less skilled workers are better off, and I have never done so.
I am proud of the quality of scholarship and balance reflected in the report. The public presentations that my colleagues and I will continue to make on the report reflect that balance.
 
JAMES P. SMITH
Santa Monica, Calif., Dec. 11, 1997
 
The writer was chairman of the National Academy of Sciences panel on immigration.

HEADLINE: Asia Turmoil Proves Bullish For U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
There is much debate over the impact of the Asian financial turmoil on the stock market. Some analysts are worried, others are not. But for bonds, there is no debate. The Asian turmoil is great for bonds.
And this is not just because of the flight of foreign investors to the safe harbor they see in United States Government securities. More important, it is because of the drag that Asia is expected to have on inflation here, as slower Asian growth moderates United States growth and the stronger dollar cuts the price level of goods imported from Asia. 
 "The reason that it is good for bonds is that the No. 1 enemy of bonds is inflation," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig & Company. "And it is impossible to stand up and tell an inflation story when one-third of the world is going to be cutting the dollar price of its products."
The power of the Asian impact -- combined with a surprise decline in prices at the producer level in November -- pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to 5.92 percent yesterday, down from 6.00 percent Thursday and its lowest level in more than four years. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 1 7/32, to 10227/32.
What makes this decline potentially more important than the last move below 6 percent is that many economists think that rates can hold at these lower levels, while the last two dips below 6 percent, in late 1995 to early 1996 and in 1993, lasted only a matter of months.
This year's bond rally, which has brought long-term rates down from 7.17 percent in April, has also reduced mortgage rates to their lowest level since February 1996. According to the Bank Rate Monitor, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 7.17 percent in their weekly poll through Wednesday. And if the decline in bond yields since then holds, mortgage rates should fall further.
But while long rates have fallen, short-term interest rates have not come down nearly as much, which means that the prime rate, which sets lending rates for many consumers and small businesses, has not budged from 8.5 percent since March. The stubbornness of short-term rates has also limited any savings for large companies with loans tied to other benchmark short-term rates.
Yesterday's assault on 6 percent was bolstered by the Labor Department report that prices at the producer level fell two-tenths of a percent and are now down to an annual rate of 1.2 percent through the first 11 months of the year. It is likely that the Producer Price Index for finished goods will show its first decline for a year since 1986. Producer prices rose 2.6 percent last year.
Despite the good inflation news, many analysts are still marveling at the decline in interest rates. They say there are other economic signals out there flashing red but they are being ignored, mostly because investors are convinced that the slower growth and lower inflation fallout from the Asian turmoil will turn those signals to green.
Currently the economy is growing near a 4 percent annual rate and there are signs of wage pressures building with the unemployment rate at a 24-year low of 4.6 percent. All these factors would normally be worrying bond investors, said Robert V. DiClemente, the chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney. And they probably would have forced the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, either at its meeting in November or at its policy- making session Tuesday.
But no such move is expected. "The fact that interest rates are declining in the face of a strong economy tells me that people are putting a lot of weight on the shock that is taking place" in Asia, Mr. DiClemente said.
In assessing the impact of Asia, Mr. DiClemente noted that the value of the dollar against its trading partners has risen 7 percent since mid-October and 4 percent in the last 30 days. This means that the prices of imports have already fallen significantly, which cuts inflation.
In addition, he said his 1998 forecast showed a decline in American exports of about $80 billion, which cuts more than a full percentage point off his growth estimate.

HEADLINE: Another Dip In Prices Paid To Producers

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers dropped an unexpected two-tenths of 1 percent in November, the Labor Department said today. The economy now appears likely to record its first yearly decline in producer prices since 1986.
Today's price data confirm that inflation remains contained and indicate that Federal Reserve policy makers are unlikely to raise interest rates when they meet next week in their final meeting of the year. 
 "Those worried about inflation are fighting the last war," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. Indeed, Mr. Steinberg and other analysts say that the Fed may soon lower the Federal funds rate.
Bond prices surged in response to the price report, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling to 5.92 percent.
Energy led the decline in producer prices, falling eight-tenths of 1 percent in November. Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food, the so-called core rate of the Producer Price Index fell one-tenth of 1 percent last month. In October, the index rose one-tenth of 1 percent, while the core rate was flat.
For the first 11 months of 1997, the index fell at an annual rate of 1.2 percent, in contrast to a 2.6 percent rise for the first 11 months of 1996.
"We expect more low P.P.I. figures in the months ahead," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. "Oil prices are falling again, and the Asian crisis will pull down commodity prices."
Indeed, Asia's economic crisis could lead to price cuts by producers hoping to offset weak sales in their home markets with shipments to the United States. That would leave businesses with "very little pricing power," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Consumer prices are also on course to show their most subdued performance since 1986, analysts said. "Inflation is simply not heating up," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York. The Consumer Price Index for November is scheduled to be released Tuesday.
Other reports today pointed to slower growth and a lack of inflationary pressure. The Commerce Department said that business inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in October while sales dropped one-tenth of 1 percent. In September, inventories rose seven-tenths of 1 percent and sales rose 1.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Decline On Concern About Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, dragged down by concerns that Asia's economic crisis would eat into corporate earnings. The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, ended its worst week in seven years.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.69 points, or one-tenth of 1 percent, to 7,838.30, its fifth straight decline. The Dow lost 3.8 percent for the week. It was the first week since the five days ended March 21 that the Dow lost ground in every session. 
 The Nasdaq composite index fell 21.96 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,536.58, bringing its loss for the week to 5.96 percent. It was the Nasdaq's worst week since Aug. 24, 1990. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 1.55, or two-tenths of a percent, to 953.39, down 3.1 percent for the week.
"There's no doubt about it; technology is in a bear market," said Robert Streed, a money manager with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, which oversees $130 billion. "Investors are selling first and sorting things out later."
Computer-related companies tumbled on signs that demand was easing in the United States and that the growth of profits they earn in Asia would slow because of the region's financial turmoil.
Intel fell 1 5/16 , to 70 1/2; I.B.M. dropped 1 1/4, to 100 3/8, and Texas Instruments lost 1 1/4, to 40 7/8.
Microsoft declined 2 5/16 , to 136 3/4, after it was ordered to stop making computer makers install its Internet Explorer browser program as a condition for their getting the company's Windows 95 operating system. The rival Netscape Communications rose 1 5/8, to 27 7/8, after the ruling.
Cisco Systems dropped 6 1/8, to 76 9/16 , on concern about rising inventory of its products, although analysts said the buildup represented increased demand, not declining sales.
Gannett fell 1/8, to 59 5/16 , after the newspaper company said it expected slower profit growth in 1998 because of higher newsprint costs and slightly lower advertising.
Shares of Fine Host fell 5 3/8, to 10 1/8, before trading was halted in the afternoon. The shares have plunged 65 percent this week, prompting the National Association of Securities Dealers to investigate the unusual trading, a N.A.S.D. official said. Fine Host officials did not return repeated telephone calls. The company, based in Greenwich, Conn., runs food and beverage operations for locations like football stadiums, prisons and convention centers.

HEADLINE: Our Hungry Legal Immigrants

 BODY:
Close to a million legal immigrants across the country have had food stamps revoked under the 1996 welfare law, 50,000 in New York City alone. The city's food distributions to soup kitchens and food pantries are soaring, and some are reportedly running out of food each month. But statistics mask the individual tragedies. As reported by Rachel Swarns of The Times, a mother of four from Trinidad has been forced to use her rent money for food and substitute Kool-Aid for orange juice. A Peruvian mother spends her days pleading for groceries in one food pantry after another.
White House officials will meet next week to decide what programs need additional money next year. No item should rank higher than food stamps for the legal immigrants cut off by the harsh 1996 act. Congressional leaders and some Administration officials smugly believe that this year's balanced-budget plan corrected the worst of the 1996 cuts in aid to immigrants. But Congress restored Medicaid coverage and cash assistance for only some elderly and disabled immigrants. It did not restore food stamps. Food stamps are crucial because they are the only surviving welfare program whose benefits are set by Washington and not dependent on the generosity of state legislatures. 
 A dozen states, including New York, have decided to spend their own money restoring food stamps for immigrants. But almost all of these state programs cover only some groups of immigrants, like children or the elderly, and are likely to shrink once state budgets contract under the weight of the next recession. Even in these generous states, however, the picture is not pretty. In New York, for example, a Cambodian father of six has seen the value of food stamps fall to $127 a month from $354. A Dominican mother of three has lost $214 a month in food stamps.
Rising tax revenues in flush economic times should give the Administration some leeway to raise spending next year. White House officials have already drawn up a tentative list of entitlement programs to trim to make way for new initiatives. The cost of restoring food stamps need not be huge. Providing them for immigrant households with children would cost only about $400 million a year -- a small price to put food back on children's plates.

HEADLINE: Lowering the Credit Fence;
Big Players Are Jumping Into the Risky Loan Business

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Beatrice Smith has refinanced the mortgage on her small Atlanta home six times in the last decade. As a result, her monthly payment rose from $267 to $417 -- before she defaulted on the loan late last year.
A 68-year-old former cleaning woman who lives alone on a monthly Social Security check of $709, Mrs. Smith said she initially refinanced her mortgage so she could pay some overdue bills. But she said she was not sure why she went through with the other ones. 
 "I can't remember things as well as I used to," she said softly. "I didn't understand a lot of things the banks were doing."
So rich are the profits to be mined from borrowers like Mrs. Smith that major companies are lining up to lend to them -- despite the risks these borrowers pose. Indeed, some critics say, it is precisely because of the borrowers' lack of financial acumen that so many are jumping into the business.
Big lenders like Chase Manhattan, Norwest, Nationsbank, General Electric, Keycorp, Countrywide Credit Industries and others are expanding their lending to "subprime" borrowers, as they are known in the trade. Other companies long involved in the industry, like Household International, are broadening their reach.
Subprime borrowers, in contrast to those considered prime-lending prospects, generally include people with poor credit histories -- or no credit history at all. A large number appear to be low-income, inner-city minority residents. Others with more substantial incomes may patronize subprime lenders and pay their higher interest rates because they have suffered a recent financial calamity.
The market is so fragmented that there is little comprehensive information available about it. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates and charters national banks, said it had no data because big banks had just begun to make their push into the market, which, confusingly, has nothing to do with the so-called prime interest rate that banks use as a reference point for many business and personal loans. Subprime auto and mortgage lending reached about $145 billion last year, with 80 percent of that amount mortgages and the rest auto loans, lenders and analysts estimate.
This financial frontier is already littered with the wreckage of small lenders that have been severely battered or crippled the last year by bad loans and dubious management practices. But the big players now plowing into the market say they bring sounder lending policies and a less free-wheeling approach to what has long been one of the shabbier arenas in lending. They argue that their sophistication will enable them to succeed where the small-fry lenders have failed.
"The subprime market is a burgeoning market," said Michael Carney, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Nationsbank's subprime unit, Nationscredit. "For a company that can deal with people who have credit issues, it really sets the tone between success and failure."
While subprime loans represent only about 10 percent of the country's $5.19 trillion in outstanding consumer loans, the fact that it has become a magnet for the titans of banking unnerves some experts.
"The entire consumer lending business has been engaged in risk warfare for almost three years now," says Edward Furash, a banking consultant with Furash & Company. in Washington. "There is an expansion of credit across the board for people who wouldn't have gotten credit under the old models. And it's making me nervous."
Some big lenders have hit rough patches in their subprime business, but nothing yet to compare with the blowups that have burned smaller companies. Consumers are taking their time paying back loans, a situation that could become very ugly if the economy falters. Consumer loan delinquencies hit a low this decade of 1.66 percent of all outstanding accounts in 1994, before shooting back up to 2.55 percent by June -- close to the highs of the recession of the early 1990's.
Moreover, while the entry of more established lenders into the subprime market has the potential to meet the social and economic goals of extending credit at lower cost to low-income borrowers, it is a rough-and-tumble world that is rife with tales of abusive lending and harsh collection practices. Critics acknowledge that lenders must charge higher interest rates for riskier borrowers, but they say that exorbitant rates are often inflated to insure big profits -- not just to account for risk.
"We have financial apartheid in our country," said William Brennan a lawyer specializing in home-lending abuses with the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. "We have low-income, often minority borrowers, who are charged unconscionably high interest rates, either directly or indirectly through the cover of added charges."
These days, mainstream borrowers can usually line up mortgages carrying interest rates of 7.5 percent to 8 percent. Until this year, most subprime mortgage borrowers had been paying about 14 percent for a loan, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. (Subprime rates have dropped this year, in some cases to as low as 10 percent, because of increased competition).
Mr. Brennan said that people he represents in the Atlanta area pay mortgage rates ranging from 12 percent to 16 percent, with borrowing costs further inflated by extras like credit life insurance and disability insurance. One of the people he represents is Mrs. Smith.
Mrs. Smith bought her house in 1969 for about $14,000. She said she had paid off a large chunk of her mortgage by the time she stopped working in 1984, but refinanced the loan in 1987 so she could eliminate her other debts. Her original lender was the Chrysler Corporation's Chrysler First unit, which Nationsbank bought in 1993 and renamed Nationscredit.
A series of refinancings helped Mrs. Smith pay off other debts, but she was charged interest rates ranging from 10 percent to 15.5 percent. Her mortgage debt rose from about $20,000 in 1987 to $35,000 by 1993. While Nationscredit lent her money at rates lower than those charged by Chrysler, her latest refinancing with Nationscredit was at 12 percent.
Mrs. Smith said she was not aware how the home equity loans the companies arranged caused any borrowing she made against the line to increase her debt.
"I thought I could get $32,000 in my hand and my note to the bank wouldn't go up each month," Mrs. Smith said. "My note went up to $500, and I didn't understand why."
Nationscredit's Mr. Carney said the bank went over all details of the loan with Mrs. Smith and that "her renewals are consistent with our policy." Nationscredit restructured Mrs. Smith's loan in 1993 without a home-equity component, lowering her monthly payment to $417 from $492. But when her workers' compensation payments ended in 1993, Mrs. Smith was forced to turn to her children for mortgage help. By late last year, her children could not afford to keep helping her and she defaulted.
Nationscredit and Mrs. Smith are now negotiating repayment terms. Despite the problems with Mrs. Smith's loan, Mr. Carney said that Nationscredit's overall subprime mortgage portfolio was performing well. Even though it has had some recent losses in subprime auto lending, Nationscredit said it intended to increase its $3.6 billion subprime portfolio about 20 percent a year.
Other big lenders are also interested. Chase said it was originating subprime mortgages across the country at the rate of about $82 million a month, up from just $12 million a month early last year. General Electric's financial services arm, GE Capital Services, said it expected to double its $1 billion subprime auto loan portfolio by the end of next year. Keycorp, which already owns a subprime auto lender, recently bought Champion Mortgage, a well-known subprime lender, which generated $500 million in home-equity loans last year, for $200 million. (Champion's motto: "When your bank says no, Champion says yes!")
The few big companies with longstanding subprime experience, like Household, are adding new lines of business. Last month, Household bought the ACC Consumer Finance Corporation, a subprime auto lender, picking up an executive along with the acquisition who has ample expertise navigating the perilous waters of subprime lending.
ACC's chief executive, Rocco Fabiano, was chairman of Far Western Bank, a subprime auto lender in Tustin, Calif., when state regulators closed it in 1990 because of risky lending practices. The Government prosecuted Mr. Fabiano in 1993, contending that he was involved in bribery at another bank. He was acquitted in 1995. In the meantime, Mr. Fabiano founded two other subprime lenders, one of which was ACC.
Household said it was aware of Mr. Fabiano's history and is "comfortable with the quality and the integrity of the management" at ACC. Mr. Fabiano, noting that he has never tried to hide his past problems, dismissed the Government's charges as meritless. "Every investor," he said, "has to determine what they think is legitimate" about the management of a public company.
The last year has been a brutal one for small subprime lenders. Many of these former high-fliers have fallen to earth beneath the weight of lending and accounting scandals and other problems. In the auto market, the financial meltdown of the Mercury Finance Company earlier this year has been followed more recently by earnings problems at competitors. On the mortgage side, the Cityscape Financial Corporation, the Aames Financial Corporation and the Green Tree Financial Corporation, have also been battered.
Although Keycorp had some early difficulties in subprime auto lending, and GE Capital has troubled loans to at least two subprime auto lenders, big companies now entering the subprime fray predicted that they would avoid similar blowups because of sophisticated credit-scoring systems that help gauge lending risk more effectively than smaller lenders can. They also note that they use more conservative accounting methods than the pioneers of the business do.
Moreover, the big companies say they want to avoid practices that might lead to accusations of abusive lending. "The more the consumer knows," said Sandy Derickson, president of GE Capital's subprime auto unit, "the better off he is."
Still, some remain unconvinced. "The national companies that are in this market are doing many of the same kind of abusive things that the little companies have done," said Mr. Brennan of Atlanta Legal Aid. While larger lenders are not as interested as some smaller lenders in forcing homeowners to give up their homes in foreclosure, Mr. Brennan said, the practical effect of keeping consumers deep in hock is often the same. The big companies don't want to foreclose," he said. "They're more interested in getting borrowers to refinance."

Seeking greater profits, banks and other lenders have been extending credit to more people, including some who pose the greatest risk of default. One result is that past-due loans are rising, as they did before the 1990-91 recession. Graph shows the percentage of mortgage and auto loans 30 days or more past due, since 1990.

HEADLINE: For Microsoft, Ruling Carries Fateful Tones

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The wording of a temporary ruling issued Thursday in the Government's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation suggests that a final decision next summer could erode the power of the company, which had seemed poised to dominate information industries around the globe far into the next century.
Microsoft, the world's most powerful and profitable software company, in recent years has leveraged its control of personal computer operating systems to enter a growing array of new businesses as varied as telecommunications, cable television, entertainment and travel. In the process, the company has evolved into one of the most respected and feared corporations in the world. 
 That could change if the final ruling in the case forces Microsoft to delay or halt shipments of Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0, the next versions of the operating system that runs on more than 90 percent of the world's newly shipped personal computers.
Operating systems are complex programs that handle myriad interactions among a computer, a user and applications like word processors or spreadsheets. Windows 98 is the next version of the operating system for personal computers that use single Intel processors. Windows NT 5.0 is a high-end business version of the operating system designed to run on more powerful network computers as well as on standard desktop machines.
Both new versions will completely integrate Microsoft's World Wide Web browser, Internet Explorer, a product that directly competes with the Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator browser.
At issue in the antitrust case is the fact that Microsoft, in at least some instances, required hardware companies that wanted to ship their computers with Windows 95 already installed to also install Internet Explorer.
In his temporary ruling, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson called the company's control of the operating system market a "monopoly" and warned that this "bundling" of its browser with Windows had so stifled competition that Microsoft "might also acquire yet another monopoly in the Internet browser market."
It is not clear, however, whether the court will determine that a complete integration of the browser into the operating system poses the same kind of anticompetitive threat as bundling a separate browser application.
The difference is not apparent to the user, but it could have enormous legal implications, which in turn could have a sizable effect on Microsoft's bottom line.
Microsoft receives only a small payment for each machine sold with its operating system, but the almost 100 million computers sold worldwide each year added up to a huge part of the $5.97 billion the company's operating systems division earned this year. Such revenues have allowed Microsoft to invest billions of dollars over the years in both development of new technologies and expansion into other industries.
"The revenue implications are huge," David Readerman, a securities analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said of the ruling on Thursday by Judge Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington.
Mr. Readerman has forecast that in its first 24 months on the market, Windows 98 will generate $3.1 billion. By June 2000, he predicted, Microsoft will have shipped as many as 80 million copies of the new Windows versions.
Microsoft defenders argue that delaying Windows 98 could have a broader detrimental impact on the United States economy than a monopoly would have.
"This doesn't make much sense from a cost-benefit point of view," Luke Froeb of the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University said of Judge Jackson's ruling. Professor Froeb, an antitrust expert who pioneered a new model for analyzing mergers now used by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, added, "Any time you slow down the pace of an industry you are going to undercut investment, and that can kill innovation."
Today, all sides in the dispute said that the impact of the temporary ruling on Windows 98 was unclear and would remain so until Judge Jackson issued his final ruling next summer.
That means it is entirely possible that the case could either delay the expected June introduction of Windows 98 or dampen the computer industry's enthusiasm for upgrading if the new version is sold without an integrated Web browser.
What is more, in papers filed by Microsoft with the Federal court last week, David Cole, the company's vice president in charge of Internet Explorer development, argued that Internet Explorer had always been an integral part of Windows 95.
"Microsoft has never developed any version of Windows 95 for computer manufacturers that does not include Internet Explorer," he wrote in his deposition. "In fact, since Windows 95 was first released in August 1995, Microsoft's ongoing development of its Internet Explorer technologies has been the central thrust of the company's development efforts for the operating system."
Critics of the company challenge that assertion, however, as offering more of a marketing definition than a technical explanation.
" 'Integrated' is a code word at Microsoft that simply means bundling," said Andrew Schulman, a senior technical editor at O'Reilly & Associates, a publisher of technical books, and the author of "Unauthorized Windows 95," an insider's guide to the software. "I don't see anything that any reasonable programmer would call integration."
Despite Microsoft claims that Windows 95 requires Internet Explorer to function, Mr. Schulman said it was a simple matter for even nonexpert users to turn the browser off.

An Accord to Open Up World's Financial Markets
The United States and more than 100 other countries signed a global trade agreement to open up the world's banking, insurance and securities markets. 
 But the new pact could ignite steep criticisms in Congress, where some lawmakers are already suspicious of the World Trade Organization, the organization that will oversee and enforce the accord. The new pact is also less dramatic than many American companies had hoped, in part because of the financial turmoil sweeping through much of Asia. A1.
 
South Korea's Plight Worsens
The fourth-largest brokerage firm in South Korea collapsed, stocks plunged and the nation's vaunted opening of its bond market to foreigners attracted only $700,000 in purchases. The latest signs of deterioration in South Korea came as the Government spent hundreds of millions of dollars from its dwindling supply of foreign exchange to defend the won to little avail. Page D3.
 
In Indonesia, one of the early victims of the Asia crisis, many citizens who had enjoyed years of increasing prosperity are now braced for rising prices, high unemployment and, perhaps, social unrest. D2.
 
Technology Stocks Slump
Concerns about the Asian economic crisis continued to weigh down stocks in the United States. Technology stocks were hit hardest, led by Cisco Systems and Microsoft. The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, fell 21.96 points, or 1.4 percent. For the week, the Nasdaq was down 5.96 percent -- its worst week since Aug. 24, 1990. D11.
 
Report Confirms Inflation Is Tame
Prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers dropped unexpectedly in November, the Labor Department said. The report indicated that the economy was headed toward its first year-to-year decline in producer prices since 1986. D3.
 
Russia Reaches I.M.F. Deal
Russia and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a plan to control government spending, opening the door for an quick infusion of $1.7 billion from the fund and World Bank. The agreement comes at a critical time for the Russian economy, as foreign investors have been fleeing Russian markets. Still, the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin has a spotty record in carrying out its promises to the I.M.F. A1.
 
Behind the Microsoft Ruling
Microsoft has argued that century-old antitrust laws originally aimed at curbing the marketing abuses of the railroad and oil barons are irrelevant in the new economy of information technology. But in ordering Microsoft to separate its Internet software from its operating system, a Federal judge has reaffirmed that the old-fashioned laws still apply. News Analysis. A1.
 
Broad Rally in the Dollar
The dollar rose against European currencies and the yen as traders remained skeptical about Japan's stimulus plan and a German official said weak Asian markets would affect Europe. The dollar settled at 130.45 yen, up from 129.75 yen on Thursday, and at 1.7753 marks, up from 1.7620 marks. D11.
 
Orange Juice Prices Rise
Orange juice futures surged on concerns that foul weather could damage crops in Florida, the biggest growing state. Grain and soybean futures fell in part on expectations that demand from Asia would slow. D4.
 
A Trustee to Run Marvel
A judge plans to appoint a trustee to run Marvel Entertainment in place of the board, to resolve conflicts among the parties vying for control of the comic-book publisher. D3.

HEADLINE: Poor Nations Reject Role on Warming

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Dec. 12

 BODY:
While the Clinton Administration has said it will not submit a landmark environmental agreement for Senate approval unless developing countries also do more, the world's poor argue that cost and fairness dictate that the sacrifices needed to preserve the globe's climate should not be heaped on them.
Even with the signing of the accord here this week by 160 countries, industrialized and developing nations continue feuding over which side bears the burden for reducing emissions of gases implicated in global warming. 
 The developing countries upset the conference by refusing to commit themselves to emission reduction targets that their wealthier counterparts have pledged to meet under the agreement.
Poorer countries were exempted from such goals and were called on only to take part in efforts to use cleaner energy sources that would be sponsored by richer nations.
"How can we devote our precious resources towards reducing emissions when we are struggling every day just to feed, clothe and house our citizens?" said F. V. Mayinga Mkandawire, Malawi's Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and Environmental Affairs.
The resistance by developing countries came after many years of fence-sitting in the face of Western pressure, and it marked a turn toward a more antagonistic stand against the global cleanup effort.
But poorer countries have long argued that the world's rich industrialized countries got that way by using the cheapest and dirtiest energy sources available to them for generations.
Most of the gases already contributing the globe's warming have come from industrialized nations. For example, the current per-capita emissions of the gases in developing countries are far below those in energy-intensive countries like the United States and Japan.
"The third world produces far less of these dangerous gases than industrialized nations, but we are being asked to do more than our fair share to clean them up," Mr. Mkandawire said.
Even rich countries fear the economic effects of complying with the costly reductions outlined in the proposed treaty, and they have far greater resources and know-how available to them.
For poorer nations, meeting the accord's goals would not merely force them to make factories run cleaner or to forego buying gas-guzzling minivans and Suburbans as in the West. It would instead call for sacrifices far more basic to their social and economic development.
If the West wants the cooperation of poorer nations, these countries say, it should share its wealth and technology.
The developing nations also maintained that the West has ignored the progress they have already made in reducing emissions.
Prosposals at this week's conference from industrialized countries for voluntary emission cuts by developing nations proved that point, they said. The talks nearly fell apart when delegates from 130 developing countries flexed their combined muscle in opposition to just such a plan.
"It's a myth that the developing countries don't care about the environment," said Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research organization. "Many of these countries have already made significant reductions in their emissions, but larger, more industrialized nations rarely acknowledge this fact."
For example, Mr. Lash said that in recent years, China had increased its fuel prices by 121 percent, resulting in a 20 percent reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide. He noted similar emission reductions by India, Mexico and Brazil, which have also raised fuel prices. In some cases these steps were taken to increase govenment revenues, but the environmental effect was the same.
In addition, environmentalists say India has become the world's largest wind-energy producer and Bangladesh has provided energy to many of its rural villages with solar power.
But it is less the current situation than the projections for the future that make the participation of developing nations vital to any effective action to stem climate change, many experts say.
Although developing nations now account for 30 to 40 percent of the world's emissions of the so-called greenhouse gases, they account for 80 percent of the world's population, and their emissions will soon exceed those of industrialized countries as their economies expand.
If the world's most populous, poorer countries indeed develop as much of the West did -- burning coal and other fossil fuels -- the consequences will be disastrous, some experts say.
"Within the next 30 years, increases in emissions by developing countries will reach the point where it's fair to say that the problem of global warming cannot be solved unless these nations agree to emissions targets," Mr. Lash said. "We in the industrialized world created the problem, but we can't solve it without cooperation from the developing countries."
But that cooperation may prove difficult to gain, particularly given the economic restraints of poor countries, and it may depend on some sign that richer nations are meeting their own commitments to reduce emissions.
Under the accord, which must be approved by the legislatures of the countries that have signed it, industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions by an average of 5.2 percent between 2008 and 2012.
Yet another bone of contention was a plan to set up an emission trading system that would allow countries that exceed their pollution limits to purchase "credits" from countries that pollute less. The United States, in particular, said Congressional approval of the accord could depend on such a provision.
The developing nations said they feared that such a trading system would allow rich countries to buy their way into compliance.

I.M.F. Reportedly to Seek More Capital

 BODY:
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has requested a $160 billion increase in the fund's capital base because of the economic crisis in Asia, a British newspaper reported today.
Mr. Camdessus wants the fund's board to raise the $200 billion capital base by 70 to 80 percent, rather than the 45 percent agreed in September, The Financial Times said. 
 Mr. Camdessus warned the board, which will discuss his proposal on Wednesday, that the fund's finances had worsened significantly since September -- especially because of its $21 billion loan to South Korea, the paper said.
Mr. Camdessus, however, has in years past called for ambitious increases in the fund's capital base that were subsequently scaled back in the face of opposition from the United States and other I.M.F. member countries.
Appearing on the television program "Newshour With Jim Lehrer" last night, Mr. Camdessus said that Japan would not need help from the fund. "Japan will not be next," he said.

HEADLINE: Russia Reaches I.M.F. Accord To Free Loans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Russia reached agreement today with the International Monetary Fund on a plan that would open the door for a quick infusion of $1.7 billion in Western loans.
Under the accord, Russia made new promises to improve its collection of taxes and cut Government spending. 
 The deal gives President Boris N. Yeltsin a chance to keep his promise to pay $1.7 billion in back wages to millions of public sector employees before the end of the year.
It will also help Russia relieve pressure on the ruble, which the Government has propped up in recent weeks with costly interventions in the currency markets.
The conditions for releasing the money include a new round of budget cuts, some of which will require approval from the Communist-dominated Parliament which has vocally questioned the monetary fund's right to tell Russia how to run its economy.
The agreement comes at a crucial moment for the Russian economy, which has been buffeted in recent days by anxiety over the health of Mr. Yeltsin and sales by foreign investors of Russian Treasury bills.
The agreement calls for the monetary fund to proceed with the next $700 million installment on a three-year $10.1 billion loan suspended since October because of Russia's failure to collect taxes.
Russia will receive the $700 million in January, a month ahead of schedule. The fund will review its adherence to the new plan before any further installments are paid.
Today's pact also unlocks $1.05 billion in World Bank money. The bank requires the monetary fund's certification of Russia's fiscal and economic soundness before making loans.
The plan will improve Russia's relations with the monetary fund, a critical step if the Yeltsin Government needs further loans to shore up its currency. Senior Russian officials have already had exploratory talks about the possibility of expanding the fund's assistance to Russia.
The accord has yet to be officially approved by the I.M.F. board, but that is regarded as a formality.
"We are pleased that the Russians are taking steps to improve their monetary and fiscal performance and that this has led to agreement with the I.M.F.," said David Lipton, Undersecretary of the United States Treasury. "These steps are aimed at bolstering the confidence of Russian and foreign investors and promoting economic recovery."
The monetary fund suspended further disbursements last October after Russia had drawn down about $5 billion of a three-year, $10 billion loan. The fund said Russia had failed to meet key conditions, chiefly the collection of taxes.
Monetary fund officials said that if Russia improved its tax collection, the next $700 million would be turned over in February.
With the turmoil on the world economic markets, Russia asked the fund to speed up that disbursement, a plea that received a sympathetic hearing in Western capitals.
In the end, officials said, the fund agreed on the faster timetable, but used the occasion to extract additional promises of fiscal restraint from the Russians.
Under the agreement, Russia pledged to reduce its Government payroll and to establish a new Treasury system that would give its Finance Ministry authority over the budgets of powerful ministries, like the Interior Ministry and the Defense Ministry.
Russia also said it would crack down on tax delinquents, open up the accounting ledgers of Gazprom, the politically powerful natural gas company, and confiscate property from persistent tax debtors.
According to officials here, the monetary fund presented Moscow with a new demand in recent weeks: the establishment of a multi-billion dollar contingency fund to deal with budget shortfalls.
The Russians argued for a smaller contingency fund than the monetary fund proposed and, one official said, the two sides eventually split the difference.
Even so, the measure is likely to draw protests from the Communist-dominated Parliament because the contingency fund would essentially be created by diverting money from the proposed 1998 budget. That budget received preliminary approval from the Parliament last week after President Yeltsin made his first appearance before it ever.
Russian officials say some of the steps are to be included in a new presidential decree, which is to be issued before the end of the year.
The Yeltsin Government has a spotty record in carrying out its promises to the I.M.F. And it remained unclear whether Moscow's recent financial difficulties will translate into budgetary discipline and sufficient support in Parliament.
To win the monetary fund's support, Russia has already taken some steps. It recently seized the property of two oil companies that failed to pay taxes and allowed interest rates on Treasury bills to rise to stem the exodus of foreign investors.
The monetary fund's long-term aim is to reduce Russia's vulnerability to disruptions in the world market.
"The I.M.F. is using this as an opportunity to get the Russians to more seriously address the fiscal issues," said Charles Blitzer, chief economist for emerging markets at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette. "You cannot really sustain a healthy economy when you have large tax arrears and large Government spending arrears. You need to have a functioning system."
That means making sure 1998 is different from 1997.
In 1997, the Yeltsin Government and the Parliament agreed on an unrealistically high budget only to see spending stopped when tax revenue failed to materialize as projected. The process was disorderly and led to a growth in government debts, including unpaid wages to workers.
Russia also maintained a large budget deficit. The deficit was financed by the sale of bonds, about a third of which were owned by foreign investors. When foreign investors became nervous about Russia's prospects and decided to sell, the ruble came under serious pressure and the Central Bank was forced to deplete its reserves to prevent a decline in the currency.
Russian officials hope the monetary fund's plan will restore the confidence of foreign investors. They have temporarily shelved plans to seek $2 billion in loans from commercial banks to help the country ride out the global fiscal crisis. They also hopes to raise additional money through privatization, like the sale this month of the government-owned Eastern Oil company.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopes Climate Fight Echoes Health Care Outcome

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
As the debate begins over the agreement to reduce global gas emissions, many Republicans sense that they have a political opportunity reminiscent of the health care fight of 1994.
The country then supported the basic idea of health insurance for all, just as it now supports strong environmental action. But Republicans skewered the health plan on the details, and in the process painted President Clinton as a big-government liberal. Some now think they can repeat their success and this time tar Vice President Al Gore. 
 Even if the Senate never ends up voting on the pact, Republicans are already testing arguments. Steve Forbes, a Republican Presidential contender, immediately called the accord "an unprecedented government seizure of American freedom and sovereignty." He added that "the Clinton health care plan pales in comparison."
Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the pact will "radically change the American life style." And Audrey Mullen, the executive director of the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, said, "Al Gore would prefer to stick working-class America with a big tax increase and stick America with lost jobs or seek the approval of his liberal environmentalist tree-hugging friends."
At the same time voices of caution in the party recognize that the Republicans have often fallen on the wrong side in the environmental debate and need to be very careful how they approach an issue on which Democrats have traditionally had a great public advantage. And some party members remember how ineffective President George Bush was when he went after Mr. Gore in 1992 on his environmental views, calling him "Ozone Man."
"The Republican Party, as far as public perception is concerned, has not been a strong position to go toe to toe on the environment," said Tony Blankley, a former spokesman for Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House. He said that while he believed that the accord and the Vice President were vulnerable, it would require an extended, concerted effort to sway public opinion.
The Republican opportunity is enhanced by division among the Democrats about the accord. It is supported by one core Democratic constituency -- environmentalists -- but has drawn significant opposition from the labor movement. This may be an issue where many Congressional Democrats stand back and let the Administration and the Republicans fight.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, who is considered a likely challenger to Mr. Gore in 2000, has been conspicuously silent about the agreement. His aides said he wanted to consult with members of his caucus. The Democratic delegation he sent to observe the Kyoto negotiations on global warming was split in its views.
The Administration does not expect to move forward to seek Senate approval until 1999 at the earliest. That means that there is plenty of time for an array of interest groups to wage a campaign of lobbying, grass-roots organizing and television ads, much as they did during the health care debate.
The question for the next year will be who will frame the debate for the American people.
"What's important now is that this is a battle for definition as much as anything else," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The issue of the treaty is completely undefined in the public mind and is in fact probably a new chapter in environmental politics."
Pollsters from both parties agree that the public right now is disposed to favor environmental measures.
A New York Times Poll last month found that 65 percent of those polled said the United States should take steps to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases "regardless of what other countries do." And a survey by the Pew Research Center last month found that a majority of Americans would even pay more for gasoline to reduce global warming.
But most Americans also favored the idea of universal health care before its opponents swung into action in 1994, ridiculing the complexity of the President's bill and running the "Harry and Louise" television ads featuring a couple voicing doubts about the plan's details.
White House officials say they learned lessons from that defeat that they are applying to global warming.
In his White House appearance on Thursday, Mr. Gore moved immediately to take off the table two potent lines of attack by the Republicans: He said the Administration would not submit the accord to the Senate until developing nations agreed to take part in the global effort. And he said the Administration would use tax incentives, not tax increases, to encourage reductions in emissions of "greenhouse gases" that are blamed for global warming.
"We were really clear about the words 'no taxes' on day one," a senior White House official said. "It was totally off the table in the first day, really quickly, no fuzziness."
At the same time, White House officials said, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore now have a powerful record on the economy, which they lacked in 1994. Their record on job creation, they argue, will help inoculate the White House against charges that the emissions-reduction effort will hurt the economy.
Finally, because the Senate will not actually receive the climate agreement until next year, there will not be actual legislation that can be picked apart. "Without the legislation, the debate's about protecting the environment," a Clinton aide said hopefully.
But Republicans are already working to reframe the issue as one of economic security and national sovereignty. This is a theme officials say can unite the Republicans' business base and economic populist faction -- and also tap into sentiment against global trade that surfaced when Mr. Clinton was defeated last month in his attempt to win expanded trade authority from Congress.
As was the case in the health care debate, the Republicans are also expecting outside help. Using the same media team of Goddard-Claussen that produced the Harry and Louise ads, the Global Climate Coalition, an association of industry groups and some unions, has already run $13 million in television advertisements against the agreement.

HEADLINE: Longtime Giuliani Assistant Will Lead Tourism Bureau

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gained extensive control over the marketing of the city to tourists yesterday -- and solved a personnel problem at the same time -- when the private New York Convention and Visitors Bureau agreed to appoint as its president Fran Reiter, formerly his Deputy Mayor and campaign manager.
City officials said the bureau, which gets about half its $7.5 million budget from the city, will now take on an expanded role as the chief marketer of New York City's shiny new image around the world, working much more closely with the Giuliani administration. 
 Stephen J. Morello, who has been president of the tourism bureau since 1994, submitted a letter of resignation yesterday and said in a brief interview that he had not decided on a new job. "The transition developed rather quickly," he said, declining to elaborate.
Several business leaders in the hotel and tourism industry said yesterday that the Giuliani administration had prevailed on the executive board of the Convention and Visitors Bureau to oust Mr. Morello and hire Ms. Reiter. By installing Ms. Reiter, who has long been a loyal and dutiful member of the Mayor's top management staff, City Hall now has a trusted associate at the helm of New York's marketing agency, which has been criticized in the past for not aggressively luring tourists. And by burnishing the city's image, the Mayor will indirectly be helping his own.
The bureau has had a low profile in recent years, and Ms. Reiter will now be further from the center of power within the Giuliani administration. Although she has worked hard for the Mayor in a variety of capacities, she becomes the first high-level casualty of the constant political power struggles within the Mayor's inner circle. Administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in recent years she had run afoul of some of the other deputy mayors, who resented her aggressive style and were concerned about how her ties to the Liberal Party would be perceived by Republicans if Mr. Giuliani ran for national office.
The administration also announced yesterday that three City Commissioners would not be reappointed in Mr. Giuliani's second term, including Christopher R. Lynn, the outspoken Commissioner of Transportation. Mr. Lynn, the most prominent gay official in the administration, had run into controversy on several occasions during his tenure. In October, for example, he got into a dispute with a Bronx parking lot owner after Mr. Lynn ordered the removal of a sign that the owner had put on a street. Mr. Lynn accepted an appointment as a commissioner of the city's Tax Appeals Tribunal.
The other Commissioners who will be leaving their jobs are Nora Chang Wang of the Department of Employment and Marta Moczo-Santiago of the Department of Juvenile Justice. Ms. Wang declined another job from the Mayor; administration officials declined to reveal where the post would have been. Ms. Moczo-Santiago, who earned $117,370 as Commissioner, accepted a position as associate commissioner for program services in the Department of Probation, where she is to earn $90,000, said Colleen A. Roche, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary.
Although her policy role has narrowed, Ms. Reiter will make more money; officials said her total compensation at the bureau would be more than $200,000, greater even than Mr. Giuliani's $165,000. And she will be in charge of what city and bureau officials said would be a much more intensive effort to promote tourism in the city, which is at its highest level ever.
"There is a recognition that we have to take tourism coordination to a much different level," said Paul O'Neil, the chairman of the bureau's executive board and the president of Sheraton Hotels of New York. "We're going to be stepping up our effort to coordinate all aspects of tourism promotion around the city, including the millennium celebration and the centennial of the city's unification, and we needed somebody familiar with all of these constituencies."
He denied that the Giuliani administration had pressured the board to hire Ms. Reiter, but acknowledged that the city's contribution of half the agency's budget spoke loudly. The Mayor appoints five members of the bureau's 15-member executive committee. "The Mayor has always contributed 50 percent of budget, and that's a lot," Mr. O'Neil said. "When he spoke, he was listened to. He has representatives on the executive committee of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, and they were listened to."
Up to now, the bureau has concentrated on bringing major conventions and trade shows to New York, and it has drawn criticism from some leaders in the hotel and restaurant industries for not coming up with more imaginative ways to lure visitors to the city. Although the city is now awash in tourists, most in the industry say that is the result of an improved economy and lower crime, rather than any intense effort on the part of the bureau.
Administration officials said the bureau would now begin many marketing efforts long urged by the industry, and would take on the role of spreading word about the city's successes -- particularly, Mr. Giuliani's successes -- to potential tourists around the country and the world.
Although the bureau's budget has been cut slightly by the Giuliani administration in the last three years, city officials said they wouldn't be surprised if the allocation increases in coming years as the bureau's mission expands.
Ms. Reiter, who had a background in marketing before entering politics, was on safari in Africa and could not be reached for comment yesterday.

HEADLINE: In Gulf Casinos' Wake, a Pawnshop Boom

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: GULFPORT, Miss.

 BODY:
For gamblers who have run out of cash but refuse to accept defeat, Drew Pitts and his 24-hour, drive-through pawnshop offers one last chance to test their luck.
"You really see how bad it is in the pawn shop," said Mr. Pitts, who worked as a dealer in the Las Vegas casinos for 14 years before opening his "Quick Cash" shop here last spring. "I see the final result now. They're having so much fun when they start -- not when they finish and end up here." 
 Anyone seeking proof that legalized gambling has thrived in the five years since casinos arrived on the Mississippi Gulf Coast need look no farther than the neon signs of the 53 pawnshops that dot the landscape like so many dandelions among the magnolias.
Pawnbrokers here tell of late-night gamblers who, unable to get more cash on their credit cards, buy televisions and radios at 24-hour discount stores, then pawn them for one-third of their value. Others pawn whatever they have because they cannot wait until midnight, when their bank cards will allow them to withdraw more money.
To be sure, many of the shops here catered to soldiers from nearby bases and local shrimp boat workers long before the casinos arrived. But the pawnbrokers and others who lend money on automobile titles have flourished alongside a casino market that has become the third largest in the country.
Later this month, Imperial Palace, which owns a major Las Vegas resort, will open this area's 12th casino, which will include a 1,088-room hotel. Construction is also under way on a $600 million, 1,800-room hotel and casino called the Beau Rivage, or "beautiful shore," which is being developed by Mirage Resorts.
For the pawnbrokers like Mr. Pitts, more gamblers and casino workers mean more people willing to trade their valuables for cash loans at a fraction of their full value, with an interest rate of 25 percent a month.
"There's already plenty of business for all of us," Mr. Pitts said. "But this town is really going to explode after they open the Beau Rivage."
Casinos and pawnshops have long gone hand-in-hand, but here the ratio of nearly five pawnshops for every casino is unique. In the nation's gaming capital, Las Vegas, for instance, there are 96 casinos but just 40 pawnshops. Kenneth Bond, who serves on the board of the Mississippi Association of Pawnbrokers, said that about 15 shops had opened on the Gulf Coast since casinos were legalized, and while local residents are a large share of their business, the casino trade had altered the customer base.
"The out-of-town customers have replaced the local people who were unstable before casinos came," Mr. Bond said.
One factor in the huge growth in pawnshops is Mississippi's relatively loose regulations. When Hayes Bolton lived in Texas, an application for a pawnbroker's license was required to show proof of having $150,000 in unencumbered liquid assets. But in 1993, when Mr. Bolton opened his Lighthouse Pawn Shop across the street from Biloxi's historic white lighthouse, he had only to produce a $10,000 bond and pay licensing fees of $150 to the state and $250 to the city.
Perhaps more important is the lucrative return that Mississippi allows pawnbrokers. The pawnshop interest rate of 25 percent per month is equivalent to an annual percentage rate of 300 percent. On a $1,000 loan, for example, interest at the end of a year would be $3,000. As a practical matter, however, most loans last only 60 days; after that, the pawnbroker is entitled to take possession of the pawned article. By comparison, in Las Vegas, the monthly interest rate is 10 percent.
"If I had known how liberal Mississippi's rules are," Mr. Bolton said with a smile, "I would have opened when I first got here in 1990."
Instead, his first enterprise was a gasoline station and garage, which now doubles as his pawnshop. The parking lot in front of his station is filled with used cars for sale. Under a state law passed a few years ago, borrowers can put up the title to their cars, boats or mobile homes, though they can keep them unless they default on the loan.
As a result, dozens of title loan businesses have opened up over the past three years, and many, like Mr. Bolton's, are physically attached to the pawnshops. The title loan businesses, which usually lend up to one-third of a vehicle's value, also charge 25 percent interest a month.
"The title bond business is so good you can't do without it," Mr. Bolton said. "It's so good, it's like dope."
While electronics and jewelry are the most common items pawned, the shelves of the pawnshops are filled with just about everything. Standing behind a glass case with diamonds as large as four carats, Don Schwartz, the owner of Gulf Coast Jewelry and Pawn, said that serious gamblers liked to wear jewelry because is gave them security.
"The main objective of having a lot of jewelry," Mr. Schwartz said, "is they can liquidate it fast and get back in the game."
But, he added, "you never know what's going to come through the door." He then pulled out the deed to a burial plot that he bought from a customer. "It was worth $1,700," he said, "and I bought it for $400."
Mr. Schwartz operated buy-and-sell shops in Atlantic City for five years and then moved to Nevada, where he decided against opening a pawnshop in Las Vegas because the license was too expensive and the business was dominated by a few large companies. Last year, he opened his shop here, across the street from the Beau Rivage site.
"Everybody wants to buy this place from me now," he said. "It's a good business, but it's a risky business, too," he noted, as he slapped the holster of a 9mm pistolt.
Mr. Schwartz has a glass case filled with new portable radios and cassette players, and Mr. Pitts's shelves are often lined with new televisions, still in the box, bought and pawned by addicted gamblers who had exceeded the cash advance limit on their credit cards. When the customers do not return to pay off their loans and interest, the new merchandise sells quickly, Mr. Pitts said.
Since the casinos are open 24 hours a day, Mr. Pitts keeps his drive-through window open 24 hours during the summer and on weekends, when tourist traffic is at its peak.
"I've sat in this window at 4 in the morning and had people willing to pawn their wives," he said. "I've seen some sad stories. All kinds of people and ages."
Some of his best customers, Mr. Pitts said, are the casino workers. While employees are prohibited by state law from gambling at the casinos where they work, they can freely gamble anywhere else. Over the past seven months, he said, one casino employee has pawned and retrieved 17 items.
"He's a good customer," Mr. Pitts said. "I appreciate him."
Lloyd Rushing, a doorman at The Grand Casino in Biloxi, confided that he used to gamble at other casinos until his paycheck was gone and that he knew plenty of casino employees who gambled and ended up at the pawnshops. "You get addicted to it," he said. "You keep going and you think you can win."

Where the President Did Not Visit, Concerns About Cutbacks

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
The drug addicts still stumble down Prospect Avenue, not far from two soup kitchens where the lines seem to grow longer every day. The homeless shuffle along, ever present, surviving in the shadows. This is the South Bronx that Ellen Rodriguez sees, and she wishes President Clinton had seen it, too.
"Just too bad he didn't come around to this area so he could see the way some of these people really live," said Ms. Rodriguez, who works at La Casita, a residence for mothers recovering from drug addiction on 156th Street near Prospect. "It's just sad to see." 
 When President Clinton visited Charlotte Street this week, hailing the South Bronx as a model of urban renewal, he left a warm afterglow in a place more accustomed to derision and contempt. His appearance brought national attention to a dramatic housing renaissance across the South Bronx that began more than a decade ago and continues, financed largely with public money.
If, as Mr. Clinton rightly noted, the South Bronx is no longer the urban wasteland President Jimmy Carter saw in 1977, people like Ms. Rodriguez know that its recovery remains piecemeal and incomplete.
The 16th Congressional District, which includes Charlotte Street, is still among the poorest in the country. There are still abandoned buildings with windows boarded shut. There are still scattered empty lots. In South Bronx neighborhoods like Mott Haven, old men push shopping carts filled with cardboard, hoping to scratch out a few nickels, if they are lucky.
And if the South Bronx has enjoyed enormous public and private investment in new housing in recent years, local activists warn that its impoverished residents now stand to suffer disproportionately as Federal, state and city governments scale back welfare benefits and food stamps.
"Yes, they've done some decent things with housing, but it doesn't mean it's all fixed," said Liz Krueger, the head of the Community Food Resource Center. "It doesn't change the fact that it is still an area with abject poverty and a long, long way to go."
A study by the resource center of the three primary political districts in the South Bronx -- Community Boards 1, 2 and 3 -- revealed that the total value of public assistance coming into the area declined by more than 17 percent between October 1994 and October 1996. While some of this decrease can be attributed to people getting full-time jobs, experts attribute most of the decline to cut-backs in benefits.
"The visit really made people feel good," said Caroline McLaughlin, executive director of the Citizen's Advice Bureau, a social services agency in the South Bronx. "But I'm still very, very worried about welfare reform, which is hitting in pieces but still hasn't totally hit."
Just a short walk from Charlotte Street, Ralph Santiago Sr., 56, stood behind the counter of his grocery store, ringing up customers who had shopped there for decades. A center for the elderly and a bank are being built across the street, reminding him of when the area thrived 40 years ago. But Mr. Santiago said sales are down recently. In the back unloading soft drinks, Ralph Jr., his son, explained why.
"It has been slow because they've been cutting back on the food stamps," he said. He said another grocer ordered 200 turkeys for Thanksgiving but sold only half because of the cutbacks. One longtime customer of Mr. Santiago's store, Sonia Fuentes, said the food stamps she receives to help feed her three children have been cut from $184 a month to $166. She says she expects further reductions.
Ernie Acosta, a supplier with Nestle Foods, said the same trend can be seen in stores across the South Bronx. "There is less money floating around," he said.
And less money means less food. Officials with Food for Survival, the organization that supplies soup kitchens and food pantries across New York, said the current increased demand for meals across the city is particularly acute in the South Bronx, where 749,000 free meals were served in September.
This endemic poverty underscores how even as 30,000 housing units have been built or renovated in the South Bronx during the last 10 years, other indices of prosperity continue to lag. In particular, unemployment remains in the double digits.
"Jobs in this neighborhood?" laughed Jessica McCormick, 29, as she and her 10-year-old son, Skylar, walked home along Prospect Avenue. "Doing what? There are not any jobs around here."
The combination of extreme poverty and improved housing has given the neighborhoods in the South Bronx almost split personalities. The blocks with new or renovated homes are considered safer and better, with a population of middle-class families. But blocks with older apartments, perhaps only a short walk away, are often considered dangerous.
Donna Nelson, who lives on the Grand Concourse, said she admires the new row houses she sees in parts of Mott Haven, where she works as in-home health aide. She said she considers these blocks safe enough -- and nice enough -- to live in. But when she walks from the bus to her job caring for an elderly woman in public housing, she keeps to busy streets for fear of crime. On the day President Clinton visited Charlotte Street, Ms. Nelson said she encountered teenagers smoking marijuana in the hallway of the housing project.
These lingering problems are why Bobby Gonzalez, 35, believes there is still much to be done in the South Bronx. As he walked home along Cypress Street near East 141st Street in Mott Haven, Mr. Gonzalez passed buildings covered in graffiti. He ran into a friend, Evelyn Salgado, 42, who said she rarely leaves her apartment, fearing crime. Because Mr. Gonzalez works, at an aluminum supply company, he could not attend Mr. Clinton's visit, but he said he would not have gone anyway. He wants to see the same sort of progress on this block.
"These buildings here probably contain more families than that whole area of Charlotte Street," Mr. Gonzalez said. "All they did was help a small number of people in the Bronx, and they are the middle class. The working class who make about $20,000 a year can never afford a house in the Bronx."

HEADLINE: Madison the Cat Is Safe! Oh, the Avenue's O.K., Too

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Yesterday was a good day for Madison the cat and Madison the avenue. One was reunited with his owner, examined by a veterinarian and found to be fine.
The other was reopened to traffic. 
 For the first time since loose bricks from a high-rise building rained down on Madison Avenue last Sunday, nearby stores were allowed to open and cars and buses were finally permitted on a two-block stretch between 53d and 55th Streets. The avenue had been closed all week while construction crews worked to shore up the damaged facade and until the city finished putting up a tunnel-like scaffold between 54th and 55th to protect cars and buses in case any more bricks fell from the high-rise.
And after a 10-minute rescue mission, Madison the tabby was freed from his owner's apartment at 536 Madison Avenue, a couple of doors down from the brick-shedding high rise. Mike Tietje of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and three employees of the city's Office of Emergency Management climbed the stairs to the top-floor apartment where Madison spent the week by himself.
His owner, Tim Curran, 27, a bartender and unemployed Wall Street stock trader who was forced to leave his apartment on Sunday because of the precarious situation, spent the week in a nearby hotel, worrying.
"If they want to come to you fast, they will," Mr. Tietje said, and Madison did. "It came out of the closet in the rear room. It started to run around us. It was scared because it didn't know us."
Shortly after Mr. Tietje carried Madison to safety, stores across from the damaged high-rise reopened for the first time since the bricks pelted the street. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went shopping, buying $71 worth of wine and stopping in cosmetics and candy shops. Officials said that buildings on the other side of the street would be allowed to reopen soon, probably tomorrow.
That was a relief to tenants like Dr. Frederick Kahn, a dentist at 538 Madison Avenue. The emergency workers who accompanied Mr. Tietje to free Madison retrieved Dr. Kahn's appointment book yesterday.
Next door, crews continued to shore up the damaged high-rise. William G. Nagle, a deputy director of the Office of Emergency Management, said bracing and structural supports had been put in. After construction workers discovered that the weakened wall was in worse condition than had been believed, work crews were ordered to reinforce it with wooden planks and steel rods.
By nightfall, traffic had been allowed back on the closed-off section of the avenue. Workers had put up waist-high barriers between 53d and 54th Streets, forming a pair of traffic funnels leading to the mini-tunnel covering the avenue between 54th and 55th.
"A building that was as high as this one, with bricks falling off, they had to make sure it was secure" before allowing traffic on the street below, the Mayor said.
City officials said on Monday that water damage to the building, accumulated from years of neglect, probably caused the damage. Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he had also asked the city's Department of Investigation to look into the accident.
For Mr. Curran, yesterday marked the end of a week of worrying over the fate of his beloved cat. As Mr. Tietje rescued Madison, Mr. Curran waited with emergency workers on the street and heard the good news over a walkie-talkie: "We have the cat. We have the cat." Mr. Tietje wrapped Madison in a blue blanket and carried him down the stairs.
Then it was off to a familiar place: A.S.P.C.A. headquarters on East 92d Street, where Mr. Curran adopted him about four years ago.
He weighed in at 16.9 pounds, about the same as before his week alone in Mr. Curran's apartment. After a checkup, Madison's condition was described in five words Mr. Curran was happy to hear: none the worse for wear.
"He certainly didn't seem hungry," said Peter Paris, a spokesman for the association. "We believe he did actually manage to make it to some food during the week."
It certainly wasn't takeout. No one, whether tenants, letter carriers or delivery people, had been allowed in all week. The rescue came after The New York Times described Mr. Curran's frustration at not being able to see or free his cat.
After Mr. Curran had taken Madison to a friend's apartment on East 85th Street, city officials said that they would have sent someone in on Thursday had Mr. Curran been there with his keys.
"Whoever he was told to see, he didn't see," said Bruce Brodoff, a spokesman for the city's Emergency Management Office.
Mr. Curran disputed that, saying that he was never given such instructions and that the officials he had spoken with at the command post on 54th Street did not have clearance to enter the building.
It turned out that Madison was not the only cat stuck on the block, or even in his building. Holed up in the ground-floor restaurant in Mr. Curran's building was Mera, a white cat with a camel-colored tail and a fondness for tuna. Never mind that his owner, Steve Tsirnikas, described Mera as "a cheeseburger cat."
Mr. Tsirnikas had left food for Mera on Tuesday, when he entered the restaurant through a basement entrance. But he could not find her. Yesterday, when he went in again, "she was all over me."

HEADLINE: ACCORD IS REACHED TO LOWER BARRIERS IN GLOBAL FINANCE

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Saturday, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Under the darkening clouds of Asia's financial crisis, the United States and more than 100 other countries signed a global trade agreement early this morning to open up the world's financial markets.
The agreement, reached after protracted negotiations that ended early this morning, commits countries to dismantling hundreds of barriers and admitting foreign banks, insurance companies and investment firms to their markets. 
 The new agreement could lead to big changes in countries from India and Indonesia to Brazil and Argentina. At its essence, the nations legally committed themselves to giving foreigners more freedom to own and operate companies in all segments of the financial services industry.
The United States, which already allows unfettered access to its financial markets, conceded nothing in the agreement. Most of the changes will be in Asia and Latin America, where countries retain many restraints on foreign banks, insurers and brokerage firms.
Even so, some economically desperate Asian countries like South Korea and Malaysia refused to commit themselves to expanding foreign access much beyond current limits -- despite the meltdown ravaging their currencies and stock markets.
The new pact could also draw sharp criticism in Congress, where some lawmakers are already suspicious of the World Trade Organization, the international body that will oversee and enforce it.
Some in Congress are still angry about a tentative ruling in which the trade organization rejected the Eastman Kodak Company's complaints about restrictions in the Japanese market. But Congress has no power to block the new pact. The Clinton Administration had the authority to negotiate and sign the agreement, which goes into effect immediately.
The new pact is less dramatic than many American companies had hoped it would be. Nonetheless, the fact that it was signed at all was viewed with considerable relief, and proponents said the deal could help reverse the tide of pessimism caused by the Asia crisis. "I don't think it would be good for confidence in the financial markets if this deal failed," said Patrick Low, the W.T.O.'s director of economic research.
 Several of America's biggest investment firms immediately praised the pact. "This agreement advances the cause of free and open markets, which will help bring the benefits of a more integrated financial system to people everywhere," David H. Komansky, chief executive of Merrill Lynch & Company, said. Jon Corzine, chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the pact would be "a powerful engine of prosperity."
 A lot is at stake. American banks and investment companies have led a worldwide expansion in financial services, from orchestrating corporate mergers to exporting American-style pension funds. International bond and stock sales have doubled in the last five years, as companies from Daimler-Benz to France Telecom listed their shares on stock exchanges. Institutional investment has ballooned, while international currency trading has swelled to $1.2 trillion daily.
Against this backdrop, it was the Asian financial crisis that overshadowed most of the talks. Though the United States has pushed harder than any other country, executives here said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, had been worried that walking away from an agreement would aggravate investor uncertainty even more.
 In Washington late Friday night, President Clinton welcomed the accord, saying it would insure market access in sectors where the United States led the world. "In the wake of recent financial instability, it is particularly encouraging that so many countries have chosen to move forward rather than backwards," Mr. Clinton said in a statement.
 American companies were conspicuous at the negotiations. Citicorp, Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch and numerous insurance companies established command posts at a hotel near the W.T.O. headquarters.As the organization's self-imposed midnight deadline for an agreement approached, many executives conferred with American negotiators.
American representatives quit the trade talks two years ago, complaining that countries were not going far enough on opening markets. Talks began again in earnest this week. As it happened, the deadline was extended by several hours as the United States kept seeking concessions.
"It is all because of les Americains!" one tired trade official said. The European Union had been ready to sign a treaty long before.
The biggest disagreements, according to officials and executives, were with Japan, Malaysia and South Korea. The South Koreans, for example, refused to commit themselves to letting foreigners own controlling stakes in banks, even with the threat of defaults looming over many Korean financial institutions.
The country is already locked in arguments with the International Monetary Fund about opening its system, barely a week after signing a $57 billion bailout with the I.M.F.
In one of the United States' toughest victories, not reached until nearly 2 A.M., Japan agreed to a sweeping array of market-opening measures. Japan had already reached a bilateral agreement with the United States that would give American companies broad access to Japan's insurance market. But Japan had refused to broaden that commitment to all countries in the organization, or to bind those pledges to the legal enforcement mechanisms of the international body.
Under the agreement, each country put forward its own best offers for opening up its local financial markets to foreign companies. The offers differ greatly, but countries become legally bound to stick by those commitments. If they do not, and the World Trade Organization rules that a country has backed away from its word, other countries get the right to seek compensation or impose retaliatory restrictions.

HEADLINE: From Close Family to World of Hate

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: DENVER, Dec. 12

 BODY:
In a sedate, upper-middle-class neighborhood here, where streets carry the names of Methodist bishops, young Mat thaeus Reinhart Jaehnig grew up in a large neo-Georgian brick house and attended a private school that nurtured freethinking. The household was headed by his father, a cerebral pastor whose pacifism dated from a childhood in war-ravaged Germany.
Last month, at the age of 25, Mr. Jaehnig burst into Denver's consciousness as a drugged-out skinhead who stole a red Pontiac Trans-Am, led the police on a wild 30-mile chase, killed a police officer in a blaze of automatic weapon fire and then committed suicide. 
 A coroner found traces of cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine in his system. Tattoos on his upper body included five skulls, two lightning bolts, one swastika, and, on his belly, the Nazi slogan "Blood and Honor."
The trajectory of Matthaeus Jaehnig (pronouced ma-TAY-us YAY-nig) from a liberal upbringing to a neo-Fascist end, offers insight into how neo-Nazi groups nationwide tap into the frustrations of alienated young people, offering solace with a scapegoating view of the world.
But Mr. Jaehnig's short life, disclosed in the accounts of his parents and friends, also offers a more universal tale of family despair over a brooding child who grew into an angry man who could not -- or would not -- find a lasting career or a place in society.
Mr. Jaehnig's end was the most violent in a string of recent attacks by skinhead groups that have rocked the Denver area, prompting much soul searching in a city that prides itself for tolerance.
Standing 6 foot 4 and weighing 200 pounds, the blue-eyed, sandy-blond Mr. Jaehnig was a two-fisted pillar of the skinhead group Denver Skins. In the summer of 1995, said a former Ku Klux Klan organizer here, Mr. Jaehnig attended a training camp at the Aryan Nations compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho. Mr. Jaehnig's family and friends denied this.
Aryan Nations, a nationwide white supremacist group linked to several incidents of racial violence in the past decade, was a a common link for two other skinheads arrested in the recent racist attacks here. The two, Nathan Thill and Jeremiah Barnum, are in jail, charged with murdering a West African immigrant, Oumar Dia, at a downtown bus stop on Nov. 18. It is unclear whether Mr. Jaehnig knew them.
"We have so many young people through here, I can't remember all the names," the Rev. Richard G. Butler, the leader of the Aryan Nations compound in Idaho, said in a telephone interview. "The youth is the future of our people, so naturally we concentrate on the youth. It's going up all the time."
Monitors of hate groups say that about five years ago Mr. Butler decided to revive his flagging movement by turning apolitical skinheads and other disaffected youths into Nazis, using forums like a newsletter, a Web site, appearances at gun shows and neo-Nazi jamborees at the Hayden Lake compound.
Yet it is not clear whether Mr. Jaehnig made neo-Nazi beliefs a core of his philosophy, or whether it was instead a tool he used to carve out a sense of belonging.
Indeed, toward the end of his life, some of Mr. Jaehnig's closest companions were members of an all-black Harley Davidson motorcycle club.
In remarkably candid interviews, friends, family members and teachers talked about Mr. Jaehnig's life.
"Matthaeus was from the very, very, very beginning a slow learner," said Ina Jaehnig, his mother, a 54-year-old high school history teacher whose voice revealed the strain of the recent events. "He was clearly dyslexic."
Ina Jaehnig and her husband, Diethart, moved here from Germany in 1971, bringing with them the psychic scars of World War II. Mr. Jaehnig's father, a German soldier, was killed by a land mine in Alsace. Mrs. Jaehnig, who grew up in Stuttgart, met her father only after the war; he had spent two years as a prisoner of war in the United States.
In Denver, the couple helped start a Waldorf School, and Mr. Jaehnig served for 20 years as pastor of an affiliated church, the Christian Community. Founded by the philosopher and educator Rudolph Steiner in Germany after World War I, the two institutions preach free-thinking, independence from governments and the nurturing of the spiritual side of children and adults. Christian Community churches are now in 16 countries and Waldorf Schools are in 32.
Until his death in 1991, Mr. Jaehnig's greatest passion was leading peace conferences for European and American young people.
The Jaehnigs bought the large six-bedroom house with a gift from Mrs. Jaehnig's father, an architect in Germany. At the west end of their block-long lot, they built the Christian Community Church, a wooden structure that resembles a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.
 
At Home and School, Difference Stand Out
To the despair of his intellectual parents, Matthaeus was slow to learn to talk. "For me as a parent, he was always a riddle," Mrs. Jaehnig said. "In kindergarten, children would say, 'I'm going to play Matthaeus.' Then, they wouldn't say anything."
His older sister, Jelena, was speeding through school. "Teo was an interesting child, very odd, very quiet, who didn't like to move a lot," said Ms. Jaehnig, a Waldorf teacher in Oregon, using her brother's nickname. Referring to their middle sibling, she added, "When Sam and I would play, Teo would usually watch."
In the small classes at Waldorf, the quiet Matthaeus was insulated from the wider world. When he reached the ninth grade, which was not offered then at Waldorf, his parents had him tutored by his shop teacher, Michael Baker. "I took him through Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs," Mr. Baker said. "We had to plow through, word by word, and then go back and look at the whole sentence."
But in 10th grade, Matthaeus started attending the nearby South High School, whose 1,500 students were about half white and half minority members. The boy was so far behind that teachers called his parents asking whether he could be tested for retardation. Assured that he was not, he was placed in a class for slow learners, where most of the other students happened to be black.
"They teased him mercilessly," Mrs. Jaehnig said of her son's classmates. "They wouldn't let him go to the bathroom. They chased him through the park."
On several occasions, the gawky boy sought refuge in the familiar warmth of the Waldorf school. After barely passing most of his first-semester classes, he withdrew from school in the spring. He was failing all subjects.
"I scold myself for letting him go to public school," Mrs. Jaehnig said.
Sam, his older brother by three years, agreed, adding: "Teo just got lost in the shuffle of a huge high school."
At South High, Sam and Matthaeus found protection in a white punk set that eventually migrated to the Denver Skins. "It was sad to see this big, simple kid harden himself," Mr. Baker said. "I watched him start to dress in black jeans, boots, combat jackets."
 
Unskilled Worker In High-Tech World
To others, Matthaeus was not just a victim of his environment. He was a victim of his own inertia, his own stubbornness, and, ultimately, his own choices.
"You can lead a horse to a river, but you can't make him drink," Jelena Jaehnig said. "Some of it was learning disability, some of it was stubbornness."
After high school, Matthaeus dropped out of a series of vocational programs, including one that taught gardening at the Denver Botanical Gardens. He went through seveal manual jobs, and once went to Europe to work for his grandfather.
"We could not find a place for him, something that would fit," Mrs. Jaehnig said.
Eventually, Sam grew out of the skinhead scene. He started getting his younger brother jobs setting up stages for rock concerts. But while Sam steadily progressed from rigger, to crew chief, to licensed stage builder, to partner in a staging company, his younger brother remained a rigger, at $7 an hour.
His old phobia of books, tests and failure apparently kept him down.
"My regular call guys had commercial driving licenses," recalled Nick Williams, Sam Jaehnig's business partner. "But Teo never took the bull by the horns for the license. There is a written test. I am sure that had a lot to do with it."
While Matthaeus Jaehnig scraped along on the fringes of Denver's booming high-tech economy, his personal life was similarly going nowhere. At 18, he became a father. One day, after a spat, his girlfriend moved out of the Jaehnig house with their baby. Mrs. Jaehnig recalled, "It shocked Matthaeus that one week after moving out, she got married -- to another man."
About this time, when he was 19, Mr. Jaehnig was arrested for the first time, charged with carrying a concealed pistol. Because of his arrest record, he was denied visitation rights. "He kept a picture of his son in his room," his sister recalled. "He would even go and watch him from a distance."
With passing years, his growing anger at "the system" seemed more directed against police officers than against racial minority member. Indeed, a few years ago, he started hanging out with the black motorcycle club.
"He went up to the mountains for campouts with them, for barbecues with them," recalled Michael Barnum, a close white friend who is not related to the skinhead arrested here recently. "One of the guys was like an adoptive father to him."
 
Bitter Anger Turns To the Outlaw Life
 But Mr. Jaehnig took drugs and lived the outlaw life. In the last two years he ran up six arrests -- for drug possession, carrying a variety of loaded handguns in his car and for pressing a loaded gun to the throat of a former girlfriend.
On June 26, 1996, Michael Blake, a Denver police officer, arrested Mr. Jaehnig after a high-speed chase. Of Mr. Jaehnig, Officer Blake recounted: "I almost shot him. When I stepped out of my car, he was going down. I told him he had better come up with open hands, or he would not enjoy the outcome. On the floor of the seat in front of him was a loaded automatic, with the safety off. His attitude was 'You won this one, they'll be another one.' His attitude was, 'I don't have a driver's license. I don't have insurance. So what's the big deal?' There was no responsibility, no respect for authority."
For eight arrests, Mr. Jaehnig spent a total of about 100 days in jail, the police say.
Neighbors fault a laissez-faire household. After Mr. Jaehnig's death, they say, the boys held skinhead parties and unleashed their dog, Mugger, on passers-by.
Last Saturday, two women, both family friends staying at the mansion, stabbed each other in a knife fight. One of the women was a homeless friend that Mr. Jaehnig had offered a place to stay.
"He would often bring home homeless friends -- that generosity is the other side of this violent boy," Mrs. Jaehnig said. On the guns she started seeing around the house, she said: "I had many, many conversations with him: 'If you have a gun, it will be used one day.' He always said: 'Mom, don't worry.' "
But for Mr. Jaehnig, the outlaw life also had a revolutionary edge.
In the summer of 1993, Don Gilworth and Bruce Vander Jagt, two police officers, were patrolling the area that included University Park when fireworks erupting over the Jaehnigs' house drew them to a backyard party of skinheads.
"I heard someone say 'Get 'em,' then a pit bull and a Rottweiler came out and ran us back to the sidewalk," Officer Gilworth recalled, saying that Matthaeus Jaehnig was the only one arrested. "On the way down to the jail, he was saying that the K.K.K. was not violent enough for their faction," Officer Gilworth said. "He said he was more in line with the white Aryan Nation."
Last month, Officer Vander Jagt, 46, had a second encounter with Mr. Jaehnig. He was the officer killed after the chase when he peered around a building corner -- straight into a fusillade from an SKS assault rifle. Mr. Jaehnig recovered Officer Vander Jagt's pistol, placed it under his chin and pulled the trigger.

HEADLINE: Unbundling Microsoft

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The fast-spreading field of information technology represents what its proponents call "the new economy," an increasingly affluent incubator of innovative products, business practices and work habits. In the new economy, its advocates insist, none of the old rules apply -- and certainly not the old antitrust ground rules that date to the late 19th century and smoke-filled rail cars.
The Microsoft Corporation, the software powerhouse, is a leading standard bearer of the new economy. So in its marathon dealings with Washington's antitrust authorities, the company has understandably taken the stance that it is engaged in a lengthy education program. 
 Microsoft executives have often expressed the view -- in tones that ranged from sincere to condescending to belligerent -- that the more Washington understands about the software industry, and its special attributes, the more the Government will be persuaded to leave Microsoft alone so it can push ahead, unfettered, to continue producing great products, rich shareholders and satisfied customers.
But in issuing a temporary order on Thursday that bars Microsoft from forcing computer makers to bundle its Internet software with its popular Windows operating program, a Federal judge stated that the antitrust issues surrounding Microsoft were not mainly about the intricacies of software programming. Instead, citing Supreme Court rulings in other industries, the judge declared that the issues in the Microsoft case were ones of old-fashioned market power, its use and its potential abuse.
"Microsoft's 'unfettered liberty' to impose its idea of what has been 'integrated' into its operating systems stops at least at the point at which it would violate established antitrust law," wrote Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court in Washington.
Judge Jackson's ruling is not an outright victory for the Government. His "preliminary injunction" against Microsoft is not a final decision. He appointed as "special master" a Harvard Law School professor, Lawrence Lessig, to study the issues of "cybertechnology" associated with the case and report back to the court by the end of May.
Yet for the moment, the Justice Department has achieved its goal of making it more difficult for Microsoft to use its dominant Windows operating system -- the program controlling the basic operations in more than 80 percent of world's PC's -- to give the company a special edge in the Internet browser market.
"The judge seems to agree with us that this case is about marketing practices and marketing power, and that traditional antitrust laws apply to this world," said Douglas A. Melamed, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
Microsoft executives say they believe the company will win in court, after the judge and special master review further evidence. "We remain confident that continuing to innovate and integrate technologies is good for the software industry and good for consumers," said William H. Neukom, senior vice president for law and corporate affairs.
The current case is a narrow one. But Microsoft executives fear that losing it could open the door to what the company sees as Government meddling in its technology decisions -- perhaps, they say, having to get an approving nod from Washington before including new features in future versions of its operating system.
"The specter here is of a Federal Bureau of Operating Systems," said Nathan Myhrvold, the chief technology officer.
Yet many industry executives are skeptical that Washington's antitrust scrutiny poses any threat to Microsoft's ability to bring innovative new products to market.
"This isn't about innovation; it's about the limits of power," said Richard Shaffer, principal of Technologic Partners, a research firm. "At some point, sheer market power reaches a threshold where it tends to be abusive. It is a political and public policy issue. It's happening in a new context now with Microsoft, but it has certainly happened before with Standard Oil, the Morgan bank and others."
In the case before Judge Jackson in the Federal District Court in Washington, the Justice Department contends that Microsoft has been violating a 1995 consent decree in which the software company agreed to make slight changes in the way it prices and sells its Windows operating system to personal computer makers.
The consent agreement was signed just as use of the Internet was beginning to soar, fueled by easy-to-use browsing programs for using the World Wide Web. The first major commercial browser was the Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator. Netscape remains the leader with more than 60 percent of the market, but Microsoft's Internet Explorer is gaining ground rapidly and now has about a 35 percent share.
In its antitrust action, the Justice Department argued that forcing PC makers to bundle Internet Explorer on their machines if they wanted to have Windows was a violation of the 1995 consent decree. Under the decree, Microsoft cannot "tie" a separate product to its Windows operating system, thereby giving it an unfair advantage in new markets.
The consent decree, however, does permit Microsoft to add new features to Windows as part of an "integrated" product. Microsoft's contention is that Internet Explorer is an integrated feature of Windows with the two programs sharing some programming language, making each dependent on the other to some degree.
Yet Microsoft also markets Internet Explorer as a separate product in shrink-wrap boxes in retail stores with its own advertising campaign and its own product logo. For the purposes of the consent decree, a key determination Judge Jackson must make is whether Internet Explorer is a "separate product" that Microsoft is unfairly tying to Windows or simply an "integrated" feature of Windows, as Microsoft contends.
In his ruling, Judge Jackson seemed to suggest that Internet Explorer appears to be a separate product, and he raised antitrust issues extending beyond the consent decree. He cited two Supreme Court rulings, one in 1984 addressing whether anesthesiology services were a product separate from the other services provided by a hospital and another in 1992 involving photocopier equipment and copier parts and service.
In those cases, the Court ruled that the key issue was not so much whether the services were integrated but the "character of the demand" and whether they were seen as "two distinct product markets" in the "eyes of the buyers."
In short, Judge Jackson appeared to be saying that the issue he was deciding in curbing Microsoft's marketing of its browser was market behavior and not technology.
"How this plays out remains to be seen," said Carl Shapiro, professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who was formerly the chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division. "But the ruling certainly shows that Microsoft cannot consider itself immune to antitrust law."

Russia to Cut Its Budget For $1.7 Billion in Aid
The International Monetary Fund and Russia agreed on a plan for a quick infusion of $1.7 billion from the fund and World Bank. The accord, which would allow for the payment of back wages and relieve pressure on the ruble, entails a new round of budget cuts that may be hard to get through Parliament. A1 

Bickering After Kyoto Pact
After the signing of a landmark environmental accord in Japan by 160 countries, sparring continued over whether developing countries would be obliged to match the industrial countries' commitment to cut emissions. A7
 
Several Republicans began testing arguments against the global climate agreement, sensing that they might skewer it despite the country's general support of strong environmental action. A1
 
Albright Praises Congo Leader
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Congo and applauded the leadership of President Laurent Kabila. She stressed the need for democracy and the rule of law, but pledged higher American aid despite reports of opposition leaders being jailed and rumors of human rights violations and corruption. Ms. Albright, in the middle of a seven-nation African tour, expressed hope that the huge nation would become the "engine of regional growth" in central Africa. A3
 
Trial of the Jackal in Paris
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, the international terrorist known as "Carlos the Jackal," went on trial in Paris on charges of killing two French security officials and a Lebanese informant 22 years ago. The Venezuelan native, who is wanted by at least four other countries for kidnappings, killings and bombings in the 1970's and 1980's, took his defense into his own hands and gave lengthy monologues about his political militancy for the Palestinian cause. A6
 
Dispute Ends at Polish Camps
A group of large stars of David and Christian crosses put up by Polish Boy Scouts in 1983 have been removed from the main burial ground at the Auschwitz and Birkenau death camps. That ended a dispute that delayed plans to preserve the sites where more than a million Jews were killed during World War II. The burial ground has been considered a national shrine for the millions of Poles who died in the war, but more than 90 percent of those killed at the Auschwitz and Birkenau camps were Jewish. A6
 
Belarus Blocks Rights Monitor
The Government of Belarus is preventing the establishment of an office there that would monitor human rights and assist in democratic development, European and American diplomats said. They said Belarus had agreed three months ago to allow the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to come to Minsk but has refused to provide the visas, diplomatic privileges or office space needed.

Internal I.R.S. Report Critical of Agency Tactics
The Internal Revenue Service, quoting from its own internal audit conducted this fall, admitted that taxpayer rights are abused by a systemwide "climate" of high pressure that encourages auditors to go to improper lengths to meet statistical benchmarks. The study said that this use of benchmarks by the I.R.S. was "unbalanced" and routinely confused as quotas. The I.R.S. commissioned the study after Senate hearings in late September where taxpayers and whistleblowers told of abuses, leading to an extraordinary public apology from the agency. A1
 
Senators Threaten Clinton
Senate Republicans threatened to block Administration nominees and freeze funding for Administration programs if President Clinton uses his power next week to make a temporary appointment without Senate approval and name Bill Lann Lee to the nation's top civil rights enforcement post. A9
 
Court to Hear Firearm Case
The Supreme Court agreed to decide what it means to "carry" a firearm while committing a drug crime or crime of violence. Existing law imposes a mandatory five-year prison sentence on anyone who "uses or carries a firearm" during that type of crime, but the cases the court will hear involve defendants who were convicted of committing drug trafficking offenses while they had guns either locked in a glove compartment or car trunk.

HEADLINE: Think Nuclear Power As Warming Solution

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Meeting Reaches Accord to Reduce Greenhouse Gases" (front page, Dec. 11): In discussions about global warming and measures to mitigate its consequences, nuclear power is often overlooked. 
 Nuclear power does not produce carbon emissions, the major contributor to global warming. France is a dramatic example of what can be done. Its use of nuclear power to generate nearly 80 percent of its electricity allows it to maintain the lowest per-capita carbon dioxide emissions level among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
True, nuclear power produces radioactive waste, which must be isolated for hundreds of years. But the amounts are relatively small and can be safely and economically managed, as shown in Europe. The impediments to the resolution of nuclear waste management in the United States are largely political, not technical or economic.

HEADLINE: Think Nuclear Power As Warming Solution;
Sacrifice Isn't Necessary

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You report (news article, Dec. 11) that for the United States to meet the promises agreed to at the global warming conference in Japan, Americans would have to make significant cuts in their use of fossil fuels. However, it will hardly be a sacrifice for this country to shift away from fossil fuels and embrace energy efficiency, fuel cells, photovoltaics and wind power. These technologies will improve the way we live, not with shocking sacrifice but with good old-fashioned American ingenuity. 
 We can reduce carbon dioxide emissions dramatically with energy efficiency and low-emission technologies at no net cost. This is because energy efficiency frequently costs less than energy generation. Most efficiency investments pay for themselves in just a few years.
While the Energy Department has indeed determined that our appetite for fossil fuels is growing, it has also concluded that a shift toward efficiency would not hurt the economy.
You note that politics -- not technology -- is the barrier and that restructuring of the utility industry provides a crucial opportunity to reduce greenhouse emissions. If done properly, restructuring will bring energy-efficient products and services to consumers and remove the indirect subsidies that have allowed coal-fired generating plants to avoid compliance with the environmental standards that other power generators in the country must meet.

Who Can Lead South Korea Out of the Quagmire?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 12

 BODY:
As South Korea lurches through an economic crisis, the presidential campaign here seems unusually clean and democratic. People are grumbling about just one detail: the candidates.
None of the three contenders has given a very credible explanation of how he would manage the economy. Two have even said they would renegotiate the International Monetary Fund bailout that is now the country's life-support system, although they have since been backtracking. 
 This has alarmed investors and foreign governments, particularly because each candidate had signed a pledge agreeing to go along with the bailout. But the broader challenge for South Korea may be that none of the candidates seems likely to emerge with a broad mandate that would allow the closing of insolvent banks and factories, a confrontation with striking unions and the unification of the nation behind a program to restructure industry and finance.
The two leading candidates, Kim Dae Jung and Lee Hoi Chang, are both respected as intelligent, cosmopolitan and courageous. But questions linger about whether they are up to the herculean task of carrying out the I.M.F. accord and presiding over a bleak landscape of layoffs, inflation and bankruptcies.
"Politically, it's very difficult," said Lee Hong Koo, a former Prime Minister. "Whoever is President next time, he's got to be unpopular. There's no other way. We need someone to say, 'This looks bad, but this is what we've got to do.' " The election is Dec. 18.
Mr. Lee favors Lee Hoi Chang, the ruling party's candidate, to bear those bad tidings. A former Supreme Court justice who has been a visiting scholar at Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley, Lee Hoi Chang is a stern, independent-minded figure whose drawback as a campaigner is that he has the charisma of a statue.
A bit ahead of Lee Hoi Chang in the polls is Kim Dae Jung, a longtime dissident who has exhibited enormous courage in defying military dictators but a bit less in challenging voters. A hero of the long struggle to bring democracy to South Korea, Mr. Kim makes the establishment nervous and is broadly popular only in his native Cholla region, in the southwest.
"If I am elected President, I will pursue new negotiations with the I.M.F. in order to regain our economic autonomy and benefit the national economy," Mr. Kim declared a few days ago.
The third candidate, Rhee In Je, who seems to have little chance of winning, has also called for renegotiation, while Mr. Lee has said that he will stick with the agreement.
The policy differences among the candidates are relatively minor, with all agreeing on a pro-American foreign policy, on the importance of a market-oriented economics, and on efforts to engage North Korea. Indeed, one of the most obvious policy disagreements concerns whether to try to negotiate a new I.M.F. accord, and lately even Mr. Kim and his aides have been signaling that this might not happen.
Indeed, in a letter to the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, released to the press today, Mr. Kim said he sought "to resolve additional issues and make up for shortcomings in the agreement."
"There have been some press reports that I demand to renegotiate the entire package," he added. "I have never made such a demand."
Ben Q. Limb, a Korean-American lawyer who serves as an adviser to Mr. Kim, said, "What he means by renegotiating the agreement is not the same as repudiating it." Mr. Limb said Mr. Kim would simply seek adjustments within the I.M.F. guidelines.
The latest opinion polls, campaign officials say, show Mr. Kim with about 37 percent of the vote, Mr. Lee with 35 percent and Mr. Rhee with 20 percent. The difference between the two leaders is statistically insignificant, and some analysts say that in the end, undecided voters are more likely to support Mr. Lee because he seems to be the safest bet.
"The mood ranges from anxiety to anger," said Han Sung Joo, a former Foreign Minister who is advising Mr. Lee. "If the anger prevails, then I think Kim Dae Jung has a good chance, because he not only is in the opposition but also has been tapping that anger by saying he would renegotiate the I.M.F. agreement. But if worry prevails, then I think that Lee Hoi Chang has a better shot."
While the administration of President Kim Young Sam has been severely tarnished by the economic crisis, this has not hurt Mr. Lee and the ruling party as much as one might expect. Although President Kim and Mr. Lee have worked closely in the past, they are now feuding, and President Kim may be supporting Mr. Rhee. Indeed, Mr. Lee has gone so far in distancing himself from President Kim as to change the ruling party's name, to the Grand National Party.
In the absence of major policy differences, the campaign has centered on such matters as Mr. Kim's age and health (he says he is 71, while his critics say he is about 74 and too old for the job) and Mr. Lee's family. Mr. Lee's election would have been almost a sure thing were it not for the failure of his two sons to enter military service.
It is perhaps natural that candidates are not extensively describing their economic policies, for there is not much political mileage in detailing to voters precisely how a candidate would make them suffer. The candidates say, only in general terms, that they are eager to shake up Korea and preside over the transition to a more modern economy.
Still, each might find that task overwhelming.
Mr. Lee is a product of the Korean establishment that many analysts say is the nation's central problem, with inbreeding between politicians, the bureaucracy and huge corporations. Mr. Kim is an outsider and might find it easier to uproot the establishment, but he has a reputation as a populist and might find it difficult to say no to trade unions, which wield enormous power.
"Clearly, this is a very difficult political environment to do something like this," a senior Western diplomat said, referring to the bailout. "You're striking at some of the connective tissue of how this system has functioned."

 BODY:
The stock of Electronics for Imaging Inc. fell more than 61 percent yesterday after it became the latest technology company to warn Wall Street of an earnings shortfall for its current quarter. In Nasdaq trading, the shares plunged $24.125, to $14.875,. The company, based in San Mateo, Calif., a maker of color-printing products, said it would earn 6 cents a share in its fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, excluding charges, in part because of weaknesses in Asian economies. Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected the company to earn 49 cents a share. The company also said delays in purchases associated with product transitions and aggressive inventory reductions by some customers were also behind the earnings shortfall.

HEADLINE: Already, The Getty Has a Full Agenda

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Barry Munitz has what might seem an enviably easy job. When he takes over as the president and chief executive officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust in January, he will inherit the recently completed product of more than a decade of efforts, a pristine, $1 billion art museum and research complex on a hilltop here that will celebrate its grand opening with ceremonies on Saturday.
With a $4.3 billion endowment, it has already captured worldwide attention. 
 But in a recent interview, Mr. Munitz, the chancellor of the California State University system, was strikingly blunt in dismissing the festivities, which will continue through the Getty's opening to the public on Tuesday, as having little relevance to what he described as a herculean task ahead. He wants to make this this imposing institution -- as well as the somewhat shapeless city over which it looms -- a national, and popular, center for culture.
"I'm not even paying much attention to them," said Mr. Munitz of the ceremonies and parties. "It's a great occasion, but to me it's the most preliminary kind of thing. It's too early to tell even what we are. We have so much work to do."
Mr. Munitz is a populist taking over what has been an elitist institution with little connection to the civic life of Los Angeles. His plans to draw a wide public to the new museum and other related institutions represents not only a big step in Los Angeles's coming of age as a major cultural center, but almost a repudiation of the majestic but isolated location of the fortresslike center, which is accessible only by a tram that leads up from a large parking garage whose parking spaces have been booked far in advance.
The campuslike structure covers 110 acres and sits on a hilltop towering above the San Diego Freeway and the tony west side neighborhoods of Brentwood and Bel Air. Designed by Richard Meier, it is a cool, austere series of buildings covered with Italian travertine, connected by a large off-white plaza and commanding a view of the ocean on smog-free days.
The museum includes 55,000 square feet of display space for its collections of ancient art, European decorative arts and Old Master and 19th-century paintings. It is a detached island of repose amid Los Angeles's busy sprawl.
"We have to think every day how we work against that," Mr. Munitz said of the aloofness of the setting. "There is a set of conditions against which we have to push back. It won't happen naturally."
Until now, despite its great wealth and creative talents, this city has traditionally made a far greater impression in movies and on television than in arts circles. In fact, when wealthy arts patrons here are interested in high art, they often fly to New York. And the city's many ethnic communities have traditionally had little involvement in the museums here.
David Geffen, one of the founders of Dreamworks SKG and a major collector and arts donor, observed: "People here go to New York all the time, for culture and theater. People don't expect to do that here to the same extent. In Los Angeles you have smaller goals, you have smaller institutions."
The hope now is that the Getty's opening can become an important part of a shift many people say is already beginning to take place.
"We do not have the tradition that New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Cleveland have," said Eli Broad, a wealthy businessman who was founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art here and is a former chairman of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "We're younger. And you have a lot of first- generation wealth here. That's one reason why Los Angeles has not been a cultural tourist destination. It has been so fragmented. The Getty may be the locomotive to help the change."
It helps considerably that the Getty is opening at a time of unusual ferment in Los Angeles. The long-stalled plans to construct a new concert venue, Disney Hall, designed by Frank Gehry, just received a a $25 million donation from the Walt Disney. Plans are moving ahead to construct a new Roman Catholic cathedral downtown. A huge new sports and entertainment complex is also planned for downtown.
"When all that is completed, it will be a city that has dramatically transformed itself," said Rusty Powell, the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the former director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "The art market is always going to be pre-eminent in New York, but the second city aspect of what you find in Los Angeles is going to become irrelevant."
Michael Ovitz, the former president of the Walt Disney and a philanthropist, emphasized that these new architectural landmarks could themselves attract more interest. "When all that is built, you can finally make a compelling case for people coming to Los Angeles as a cultural destination," he said. "Those buildings will be a real draw for a city that hasn't had those kinds of draws."
Adding an even greater sense of momentum is the booming growth in the technology and entertainment industries, which are fueling an economic surge. In many instances, these businesses are just getting organized to back the arts here.
"Now the economy has been transformed," said Mr. Munitz. "Here we are at the Getty, close to but not much connected to, either of those communities. We are going to look quickly and aggressively at ways to partner up with the technology industry and the entertainment industry." Mr. Munitz is certainly not facing a blank slate, but he characterizes the huge new campus as little more than a $1 billion seed. He said that he had few specific plans so far, but that he wanted the Getty to become even more involved in education, bringing schoolchildren to the museum and training teachers in the arts.
When the outgoing head of the Getty, Harold M. Williams, took over in 1981, he had little mandate other than to create an important cultural institution. The Getty Trust had a modest museum in Malibu and a huge endowment. Mr. Williams pushed hard to develop not just the museum and its collection of ancient art, Old Master paintings and the like, but also research into such areas as art conservation and support of education.
Today, the immaculate new campus houses, in addition to the museum, institutes for arts research, conservation, arts information, education, grants and arts leadership.
The principal public draw, of course, will be the collection, but Mr. Munitz was cautious about what it could achieve, even with its huge acquisition budget.
"It's never going to be an encyclopedic museum," he said. "It will be a spectacular museum."
That is one area of potential friction as Mr. Munitz tries to connect the museum with other arts institutions here. The Getty can outbid almost any other institution, including local museums, for major works, and has done so on occasion. Mr. Williams explained that one reason the Getty had decided to collect works only up to the 20th century was so it would not compete in more recent art with other museums in the area. (The trust has filled its private administrative offices, however, with works by artists like Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning.)
Mr. Williams said the museum could reconsider the self-imposed limits on 20th-century art. Some museums here are concerned that the Getty might outdo them in seeking donations of major collections of contemporary art from wealthy individuals.
Meanwhile, Mr. Munitz is trying to stress the trust's functions other than the museum as a way of building connections with the city's various communities, particularly its Latino, Asian and other ethnic groups.
"Perhaps most critical is that this will strengthen and awaken the local awareness of an arts culture for a variety of communities in Los Angeles, many of which aren't used to thinking of these things," said Mr. Munitz.
Some of the other museums here are also trying to build bridges to groups that were traditionally neglected. "When this museum was built, there was no belief in outreach," said Andrea L. Rich, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which has recently created a collection of Mexican art. "You may not need that in New York, but in Los Angeles you have to make a conscious decision to come to the museum."
Whatever kind of relationship develops between the Getty and communities around the city is likely to be complicated. There will be almost no drop-in traffic because of the need for parking reservations. There will be no street life in the big plaza in front of the museum, no mimes passing a hat or food vendors.
"We won't have the pretzel guy and the hot dog guy," said Mr. Williams. "But we'll have our espresso carts."

A picture caption in the Arts and Ideas pages on Saturday, with an article about heightened expectations for the new Getty Center in Los Angeles, referred imprecisely to the buildings shown and misstated the extent of the opening scheduled for today. The picture showed the entire Getty Center, not just the museum, and all of it is opening to the public.

HEADLINE: Crime

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
The saddest crimes in Archer Mayor's rawboned mysteries set in Vermont are the slow deaths of those hard-working mill towns that were once the backbone of the industrial Northeast. Its factories closed and its spirit broken, the worn-out specimen that Mayor mourns so eloquently in BELLOWS FALLS (Mysterious Press/Warner, $22) has already deteriorated into a welfare town plagued by crime and burdened with social problems. But a reclamation movement is also afoot in this picturesque village, so the last thing it needs now is a new drug merchant -- or a sex scandal in the already demoralized Police Department.
Lieut. Joe Gunther, the iron man of this rugged series, is lent out by the Brattleboro Police Department for the internal investigation of a cop accused of harassing the wife of one of the town's less-than-solid citizens. Gunther knocks down the bogus charge but sticks around to keep an eye on the complainant, a known drug dealer whom he suspects of setting up a distribution network sure to undermine the fragile stability of Bellows Falls. Mayor creates the kind of characters who have always had to fight for survival. Individuals like the villain's battered wife and the naive young cop who falls in love with her seem painfully real. But it is when these people are viewed collectively -- as Bellows Falls in the flesh -- that we can really see the value of their lives. 
 On a perishing cold winter's day in 1895, the naked, abused body of a young housemaid is discovered frozen to the ground in a squalid back alley of Toronto. Maureen Jennings makes a tender moment of this stark scene in EXCEPT THE DYING (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $23.95), a first novel enriched by the vividness of its period settings and animated by the lifelike characters caught up in its broad social sweep.
The newsboys on their street corners, the prostitutes in their filthy beds, the widows at their craft work, the courting couples on their skating ponds, the rich men at their clubs -- Jennings has a wonderful feel for the places and tasks that give life and context to a character. She also understands the barriers of economics, class and religion that imprison people in their separate niches.
By virtue of his sympathetic nature, Detective William Murdoch slips easily through all these worlds, unafraid to shake them to their foundations in his search for the person who is using and discarding women with such contempt. In private, Murdoch mourns the fiancee who died young ("gone as quickly as a shadow on the lawn") and silently practices his waltz steps on the bare floor of an empty room. Although he solves his case in a fairly conventional way, there's more to Murdoch than his genre traits, and his warm heart makes him the right sleuth for this cold city.
Ian Rankin's Scottish police procedurals are so gritty you have to pick the shards out of your teeth when you finish one, and BLACK & BLUE (St. Martin's, $24.95) is as flinty as they come. Only a hard cop like John Rebus could shrug off the attacks of gangsters, the threats of senior officers and the grief he gets from his own Calvinist conscience to carry on a lone-wolf investigation into several heinous but far-flung and seemingly unrelated crimes.
Don't ask him why, but Rebus senses a connection between the murder in Edinburgh of an oil rig worker from Aberdeen and the Godfatherlike maneuvers of a mobster in Glasgow. More unnerving are the parallels he sees between the current activities of a serial killer known as Johnny Bible and the work of Bible John, the legendary "bedtime bogeyman" of an earlier generation.
It takes a lot of traveling time and close, often dangerous police detection for Rebus to work all the information he gathers into a coherent pattern; and some events, like a trip to an oil rig in the middle of the North Sea, stick in the mind more than others. But Rankin has a point to make about the corrosive effects of human wickedness that, if left unchecked, seeps into the bloodstream and poisons the national body -- a point well made in his blunt and bruising style.
The air of moral certitude in Margaret Yorke's new novel of psychological suspense, A QUESTION OF BELIEF (Mysterious Press/ Warner, $23), brings to mind those cozy classics of the golden age of the English mystery. The forces of good and evil line up neatly when a mild-mannered department store executive is falsely accused of sexual harassment by a vindictive customer. After losing both his job and the trust of his family, the poor chump fakes his suicide and tramps off to a little village where nobody knows of his shame. Here his fate intersects with that of another outcast, an illiterate teen-ager who has been shabbily manipulated by a militant animal rights activist with a hidden agenda. Several other folks come out of the woods to play, and although their convergences are strictly contrived, their characters are sharply defined in this fatalistic tale of modern morality in tatters.
Compared with the nimble-witted academics D. J. H. Jones satirized with such gusto in "Murder at the MLA," the brain-dead cultists who get hammered in MURDER IN THE NEW AGE (University of New Mexico, $19.95) are an easy target. Still, it's a nasty pleasure to watch the clever series heroine, the Chaucerian scholar Nancy Cook, stick it to the colony of New Agers whose house she is sharing while on sabbatical in Santa Fe. In her inspired intellectual assaults on cant, she debunks their theories on near-death experiences, gives them the scientific skinny on crop circles and informs them that their beloved Anasazi were cannibals. But both Nancy and the pseudonymous author are wasting their talent for invective on these chowderheads, even if one of them does happen to be a killer.

George Bush
 The Life of a Lone Star Yankee.
 By Herbert S. Parmet.
 Illustrated. 576 pp. New York:
 A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $32.50. 
 Somewhere, some entrepreneur must be preparing a video library of 20th-century Presidents for release during the coming turn-of-the-millennium marketing frenzy. When the tape rolls around to George Bush, there will be the line-in-the-sand speech in which he went eyeball-to-eyeball with Saddam Hussein. There will be footage of Bush, at just the moment when Americans worried about becoming economic vassals of a predatory Japan, vomiting at a state dinner in Tokyo. And, to catch the irony of his eight years' service as Ronald Reagan's loyal Vice President, there will be his contemptuous charge -- issued during the 1980 campaign against Reagan for the Republican nomination -- that the California Governor was a believer in "voodoo economics."
These and lots of other familiar images scroll by in Herbert Parmet's "George Bush: The Life of a Lone Star Yankee," the first full-scale biography of the penultimate elected President of the 20th century. Parmet, a professor of history at the City University of New York, has given us a sympathetic portrait of a moderate Republican in the doomed lineage of Wendell Willkie and Nelson Rockefeller, who tried to refashion himself for the Sunbelt politics of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. He even finds a hint of tragedy in this career -- as Bush fails, despite his rise to the Presidency, to preserve the core value of the tradition from which he came, which Parmet sums up as "mitigating the excesses of capitalism" for those who gain or lose too much from the workings of the free market.
Ultimately descended on his father's side from Scottish Protestants and on his mother's side from English Catholics (the ancestral religious divide closed when the two families converged into socially irreproachable Episcopalianism), George Bush was born in 1924 into a family with a good pedigree and a solid fortune. After growing up in Greenwich, Conn., he took the prescribed route via Andover to Yale, where he acquired lifelong friends in the secretive Skull and Bones Society. His father, Prescott, was a partner in the investment firm of W. A. Harriman, and a member of the Yale Corporation. An imposing and formal man, Prescott Bush commuted for years to Grand Central Station, then rode down to Wall Street on the subway. "He'd die now," according to George's sister Nancy, "with limos picking them up. He was a straphanger." Though more than proficient at earning and saving, Prescott Bush regarded zeal for money as a contaminating passion.
Parmet's theme is how George Bush found his father's patrician New England scruples a handicap in the changed political world to which his own ambition drew him. Prescott Bush himself was elected to the Senate in 1952 (defeating Abraham Ribicoff), and when Parmet gives us a glimpse of him uneasily sharing a Bridgeport platform with Senator Joseph McCarthy, we get a premonitory feeling, as if we were watching a preview of the destiny of his son: the half-desperate, half-appalled blue blood cozying up to the xenophobes and demagogues who are taking over the Grand Old Party.
Having realized early that power was shifting westward, the younger Bush built his own political future, according to a friend, "by breaking away from the white-shoe set of Yale and Andover by going out and being a relative roughneck in the oilfields of Odessa, Tex." But the break was never clean. Throughout his Texas career, and beyond, he was dogged by suspicions that he was a silver-spoon Yankee dissembling in a cowboy hat.
Parmet gives a meticulous account of Bush's rise to prominence in Texas, beginning with his ventures in oil exploration, financed in part by family funds. When Bush moved into politics (becoming Harris County Republican chairman in 1963), he never lost his adopted identity as an oilman -- always defending the oil depletion allowance and other tax and regulatory benefits for the industry, even while preaching the evils of government interference in the marketplace. Some of the social attitudes he had brought with him from New England were, however, more dispensable. "His first significant break with his moderate background," according to Parmet, came during his run for the Senate in 1964 against the Democratic populist Ralph Yarborough. With "working-class ethnic minorities, especially blacks and Mexican-Americans . . . threatening to depart from their traditional roles as suppliers of cheap labor," George Bush responded by defending poll taxes as better than having the polls "swamped" with the "liberal bloc vote" they potentially represented.
Though he lost to Yarborough in 1964, he was elected two years later to Congress from Houston's Seventh District; and by 1968 the young Congressman, with his unusual aura of Texas savvy and New England polish, was widely discussed as a possible running mate for Richard Nixon. After another failed try for the Senate in 1970, Bush changed course, building his circle of patrons through a series of appointed offices: Ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, head of the United States liaison office in China and Director of Central Intelligence.
Throughout this career, many found it hard to tell just what George Bush believed. Parmet, too, seems uncertain -- reporting, for instance, that Congressman Bush was sufficiently liberal on family planning and abortion laws that he was known in Washington as "Rubbers." Yet when he ran with Ronald Reagan in 1980, he endorsed in full voice the party platform calling for a constitutional amendment to repeal Roe v. Wade. Every politician sometimes has to bend to the wind; but Parmet's book raises, again and again, the question of whether George Bush ever came to a moment in public life when he followed his convictions rather than his interests -- or whether there was any distinction between them.
This question is never resolved. Parmet finds hints in Bush's diaries (to which he had free access) that he recoiled from what the biographer calls the "tacky ostentation" of the Reagan circle. Yet he notes in passing that when it came time for Bush's own inauguration in 1988, it was twice as expensive as Reagan's. Still, he seems to want to dissociate Bush from the "Teflon President," in whom Parmet finds hypocrisy raised to a public art. Reagan, he writes, "could increase deficits while calling for budget balancing and win praise for fiscal responsibility. He could ignore export laws by making covert shipments of arms. He could do almost anything without jeopardizing assumptions about his patriotism and good sense."
In the end, the suggestion of discontinuity between the master actor and the career politician is unconvincing. The era of Reagan and Bush was continuous in the growth of income disparity to its greatest levels since the Gilded Age. It was continuous in inflaming racial animosities, narrowing access to education and shifting the burden for social welfare to the private sector even as the pace of charitable giving declined -- despite Bush's talk about a "thousand points of light" and being the "education President." And thanks to the Iran-contra circumvention of the Congressional ban on supplying arms to Nicaraguan "freedom fighters," the savings and loan scandals, and the atmosphere of venality and greed that Parmet describes with appropriate revulsion, the Reagan-Bush years contributed to the breakdown of public trust in the processes and persons of government.
Parmet tends to describe George Bush as valiant rather than insouciant within the historical limits in which he found himself. He points out that Congress shared responsibility for the deregulation of the savings and loan industry that led to the most costly taxpayer bailout in American history. And he writes admiringly of Bush's handling of foreign affairs in the aftermath of Tiananmen Square, during the potentially explosive meltdown of the Soviet empire, the controversy over German reunification and the gulf war. Yet in the end Bush's reputation will be safer with those who get their history from video clips than those who read this ultimately disheartening book. For fans' coffee tables, there is "George Herbert Walker Bush: A Photographic Profile" (Texas A&M University Press, $39.95), compiled by the former President's personal photographer -- a feel-good album ranging from boyhood photos to snapshots of the "grandkids." By contrast, Parmet's book leaves one with the feeling that it was written with respectful intent by an author too scrupulous to conceal its indicting effect. It is the story of a man who never quite convinced the new Republican ideologues that he was one of them -- though not for lack of trying. "To passionate critics on the far right," as Parmet puts it, "Bush had to do more, more, more," and he never did enough. Whether he stopped short out of decency or weakness is never quite clear.
The theme of desperation and inconstancy in an unmoored American leader that Parmet explores in this book was anticipated with uncanny prescience by Walter Lippmann nearly 70 years ago: "Our rulers today . . . are to be found in the inner circles of banks and corporations, in the best clubs . . . among the political churchmen . . . and the grand panjandrums of the secret societies. They give orders. They have to be consulted. . . . But none of them is seated on a certain throne, and all of them are forever concerned as to how they may keep from being toppled off. . . . Nor do they count with any confidence upon retaining their power, nor of handing it on to their sons. They live, therefore, from day to day, and they govern by ear. Their impromptu statements of policy may be obeyed, but nobody seriously regards them as having authority."
In 1992 -- still flush with war victory, but weakened by years of trying to placate the forces of reaction within his own party -- George Bush finally toppled. Perhaps a new generation of Republican leaders like George W. Bush, now Governor of Texas, will find a way to restore the old combination of economic conservatism and social liberalism for which his father and grandfather once claimed to stand. "You can count on it," the senior George Bush might say, as he used to do on the campaign trail. But who would believe him?

HEADLINE: The Population Explosion Is Over

 BODY:
After arguing for years that societies have little trouble adjusting to rapidly growing populations, Ben J. Wattenberg is worrying that aging populations and slower growth are obstacles to human well-being ("The Population Explosure Is Over," Nov. 23). What delicious irony!
Birthrates are certainly declining around the world. Not a world made lonely by fewer children, however, but one with better access to education and health care for women, and with families who are choosing to have fewer kids in order to give each child a better life. 
 Wattenberg would have us believe that "the saddest funerals are those in which the deceased have no offspring." In developing countries, the saddest funerals are those of the 600,000 women who die needlessly each year from pregnancy-related complications, many of them mothers with young children.
Yes, world population growth is slowing, but is unlikely to be over "soon." Today's population of 5.9 billion puts us just past the midpoint of some 50 years of unparalleled growth: some 2 billion people since 1970 and most likely another 2 billion by 2020. If the world's population starts to decrease in size, it will only do so several decades from now at the earliest, and from a level substantially higher than today's.
Most future growth will occur in developing countries. While birthrates have fallen in many of these countries, they are still high in many others. In sub-Saharan Africa, birthrates are not "plunging," but falling modestly. For example, in Kenya, the average number of births per woman has fallen from over eight to between five and six. Under even the lowest of the U.N.'s projections, sub-Saharan Africa's population will nearly double in size to 1.2 billion by 2025.
Many poor countries are struggling to support their current populations. Slowing population growth is essential to insure a world worth living in for future generations. Even with declining birthrates, by the middle of the next century, at least two billion people will live in countries where water shortages may constrain food production and economic development.
Wattenberg rightly attributes declining birthrates in developing countries to the success of international efforts to expand access to family-planning services, to social and economic change, but most of all, to the conscious choices about childbearing made by millions of individuals. But his misrepresentation of other facts provides further ammunition for those seeking to deny women and men the means to control their reproductive destinies, including our own Congress, which has slashed funding for international family planning by one-third since 1995.

HEADLINE: Housing Investment Surges in Cambridge, Mass.

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
A YEAR ago Linda and Russell Gee sold the roomy home in suburban Newton where they raised their two children and bought a Victorian house on a marginal block dense with housing in Cambridge.
"Classic empty-nester stuff," said Mr. Gee, a 51-year-old partner in a software company in the nearby town of Waltham. 
 The couple used the $400,000 from the sale to buy a 100-year-old house on Sacramento Street, a few blocks from the Harvard campus in a neighborhood with a mix of artists, academics and affluent professionals and working-class families.
They intend to invest $175,000 more to renovate the house. Given the expense, Mr. Gee said, "we're asking ourselves, 'Is this a bad idea?' "
"But it's so cool living here," he said. "We can walk to stores and bars that aren't chains and have neighbors who teach, who make furniture. Money is not at the center of everybody's life as it was in Newton."
In the last three years, this city of 92,000 residents in Boston's backyard has seen a wave of newcomers like the Gees invest in upgrading the existing housing stock. Along with them as well have come professional developers producing luxury housing for others to buy or rent.
Cambridge is buzzing with renovation activity because the end of rent control has coincided with a strong economy and favorable interest rates. A statewide referendum three years ago, financed by property owners and real-estate trade groups, led to the demise of controls in the three communities that had it -- Cambridge, Boston and Brookline.
In Cambridge it stripped 15,000 housing units of rent protections, about 37 percent of the entire housing supply.
Real estate specialists note that the long housing recession of the late 80's and early 90's has given many baby-boomer families the time to amass equity to plow into a housing investment.
"The housing market here is exploding," said Roger Herzog, the director of housing for Cambridge, who runs the city's affordable housing programs. He expressed concern that owners who developed low-income housing years ago under Federal programs would convert about 2,000 units to market-rate rentals once they became eligible to do so. If the owners refinance with conventional loans, they would be able to charge market-rate rents.
Already about 800 new luxury rental units are being built, the first upsurge in new market-rate construction in 25 years. And all around the city existing homes are being refurbished, sometimes expanded by new owners who build additions, and sometimes converted from rental or ownership occupancy to condominium apartments.
In the 1997 fiscal year, which ended June 30, Cambridge issued 2,100 permits for building projects, up from 1,488 for the year that ended in June 1994, the last 12-month period under rent regulation. Ranjit Singanayagam, the city's assistant commissioner of the Inspectional Services Department, estimated that the 1997 permits would generate $170 million in renovation activity. The 1994 permits brought forth about $61 million in renovation work, he said. The department keeps no figures on the number of housing units represented by the permits it issues.
"In Cambridge, we've seen some properties flipped after a rehab for prices that are almost too high," said Stephen E. Doran, a vice president for Fleet Mortgage Corporation, which recently had about a 30 percent increase in the origination of home-improvement loans over the last three years. According to Karl Case, a housing consultant to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, "The low end of the market is disappearing and the high end is reaching new heights."
THE house the Gees purchased had not previously been a rental. They bought it from a woman who had lived in it for 70 years. With about 2,000 square feet on two floors, it is much smaller than their Newton house and has never undergone major renovations. It has two bedrooms, a sleeping porch and one bathroom upstairs. Downstairs, it has a gracious entry foyer and staircase, parlor, dining room and kitchen.
The Gees expect to spend about five months to modernize the interior and refurbish the historic exterior. They will tear down the garage to have a larger backyard and space to expand the sleeping porch and one bedroom into a master suite. They will also add one and a half bathrooms, finish part of the basement for an office, gut the kitchen and existing bathroom and rebuild a side porch.
Elsewhere in Cambridge, the ever greater presence of commercial developers has raised questions about whether residential streets in higher-density zones will lose their character as builders seek to maximize the economic potential of their sites.
The city's oldest house, the 307-year Cooper-Frost-Austin House, is on Linnean Street, where Steven A. Cohen, president of the CEA Group of Cambridge, who has long experience as a builder in the city, purchased an 1872 Victorian for $825,000 late in 1995. A long battle with neighbors ensued when he proposed to build eight new condominium units on the property, which was zoned for 14 units.
Ultimately, he compromised by renovating the existing house and building a four-story addition on the rear of the lot, with one luxury condominium of about 2,200 square feet on each floor. He had the original house lifted up while a larger foundation was poured for the project. He is also renovating the original house, and he has sold three of the five units at prices of just under $900,000 to just shy of $1 million each.
But neighbors are still unhappy, fearing that their Avon Hill neighborhood and similar districts with a historic character will be unwisely transformed.
Gwendolen G. Noyes, a partner in the Cambridge-based Oaktree Development Corporation, did a different kind of expansion and renovation on Garden Street, just a block from the Historic West Cambridge District where Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's mansion is maintained as a National Park site.
IN 1995, Oaktree purchased a 3,400-square-foot, single-family Victorian for $575,000. The company intended to renovate and convert the three-story, 1890 house into three units. But the city, fearing overdevelopment, downzoned that type of house, Ms. Noyes explained.
Instead, starting in the spring of 1996, her company added four feet to the back of the house and created two condominiums, which sold for a total of $1.2 million by last summer, she said. The most dramatic changes in the house -- the additional footage, a new entry, a widened and altered stairway, a new bathroom, finished basement, elaborately landscaped garden -- were made in the back unit purchased by Jerome and Marlene Schultz.
They sold the three-bedroom colonial where they had raised their two daughters in suburban Needham for a price they declined to disclose, and paid more to buy their 1,800-square-foot condominium with two bedrooms and a study.
"We were coming in every other week to have fun anyway," said Mr. Schultz, a clinical neuropsychologist who, with his wife, spent two years looking for a home here.
Ms. Schultz can walk to her job as an administrator at Lesley College while Mr. Schultz can easily commute throughout the region or around the country. His new home is near all the major highways and about 15 minutes from Logan International Airport.
"To decide at the last minute to go to a restaurant and walk to one of a hundred places is very exciting," he said. "We're close to the pulse of things."
As a bonus, he added, "We have enough space to maintain a family home that our daughters, and hopefully our grandchildren, can come back to."
Mr. Gee of Sacramento Street, meanwhile, wonders if some of the creative, youthful energy in Cambridge that attracts him and his wife will be priced out of the market.
Ms. Noyes, the developer, who herself is a Cambridge resident, acknowledges that to a degree, it is inevitable.
"People are being displaced," she said. "It can be heart-rending, but as an architect and a builder, when I see people fixing up houses and giving them 50 more years of life, I can't say I feel bad about that."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
With a Lavish Bow to the Past, A Broadway Palace Is Built

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
"TONY, ARE THEY GOING to pour the orchestra Thursday?" Peter H. Kofman asked one morning last February, the edge in his voice suggesting that there was only one answer he wanted to hear.
Mr. Kofman, an architect and engineer from Toronto, stood near Times Square inspecting an embryonic steel skeleton that was growing even as he watched, beam upon column etched against a pale winter sky. In the fanlike arcs of the balconies-to-be, the framework had begun to hint at its structural destiny. It was becoming a theater. 
 A really big theater.
Concrete was about to be poured to form the auditorium floor. And Mr. Kofman sought assurance from the on-site project architect, Tony Tarazi, that this would occur the next day, as scheduled.
Every hour mattered. Mr. Kofman's client, Garth H. Drabinsky, chairman and chief executive of Livent, the Toronto-based theatrical production company, had told the world that he would have the theater, the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, open by December 1997. More than Mr. Drabinsky's reputation was on the line with this high-stakes goal; so were investment-tax credits worth $4 million to $5 million, applicable only if the theater was in operation by year's end.
As it happened, the orchestra floor was poured on schedule. Indeed, it seems that almost everything has gone right with the $22.5 million construction project, including elements not susceptible even to Mr. Drabinsky's considerable influence, like a mild winter that barely interfered with progress.
And so its many doors -- there are entrances both on 42d and 43d Streets -- are about to open, on time. This brings to a close the story of how a plush theatrical showplace emerged from what was a muddy pit only a year ago.
With a flourish, the Ford Center has appropriated the exuberant 43d Street facade of the Lyric Theater -- a turn-of-the-century, four-story riot of richly sculptured detail. But it has replaced the actual structure of the Lyric and its handsome next-door neighbor, the Apollo Theater of 1920, bookends to the brief period when 42d Street was the theatrical hub of New York City, the giddily high-spirited province of Shubert brothers and Ziegfeld girls.
Two historic 42d Street playhouses, the New Victory and New Amsterdam Theaters, have already been reclaimed as part of the government-sponsored 42d Street redevelopment project. Twelve days from now, when its curtain rises on the first New York preview of the musical "Ragtime," the 1,821-seat Ford Center will take its place as one of Broadway's largest theaters (rivaled only by the Gershwin and the New Amsterdam) and its first new playhouse in more than a decade. Opening night is Jan. 18.
Mr. Drabinsky is so proud of his theater that today he is inviting the public to an inspection tour between 10 A.M. and 6 P.M. Visitors will walk over the speckled mosaic faces of Tragedy and Comedy. They will discover as many chandeliers as a dowager has diamonds. Under the great elliptical dome salvaged from the Apollo and restored to Easter-egg perfection, they will find murals depicting music, dance and drama in ancient Greece. And everywhere they will spot lyres, emblems of the Lyric; painted, stenciled, cast in iron.
What they will not see is a restoration of the Apollo and Lyric auditoriums. Until a year ago, the Livent team artfully presented its plans to the public as a kind of combination and renovation of two old playhouses. Livent's annual report for 1995 described the new project as being built "within the existing framework of the legendary Lyric and Apollo Theaters."
In truth, the Lyric and Apollo were demolished. Yet key features were preserved and reincorporated in the new building: the Lyric's facades and the domes, proscenium arch, boxes and 42d Street lobby from the Apollo, which was designed by Eugene DeRosa.
"We're saving history and putting it in a much more practical environment," Mr. Drabinsky said. "The other theaters would have sat there and rotted. There's no point in talking about the conservation and restoration of history if it can't be savored by the public."
There is much to be savored in the Lyric facade, designed by V. Hugo Koehler, who was also the architect of a celebrated Harlem playhouse, the Lafayette Theater. Athena and Hermes gaze impassively on arriving theatergoers while demonic ram's-head masks leer over their shoulders. Banded columns soar upward from a second-story balustrade, framing arches that contain the busts of three bewhiskered Edwardian gentlemen. The brickwork is punctuated by oculi and festooned with enough wreaths for an opening-night bouquet.
(The theatrical historians Mary C. Henderson and Louis Botto both believe that the busts probably depict Reginald DeKoven, the composer for whom the Shubert brothers built the theater, and Gilbert and Sullivan, whose names were synonymous with musical comedy.)
Behind this facade was built an entirely new four-story structure housing the main lobby, a box office and two rehearsal halls.
On 42d Street, behind a smaller Lyric facade that was also preserved, is a renovated three-story structure containing another box office and a through-block link to the main lobby. On the second floor is an office, once used by the Shuberts, that will serve as Mr. Drabinsky's New York base.
Just west of the Lyric's facade on 43d Street is a new 94-foot-long, 70-foot-high box clad in red-brick panels that contains the auditorium of the Ford Center.
Rising beside the auditorium is the structure known as the stage house, which contains the stage deck, the fly loft into which scenery is hoisted and, below, the trap room into which the stage floor can be lowered. Reaching 100 feet, this structure is as tall as a 10-story apartment building. Atop it is a 40-foot-high rooftop sign.
At the pinnacle of the sign is the familiar logo of the Ford Motor Company, which paid Livent for "naming rights," as it has for theaters in Chicago, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia. Just how much, neither company will say. But Christopher P. Dixon, an entertainment analyst at Paine Webber who follows Livent, estimated that the New York theater commanded at least $8 million to $10 million. In return, Ford gets its blue oval in lights over Broadway and its name repeated in countless advertisements, posters, playbills and press accounts, including this one.
To justify the economic investment, the new theater needed 1,800 seats. Neither the Lyric nor the Apollo alone had that capacity. Combined, however, they offered a site that would accommodate such a theater.
But it took more than a little ingenuity to realize this vision.
 
February: A Steel Skeleton, And Each Inch Is Precious
"Every patron has to have a full view of the proscenium," Mr. Kofman declares. "If you work from that premise, the rest of the geometry almost sets itself." Rather than a single deep balcony, the Ford Center will have two shallow balconies, each only eight rows deep; the lower one has been designated the dress circle.
The view from the back of the dress circle is stunning now, although it is nothing theatergoers will ever see. There is no proscenium, just the emerging framework of the south proscenium tower.
Overhead is a skeletal balcony, a latticework of steel beams. Through the interstices can be spied the steep profile of the Hotel Carter down the block. Across the street, the gleaming terra-cotta facade of The New York Times building is visible, looking almost like a wall of the auditorium.
The only actual wall now standing is the 70-foot-high Lyric facade. Just three feet thick, it is braced by a scaffold built over the 43d Street sidewalk. The new structure behind the facade has a yawning hole in the center of its second story. This, Mr. Kofman explains, will be the lobby rotunda.
At the other end of the site is the stage house, which must be made as large as possible to accommodate changing theatrical technology. By tucking the steel columns of the stage house into vertical niches carved into the walls of the adjoining Selwyn Theater, the designers will pick up an extra eight inches of space. Ordinarily, such columns would be free-standing.
The goal at the Ford Center is a stage at least 55 feet deep by 97 feet wide; greater in area than those of the Lyric and Apollo combined. "Productions keep getting larger," Mr. Kofman explains. "The number of devices is becoming more significant, the electrical loads are growing, and there seems to be no stopping any of that."
More space will be gained by putting dressing rooms and other backstage functions in the basement, as was done at the restored Pantages Theater in Toronto, on which Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Kofman also collaborated. "He's excavating the wig room," Mr. Kofman notes, as a backhoe operator tears at the raw earth.
Standing on the corrugated metal deck where the orchestra floor will be poured, Mr. Kofman draws a circle in the air, saying, "The main historic dome goes right in here."
 
June: The Roof Goes Up As the Pace Intensifies
Mr. Kofman's cell phone rings. "I'm on the roof of the Lyric," he tells his caller. That is how quickly the Ford Center is getting built. It already has a roof. And from this vantage point comes a surprising discovery. The rear wall of the auditorium is not flat, as it appears to be inside, but curving. This concave shape will help disperse sound and increase intelligibility.
For now, cacophony reigns as 250 workers swarm over the site. The only problem (at least the only one Mr. Kofman will share with a reporter) is that the pace of building threatens to overtake the production of detailed construction documents.
With the roof in place, the Ford Center is getting its exterior walls. It is here that the project is gaining a considerable saving in time -- at least two months -- by using prefabricated wall panels, typically 12 by 20 feet. The panels that cover the auditorium are surfaced in red brick, those that envelop the stage house in precast concrete.
They arrive from Richmond Hill, Ontario, on flatbed trucks and are lifted into place by a giant crane. The panels are attached to the superstructure but are isolated from the steel by synthetic rubber pads that will reduce vibration and thus the transmission of sound from the street.
Now that it is enclosed, the stage house looks as if it could do double duty as a dirigible hangar. Filling the auditorium is a lacy forest of scaffolding, recalling in its delicacy the interior of a Gothic cathedral as if rendered by a Cubist.
On stage sit three plaster domes, the largest one eight feet in diameter, that were extracted from the Apollo. They have just returned to the site from a warehouse in Bayonne, N.J., where they had been kept since demolition. They will be inserted under the dress circle and worked into the new design. For now, they are encased in welded steel frames, their ever so refined Adam esque ornament looking incongruous in the midst of burly construction equipment.
Elegance is otherwise in short supply today. For instance, the V.I.P. room -- for theatergoers who pay an additional $49 -- is filled with foil-covered duct work, metal-sheathed cables and insulation pads. No mahogany wainscoting yet.
 
July: Hearing a Pin Drop, And a Huge Alabaster Pie
"This is very important -- very important," Mr. Drabinsky insists, as he conducts a tour of the Ford Center one sweltering afternoon. He is not talking about stage depth, sightlines or public spaces.
He is talking about a small wedge-shaped room between the auditorium and the lobby, with doors at both ends. The double set of doors in this vestibule will serve as a noise and light barrier. In theaters where only one set of doors separates the auditorium from the lobby, a patron who arrives late or leaves early can disrupt the darkness and tranquillity of the whole house.
So Mr. Drabinsky insisted on vestibules at every entrance. It is just one way he has imposed himself on the design. "Everything matters to me," he says. That means the ratio of women's toilets to men's (two to one), the width of seats in the theater (22 inches, rather than the customary 18) and the distance between rows (34 1/2 inches, rather than the customary 30).
That means studios with cushioned floors and enough room for a full-scale rehearsal. "This is worth everything," Mr. Drabinsky says, "to rehearse people in air-conditioned, acoustically sound space."
Mr. Drabinsky also demanded a generously sized lobby. "I've been so cognizant of the claustrophobic nature of going to the theater in New York," he says.
The Ford Center lobby will have as its centerpiece a two-story rotunda, ringed by columns and a cast-iron balcony. A grand staircase will rise between the columns and branch out around the rotunda.
While the ceiling of the rotunda will be new, the auditorium will house the original 39-by-28-foot elliptical Apollo dome. It now sits on the scaffolding in two dozen sections that look something like segments of a gargantuan alabaster pie.
It is Mr. Drabinsky's turn to show off the vantage from the back of the house, encompassing the entire proscenium. "See it?" he asks triumphantly. "Needless to say, you're seldom playing to the top of the proscenium. If you do, you've got a director who doesn't know what he's doing."
 
August: Details Emerge As the Dome Turns to Gold
Finally, after all the talk about seeing the proscenium, there is a proscenium to see, framed in the ornamental arch recovered from the Apollo. Because it was too small for the new stage opening, the arch had to be widened eight feet across and lengthened five feet at the sides. Lighter-colored patches of plaster disclose its hybrid nature.
The main Apollo dome has been reassembled, and a crew of painters is revivifying it in a palette of slate blue, terra cotta, mustard and gold. Tiny flecks of excess gold leaf drift down and litter the work platform like glittering autumn foliage.
Subtleties are becoming evident. For instance, the auditorium walls are divided into panels that have a slightly convex shape, meant to spread sound more evenly throughout the house.
The most challenging work now is the installation of the 75-foot-long vault that spans the area in front of the proscenium. It is suspended in pieces from cables attached to the ceiling beams. Until the pieces are joined, the designers will not know exactly where it will meet the auditorium wall. "We're not sure at what angle the vault is going to hit the entablature, plus or minus an inch," Mr. Kofman says. "It's like a three-dimensional puzzle hanging out there."
 
September: People-Gazing From a Perch in the Rotunda
The network of scaffolding has been removed from the auditorium, revealing for the first time its cavernous volume. Richard Blinder, the partner in charge of design at Beyer Blinder Belle, enjoys the astonished look on a visitor's face. After all, he says, this is the point of the theatrical experience: "You drop your jaw just a little bit."
Clearing the scaffold forest has also uncovered the side boxes. "They animate the theater by placing people on the side, instead of a blank wall," Mr. Blinder says.
Wherever he looks, Mr. Blinder already sees crowds in his mind's eye. "One of the most important things about intermission is people-watching, and that's the purpose of this balcony," he says as he makes his way through the lobby rotunda.
Under his feet, covered by protective planks, are mosaic masks of Tragedy and Comedy, made of 172,800 green, gray, black, brown and ivory marble tiles by 18 artisans in a studio in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. "We looked at having it done in Italy," Mr. Blinder says, "and we thought they could do it better."
Pointing to a spot just above the first landing of the grand staircase, he adds, "Zeus goes there."
 
October: Finishing Touches Add the Grace of Years
Zeus has arrived. His fierce, bearded visage glowers from the center of a four-and-a-half-foot circular plaster medallion that once crowned the proscenium boxes at the Lyric. The arrival of this piece, which sits for the moment like an archeological artifact on the steps of the 43d Street lobby, marks one of the final deliveries of salvaged material.
While the builders seem busier today than ever, the place has begun to turn from construction site to cultural hub, as the rough-and-tumble edges get smoothed. Within a month, the "Ragtime" set will arrive.
The auditorium still resonates with hammering, sawing and drilling, but the sounds are muffled by carpeting. It is the color of cafe au lait, with a burgundy check, and it blankets the poured concrete floor Mr. Kofman worried about eight months ago. The house is bathed in an ivory-tinted glow. Light glints softly off the newly installed brass railings along the balcony parapets.
Incredibly, the theater actually seems to be aging as it nears completion.
Roger Morgan, the interior designer, says he hopes one day to overhear an exchange along these lines between a couple "of a certain age" arriving at the Ford Center for the first time.
"Alice," the husband will say, "this is where we saw 'Guys and Dolls.' "
"No," the wife will answer. "This is where we saw 'South Pacific.' "

An Abundance of Wit On the London Stage

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THE FUTURE OF THE LONDON theater may be as gloomy as local observers predict, though the visiting American can't worry too much when (like me two weeks ago) he can find 24 straight plays running in theaters in the West End, at the Royal National Theater and at the Royal Shakespeare Company. That compares to what is in fact an unusually high total of eight currently on Broadway, which has long since abandoned straight plays to the more adventurous, somewhat less economically pressed Off Broadway producers.
But it isn't only numbers that impress the visitor. It is also the enthusiasm with which London audiences, young as well as old, respond to the new, the difficult and the unpredictable. 
 A case in point: the National's ravishing production of "The Invention of Love," Tom Stoppard's latest play, a free-wheeling, idea-and language-stuffed comedy that takes as its subject the buttoned-up life and tumultuous times of A. E. Housman, the poet and scholar.
Housman (1859-1936) would not seem to be the most likely inspiration for a comedy, but Mr. Stoppard is a risk-taker. "The Invention of Love" also touches on textual criticism, Britain's notorious 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Bill (not repealed until 1967) under which Oscar Wilde was tried, the Esthetic Movement (with its emphasis on "boy love"), which was all the rage at Oxford in the 1870's and 1880's, and the nature of love itself. Supporting characters include Wilde, the critics John Ruskin and Walter Pater, the journalist Frank Harris and various Oxford and Cambridge dons whose names are probably familiar only to a dwindling number of Oxbridge students.
No matter. The wizardly Mr. Stoppard is an effective popularizer of esoteric knowledge. Remember "Arcadia" and the delight he took in coaxing audiences to pay attention to the basics of Newtonian physics, the mathematics of deterministic chaos and the historical import of English landscape gardening. "The Invention of Love" is in the same league, and so beautifully constructed that the playwright seems to be discovering his play only one jump ahead of the audience. It has that sense of surprise and wonder.
Housman, a closeted homosexual, lived out his carefully circumspect life mostly in academe, first at Oxford and then at Cambridge. For 30 years he worked on what he hoped would be his "monument," assembling the definitive Latin text of the "Astronomica" by Marcus Manilius, a first century Roman poet and astrologist. He believed in the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself. Knowledge, Housman said, has a moral aspect; by being true, it is good.
At the same time, he was pouring his unrequited, nearly lifelong passion for Moses Jackson, whom he met when both were Oxford students, into his poetry. The initial result: "A Shropshire Lad," the collection of severely spare poems about lives of unfulfilled promise and desires (mostly young men's), set in a largely imaginary Shropshire, of which Mr. Stoppard has him say, "A county where I never lived and seldom set foot."
Housman is trying to get a fix on his life in the course of the play, which opens with his arrival at the River Styx to join Charon, the ferryman, for the voyage to the far shore. Whether what he sees and remembers is fact or fantasy, he can no longer be sure. Dead or sleeping? Even that is uncertain. In a succession of scenes that blend one into the next with cinematic fluidity (and with no regard for the classic unities), he moves back and forth in time, his secret love for Moses Jackson defined in the doubleness of his life as poet and scholar.
As Mr. Stoppard writes him, Housman is a figure of pinched rectitude but heroic dimension.
On his way to the other side, he sees himself on his arrival at Oxford, meeting Moses for the first time, but then when he has a chance to talk to the young Housman, he doesn't immediately recognize him. When he does, he suggests they sit down to chat: "I'm not as young as I once was. Whereas you, of course, are."
A hilarious croquet game, during which the master of Balliol College criticizes Pater for signing letters to an undergraduate "Yours lovingly," is crosscut with Housman's memory of coaching Moses as he trains for a track meet. At one point a myopic don mistakes the commonplace young Housman for the notorious Irish student who wears plum-colored velvet breeches and his hair long.
Though Oscar Wilde doesn't enter until near the end of the second act, his presence shadows the play. His proud flamboyance describes a sense of freedom and self-assurance that Housman denied himself in all things except his poetry and his work on the Manilius texts. Wilde's terrible fate at the hands of the law apparently haunted Housman. Though they never met in life, they meet in death by the River Styx, courtesy of Mr. Stoppard, in a scene of immense wit and melancholy.
HOUSMAN COMES UPON Wilde sipping a brandy and reading aloud from "A Shropshire Lad." His selection, one of the angriest in all of Housman's poetry, is the poem that begins: "Shot? So quick and clean an ending?" Inspired by the newspaper report of an inquest, Housman wrote about the young man, a Woolwich cadet who, shortly after the Wilde trial, blew his brains out to insure that his family would never be similarly disgraced by his own "weakness." Says Wilde: "Poor, silly boy!"
Weepily, the overweight esthete announces that he must return to Lord Alfred Douglas. "Bosie is what became of me." Bosie, he acknowledges, is spoiled, vindictive, selfish and untalented, "but these are merely the facts. The truth is he was Hyacinth when Apollo loved him."
Housman seems to shrink as Wilde goes
on: "Before Plato could describe love, the loved one had to be invented. We would never love anybody if we could see past our invention. Bosie is my creation, my poem. In the mirror of invention, love discovered itself."
Housman tries to offer sympathy to Wilde: "Your life is a terrible thing." But Wilde will have none of it. "Better a fallen rocket than never a burst of light," he says. "Dante reserved a place in his Inferno for those who willfully live in sadness."
Housman's life, Wilde realizes, was one of such sadness. Uncharacteristically benign as he departs, he mentions Housman's poems. "How can you be unhappy when you know you wrote them? They are all that will still matter."
Housman's final speech is filled with stoic rue. "Oxford in the Golden Age!" He recalls "the hair shirts versus the Esthetes; the neo-Christians versus the neo-pagans." "What emotional storms, and oh what a tiny teacup."
With his staging of "The Invention of Love," Sir Richard Eyre leaves the National Theater, where he has been artistic director since 1988, to be succeeded by Trevor Nunn, the man who staged Mr. Stoppard's "Arcadia" at the National in 1993.
"The Invention of Love" is a gala farewell piece. The production, starring John Wood as the old Housman and Paul Rhys as his younger self, is consistently well cast, simply but elegantly designed by Anthony Ward and lighted by Peter Mumford with the care of an obsessed poet, someone who knows when not to use a comma, and who would throw himself on the pen that would put it in.
Mr. Stoppard's work demands such care. Anything less, and the play goes out the window.
Note: I saw "The Invention of Love" at its last performance at the small Cottesloe Theater, where it opened in September. The production goes back into the National's repertory on Saturday, when it reopens at the larger Lyttelton Theater.
 
'The Chairs'
The falling-down funniest, most exhilarating production in London at the moment could well be "The Chairs," Eugene Ionesco's 80-minute "tragic farce," revived in a faultless production by the Royal Court Theater and the Theatre de Complicite, now at the Duke of York's.
Directed and choreographed by Simon McBurney, using Martin Crimp's translation, and starring Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, "The Chairs" seems to have slipped into town with almost no advance want-to-see, but left the local critics limp with unexpected pleasure. It deserves to be a hit.
Ionesco, the half-French, half-Romanian absurdist playwright (1909-94), has himself slipped into near-oblivion in recent years. After his vogue in the 1950's and 1960's, his work was overtaken by Samuel Beckett's pared down, far more uncompromising plays, which closely followed the appearance of Ionesco's. It seems clear on the basis of this production that the two playwrights are not really competitors. Beckett is a moralist; Ionesco is an absurdist-satirist whose wild humor transforms nightmares into occasions of grandly theatrical hilarity.
Mr. Briers, as the Old Man, has the face of an ancient spoiled child. Ms. McEwan, as the Old Woman, displays a skinny, bendable frame and a bandy-legged walk that recall Popeye's Olive Oyl gone to seed. He's a janitor, bitter about his missed opportunities. They're survivors of who knows what ghastly apocalypses, inhabiting a cavernous dump of a house surrounded by water, bucking up each other with banalities and endearments that flow from their mouths like pre-recorded announcements. She is his "petty-pie"; he is her "poppet."
On this night he is to deliver his message to the world, his gift to mankind, for which he has hired an orator (he is modest about his own public-speaking abilities) and invited guests who, lo and behold, start arriving: a "fabled beauty" (her "eyes still twinkling over the cataracts"), a famous field marshal who makes obscene proposals to a young woman, family groups, the media, opinion makers, strangers, hundreds. The house is packed to the gunnels.
The guests may be invisible but they are all clearly present, requiring -- nay, demanding -- chairs, which the poor Old Woman attempts to supply with mounting desperation. Doors open and close with increasing speed. Chairs of all descriptions and state of repair appear and pile up to create utterly blissful pandemonium. Think of the stateroom scene from the Marx Brothers' "Night at the Opera."
At one point, the double doors at the back of the stage part for the entrance of the Emperor, also called the King of Kings. "The king of what kings?" asks the momentarily grumpy Old Woman. He is a blinding light shown directly into the eyes of the audience, a variation on the celestial effects in one of Cecil B. DeMille's old biblical epics. The Orator does appear, a macabre, white-faced ghoul, who moves like a mannequin.
The Old Man and the Old Woman, their mission accomplished, serenely jump into the sea to their deaths. The Orator, who turns out to be deaf and dumb, can only mumble, then scribble a few words of gibberish on a blackboard. The End.
What does it all mean? Whatever you want to make of it. The remarkable thing is that it's so funny in the primal, uncomplicated way of slapstick. It is also moving.
Mr. Briers and Ms. McEwan (remember her as the elegant, mischievous Lucia in "Mapp and Lucia"?) are without price. The set, the lighting and especially the sound design (a cacophony of doorbells, buzzers, music, hubbub, squeaks and squeals) are all superb.
Mr. McBurney is the artistic director of the Theatre de Complicite, for which he directed and acted in the socially responsible peasant drama "The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol," presented in New York as part of Lincoln Center's Festival '96.
This man's bow has more than one string.
"The Chairs" goes off on Saturday, but returns to the Duke of York's on Jan. 6 to run through Jan. 31.
 
'A Delicate Balance'
Further notes: Edward Albee's comedy, "A Delicate Balance," is being revived at the Haymarket in a handsome production directed by Anthony Page, starring Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins and John Standing.
Dame Maggie, who receives top billing, takes the supporting role of the sister Elaine Stritch played in Gerald Gutierrez's hit New York revival. The night I attended, she gave a fine, unbusy performance without any Maggie Smith interpolations -- in London that seems to be news. Ms. Atkins is superb as the wife. More than Ms. Stritch and Rosemary Harris, Ms. Atkins and Dame Maggie look and sound as if they could be sisters.
How does this production compare to Mr. Gutierrez's? It is different, more intimate, perhaps, but less grand and ghostly. The two star actresses are the attraction here, though Mr. Standing is exceptionally good in the husband's role, in which George Grizzard was exceptionally good in New York.
 
'A Letter Of Resignation'
Now at the Comedy Theater is "A Letter of Resignation," written by Hugh Whitemore, about Prime Minister Harold Macmillan during the 1963 crisis involving his secretary of war, John Profumo, a teen-age showgirl and a Russian naval attache. Edward Fox gives a good, serious impersonation of Macmillan, though he seems to be straining his voice at times. Clare Higgins is excellent as his wife, who is something more than she initially seems.
The revelation of the play (at least to me) was the way in which Mr. Profumo's marital difficulties reflected those in the Prime Minister's own house. Quite startling, but the play itself is made for the matinee trade. I saw it at an evening performance when, looking out over the sea of gray- and white-haired heads, I felt as if I were a member of a theater party for Macmillan's well-heeled Tory friends and associates.
 
'Art'
Keep an eye out for Yasmina Reza's "Art," the French comedy that has been running at Wyndham's Theater since October 1996. If the New York production opening on March 1 is as much fun as this one, which is now on its fourth three-man cast, it should be a good bet for Broadway.
Christopher Hampton's English translation, directed by Matthew Warchus, is intelligent, funny and very French, as are the characters: three mid-30's Parisian fellows, fast friends until one of them buys an expensive white-on-white painting. Sometimes a friend goes just too far.
Even Mark Thompson's set has wit: a bachelor's expensively but minimally furnished pad in what could be a high-rent building in Paris's nearly characterless 16th arrondissement. If apartments were people, this one would be a maitre d' with standards far loftier than those of any of his guests.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM/A Catholic Worker House;
Where Nonviolence and Commitment to the Community Rule

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
KEELEY COLVILLE had quite a seventh birthday party at her home in New Haven a few weeks ago, even though her father was in jail in Maine and several other members of her collective household were at an anti-military demonstration in Georgia. That kind of disruption is par for the course when you live in a Catholic Worker house, a place where people believe in doing the works of mercy and justice, as enumerated in the Sermon on the Mount of Jesus.
The love of her mother and siblings and extended family of down-and-out neighbors and fellow justice seekers is also par for the course, and Keeley and her younger sister and brother seem to thrive living in a real village that is raising them and other children. 
 Home is the Cesar Jerez Catholic Worker House in the Hill section of New Haven, founded four years ago by Mark Colville and Luz Catarineau-Colville, Keeley's parents. Members of the Catholic Worker movement subscribe to pacifism and a radical political and economic analysis that leads them to identify with the poor and take personal responsibility both for helping the poor and for changing the social conditions that allow poverty and militarism to exist.
Nov. 8 marked the centennial of the birth of Dorothy Day, co-founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, and, some say, a saint. She died in 1980. Her philosophy of nonviolence and her practice of voluntary poverty have inspired followers who have established 140 Catholic Worker houses around the world; New Haven's is named for a revolutionary Guatemalan priest.
It was in February, on Ash Wednesday, that Mr. Colville and five others, calling themselves the Prince of Peace Plowshares, poured their own blood on and hammered on a nuclear-armed destroyer being built at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Me. Mr. Colville has been in jail ever since, having been convicted last May of destruction of government property and conspiracy; in October he was sentenced to 13 months, including time already served.
The day after his sentencing, the Cesar Jerez House received the fourth annual Morris Wessel Prize, named for a beloved retired pediatrician, to honor "unsung heroes" in the New Haven area who work with families and children. The monetary award is not large, but the honor was welcome. That same week, almost 100 people squeezed into the small house for a prayer service and celebration.
Rosette Street, where the house is situated, has not yet been touched by the nascent revival of inner city New Haven and by the drop in violent crime evidenced in the city and around the nation. There have been several shootings in the immediate neighborhood in the past few years, including one homicide. Despite noticeable progress on demolishing some abandoned properties and planting gardens in their stead, the abandoned buildings on Rosette seem distressingly resistant to change.
But at the Catholic Worker house, there is always something upbeat going on, and usually many more people than just its full-time six or seven residents, some of whom rotate through the house for periods of weeks or months. One recent afternoon after school, four seniors from Fairfield Prep, a Jesuit high school, arrived for their weekly one-on-one tutoring session with neighborhood children. It's how they've chosen to fulfill their two-hour-a-week senior service project, although Marc Robert, one of the volunteers, says he thinks he'd do this work without being required to.
Mr. Robert has an ongoing relationship with Herman Santiago, a fifth grader at nearby Truman School. They work on language skills and math for an hour, then hang out and play together for an hour. Another high school student takes plays educational games with the children on the computer. Both games and computer have been donated, as is virtually everything else in the house, by a large and growing band of supporters.
Carmen Castro, Herman Santiago's mother, lives next door and takes part in activities at the Catholic Worker house, including street Masses. At Give and Take sessions, neighborhood residents are invited to take what they need in terms of food, clothing, furniture and toys, and donate any possessions they no longer use, so that others in need may have them.
"To help the next person is always good," Ms. Castro says.
She says she knows Mark Colville is in jail, but is not sure why. Of one thing she is certain: "I know he is a terrific person."
Mr. Colville has been busy from his jail cell, running prayer groups and writing letters and articles for his Catholic Worker newsletter and for Catholic newspapers around the country.
In one letter, he wrote, "Christianity is supposed to be centered around the Cross. It is supposed to be about suffering. Not suffering for suffering's sake, but redemptive suffering, acting for justice, embracing the consequences, healing the world by afflicting ourselves in solidarity with the afflicted. A Plowshares action strikes me as a particularly good way for a family, especially an educated white family living in the modern Empire, to take up the Cross. It solidarizes us with so many, many families in this world who are separated by war, hunger, economic crisis, unemployment -- all of which are the direct result of policies of the U.S. Government, especially the arms race."
The other members of the house say they feared people would not understand Mr. Colville's action, particularly his decision to voluntarily separate himself from his wife and three young children. But they say the response, both among the peace community and among their poor, mostly black and Latino neighbors, has been very positive. Winning the Morris Wessel Award was another, more tangible, measure of support.
Meanwhile, life goes on at the Catholic Worker house. Jimmy Byun, a recent Yale graduate, moved in for the summer and helped organize a gardening project for the homeless in collaboration with the Columbus House shelter in the Hill. He says he first became aware of the Catholic Worker movement when he picked up the group's national newspaper in a New Haven church. What caught his eye was the price: a penny. He started going to gatherings in New York City, and it was there he found out there was a house much closer to home.
The gardening project is based on the idea that homeless people have, or can learn, a lot of skills to make them self-sufficient. They grew and sold food and flowers from the 1,200-square-foot plot. Plans are to double the size of the garden next year, and to start growing in early spring instead of early summer as they did this year.
Mr. Byun said his family converted to Catholicism when he was 13. "I took it very literally," he said, "and when I saw what the Catholic Worker was doing, I saw that as a return to a more pure form of Christianity before it was co-opted by the state."
He was one of 2,500 people who went to Fort Benning, Ga., in November to call for closing down the School of the Americas, a United States-financed military school that opponents have dubbed "School of Assassins" because graduates have returned to Latin America and committed large-scale human rights abuses. Eight New Haven area people were arrested, including Mr. Byun and David Amaral.
As for Mr. Colville, in a note published before his sentencing, he wrote, "Pray not for a shorter sentence, but for the continuation of dialogue and the clarification of thought."
His sentence will be followed by two years of supervised release, during which time he must report regularly to a parole officer. He is also required to pay restitution for the damage to the ship.
In his sentencing statement, however, he said: "I will pay no restitution; I will report to no one, nor will I allow my conscience to be supervised."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
American, Asian and a Warm Welcome

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY 

 BODY:
REMEMBER Duffy's Tavern on the radio? The Merry Pedlar in Floral Park is the same kind of homey, neighborhood spot. Instead of a bartender telling all comers, "Duffy ain't here," there was a beaming priest sitting at a table near the entrance who volunteered, "This is a wonderful restaurant with great food." Who could argue with a heavenly endorsement like that?
On a second visit, we were welcomed with a round of applause. No, it was not the priest and his parishioners. Rather, two multitalented musicians had just finished playing. 
 Even though the hand was not for us, the greeting by the smiling hostess was a warm one. At the Merry Pedlar everyone feels at home. Family groups in jeans and baseball caps are as comfortable as the couples dressed for an evening out who occasionally get up and dance to a song or two. Valet parking, live music, an inviting antipasto table and a waiter sporting a tuxedo are weekend additions that do not alter the casual spirit of this hospitable restaurant.
The pleasing decor combines a garden motif with antique touches: plants, bentwood and wicker chairs with floral cushions, striking etched-glass windows, botanical prints, an old wood bar, period light fixtures and dark wood wainscotting.
Service is a bit wobbly. One evening our very sweet waitress was knowledgeable and seemed competent, but the meal took forever. The problem may have been in the kitchen. We were ordering a la carte selections while most diners were trying the very economical (and possibly faster) three-course dinner at $19.97. On another evening, service was more speedy, but it always took at least two requests to get a beverage refilled.
Longtime residents of Floral Park may remember a restaurant at this location called the Merry Pedlar a decade or two ago. The original owner is back, the name is the same but the food is a new story. The chef is Bill McCann, who is French trained, was sous chef at the Rainbow Room and most recently cooked at 13 Barrow Street and the Screening Room in Manhattan.
The food is 1990's American with a few pastas and a smattering of Asian offerings (a trio of stir frys and an orange lacquer duck).
Among the standout starters are a wild mushroom salad ( a toss of greens, a ragout of mushrooms and a warm thyme vinaigrette) and a plate of seafood-vegetable fritters. The crisp, greaseless morsels, combining corn, peppers, salmon and shrimp, surround a chunky tomato-pineapple relish.
In that same major league was the soup of the day, a pureed vegetable brew that was full of flavor. Another treat was the help-yourself antipasto table ($6.95) that sparkled with roasted peppers, grilled vegetables, olives, cheese, meats, asparagus, a bowl of mesclun and dressings.
Also earning kudos were the rich onion soup, the goat cheese-topped caponata, the mixed green (mostly romaine) salad in a pleasing lemon vinaigrette and the rustic salad chock full of blue cheese, apples, croutons and nuts. The less than classic Caesar, though, had a bland, creamy dressing.
Among the entree choices on the $19.97 dinner is a superb penne with a meat sauce made with chunks of fork-tender sirloin, red wine and vegetables. Another good pick on that menu is the chicken stir fry, overflowing with crisp vegetables and Asian flavors.
Speaking of the East, the orange lacquer duck is a beauty: a roasted leg with crisp skin, rare slices of tender grilled breast and a seductive pecan-currant rice. In sharp contrast, though, was a lackluster breast of chicken in a very faint Dijon mustard sauce.
The only fish we sampled, Southwestern grilled tuna, was overcooked. Still, its salsa topper and bed of warm greens nearly saved it.
Meats fared better. The T-bone veal chop, escorted by artichoke hearts, tomatoes and a marsala sauce, was a hit, as were a special steak in a mushroom-wine sauce and the menu's baron of lamb. The last included juicy chops and a slow roasted meld of shredded leg of lamb.
Desserts are great. When did you last see a do-it-yourself hot fudge sundae on a restaurant menu? It was a bell ringer but so, too, were the satiny creme brulee, the flaky warm apple tart, the impressive peanut butter brownie torte garnished with peanut brittle, the three-layer chocolate mousse cake and the rich hazelnut cappuccino sundae.
The six wines on the restaurant's temporary list offer solid dependable choices at prices of $16 to $28. Two French 1995 selections, a rich, ripe Louis Jadot Beaujolais Villages ($23) and a crisp, dry Joseph Drouhin Macon Villages ($23), are recommended.

HEADLINE: Riverhead Plans to Take Over Navy Site in Calverton

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
COMMERCIAL and industrial real-estate brokers who toured the former Grumman plant in Calverton last week were surprised to find a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in their midst.
The agent was on hand to steer visitors away from the industrial heart of the 2,900-acre site that the Navy owns, the cavernous main hangar where a reconstructed section of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 is protected behind a thick security cordon. 
 Ever since the disaster in which 230 people died on July 17, 1996, the plant where Grumman built F-14's and other Navy jets has been headquarters for the most expensive and extensive Government investigation ever into the crash of a commercial airliner. Its centerpiece is the fuselage of the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, painstakingly assembled by investigators and technicians over two months from 876 pieces that divers and salvage vessels recovered from the ocean floor off East Moriches.
Victims' family members and the few outsiders allowed to view the reconstruction described it as awe inspiring, horrifying and altogether overwhelming.
"When I walked through the door, all I could think was, oh, the humanity," said John J. Seaman of the Families of T.W.A. Flight 800 Association, recalling the words of a reporter who saw the burning of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, N.J., in 1937.
Now, after delays caused in part by the crash investigation, the Navy is preparing to sign over the 2,900-acre property to the Town of Riverhead Community Development Agency for a development that would mix commercial, industrial and tourist-related recreational uses. Such a complex would have broad economic implications for eastern Long Island. Town officials said the transfer could be carried out in February.
As the transfer nears, questions are arising about what to do with the reconstruction of the jetliner, a high-technology artifact that produced volumes of information with major implications for air travel.
The National Transportation Safety Board, owner of the wreckage and reconstruction, said its inquiry would continue in the hangar through next year and possibly longer. Civil litigation over the crash, which investigators have said was caused by an explosion in the center fuel tank, may require that the reconstruction remain intact for years as cases move through the courts. Some legal experts estimated that the litigation could run up to 10 years.
Jesse R. Goodale 3d, chairman of the Riverhead Development Corporation, created by the town to oversee the development of the site, said the town was close to agreeing to lease the space that the safety board was using back to the Federal Government after the transfer. "They are prepared to compensate the town," Mr. Goodale said.
Mr. Goodale and the director of the town's community development agency, Andrea H. Lohneiss, said they did not expect the presence of the reconstruction would slow development elsewhere at the site. "We don't see that as an impediment," Ms. Lohneiss said.
Mr. Goodale said rent that the Government would pay would partly cover the town's estimated $3 million-a-year maintenance costs. That figure does not include the highest level of upkeep for the 7,000-foot and 10,000-foot jet runways.
Mr. Goodale said the development corporation had not taken an official position on what should be done with the reconstruction after the investigations and litigation had been complete.
But eventually decisions will have to be made. A spokeswoman for the safety board, Shelly Hazle, said the board was "trying to determine the best solution." She noted that the reconstruction, on a frame with wheels, was designed to be dismantled in large sections.
Last week Suffolk County Planning Director Stephen M. Jones suggested that the reconstruction could be an exhibition at an air museum at the Calverton site. "If it was done tastefully and properly, it could be very favorable," Mr. Jones said. "It could be an educational tool that would attract people to the site. They should certainly consider that before they take it apart."
Some people recoiled at that suggestion. "It seems a little morbid to me to be exploiting something so many people were killed in," the curator of the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, Joshua Stoff, said. "It's not the impression a commercial aviation museum wants to make. We don't want to be showing wreckage."
"It might be insensitive," said Jack O'Connor, president of Grubb & Ellis Island Realty of Melville, the agent for the 2,900-acre property, who added that interest was high among developers with other plans. "I'm not sure I would want that if I was one of the family members."
But Mr. Seaman, whose niece died in the crash, said: "We have been talking about this quite a bit. There are mixed feelings right now. But the families are talking about a permanent monument or memorial. I am not sure whether people would be comfortable with the aircraft itself being the permanent monument to the ones we lost."
But Mr. Seaman, who formerly lived in Huntington and who now lives near Albany, said the families had formed close bonds with rescuers and investigators, including divers who brought up wreckage and technicians who examined each piece in their search for the cause of the crash. The reconstruction, Mr. Seaman said, was a monument to their work.
"Families' members looking at it will always remember those who died," he said. "But for other people it may be more positive. It is very impressive. It's an enormous achievement. And from what we are hearing, the crash of T.W.A. 800 is going to become a turning point in commercial aviation in this country."
The salvage operation reportedly recovered 95 percent of the 400,000-pound plane from three underwater fields of debris. Some pieces were as small as a quarter.
At the former hangar, officials began around-the-clock operations as the F.B.I. looked for evidence of bombs, a missile or sabotage. That meant that the hangar became a high-security zone for the criminal investigation.
"You had to give your life story to get in the gate," said Mr. Jones, referring to the fact that the Government closed the entire site to the public.
Investigators from the safety board noted the location of each piece and its damage as truckloads of wreckage arrived at Calverton. Parts and pieces not used in the reconstruction were placed on a specially marked floor.
As work advanced a 60,000-pound section took shape. Holes marked where damage was so extensive that recovered pieces were crumpled, deformed or all but obliterated.
Seats, galleys and lavatories were reconstructed. The four engines, all recovered, were disassembled and examined.
At a hearing last week by the safety board in Baltimore results of the investigation poured out. Included were volumes of information learned at Calverton. Virtually no detail of the jet's interstices, from wires to metal skin to seat fabric, escaped examination.
"Every piece was thoroughly examined for evidence of an explosive device," the board's investigator in charge, Alfred W. Dickenson, said in his opening statement. "None was found."
Last week, in an incident indicative of a controversy over the cause of the crash, a senior T.W.A. pilot involved in the investigation admitted he stole fabric from the wreckage for a writer who wrote that a missile struck the jet. The pilot, Terrell Stacey, was cooperating with an F.B.I. investigation of the writer, James Sanders, and his wife, Elizabeth Sanders, a T.W.A. flight attendant.
The F.B.I. decided this month to close its criminal investigation, and the Calverton site has begun to reopen.
"We had some tremendous impediments, but the problems seem to be coming to an end," said Mr. O'Connor, adding that the F.B.I. had cooperated in providing escorts for tours.
Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Goodale confirmed that negotiations were under way with a prospective tenant about leasing the entire 2,900 acres for mixed uses. Mr. O'Connor said the tenant would have an option to buy the property.
"First and foremost," Mr. Goodale said, "the preference for the town is for a management agreement with a master tenant that would lease the entire site. The town really has no interest in running the place in the long term. The market will dictate what happens. Our planning will accommodate broad uses."
The town plan envisions an industrial park in former production areas on 800 acres of the property, according to Ms. Lohneiss. It envisions commercial and recreational developments on open land. Office buildings, golf courses, an automobile-racing track, a sports arena and a theme park are also possibilities.
County officials concur in the town plan. "Redevelopment is a tremendous opportunity for the Town of Riverhead, the entire East End and the county," said George Gatta, deputy county executive for economic development.
The land includes 400 acres in the core area of the Pine Barrens Preserve, which would be left untouched.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dr. Seamus O'Cleireacain;
Professor's Spin on Global Trade Policies

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AS a professor of economics at Purchase College, Dr. Seamus O'Cleireacain hears not only from American students but also ones from Korea, Russia, Austria, Poland and Japan. As a specialist on international economic policy, he is in a position to influence the distribution of foreign-aid money.
Dr. O'Cleireacain (pronounced oh-CLARE-a-con) has been a consultant to the United Nations and Congress. In 1996 and '97, he was a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, where he set up a global network of economic reformers who had been economics or finance ministers in developing countries of the former Soviet Bloc. 
 Last year, he served on the Council of Strategic and International Studies Bipartisan Task Force on the United States and the multilateral development banks.
The author of many publications, the Irish-born Dr. O'Cleireacain, a Manhattan resident, is also an adjunct professor at Columbia University. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with him:
Q. Why should a person who is not directly involved in financial matters pay attention to stories like those about the World Bank?
A. Because it's through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and through regional development banks that we have some rules of the game, that we have an international economic government. Those organizations deal with international finance and development. On the trade side, we've got the World Trade Organization to set the rules.
Without having these organizations, we would be a much poorer planet. We would have a much lower level of economic growth for most of the countries of the world.
For the really poorer countries, the World Bank is the only place they can go to borrow. They are not good commercial creditors. Commercial banks do not want them. Somebody needs to insure that there is a flow of financial resources into those countries. It gives them a chance.
Q. Is it partly a moral obligation?
A. I didn't call it a moral obligation. I won't call it that. I think that these days a phrase like "global interdependence" is a trite phrase, but it really does have meaning. We're a much smaller planet. We're much more closely connected than we had been in the past, and we have an interest in what happens in these countries. Diseases spread. Ideas that are not conducive to freedom of expression, freedom of religious rights, spread very quickly. A small group can have a rather horrendous impact on the larger society. And we have an interest in stability and prosperity everywhere.
Q. How do you feel about the United States' trying to use economic policies as a tool to make political change, say in Iraq?
A. I think that in the case of Iraq that without sanctions Saddam Hussein would be even more dangerous than he is. Saddam Hussein has the ability to sell oil to get money to pay for food and to pay for medicine. He has had that ability from the very beginning -- from the time the sanctions were imposed. They were imposed by the United Nations in a way in which the weaker members of Iraqi society could be taken care of. For years, he didn't take that option. I don't follow it totally, but I have a sense that in the last year or two, he finally has.
So I have no problem at all with really strong sanctions against Iraq. I have a different perspective on sanctions elsewhere, because too often people impose sanctions or ask for sanctions to be imposed just to make themselves feel better, to make themselves feel morally superior. There may be a moral argument for sanctions, but they may not work.
Q. Are you thinking of Cuba?
A. Sanctions on Cuba are a mistake. They've been a mistake for years. They've had no impact on the Cuban economy, but they're politically great for Fidel Castro and his Government to argue that the reason that the country has been in such trouble, has fallen so far behind the level of development elsewhere in Latin and Central America, is because of the nasty U.S. The reality is every other country in the world will trade with Cuba, so the sanctions economically are relatively meaningless. Cuba's economic problems are the result of very bad economic policies inside the country. But everyone understands the sanctions were imposed for political reasons.
Q. Did you support our changed economic policies toward Vietnam?
A. Oh, sure. I think the worldwide move toward market-oriented economy and democratically oriented political systems is terrific. It is to be applauded, supported and promoted. It doesn't happen in some countries without providing moral support, political support and economic support to those forces in the countries that want those kinds of changes.
Q. What about China? Is it moral to make China a most-favored-nation trade partner?
A. China is not yet a member of the World Trade Organization. It's the last major international organization that it has been kept out of. It has been kept out of it for very good reasons. The W.T.O. is an organization for countries that have market-oriented economies. People know in advance how their products are going to be treated, and they know what the trade barriers are. For the last number of years, China has been negotiating with members of the W.T.O. on what it has to do in order to be allowed in. It's very close to it. There has been a lot of technical assistance from the U.S. trade representative's office to China and by the European Union on how it needs to reorganize its economy. At some point that will be settled.
Once China gets into the W.T.O., it will automatically have most-favored-nation treatment in all the products it sells to any of the W.T.O. members. Most-favored nation is a phrase that gives the impression of something terrific. In reality, it is almost the worst treatment that anyone gives W.T.O. members because everyone wants some type of preferential treatment beyond that.
Q. What about the moral issues of dealing with China, a politically repressive country?
A. China is too big to ignore. It's part of the international community, and if it's part of the international community the rest of us are better off having it inside the organization. It does not mean we need to like its domestic policies. It does not mean we should not support people who want to change it.
Q. There have been many currency devaluations in Asia. How will this affect people in Westchester?
A. It will probably mean cheaper computers. Most of the components of PC's are coming from a number of countries that have been devalued. The impact on the American economy should be pretty small because the bulk of U.S. exports don't go to that part of the world. The U.S. will be less impacted than a country like Japan. This is a part of the world where the banking systems are really fragile and the problems have not been solved. The financial effects of what is going on there can be dramatically larger in the United States than the trade effects.
Q. What was the Council for Strategic and International studies that you served on?
A. I was on a task force looking at the appropriate roles for the U.S. in multilateral development banks, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and there are a series of regional development banks. The task force had politicians from the Hill and a fair number of business executives and a handful of academics. We were trying to influence what Congress would decide to do about funding U.S. foreign aid bills that include contributions to those organizations and what should be the conditions attached to it.
Q. And what conditions do you think should be imposed?
A. I think it needs to be tied to whatever the U.S. decides are its foreign policy objectives. The U.S. is just one of many contributors to those organizations, but it should only be contributing to them if it thinks those organizations are furthering the broad scope of U.S. foreign policy. But at the end of the day, these are sovereign countries that have to decide for themselves what their appropriate path is.

HEADLINE: Stores Wait For That Last-Minute Rush to Buy

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AT the Williams-Sonoma store in White Plains recently, free samples of gourmet herb and Parmesan pasta disappeared by midafternoon -- scooped up by eager Christmas shoppers with hearty appetites. Most of the pricey merchandise for sale, however, remained on the shelves, as it did in other stores at The Westchester mall.
In another, less-expensive section of the city, a similar scenario played out at the Sam Ash Music Stores location on Mamaroneck Avenue, the main street of White Plains: hype about the shopping season but not as much action at the cash register. The Sam Ash manager, Tony Faranda, worried that a sale earlier in November had taken some of the starch out of his holiday effort. 
 Although better days may be in store, the retail trade mostly languished in many sections of Westchester during the first weeks of the holiday period. On Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when many merchants hope to turn their ledgers from red to black, business was "O.K., but not great," Mr. Faranda said.
In the downtown shopping areas of small hamlets and villages like Hastings-on-Hudson, some shopkeepers reported that the quiet was deafening. And along main streets in cities like White Plains, foot traffic was light. Even at busy malls like The Westchester, where parking spaces were in short supply, retailers fretted as many in the crowd, like those at Williams-Sonoma, only sampled the offerings.
Why more talk than action so far this year? Shoppers who were interviewed said they were merely on initial surveillance missions and not ready to make their purchases.
"First, we're having a look around," said Stephen Morrissey, a New York City police officer who was reconnoitering in toy stores on Black Friday with his wife, Martina, and their 6-month-old daughter, Stephanie. "We're raring to spend, but right now we're just checking things out." Most malls began decorating for the holidays on Nov. 8 in an attempt to lure customers early, but the first weekend after Thanksgiving now accounts for only 10 percent of Christmas sales, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan.
"Thanksgiving weekend is a good indicator, but it plays a less important role than it did years ago," said John Konarski, president of the trade association, which measures traffic in 35 malls around the country.
The day with the highest mall traffic is actually the Saturday before Dec. 25 -- this year that will be Dec. 20 -- the association said. And the week to watch is the one beginning on Wednesday and running through Christmas Eve.
Also, because there are five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, the sluggish start is most likely to be replaced with a flurry of shopping activity when it dawns on consumers that time is running short, said Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce.
Early in the season, most shoppers said they were reaching into their pockets only when a bargain beckoned, and few tarried at racks where merchandise was not marked down.
"I'm taking my time and waiting for the sales," said Annabel Ramos, an accountant who was shopping recently at Bloomingdale's in White Plains. "No rush yet."
At the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, Ruthe Berman, executive director of marketing, said that two department stores known for their bargains and heavy promotions -- Sears and Stern's -- were thriving. "Absolutely, people are buying," she said, "but only under certain circumstances."
Not only in Westchester, but in many locations throughout the New York City area, the Christmas shopping season started unhurriedly, reported Kurt Barnard, editor of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, an industry newsletter. He said that even though parking lots were packed 10 deep in some places, merchandise was not moving well, as witnessed by the dearth of bulging shopping bags.
Throughout the United States, too, reports indicated that the season had not begun with a bang despite the robust nature of the economy. On the first holiday shopping weekend after Thanksgiving, sales nationally were up only 1 percent over the same weekend last year, according to Telecheck Services in Houston, the world's leading check acceptance company, which measures check writing in more than 27,000 locations each year.
As recently as Tuesday Telecheck reported that consumers continued to be cautious in their holiday spending. New York and the rest of the Northeast, however, showed slightly more activity than the rest of the United States.
Checks are not a preferred payment method for most shoppers, although Telecheck's numbers tend to be consistent with industry trends.
There is hope ahead. Telecheck and other companies predicted that the shopping activity yet to come would make up for the sluggish beginning. Many shoppers confirmed that forecast, saying they entered the season feeling financially secure and would buy, but not wildly.
"Judging by most indicators, this will be a good year for spending," said Karl Lamson, an accountant who was at The Westchester last week with his son Andrew, 8. "The stock market is good, unemployment and inflation are low, and Congress is working on the budget deficit. So what could be bad?"
Or as John Clark, a carpenter who was checking the merchandise in F.A.O. Schwarz in White Plains with his wife, Lisa, and their 2 1/2-year-old twins, Kevin and Sean, explained it, "The economy is optimistic and so are we."
In assessing the shopping picture this year, economists suggested that because the recession is long past, consumers may be running out of new things to buy. They reported, too, that some buyers have overextended themselves on their credit cards and are pulling back.
Ms. Berman at the Cross County Mall observed that the stores have created demon shoppers who expect deep discounts and will not settle for less. "Why would you buy something for $50 when you know that if you wait, you'll be able to get it for $30?" she said.
Telephones and computers are also becoming significant competitors in the Christmas shopping marketplace and siphoning off store customers. Catalogue sales are expected to grow at a faster rate than store sales, and Internet sales could double what they did last year, widespread reports said.
The contributing factors notwithstanding, it is becoming increasingly difficult to forecast how any retail season will evolve. Last year, the shopping season began optimistically and ended with little more than a whimper. In other years, the first shopping weekend of Christmas was described as lackadaisical, but the season ended strongly overall.
And while the first weeks may no longer be the key shopping period, trends emerge during that time and provide a glimpse ahead for retailers. The Council of Shopping Centers predicted that jewelry would account for most of the Christmas sales at malls -- 24 percent -- with home entertainment and electronics following a close second.
But for those who would rather place bets based on what shoppers on the street are forecasting, then Ruth Treglia, a physical therapist from Scarsdale, might be the one to consult. Shopping with her daughter, Dana, at Bloomingdale's on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Ms. Treglia predicted that 1997 would be remembered as a year when practicality reigned. "It's all getting too gluttonous," she said. "Just give me a pair of running shoes, and I'll be happy." She said that she was buying bedding and other practical gifts for people, not frivolous items.
Sonja Bernstein from Scarsdale, who sells high-end jewelry, observed that even in that category, shoppers were being practical. "No one's going on a spree," she said. "They're buying watches, not expensive baubles."
And Gil Schwartz of New Rochelle, a public relations specialist who was at Sam Ash's buying his son a cymbal for Hanukkah, said: "I'm definitely not going wild. This year, it's a sense of careful optimism."
While the not-going-wild syndrome is holding for most categories, the toy and book businesses have bucked all trends. Favorite items did, in fact, sell out over Thanksgiving weekend, and others are in short supply.
If a Sing and Snore Ernie is on the list, the giver should think again, because the doll whose tummy moves while it "sleeps" sold out not only in Westchester but also across the United States, stores reported. A substitute is Interactive Barney, who was in F.A.O. Schwarz just days ago. Acti Mates, the manufacturer, is calling the purple dinosaur "your child's best friend."
Books, too, "are flying off the shelves," said Kristy Janiszewski, manager of Waldenbooks at the Galleria mall in White Plains. The three hottest books this year at Waldenbooks are "Angela's Ashes" by Frank McCourt (Scribner), "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" by John Berendt (Random House) and "All Over but the Shoutin' " by Rick Bragg (Pantheon).

HEADLINE: Hearings Begin on Carting Industry

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
IT has been called the mob tax -- the added amounts that governments, businesses and individuals have to pay for garbage collection because of organized crime's influence in the carting industry.
In the aftermath of Federal indictments and guilty pleas from five people and 13 garbage-hauling companies, including some that do business in Westchester, a committee of the County Board of Legislators has begun hearings aimed at seeing what can be done to increase competition and decrease disposal costs. 
 "So far, we have heard confirmed what everyone knows -- there is a problem in Westchester County," said Thomas J. Abinanti, a Greenburgh Democrat and chairman of the Board's Committee on Legislation. "Organized crime controls the carting industry and that control impacts everyone who works or lives in Westchester."
The purpose of the legislative hearing is to establish a record of corruption by the carting industry, which can be used to justify the Board of Legislators's using its police power to regulate the industry. The Board has also set up a Mob Tax Hot Line for tips about potential illegal activity of carters. The number is 285-2144.
At its initial hearings earlier this month, the committee heard from Edward Ferguson, executive director of the New York City Trade Waste Commission, and Chad Vignola, the Deputy Commissioner, both of whom urged Westchester to follow New York City's lead in regulating the industry. "For too long," Mr. Ferguson said, "New York City and Westchester County have shared a common affliction: a basic, necessary service in an advanced society -- the collection and disposal of the waste it generates -- has been controlled by organized crime. For decades, a criminal cartel of carting companies, operating under the auspices of La Cosa Nostra, kept competition out of the industry with a wide range of anti-competitive practices, including customer allocation, price fixing and bid rigging."
Mr. Ferguson testified that things changed in New York City only after the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the Police Department began a five-year undercover investigation of the carting industry, which led in 1995 to the indictment of many carters on corruption charges. A year later, at the instigation of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the City Council passed a law that created the Trade Waste Commission and gave it extensive authority to regulate the carting industry.
As a result of this regulation, Mr. Vignola said, New York City residents and businesses have saved $335 million in garbage collecting fees because of increased competition. The Acting County Attorney, Gregory F. Meehan, said that until recently, Westchester had little basis for trying similar regulation. But now, he said, Westchester can make a case for regulation because of the guilty pleas on Sept. 30 of several carting companies and people who do business in Westchester, including Suburban Carting Corporation, Thomas Milo, its president, and a subsidiary, Trottown Transfer Inc., both of which have contracts with the county. The individuals and the companies are awaiting sentencing.
Exercising police powers to regulate the carting industry requires a legislative finding that there is a real problem and that a proposed remedy has a reasonable chance of working, Mr. Meehan said.
The alleged problem that the panel seeks to document involved what is called a "property rights systems established and perpetuated by organized crime for the purpose of eliminating competition in the marketplace," said Mary Anne Harkins, a lawyer who has been retained to help with the Board's investigation and development of regulations.
As charged in Federal indictments from the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mary Jo White, under this system a particular carter -- "affiliated with certain organized criminal groups" -- asserted a permanent property right to every location where it picked up garbage. Competitors that failed to accept those rights were subject to physical and economic reprisals, Ms. Harkins said, describing the indictments.
"It is important," she added, "to point out that the property right system described in the Federal indictment affects every level of carting-services consumer in this county, from individual commercial customers, like restaurants, delis and liquor stores, to cities, towns and villages, which hire carting companies to transport garbage to transfer stations, to the Westchester County government itself, which uses garbage haulers to take garbage from transfer stations" to its garbage incinerator in Peekskill.
The Legislation Committee will resume hearings early next year, Mr. Abinanti said. Whatever solution the Board comes up with would fit the county's problems, he said. "We don't have the resources of New York City," he said. "But clearly we need some type of supervising authority that would enhance the power of the Commissioner of our Department of Environmental Facilities."
In his remarks to the committee, Mr. Ferguson of the Trade Waste Commission said: "The precise form that regulatory reform should take will, of course, depend on the practical range of available alternatives. That said, however, it must be stressed that whatever regulatory framework is erected must be strong enough to be a credible deterrent to corruption. The success of the carting-industry reform effort in New York City is largely attributable to the broad authority conferred by Local Law 42 on the Trade Waste Commission to clean house in the industry and open up the market to vigorous competition."

2d Anchor Begun in Trenton's Revitalization Plan

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
ON Dec. 2 ground was broken for an 10,600-seat arena on 18 acres now occupied by industrial buildings in the landmark 45-acre former Roebling complex in Trenton. The ceremony conjured up images of the city's past and its hoped-for future.
The $45-million arena, which is scheduled to open in October 1999, will provide the second anchor in a plan by city and Mercer County officials to create what they describe as a triangle of economic development to help revitalize Trenton. 
 At its heart the plan, which borrows a page from the Baltimore Inner Harbor development, aims to blend sports, entertainment and cultural development with commerce to bolster the economy in a city that has watched its industrial base vanish over the last few decades. That in turn, the officials say, will help establish the state capital as a tourist destination -- not only a government center that shuts down by 6 P.M. when state workers leave.
The three anchors of the redevelopment area -- either completed, under way or planned -- are half a mile from one another. Many of the projects in the area are public-private partnerships.
The first anchor is a 6,150-seat minor-league baseball stadium that opened in 1994; the second is the arena and the third is the 200-room hotel-conference center planned for the downtown, which includes the state capitol and its environs. Around the anchors a mix of housing, office and retail space as well as additional recreational amenities will rise, spurring other development, county and city officials say.
By linking these areas and projects together Trenton "is building a new industry" that will help change that part of the city and filter into the neighborhoods, said Mercer County Executive Robert D. Prunetti.
"If the city does better, so do the suburban communities in the county," he added.
"For Trenton to advance we had to find a niche in modern economic times," said Alan Mallach, director of the city's department of housing and economic development, "and the leisure-spending industry is probably among the fastest growing and an area in which older cities like this can be competitive."
Both officials said the baseball stadium, which is called Waterfront Park, proved that people with money to spend would come to Trenton and that others would invest there. They said it also helped to change the perception of the city.
While many observers initially viewed the stadium as a pipedream, they now consider it a success. Attendance at the ballpark, home to the Trenton Thunder, an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, has been about 500,000 a year. The riverfront site includes a walkway, a picnic area and a restored old fishing wharf. A private investor also converted a vacant factory into a restaurant/nightclub called Katmandu. And now the county is advancing plans to reshape a two-mile riverfront stretch, most of it south of the stadium, for recreation and commercial uses.
One developer who sees the potential of the waterfront is Peter J. Cocoziello, president of the Advance Group of Bedminster. His company recently bought a four-building, 240,000-square-foot office complex on 20 riverfront acres next to the stadium. Future plans for the 12 undeveloped acres include retail stores and office space, he said.
The market for the stadium, considered a regional attraction, is the 2.5 million people who live within a 30-mile radius of the site, as well as state workers. That is the same market officials hope to tap for the arena.
The arena, a combination of renovated existing buildings and new construction, will begin to take shape this spring at South Broad Street, Hamilton Avenue and Route 129 amid a collection of gritty industrial buildings. The old factories, which shut down in the 70's and 80's, were built for the John A. Roebling Sons and American Steel and Wire companies, manufacturers of cables for bridges, elevators and trolleys.
The arena fits within the redevelopment plan drawn up in 1985 by the nonprofit Trenton Roebling Community Development Corporation to reshape the entire site into a mix of uses. It is expected to accommodate at least 160 events a year, key among them minor-league hockey and basketball games. But concerts, collegiate games, trade shows and family entertainment events will also be held there.
L IKE the baseball stadium the arena is being publicly financed. The Berman Development Company L.L.C., which is based in Trenton, owns the land. It will develop the arena and then sell it to the county, which will own and manage it.
Mr. Prunetti, the County Executive, said the county had received $12 million in state loans and would sell $32.5 million in bonds to finance the arena and parking. The city, for its part, will invest $2 million to $5 million to create additional parking for the project, said Mr. Mallach. The arena is to become the home of a minor-league hockey team owned by Ronald J. Berman, chief executive of the company building the arena with a partner, Stephen Cowen, a Tenafly real estate investor. The as yet unnamed expansion team will be part of the East Coast Hockey League, which has its headquarters in Princeton. The Continental Basketball Association, in St. Louis, also announced plans to bring a team to the arena.
Mr. Berman said that the prospects for a recreational use such as the arena were enhanced by the existing baseball stadium. "With urban development, single projects don't work," he said.
The arena joins other projects within the Roebling redevelopment area. Mr. Berman's company, for instance, developed the 12-acre Roebling Market, reshaped from three interconnecting former factories. One contains 66,000 square feet of offices for theNew Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency, which purchased the converted building. The others were converted to 25,000 square feet of light industrial space and a 110,000-square-foot retail center, which opened last year. The retail center is 91 percent leased, said Mr. Berman, with Edwards Supermarket taking 54,000 square feet.
A 75-unit rental housing project for elderly residents with low and moderate incomes opened this month. The project, which Mr. Mallach said is in an industrial building purchased by the city, was adapted into housing by a joint venture of Pellettieri Home for the Aged Inc., a nonprofit sponsor of housing for the elderly, and Pennrose Properties in Philadelphia. Mr. Mallach said work had also started on the renovation of the former 57,000-square-foot Roebling machine shop into a museum-science center called the Invention Factory Science Center.
Because only $3 million is available so far, he said, renovation will be limited to the basic rehabilitation of the property and to create a visitors' center. He estimated that the overall cost would be at least $20 million. Completion will depend on when additional funds are secured.
Other projects are planned. Mr. Mallach said the city was in the process of acquiring another old factory to convert, beginning next year, into 150 market-rate rental apartments. Another building is to become a children's learning center. And the Y.M.C.A of Trenton is putting together financing to renovate one of the structures into a fitness center, he added.
A T the same time, plans are advancing to turn a downtown 3.5-acre site into a seven-story hotel and conference center, returning hotel rooms to the city after a 20-year absence. The hotel will be linked to the Trenton War Memorial, a state-owned historic landmark now undergoing a $30 million renovation. It is now used for such events as concerts and other entertainments, as well as community events.
The $44-million hotel project is to rise on a site at the foot of South Warren Street, which is owned by the city and the Trenton Parking Authority and is now a surface parking lot. The hotel will be financed with public and private funds. A total of $20 million in public funds is already in place.
Acquest Realty Advisors, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is the developer and Marriott Conference Centers, part of the Marriott hotel chain, will operate the new hotel-conference center as well as the War Memorial.
"What we look for is if there is enough public commitment to the project," said David G. Ong, president of Acquest, which often works with Marriott on such projects. "We saw that commitment in Trenton. We've also done our own homework and concluded that the market is there for such a project."
Mr. Ong said most of the $24 million in private financing needed for the project had been raised. He said he expected construction to start early in the second quarter of 1998 with completion to follow 15 to 18 months later.
Mr. Mallach said the combination of redevelopment initiatives pooled together under the plan was not a panacea. "But it is an opportunity to create a significant economic engine for the city," he added. "We better not blow it."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
Stores, Landlords Seek Profits Above and Below

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
WHEN the owners of the Tourneau company decided to establish a flagship store in Manhattan, they realized they would not be likely to find all the space they needed on one floor in a prime location. So they decided to look up and down as well as around.
The result is their new store on the southwest corner of 57th Street and Madison Avenue, a four-level extravaganza housing wristwatches with prices ranging from $25 to $250,000. To encourage customers to move between floors, lots of vertical transportation is provided: escalators, an elevator, stairs and even a rock-climbing wall -- which is only used for special events. 
 The 16,000-square-foot store dwarfs the company's other New York outlets, which average 1,500 square feet. The larger size allows a whole new approach to retailing, company officials say.
"We don't have the space to display enough products in our other stores," said Robert Wexler, president of the family-owned firm. "With the new store, we display 40 additional brands and we have space for a service facility, for education and exhibitions."
While retailers are finding new possibilities in vertical expansion, , landlords are realizing there may be better uses for the second and third floors of their commercial buildings than offices. Combining them with the ground-floor space may provide an opportunity to rent to a retailer, who usually pays more for space than an office tenant.
"You need a good location, but, yes, landlords are discovering that they can rent their lower floors to retailers at a premium to office use," said Benjamin Fox a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services. "The psychology has changed."
Retailers who are entering or expanding in the New York market are turning to vertical retailing as a way of presenting a full line of merchandise without being crippled by the high cost of ground-floor space. Shanghai Tang, the colorful new fashion and furnishings emporium at Madison and 61st Street, uses both a lower level and a mezzanine in addition to the ground floor.
The Tuscan Square combined store and restaurant in Rockefeller Center uses two floors to attract shoppers or the hungry from both street level and the center's below-ground concourse. Managers of Rockefeller Center are working on plans to transform much of the other retail space in the complex to multilevel operations, using the concourse and the second floor, which is now occupied by offices.
It is a pattern that is becoming more common. "We are definitely going to see more of it," said Kate Coburn, Cushman & Wakefield's director of retail services, referring to vertical retailing. "Much of the catalyst has come from national retailers coming into Manhattan who need 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of space. They are not going to find many buildings that have 15,000 or 20,000 on one floor. So they have to make accommodations to fit into space that makes the numbers work."
Some of the most important of these numbers are the lower rental rates for below-ground and second-floor space, compared to the ground floor. For example, on Madison Avenue in the 60's, first-floor rents are reaching $400 a square foot, according to Faith H. Consolo, senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, retail specialists. But the second or lower floor in the same prime location might only command $150 to $175 a square foot.
By blending the higher and lower rates, the retailer ends up with a rental rate that the store can support and still earn a profit.
Nor is it just newcomers who want bigger spaces. Much of the retail industry is looking to expand, according to real estate executives. "Everybody wants to get bigger," said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director at Insignia/ESG. "The store that had 3,000 square feet at grade now wants 15,000 by adding a mezzanine and a lower level," he said.
"Everybody is following apparel, books and records," observed Ms. Consolo, who said stores like The Gap, Barnes & Noble and Virgin led the way to successful multifloor selling. "Now you have the health and beauty stores following. They want to generate some excitement by giving the customer more items to choose from. These stores are becoming the 90's version of the variety store, a Woolworth's for the millennium."
Bigger stores usually mean more sales, which is good for the retailer. But Mr. Seligman argues that they are also good for consumers, by offering them more choice.
"A lot of off-price, discount and multiproduct retailers simply could not afford to be in New York without multilevel," he said. "And if they can't afford to be here, the customer loses out."
Choice, he said, has become increasingly important to consumers in recent years. "All the rules of retailing changed after the economic crash of 1987," he said. "Prior to that if you were a Neiman-Marcus customer, that's where you went. Now it is all price-value. Today it is not unusual to see someone buy a $40 pair of jeans at The Gap and walk across the street and pay $350 to $400 for a pair of Ferragamo shoes."
It is this willingness of customers to shop at different economic levels that has led to a multiple-level Warner Brothers Studio Store facing Tiffany's across prestigious 57th Street and to Niketown, a multilevel temple of sports, sharing the southern side of the block between Fifth and Madison with Tiffany's and the new Tourneau operation.
And if the bigger stores are, arguably, good news for retailers and customers, they can be terrific news for landlords, who can convert unrentable basement and low-priced second floor offices into retail space. Brokers say that the second floor of most buildings is the least desirable because of the lack of views, but that the per-foot rental rate can be easily doubled if combined with the ground floor into a multilevel store.
Indeed, the owner of an office building on Third Avenue that was purchased last year for $50 million estimates that he added $8 million in economic value by deciding to combine the second floor with the first to attract the so-called "big box" retailers who demand multilevel space to showcase their wares.
As might be expected, operators of vertical stores are resorting to some tricks to get customers moving up and down. For example, at a Gap store on Madison Avenue, the store's most popular product, blue jeans, is on the lower level. To get to them, the customer must walk through the whole street-level portion of the store where other products, such as shirts and sweaters, are displayed in hopes of provoking some impulse buying.
"It's stocked on the supermarket principle," Mr. Seligman observed. "You put the most popular product the farthest away."
ANOTHER approach is convenience. The Riese Organization recently converted a property it controls on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets from a quick-service food court (Pizza Hut, Roy Rogers) into a T.G.I. Friday's, a full-service restaurant.
The restaurant has three serving levels, the ground floor and two upper floors. To get people to the upper levels, receptionists tell them how long it will take for a table to open up on the main floor, much of which is taken up by a bar, and advise them they can be seated more quickly if they will climb some stairs.
"People will go upstairs if there is a window; they don't like basements," said Dennis Riese, the chief executive of the company. "It's important to get them up the stairs quickly. The longer they stare at a flight of stairs, the more likely they are to go elsewhere."
Because the franchise is well known around the country, he said, he expects the renovated restaurant, which reopened last month, to draw heavily from tourists visiting adjacent Rockefeller Center. He said a full-service restaurant made more sense than quick-service at that location. "People are tired and cold, their feet hurt," he said. "They want to sit down and be served."
Mr. Riese's aides said that with a multilevel restaurant they could do things that would be difficult on a single floor. "If we don't need all the tables, we can shut down a floor, which has the effect of shrinking the restaurant," said Jamie B. Galler, the executive vice president for operations. "Or we can have private parties upstairs without disturbing the operations down below. Having the floors makes the place more modular than just one level."
Entertainment is becoming a bigger part of retailing, and bigger stores present more opportunities to attract the attention of customers. In fact, the entire Tourneau store has been outfitted to resemble the inner workings of a watch, with a structural column detailed to suggest the pinion that transmits motion between gears.
The windows along the store's 100 feet of frontage on 57th Street are 40 feet high so passers-by can see all the levels except the one below ground. The windows are recessed behind the facade holding the store's sign and the clocks, so that anyone taking a close look at the window is effectively in the store without opening the door. "Someone who is at the window is already within our space," Mr. Wexler said. In keeping with the watch theme, the display cases and counters are all curved. Much of what had been the second floor of the building has been removed and replaced with a mezzanine.
Having the mezzanine promotes an open feeling within the store and also keeps the floor area within city zoning limits, since the mezzanine space is no more than the now-removed second-floor area. "We took out 100 tons of structural steel and building materials to create the open space," said Anthony J. D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau.
With ample space available, the display cases are placed well apart. The street level is stocked with what Tourneau executives describe as popular brands, including Breitling, Movado and Tag Heuer. As a visitor goes up, so do the prices, with vintage watches and jewelry on the mezzanine level and luxury brands like Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Rolex on the carpeted top floor.
Below ground are more moderately priced brands such as Bulova, Citizen and Seiko, a service area and a gallery tracing the development of timekeeping. A hall for special exhibits is also on this level and will house various contemporary events. "Tag Heuer sponsors a Formula One racing team," Mr. Wexler said, "so we had a race car here for awhile."
THE drive for vertical retailing is changing the appearance of some of the city's best-known properties. The southern half of the retail space of the building at 666 Fifth Avenue, at 52d Street, is being completely renovated to house the first store selling products endorsed by the National Basketball Association.
"This was a retail-unfriendly building, with the display glass behind columns," said Glenn Markman, an executive managing director of Grubb & Ellis New York, who represented the N.B.A. Nevertheless, with an assignment to find 35,000 square feet on Fifth Avenue in the heart of the shopping district, he was not about to dismiss any possibility.
"We started to play around with ideas of how to make it friendlier," he said. "As we thought about it, we realized that N.B.A. was about height. And we figured if we removed part of the slab of the second floor, we would have real impact space."
When it opens in September 1998, the store will have a new all-glass facade and will operate on three levels. The ground-floor space will be the smallest, with 8,000 square feet. There will be 10,500 square feet on the second floor and 16,500 square feet on the lower level.
Mr. Markman said it took 18 months to negotiate the deal, which involved moving existing tenants and getting the owner to agree to the renovations.
Nevertheless, Arthur L. Bocchi, a senior managing director of the building's owner, Sumitomo Realty & Development, said he was so pleased with the outcome that he wanted to convert the northern part of the retail space in a similar fashion.
"We had been thinking about what we could do to enhance our retail," he said. "We felt that we didn't really have a presence on Fifth Avenue." He said the retail part of the building was essentially unchanged since it was built in 1958, and had been divided into relatively small blocks and leased to airlines, such as Alitalia, for ticket offices and for bank branches. A B. Dalton bookstore operated on the ground floor and lower level.
Now, with the N.B.A. store under construction, the company is going ahead with a plan to renovate the building's lobby and entrances. And it is looking for a tenant or two for the remaining available space, 9,000 square feet on the first floor and 15,000 square feet on the second.
"We'll lease it to one tenant or split it in two, but no more than that," Mr. Bocchi said.
He said vertical retailing appeared to work when there was one company involved, to establish a presence at the street level. "There is a resistance to going up," he said. "That's why vertical malls, where customers have to ride up in elevators to visit various shops, have not been successful. But it does work if it's one store."
Carl Barbato, the chief operating officer of Shanghai Tang, which has two levels and a mezzanine, said the way to get customers to move vertically was to make the lower space physically inviting and then use a little showmanship to attract their attention.
"You have to have a high enough ceiling and the right lighting and then the right tease to make people want to know what is downstairs," he said. "We have had remarkably little falloff from the main to the lower level."He said the lower floor is stocked with such things as men's and children's clothing and decorative home furnishings, such as picture frames, that represent a growing market. In addition, the rest rooms are on the lower level.
VERTICAL retailing is as much about theater as it is merchandising, said Paul B. Boardman, the retail design partner at HLW, an architectural firm. "Brokers like to talk about the value of blended space, but if you really are to do well you have to design a space that produces a more theatrical type of retailing," he said.
He said the Tourneau store, with its video display screens, exhibits and constant evocations of watches and time in its design appears to have that quality.
Not all the practitioners of this type of retailing are new on the scene, he added.
"Why do people go to Tiffany's and pay $5,000 for a diamond they could get on Jewelers' Row for $2,200?," he asked. "The answer is that they want the entire Tiffany experience."

HEADLINE: Beyond Prayer;
Testing Faith in Their Own Hometowns, Congregations Offer Hands-On Help

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
LAST July, the mens' club of the First United Methodist Church in the impoverished Cumberland County town of Port Norris merged with the mens' club of the John Wesley United Methodist Church a few blocks away. One of the first questions the new group examined was how to create a much-needed recreation center for young people.
By November the congregations had bought avandalized abandoned house on Main Street from a bank for $3,000. They plan to strip the inside after the holidays and start renovations in the spring. 
 "The labor will come from the members of these two churches," said the Rev. Chris Miller, pastor of First United Methodist. Then in a joking manner, he added, "Maybe we can get some of the kids who vandalized it to help us out."
For some, living one's faith may mean going to services for prayer, song and sermons; giving generously when a collection plate is passed or a fund drive is announced, and taking part in other opportunities for fellowship and study at their church or synagogue.
But increasingly, religious leaders say, there is a feeling that prayer and meditation are not enough, that people can deepen their faith by reaching outside themselves and their houses of worship. Rather than just asking God to help solve society's problems -- especially those in their own communities -- they are stepping in to offer hands-on help. And, in the process, their ministers and rabbis say, they often find that they are growing spiritually as well.
Congregations around New Jersey, like the two Methodist churches in Port Norris, are tackling the needs of their towns and their neighbors not only by doing manual labor or committing large of amounts of time to counseling or caring for the troubled or destitute but also by bringing their moral weight to bear on national and international issues.
With the welfare system being retooled to drive hundreds of thousands from the rolls, with an increase in the number of working poor and the infirm elderly, congregations are reaching out in the traditional ways, of course: collecting food for the hungry at Thanksgiving, buying gifts for poor families at Christmas and Hannukah, and visiting hospitals and nursing homes.
But they are also doing so in unusual ways, like trying to set up day care services for the children of working parents, encouraging young people with career advice, and "partnering" with less affluent congregations.
To do this, many churches are crossing racial and religious lines. For example, in Port Norris, Mr. Miller and the members of his church are white, while his counterpart, the Rev. Joseph L. Scott, and his church members are black.
Throughout the state, synagogues, Catholic parishes and Protestant churches have been joining in inter-faith coalitions to help the homeless in their communities, often putting them up for a week at time in church and synagogue basements.
"Churches and synagogues are increasingly moving to do social justice within the neighborhood, like soup kitchens," said Rabbi James Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee in Manhattan. "They're focusing more and more on the local neighborhood, the community, the village and less on the global scene."
"That doesn't mean they've taken their eyes off the environment, nuclear weapons or land mines, which is the big issue now, but I see congregations focusing more on local and regional service delivery systems."
The Rev. Jack Johnson, a high-ranking Methodist church official who is president of the New Jersey Council of Churches, said he also sees a new involvement of congregations in social issues, recalling that many ministers and members of mainline Protestant churches were highly visible in civil rights and social justice issues in the 1960's, demonstrating, marching, lobbying and sometimes ending up in jail.
"I think for awhile churches backed away from that," Mr. Johnson said, "but they are now returning, recognizing that part of the mission of the church is to reach out and witness to the community. And the church has been engaged more recently on issues relating to affordable housing, clearly on issues of homelessness and hunger."
 
Seeking More Response At the Parish Level
 Several years ago the National Conference of Catholic Bishops released a paper urging Catholics to get involved in ministering to the needs of their parishes and communities. Last month, its international policy committee, headed by Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, expanded the scope with a paper entitled "Called to Global Solidarity." The Bishops are now urging a greater response by Catholics at the parish level to international problems of poverty, hunger and economic inequality and social justice and will issue guidebooks early next year on how to do so.
"A key test of a parish's 'Catholicity'," the document said, "is its willingness to go beyond its own boundaries to preach the Gospel, serve those in need and work for global justice and peace."
John Carr, secretary for social development and world peace of the United States Catholic Bishops Conference, said there were "literally hundreds and thousands of parishes" committed to social action but, added, "There is always a danger that one committee or group does it for the rest of us. We pray for them. We applaud them. We write them a check occasionally, but we don't join them." He added, however, "That's what I think is changing."
In Port Norris, the need for involvement become obvious. Once a prosperous town, its oyster industry was devastated by marine parasites. Today the per capita annual income of its 2,000 residents is about $10,000.
Teen-agers tend to hang out in front of Dino's pizzeria or Newcomb's Supermarket, which last year was damaged when a small plane crashed into the roof, closing the only grocery store in town for about eight months. That was when Pastors Miller and Scott first joined forces and operated a bus service so people without cars could buy food 18 miles away, in Millville.
Mr. Miller estimates that the cost of materials to convert the old house into a youth center will be $35,000 to $45,000 and is hoping for donations from outside Port Norris. And this is one of those holidays when donations are at their greatest. In Catholic and Protestant churches there were Christmas trees from which members have taken paper ornaments with instructions to buy gifts anonymously for "boy 6 to 8 year old," or "girl, 10".
St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Rutherford is no different. Last Sunday about 550 ornaments, 50 of them representing gifts for patients in Bergen Pines County Hospital, disappeared, said Kathleen Lovett, a member of the social concerns committee.
St. Mary's also takes part in the "Help A Family At Christmas Project," sponsored by the Newark Archdiocese, in which parishioners volunteer to be donors for needy families suggested by coordinators of emergency food programs.
Catherine L'Insalata, director of the archdiocesan parish social ministry programs, said it began a dozen years ago when a distraught woman who had lost a son called to say she wanted to help a needy family. Each year about 300 are helped; St. Mary's sponsored 12 this year.
"It's a very busy time for the social-concern elves, as we call ourselves," Ms. Lovett said.
Synagogues, too, have been busy collecting food and gifts for the needy at Hanukkah. One of the most active social ministry programs, in general, is in Temple Emanu-el in Westfield, where children have been bringing in hundreds of toys to the religious school for the Jewish Family Service and a cancer care facility.
Perhaps the most dramatic example of community involvement comes on a Sunday in April called Mitzvah Day, when 700 adults and children sign up to work on projects in the community. One of the projects involves a decade-old affiliation with the people of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Plainfield, where members rehabilitate houses of the needy.
"It's an amazing thing," said Rabbi Charles A. Kroloff, spiritual leader of the temple. "The volunteers do physically what they can, from painting to moderate repair, but we will hire people to do more difficult tasks, like the electrical work."
The Lutheran Church of the Reformation in well-to-do West Long Branch has teamed up with the Second Baptist Church in Long Branch to explore community needs. One result is creation of a soup kitchen that feeds 100 people every Saturday.
Our Lady of Notre Dame in North Caldwell, like many Catholic parishes, has a sister parish, St. Mary's in Jersey City. Recently parishioners advised students at the school there on career day; for the last three years Notre Dame has been providing scholarships to grammar school and high school students in St. Mary's parish.
 
The Basics for Babies At a Local Church
 An unusual program geared to working poor families got its start at the West Side Presbyterian Church in Ridgewood. "Baby Basics" provides the babies with formula and diapers, said Pat Hanft, a church member who organized the program in April 1995 and now serves as its director.
The program began in a Sunday school classroom and served five to 10 babies in the immediate area. Since coming under the auspices of the Red Cross in Ridgewood last summer, it now serves 40 babies in Bergen County.
Mrs. Hanft, who gets a small salary which she splits with an assistant before donating her share to the program, "These are people with dignity, and most want to give back to us. A few weeks ago, a mother gave us two afghans she had knitted said, 'Please give these to babies in the program who need them.' "
Many religious bodies have been opening after-school programs to meet the needs of single-parentand two-income families. Last year, the First Presbyterian and Trinity Church in South Orange created a non-sectarian after-school program for middle school students that supplements their regular schoolwork, said the pastor, the Rev. Charles Thompson.
"As a church we become a model to the larger community of bringing a racially and culturally diverse community together in ways that are positive and exciting," he said.
His church also provides a meeting place for a gay youth group unaffiliated with the church and an organization, "Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays."
Among its programs, St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in Fair Lawn has what the human-concerns minister, Lenora Mosca, calls a garden ministry. The church has long served as a food pantry and feeds 50 families a month in neighboring towns, including Paterson.
Several years ago, Ms. Mosca -- an enviromentalist who gives out seeds on Earth Day, encourages parishioners to avoid using chemicals on their lawns and publishes a quarterly ecology bulletin -- told a parishioner how useful including fresh vegetables in food packages would be.
The parishioner, Zach Garripoli, a retired union steamfitter, volunteers his time to Harrison House, a historic working farm owned by Bergen County, where he explains gardening techniques to childen and their parents. So he arranged to use a section of a garden behind the house to grow vegetables for the needy.
He and other parishioners also take Holy Communion to residents of a Fair Lawn nursing home and Bergen Pines Hospital on a regular basis.
"They look forward to seeing us and I look forward to seeing them," said Mr. Garripoli. "All of us get a lot out of it."
Another parishioner, Nancy Crincoli, a former consulting engineer, helped to form a group called M.O.M.S, Ministry of Motherhood, whose activities include taking their young children to nursing homes to interact with the sick and elderly.
Many churches and synagogues are in coalitions to address homelessness. One is Faith Lutheran Church in New Providence, which was the first to join the Interfaith Hospitality Network of Union County about 10 years ago.
For two weeks each year, member congregations shelter homeless women with children or families overnight. Faith Church provides 100 volunteers to the cause, said the pastor, the Rev. Murdoch MacPherson. Members also work at a soup kitchen in St. John's Roman Catholic Church in Newark each Saturday and volunteer time at an AIDS hospice every two months.
"We have a lot of people who realize they've got a lot," said Mr. McPherson, "and they're looking for ways to share it." He added, "You sit with a family and talk to the kids in the hospitality program and they say, 'I want my own home and my own bed.' And a lot of our people get fired up and want to deal with these issues."
 
Help With Rent For Working Poor
 Another coalition, Interfaith Neighbors Inc. in Monmouth County has a different approach. A non-profit corporation supported by 100 churches and synagogues, outside donations and government grants, it provides rent subsidies to the working poor.
Its president is Rabbi Sally Priesand; its long-time executive director is Joe Marmora. As a retired real estate salesman, he was looking "to do some good deeds here and there " and ended up 10 years ago helping to form the coalition.
The group now provides subsidies to about a hundred families a year and operates a senior citizen meal program for 2,200 elderly people a year.
"What we found was that no matter what our religion was," Mr. Marmora said, "we all believed we have a mandate from above to help needy people." He added, "We kind of thrive on that."
As productive as churches and synagogues are at direct service, with salaried employees or committees to deal with social concerns, their efforts to affect policy on broad issues like welfare are less widespread.
"Policy is a very important component for social justice, complementing the direct service works," said Regina Purcell, associate director for social concerns of the New Jersey Catholic Conference in Trenton, a public policy arm of New Jersey's bishops on social issues.
The conference and other interfaith groups joined some months back to influence Governor Whitman to establish a state-financed food-stamp program for legal immigrants who were losing food stamps as a result of changes in Federal policy.
Ms. Purcell said there is a deep level of cynicism among people about whether government can correct complicated societal problems, but there is also a desire to help.
"What I see when I visit with parishes is a sincere desire to do something that will make a difference, to change the way things are done, to help influence politics and politicians," Ms. Purcell said.
"Part of our job," she added, "is to encourage people to continue to be persistent in contacting their legislators, to write letters, to make phone calls and to know they ultimately can make a difference."

If Only One East Coast Port Can Be No. 1, Which One Will It Be?

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
The year is 2030. Broad floating behemoths, eight stories high and nearly five stories deep, chug into an East Coast port, carrying 8,000 standard shipping containers filled with European exports, everything from computers to beer. Robotically unloaded, the cargo is shifted onto smaller ships, for delivery to other East Coast ports, onto railroads for delivery to the Midwest, and onto trucks for local delivery. American exports are loaded on, and the mighty ships take off for foreign ports, all in the service of a booming international economy.
This is what elected officials, business leaders and advocacy groups mean when they say "hub port," a phrase that is popping up with mantralike frequency as the debate over the future of the Port of New York and New Jersey gradually intensifies. In contrast to the unity that label suggests, there is an overriding issue: will the port of the future be in New York or in New Jersey? 
 The stakes are high. Most hub port visionaries believe there will be only one hub for all shipping lines on the East Coast -- and other established ports, such as those in Virginia and in Halifax, Nova Scotia, are jostling for the spot. New York and New Jersey, many say, does not have room for error.
The last change of similar significance in the shipping industry was the move toward containerization, which decades ago prompted the development of Ports Elizabeth and Newark, and spelled the end of the dominance of Brooklyn's bulk ports.
So the threat of failure is as real as the promise of huge economic benefits from international port business that experts project will increase 5 to 8 percent a year over the next 30 years.
Chris O. Ward, director of port redevelopment for the Port Authority, said: "If it becomes a battle between New York and New Jersey, the region as a whole will only suffer. We could blow this whole thing out of the water if we fight over it tooth and nail."
The current commercial business is centered on Ports Elizabeth and Newark, which have the most modern container equipment, though there are also functioning ports on the southern Brooklyn waterfront. Dredging to keep the channels to Elizabeth and Newark clear, and further dredging to deepen them to 45 feet, has been the main issue of the last few years, mainly because the dredged material is tainted with toxins and cannot be simply dumped elsewhere.
That problem has not been totally solved, but Representative Robert Menendez, a Democrat from Essex, Hudson and Middlesex counties, believes there has been enough progress on plans for the sludge to permit him to focus on the next issue.
And that, he said, is making the routes to Elizabeth and Newark 50 feet deep, to accommodate ships so big they cannot fit through the Panama Canal, and so are called post-Panamax. The Bayonne Bridge, with a high-water clearance of 137 feet, is just high enough for these ships, according to Peter Schaerf, a consultant at the Commonwealth Group, a ship broker.
An Army Corps of Engineers study is under way now to determine the practicality of deepening the channel to 50 feet. But there are those, including Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic Representative from New York who has been trying to expand the region's use of rail for years, who believe that Ports Elizabeth and Newark cannot be the hub port.
Brett Heimov, a Nadler aide, said that no matter how deep the channels could be made, the Kill van Kull, the waterway between Bayonne and Staten Island, is wide enough for only one post-Panamax at a time. And, he said, it would be virtually impossible to widen the channel, a point disputed by Mr. Menendez and Mr. Ward.
But just in case, two other studies are examining alternative sites for hub ports. The Port Authority is examining the largest array, including southern Brooklyn and the 437-acre Military Ocean Terminal of Bayonne, which the military is closing in 2001.
A study by the New York City Economic Development Corporation is focusing solely on southern Brooklyn, in combination with a proposed rail-freight tunnel that would link it to Staten Island or New Jersey. New York's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, threw his support behind the tunnel this year.
Charles Millard, head of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said that while potential trade growth probably meant there would be development on "both sides of the harbor," it was only right for Brooklyn to get a major role.
"The coming growth in world trade is going to create enough market share for everyone," he said. "But the Mayor believes that New York City has not gotten its fair share of this trade over the last couple of decades because of the Port Authority's pro-New Jersey policies."
Mr. Ward, on the other hand, said that New York benefits when New Jersey's port business grows. "Sixty percent of the freight forwarders that handle cargo in Ports Elizabeth and Newark work in New York City," he said, concluding, "Hub ports don't just come off the shelf at Kmart. We need to look at where the jobs and the economic benefits land, rather than where the terminals do."
Mr. Menendez, the New Jersey Congressman, said that while the two states' common interests were compelling, so were their differences.
"If you listen to Jerry Nadler, he wants a rail tunnel, he wants New York to be the place for a new container port, and we would in essence become the feeder port," he said. "I say that's reinventing the wheel. We already have the container ports. And they generate $20 billion for the economy and 180,000 jobs!"
Forums to try to shape the debate are beginning to spring up. On Tuesday, the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a pro-rail advocacy group, is sponsoring a seminar at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark that will include New Jersey lawmakers, Port Authority officials and rail executives. William Yates, a project coordinator at the campaign, said a separate seminar is being planned to address New York's particular concerns.
And the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, an association of New York governmental agencies and transportation providers, is planning a forum, perhaps as early as February. Gerry Bogacz, an assistant director at the council, said such discussions were necessary to supplement efforts by the Port Authority, because, he said, it is "not necessarily seen as a neutral forum -- it's seen as a stakeholder."
 
Who Has What Ammunition in Port Fight
Three ports are most often mentioned as competitors for an increase in international shipping over the next 30 years. Here is a brief profile of each, using 1996 figures.
 
PORT OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY -- Pros: Huge number of local consumers, good rail connections on the New Jersey side. Cons: Existing channels need to be blasted and dredged for megaships; new container plants must be built where channels are already deep enough; costs are high.
Estimated imports are 51,993,484 metric tons, valued at $55.1 billion; estimated exports are 7,925,994 metric tons, worth about $24.2 billion. Total: 59,919,478 metric tons, worth $79 billion.
The top 10 destinations of cargo imported at this port are New York, New Jersey, Texas, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Georgia, Florida.
 
PORTS OF VIRGINIA -- (ncludes Portsmouth, Norfolk and Newport News.) Pros: 36-hour transit time to Midwest; has bulk and container equipment, excellent rail connections and warehouses; deep channels, thanks in part to military presence; low labor costs. Cons: relatively small local market.
Estimated imports are 9,893,865 metric tons, worth $16.6 billion; estimated imports are 4,941,463 metric tons, worth about $17.5 billion. Total: 54,835,328 metric tons, worth $34 billion.
The top 10 destinations for imported cargo are Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, Michigan, Connecticut
 
PORT OF HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA -- Pros: A day closer to Europe than other East Coast ports; deep channels; good rail connections to the Midwest; low labor costs. Cons: Few local consumers, a day further from markets from other East Coast ports.
Imports are an estimated 6,031,469 metric tons; imports are 6,903,653 metric tons. An estimated value was not available.
The top 10 destinations of cargo imported at Halifax are Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Illinois, California, British Columbia, Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey.

Preservation Pays, A Rutgers Study Finds . . .

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
The $60 million raised in the past 10 years through three bond issues for preservation of historic sites has generated many times that amount of money and created more jobs than new construction projects costing the same amount of money would have, according to a study by the Center for Urban Policy of Rutgers University.
The study supports the contention of preservation advocates that spending money to preserve history pays off, said Harriette Hawkins, director of the state Historic Trust. 
 The last of the money available for grants from the 1987, 1992 and 1995 Historic Preservation Bond Acts will be distributed this week. The money from the bonds and from all other historic preservation work in the state generates $263 million in income, creates 10,140 jobs and produces $215 million in state and local taxes each year, according to the study. New Jersey has 1,100 historic sites on the State and National Registers of Historic Places and 240 historic districts that containing thousands of other buildings. The study said 9.1 million tourists visit New Jersey's historic sites each year and spend $432 million. KAREN DeMASTERS

Lacking Big Boxes, Fulton Uses Gold To Draw Shoppers

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Fulton Mall is a vibrant conga line of 300 fast-food joints, electronics and sneakers stores, clothing chains, random discount stores and gold jewelry by the truckload. With its aging buildings and countless "Sale" and Discount" signs, it's like Times Square, pre-Disney, sans porn.
"It is an esthetic honky-tonk," said Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. "But it's so successful that no one pays attention." An estimated 100,000 pedestrians traverse the mall daily, and it is among the city's highest grossing streets. 
 But there are signs of trouble, or at least transition, on the drag that is downtown Brooklyn's heart. At least five stores are having liquidation sales, and several other spaces are for rent. Woolworth's is closed. King's Department Store and Wertheimer's both just closed.
Fulton Mall has become Gold Alley, with new jewelry stores and counters, most run by Russian and Middle Eastern immigrants, proliferating. But vendors said the market was sagging, either from oversaturation or diminished demand.
Some non-gold retailers also said that business declined substantially in the last 18 months. "It's really, really, really going down; it's terrible," said the owner of NuBest, who declined to give her name but said that last year she had resorted to subleasing space in her men's-wear store to sportswear sellers and a gold jewelry counter.
Countless stores on the mall have become such mini-bazaars, with sneakers and electronics operations and a gold jewelry counter sharing space to meet rising rents.
Fulton rents have always been high, but retailers, realtors and business observers said perhaps landlords had pushed rates too high in a changing retail climate.
Peter Botsaris, president of Garrick-Aug Store Leasing Associates, said rents had risen to $150 per square foot. "Based on the volume on the street, they should have stayed at $100," he said. The 86th Street strip in Bay Ridge brings $60 to $80.
Downtown developments like Metrotech have brought thousands of consumers to the area. Surveys show they want better quality and service than Fulton's stores have provided.
Mr. Adams said new sites like "the clean, bright, well-organized" Atlantic Center nearby could lure many of those consumers. With this in mind, Lou Carbonetti, the Fulton Mall Improvement Association's new director, said he had begun persuading landlords to fix up the street. Otherwise, he said "there would be a disaster in five or six years."
But one landlord, Albert Laboz, said he thought that the empty stores would soon be snapped up and that the street was "still very strong."
The Gap-free mall has many loyalists, who come in search of deals, not smiles. Judy Franklin of Flatbush held up a gold bracelet and said she had just bartered it down to $100. "That's why I like it here," she said triumphantly. AMY WALDMAN

She's Wound Up in Her Career, but He's Ready to Wind Down

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
AFTER a career as a salesman, Ruth Cambron's husband retired, and she thought she might, too. She took a leave from her job as a health care specialist in California, and the couple traveled on cruise ships. "That convinced me not to retire," Mrs. Cambron said. "I did not want to feel useless." She also wanted to build her pension. And 12 years later, at 73, she still draws a paycheck -- a stalwart in the growing ranks of older women who continue to work after their husbands stop.
Sandra Kaul, an art gallery director and consultant, is just entering those ranks. Her husband, lured by the offer of a sweetened pension, retired in June at 58, after 30 years as a college art professor in Minnesota. "I encouraged him," said Ms. Kaul, who is 55. "I knew he really wanted to stay home and paint, while I have a career to pursue." 
 Helena Genovese, 63, stays at her job out of both necessity and desire. Her husband, a professional hypnotist, now 68, retired seven years ago, worried that if he did not ease up he might suffer a fatal heart attack, as a friend had. But his $850 in monthly retirement benefits, mostly from Social Security, is insufficient to maintain the couple's suburban life style without Ms. Genovese's $1,900-a-month salary as a manager of the parking facility at Buffalo's airport.
"Besides, what would I do all day at home?" she asked. "He plays with the dog, builds model planes and visits our children. I think that if two people are home together constantly, they could end up killing each other."
Having distinguished themselves as the first generation to leave the house to work in large numbers, women in their late 50's and early 60's are now in retirement range. If they are single, divorced or widowed, they often keep working, surveys show, because they lack the Social Security credits or pension savings of men their age, who earned more and worked more years. But in growing numbers, married women in this age group are also staying on the job -- breaking with the practice of sharing their husbands' retirement.
Surveys are just beginning to catch the shift and the reasons for it. A big one is the promise of an independent pension to avoid the poverty that often comes to widows who rely on their husbands' benefits. Social Security, the main ingredient in most cases, is cut after a husband's death.
"Older women keep working to secure their economic survival," said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington.
What is more, the extra income earned by the women helps maintain family living standards, particularly if a husband has been pushed out of the labor force before he had planned to retire. And there is what Mathew Greenwald, a market researcher who polls people on retirement issues, calls the sociability aspect.
"Building friendships on the job is often more important to women than it is to men," he said. "Women may want to go on working to maintain these friendships. They find the idea of being retired more isolating than men do."
Whatever the reasons, women's persistence in working could have broad implications for the economy. It could, for example, relieve some of the financial pressure on the Social Security system, which will be stretched thin when the baby boomers retire.
The statistical evidence is still sparse, but the shift appears to apply mainly to those 55 to 64 and not to those 65 and older. The number of working men and women in that older group has traditionally been relatively small, although it has crept up slightly for both sexes in the 1990's.
The University of Michigan, which is tracking people in their 50's and 60's in a federally financed study that is just beginning to produce data, found that of 813 married women whose husbands had retired, 45 percent still worked, most of them full time. "These are serious workers, not just women doing real estate," said Marjorie Honig, a Hunter College economist who helped tabulate the results.
Labor Department surveys also suggest that married women are working in increasing numbers after their husbands stop, or at least that married women aged 55 to 64 are staying in the labor force in rising percentages while men are not. Nearly 3.5 million women in this group were in the labor force last year, or 48.6 percent of all married women 55 to 64, up from 41.3 percent in 1989 and 36.3 percent in 1980. But the percentage of married men in that age group in the labor force has fallen to 70.2 percent, from 75.4 percent in 1980.
"Women are beginning to realize that by working just a few more years, they become eligible for good pensions," said Olivia Mitchell, a labor economist at the University of Pennsylvania. "The benefit of those few extra years can be quite high."
MS. GENOVESE, who took a salaried job in 1980 when the youngest of her four children was 13, came to exactly that conclusion. "If I work three more years, I'll be eligible for a pension of $1,000 a month," she said. She made it clear that if her health held up, she would work indefinitely, qualifying for an even bigger pension. Her job also provides the couple's health insurance.
Many other women are also working for bigger pensions. The Social Security Administration projects that if current trends continue, by 2015 nearly 60 percent of married women will be entitled to higher pensions upon retirement than the spousal benefit they would receive under their husbands' Social Security. That would be up from 33 percent today. And 20 percent of the women will qualify for pensions that are higher than those of their husbands, up from less than 10 percent today.
But there is a caveat about projecting the trend forward. What Ms. Cambron, Ms. Kaul and Ms. Genovese share with many older married women is this: They took jobs and began careers relatively late in life after raising children or at least staying home until their children were in junior high school. Younger women, on the other hand, are far more likely to have careers that parallel those of their husbands. Once they reach retirement age, husband and wife, having gone through the same career cycles, may think alike about retirement.
"The question is, will these younger people prod each other to stay on the job or will they prod each other to retire," said Angela O'Rand, a Duke University sociologist and retirement specialist.
For now, however, older husbands and wives are increasingly going in separate directions.
Six months after her husband retired, Ms. Kaul is in high career, having entered the work force only 14 years ago, once her two children became teen-agers. She is even expanding her domain, looking into using retail stores as small, makeshift art galleries for Minnesota painters. Actually, her work as the art gallery director at Bemidji State University, 100 miles north of Minneapolis, where her husband, Marlin, had taught for 30 years, is a part-time job. But Ms. Kaul has five part-time jobs, most of them as a paid consultant to various art councils and art projects in Minnesota.
"I am in the process of proposing to the university a larger position for myself," she said. "It will probably be three-quarters time. I am suggesting that we start a museum program, to manage art collections and curate them for traveling exhibitions."
Still, the Kauls do not have to rely on her income. Marlin Kaul's sweetened pension -- a lump-sum payment and $40,000 a year -- is enough for them to live comfortably. The $15,000 she brings home helps, of course, but her decision to keep working separates the Kauls from three couples who are their friends. The men, also professors at Bemidji, accepted sweetened pensions, too, and their wives have decided to retire with them. All three women had worked much longer than Ms. Kaul.
"Two of them were in teaching careers," Ms. Kaul said, "and they no longer like their jobs enough to keep doing them anymore now that their husbands are retiring."
The decision also swings the other way. And when it does, a wife who continues to work sometimes ends up on Rosalind Barnett's couch. Ms. Barnett, a psychologist and senior researcher in women's issues at Brandeis University and Radcliffe College, recounts one patient's story:
"Her husband, a lawyer who never liked what he did, lived for the day he could move to the woods in New Hampshire, and this was a nightmare for her," Ms. Barnett said. "She was the director of a nonprofit organization, involved in work and community life, with a big network of people around her, and he wanted to retire to a rural life style."
In the end, the husband did not retire. "He cut back his hours," Ms. Barnett said, "but he is still working as a lawyer. He is very unhappy."
EVEN husbands who support their wives' decisions to keep working can take awhile to get there, as Dominic Genovese did.
He had never cooked, and for five years after he retired he stayed out of the kitchen, which meant that his wife could not relax until she had prepared dinner. "The stress for me did not end with the job," she said. And the dinner hour became later and later. "That ticked me off," Mr. Genovese said, "But cooking is something I did not think of doing. I made the bed; that took only a few minutes. And I vacuumed; I did not want to be home with dog's hair around."
A life-threatening stomach ailment changed his attitude toward cooking, he said -- as did the fact that the couple's three adult sons cook. He now makes dinner four nights a week.
Howard Aronoff, 57, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., also cooks. His mother had taught him, and in retirement, he took over that task from his wife, although she still does the grocery shopping. Unlike Mr. Genovese, Mr. Aronoff did not willingly retire: he took a buyout in 1993 from I.B.M., where he was a senior planner, rather than risk being laid off without any payment. After briefly trying a new career as an insurance salesman, "I drifted into retirement," Mr. Aronoff said. "When people found out I was no longer at I.B.M., they looked on me as a piece of dead wood."
Her husband's changed status scared his wife, Roberta, who is 53. His earnings suddenly deflated from more than $80,000 a year to a $35,000 pension even as the couple, who were nearly finished paying for their two children's undergraduate education, were counting on the next five years to save for retirement. So she has continued in her nearly $30,000-a-year job as the manager of a dental office, a position she had held for a decade.
"You have to sit down and work out the money issues," she said. "My husband did that. He showed me, with spreadsheets, how we would get by, and that eased my mind. He found a way even to save a little."
The new budget meant belt-tightening. They bought a new car for her, for example, but he still drives a 1988 model. And their daughter, now at Harvard Law School, pays her own way. "My wife would have liked some new jewelry," he said, "and I would have liked to help my children more."
Sometimes a husband chooses retirement because changes at work suddenly make the job much more difficult. William Cambron found himself in this situation in 1985, when he was 62. For years, he had been a salesman for a wholesale company that offered a line of toasters and household wares to hardware stores. As those stores lost out to big discounters like Sam's Club, the Wal-Mart unit, Mr. Cambron had to travel farther from the couple's home in Sacramento.
"They kept widening his territory as the market dwindled, and he was tired," Ms. Cambron said. And so he stopped. "He does not have a need to work. Basically, he enjoys supporting me in what I do. He even keeps my car filled with gas. I never have to do that anymore."
When her husband retired, Ms. Cambron, a year younger, was only a decade into a career as a health care specialist in the California Department for the Aging. That job paid her $50,000 a year when she retired two years ago and shifted to a job monitoring nursing homes for a nonprofit organization, earning just $7,000 but working far fewer hours. Being older than 70, she is permitted to draw her full Social Security and a California state pension. They total $37,000, exceeding her husband's retirement payments by $7,000, even as she still draws a paycheck.
"I would not be well off," she said, "if I had not continued working."

"The Rewards of Working a Little Longer"
A few extra years of work can substantially increase a woman's monthly Social Security benefits. For example, a woman who started working in 1981 at age 45 and is earning $30,000 annually at the time she retires could double her benefit by working to age 70. Chart shows increase in benefits.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Even if Gambling Wanes, Hilton May Be Worth a Bet

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
IN a week that was less than kind to many stocks, Hilton Hotels, which surprised analysts with an unexpectedly low earnings forecast because of weakness in its gambling operations, was hit harder than most.
In falling, Hilton's stock was catching up to a broad decline in the gambling business -- one that put Timothy Ryan, dean of the University of New Orleans College of Business and an authority on the economics of gambling, in mind to recall a student's paper: If Houston continued growing at its present rate, the student wrote, it would soon be bigger than Texas. 
 "That sounds like some of those projections we used to hear about legalized gambling," Professor Ryan said.
While the push for legalized gambling remains strong in cities that are looking to create jobs and generate tax revenue, industry watchers have increasingly begun to utter the dreaded "S" (for "saturation") word. And indeed, pure gambling stocks in general are lower for the year -- a strikingly bad performance against the overall market's gains.
Saturation does not seem to worry Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who confirmed nine days ago that his administration was thinking about where to build a casino, possibly including Governors Island in New York Harbor.
Nonetheless, the word is likely to be heard more often, after a 13.8 percent drop this week in Hilton's stock, which closed on Friday at $26.9375.
Late last Monday, Hilton projected that its fourth-quarter operating earnings per share would be in the mid-to-high 20-cent range, well below the 37 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by First Call.
Still, most analysts continue to recommend Hilton stock, largely on the strength of its hotel operations.
On that basis, Jason N. Ader, senior managing director at Bear, Stearns, calls Hilton "attractive." But he warns that in gambling, Hilton had a lot of catching up to do to rank with such first-tier casino-resort companies as Mirage Resorts and M-G-M Grand -- and to stay competitive in Las Vegas, Nev.
"If you're here for a convention, you'll stay at Hilton," Mr. Ader said -- in a telephone conversation from the Las Vegas Hilton, adjacent to the city convention center. "But you don't get the entertainment or excitement that draws visitors and walk-in traffic to the casinos."
Nevertheless, Mr. Ader noted that Stephen F. Bollenbach, Hilton's president and chief executive since February 1996, "has a history of creating value." Therefore, Mr. Ader added, "I suspect you'll see a major stock repurchase over the next 12 months, if the shares stay at this level."
Dennis I. Forst, a gaming analyst with McDonald & Company Investments, has an "aggressive buy" posted for Hilton stock, which he said was "very cheap." He noted that the company was doing well at its Hilton and Bally's properties in Atlantic City. "And Steve Bollenbach hasn't yet been there very long," he added.
Mr. Forst estimates that Hilton's 1997 revenue will be almost evenly split between its lodging and gambling operations, with $2.75 billion from lodging and $2.6 billion from gaming.
Naomi Talish, gaming analyst for Merrill Lynch Global Securities, was surprised by the timing of Hilton's announcement. "Some of the problems Hilton cited didn't just happen; they were known a couple of months ago," she said.
Furthermore, "very rarely will a big casino company make a pre-announcement of the fourth quarter when about a third of fourth-quarter earnings come in the last eight hours of the year," Ms. Talish said, referring to the hoards that jam Las Vegas for New Year's Eve. Those hours, she said, could mean as much as 5 cents either way for the quarter.
Andrew Zarnett, a gambling industry analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann, acknowledged that "a lot of small events have caused people to be more wary" of gambling stocks.
One problem is the growth in hotel rooms in Las Vegas, which now has 104,000, combined with fewer airplane seats to the city because airlines have deployed many larger planes to routes with more high-fare business passengers. But the situation should come back into balance next year, Mr. Zarnett said, with the opening of 26 new gates at Las Vegas's McCarran International Airport.
Meantime, he said, "While there clearly is concern in the market, that's when you want to buy, not when everything's rosy."
Hilton's disappointing earnings projections are related in part to a charge of about 5 cents a share from its unsuccessful attempt to take over the ITT Corporation. It will also write off about 20 cents a share for its Flamingo Casino in Kansas City, Mo., a highly competitive and tightly regulated market, and 5 cents a share for its Flamingo riverboat casino in New Orleans, which shut down two-and-a-half months ago.
While Hilton has not enunciated a grand strategy in the wake of its assault on ITT, it has acknowledged the possibility of a stock buyback and has made no secret that it will continue to look for acquisitions.
Still, Professor Ryan foresees problems throughout the gambling industry.
"Show me any product, and I'll show you a life cycle," he said, pointing to the recent explosion of casinos on riverboats and Indian reservations. While it takes years for many industries to develop, he said, legalized gambling "compressed it into 8 to 10 years."
That helped satisfy pent-up demand and created new customers, but it eventually bred disillusionment when customers realized they were far more likely to lose than to win -- and then cut back on visits or wagers. That has put a damper on growth, Professor Ryan said, at a time when the market is becoming saturated with casinos.

Scenes from the Malls: Megastores and Mini-Bazaars

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Those who consider Atlantic Center, the 380,000-square-foot Atlantic Avenue shopping mall, a leisure destination would do well to read the code of conduct posted near each entrance.
"Juvenile groups of four (4) or more will be dispersed," warns the code, which is reinforced by roving security guards. "Customers must keep moving in an orderly fashion. "Seating benches are to be used for shopping breaks not to exceed 15 minutes." 
 From its rules to its architecture -- three floors with 11 megastores separated by long narrow hallways, with few benches for those 15-minute breaks -- this safe, sanitized "power mall," as some have dubbed it, clearly means business.
A year after it opened, it is also doing big business. David Roberts, the human resources manager for Old Navy, said the store, the first Old Navy in Brooklyn, had $18 million in annual sales, placing it second among the chain's 263 stores.
The center's construction by Forest City Ratner on a long-vacant site had some smaller local businesses worried that they would be squashed by the "big box" stores' size and pricing. If anything, the opposite has proved true, said Rick Russo, the executive director of the North Flatbush Business Improvement District. "There's increased pedestrian traffic" on Flatbush Avenue, he said, "and increased sales."
Henry Rosa, the manager at Triangle Sports, which had quaked at the arrival of the much larger Sports Authority, agreed. The store had "more traffic than ever before," he said.
But Ruben Demesa, the manager at Furniture House on Flatbush Avenue, said that to compete with Caldor's lower prices, his store had begun offering assembly and other services that Caldor's does not.
On the Fulton Mall, Phil Hodges, the manager of Modell's, said business was not so strong as in the past, but he did not know if that was the center's fault. "Retail is flat in general," he said.
Residents of a borough routinely described as "understored" have taken full advantage of the center. Rachel Nash takes two buses once a week from Crown Heights to shop at Pathmark, "because it's cheaper" than her neighborhood stores, she said.
Not all is rosy, of course. While an unscientific survey of shoppers found that many had arrived by public transportation, plenty still drive, contributing to the entrenched gridlock at the intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. And some store managers, who would not speak for attribution, said sales were weaker than during last year's pre-Christmas season.
The mall has provided around 1,500 jobs, many to Brooklyn residents. But Brad Lander, the executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, a community group, criticized the jobs' nature. "Local people are being hired in part-time, minimum-wage, no-benefit, no-union jobs," he said. "That's not a good economic development for the city." AMY WALDMAN

HEADLINE: AT THE GATE;
Hoping to Follow In Others' Tread Marks

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
IT a time when demand for new stock offerings is waning, the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group nonetheless has high hopes.
Next week, the company, which consists of two car-rental businesses owned by Chrysler, is expected to sell 22.5 million shares at $19 to $22 each. Chrysler is selling off the entire operation and will keep all but $45.9 million of the expected $460 million in proceeds. 
 The reason that Dollar Thrifty is hopeful is the strong stock performance of two competitors that preceded it into the public market this year.
Since it went public in April, Hertz has seen its stock rise about 66 percent. And the stock of Avis, which went public in September, has nearly doubled.
Many of the forces that have propelled these stocks should benefit the two Chrysler businesses, Dollar Rent A Car Systems and Thrifty Rent-a-Car System. For one, they are the last car-rental companies to be spun off by an auto manufacturer. Once freed from the auto makers, which often used them as a dumping ground for their vast fleets of cars, the rental operations have been better able to pursue profitability, raise rental fees and keep the size of their fleets relatively stable, said J. Cogan, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
Also, the industry's small number of companies is partly shielded from competition by the high cost of assembling large car fleets, said Mark Basham, a research analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Because of persistent economic optimism, car travel in general is growing, too. Despite rising air fares, hotel rates and other travel-related costs, for instance, auto travel during the holiday season is expected to be 4 percent higher this year than in 1996, according to the American Automobile Association.
That growth and the rental companies' new independence have allowed the industry to raise prices for the first time in more than five years, and all these factors are showing up in revenues. According to Auto Rental News, a trade publication, industry revenue is expected to rise 11.8 percent this year, to $16.4 billion.
And the price increases may stick. "Leisure travelers are more concerned about airline costs than rental car costs," Mr. Cogan said. "You're not going to cancel a trip to Hawaii because the rental car rate went up 5 percent."
Dollar Thrifty has been buoyed by these rising sales and price increases. The company had a net profit of $24.2 million for the first nine months of 1997, compared with $13.6 million for the corresponding period in 1996, exclusive of a $155 million one-time charge related to its spinoff from Chrysler.
But an investment in Dollar Thrifty has risks. With total revenues of $705.6 million last year, or about 5 percent of the industry's sales, the two Chrysler operations combined rank as only the seventh-largest rental company. The three biggest -- and better known -- competitors are Enterprise, with $3.1 billion in 1996 domestic revenues; Hertz, with $2.7 billion, and Avis, with $1.8 billion.
Moreover, instead of focusing on bread-and-butter business travel, Dollar Thrifty looks at the leisure market. This may put Dollar Thrifty at great risk in a faltering economy.
True, all rental-car companies are vulnerable to an economic slowdown. "If growth were to slow, these companies could see their profits erode quickly," said Ryan Jacob, research director at IPO Value Monitor, a New York research firm. A price war prompted by the slowdown could further erode profits, he added.
But leisure travel, financed by personal dollars and basically discretionary, is much more cyclical than business travel, Mr. Jacob said.
Debt is another danger point. Like the rest of the industry, Dollar Thrifty carries large debts to finance its fleet. Its ratio of debt to total capitalization is 85.5 percent, for example, and Hertz's is 82.1 percent.
Such debts can squeeze profits in tough times. In its prospectus, Dollar Thrifty says it must sustain its improved performance this year to meet its debt service obligations using operating cash flow.
FOR investors, then, Dollar Thrifty, with both significant strengths and significant risks, poses a hard question. But its stock price may tip the balance.
At the midpoint of its offering range, Dollar Thrifty stock would trade at about 25 times its estimated 1997 earnings per share. Hertz and Avis are trading at about 22 times and 27 times 1997 earnings, respectively. As for 1998 projections, Dollar Thrifty looks slightly cheaper, with a multiple of 16 compared with 19 for Hertz and 21 for Avis.
But new stocks often have a modest discount to those of competitors who are already public. And anyway, Mr. Jacob said, all these price-earnings ratios are just too lofty.
Mr. Jacob conceded that the fundamentals of the car-rental industry "are the best they've looked in a long time." But "given the cyclical nature of the rental-car industry" and its high costs, "20 times earnings is a high multiple," he said.
Thomas Galvin, chief equity strategist with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, agreed, and said that multiples between 12 and 15 seem more reasonable for the industry. He said airlines and hotels, two other cyclical, travel-related businesses, are good comparisons, and that when averaged together, these industries' stocks trade in that range.

EVEN today, when he is in legal trouble on three continents and fighting for his financial life in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore, Gooch Ware Travelstead, an alternately charming and blustery real estate developer, is described by his few remaining friends and his many enemies as a "visionary."
As a consultant from a tiny design firm in North Carolina, Mr. Travelstead persuaded the First Boston Corporation to place him at the helm of its worldwide real estate operation in the boom years of the 1980's and eventually lend him at least $37 million to share in its deals. He conceived the plan to transform the decaying Docklands of London into Canary Wharf, the biggest real estate project in Europe. He tried to erect the tallest building in the world on Madison Avenue -- while also finding time to take on a sprawling hotel, office and retail project in Barcelona, Spain, tied to the 1992 Olympics. 
Yet all of these relationships and projects ran into difficulties or foundered -- and Mr. Travelstead's career is strewn with partners, friends and investors whose admiration for the developer ultimately turned into bitter recriminations and tangled lawsuits. Even so, just two years ago the local press still hailed Mr. Travelstead as the "Lord of Broome" when he swooped into that town in Western Australia to try to save one of the country's largest landholding companies.
Now, Mr. Travelstead, who is known as Ware, seems to be coming to a dead end.
He is scheduled to appear in Barcelona tomorrow to answer criminal charges of misappropriation brought by a partner in a Planet Hollywood franchise at the hotel complex.
And on Thursday, he has a date in Baltimore in the bankruptcy case. Among other things, he will be asking the court to protect him from foreclosure on $3.8 million in loans he took from his Australian property company. A foreclosure would strip the developer of the Australian property -- which all sides say is the most valuable asset left in what he once called a $100 million empire.
This is an extraordinary denouement for a man who regularly shuttled to Europe on the Concorde, had homes in Barcelona, Connecticut, London, New York and North Carolina and counted among his friends and associates Fred Wilpon, a developer and an owner of the New York Mets; Joseph R. Perella, the merger superstar; Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of the Interior, and even Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of Britain.
But more than just a Hollywood-caliber saga of personal highs and lows, Mr. Travelstead's story serves as a cautionary tale for the real estate industry, which emerged only last year from a recession that began in the early 90's. The real estate market is again crackling with billions in cash, even as some observers warn that buyers are overpaying in a frenzied atmosphere, just as in the 1980's, when Mr. Travelstead was at his peak. Indeed, his success during the last boom has some people in the industry wondering just how many of the new generation of visionaries, and their fantastic plans, will turn out to be the real thing.
"There's an unprecedented amount of money flowing from Wall Street into real estate," said David S. Cordish, a fellow developer who was a crosstown rival of Mr. Travelstead's in high school lacrosse in Baltimore. "People are going to get burned, and stuff that shouldn't get built will get built. Developers -- and Ware is the personification of this -- always see the brightest scenario. He painted with a big brush on a big canvas."
Those bright pictures Mr. Travelstead so cannily painted for investors and bankers consumed enormous sums of money. That left some of his partners and investors howling. Among them was Sogo, the Japanese department store company that saw the cost of the Barcelona project that it was backing soar to more than $800 million from the projected $230 million.
"Ware is the most fascinating person I've ever met," said Richard L. Fisher, whose family real estate empire includes some of New York's major office towers. "His visions were fantastic and almost always proved to be pure fantasy, ultimately destructive to all those around him. There will always be so-called visionaries whose dreams so far exceed their capabilities that often the difference between them and charlatans is hard to discern."
DESPITE all his legal troubles, Mr. Travelstead seems unbowed. During a brief encounter in Baltimore in September, he treated the bankruptcy proceedings as a minor irritant, telling a reporter, "This won't last long."
For several weeks, neither Mr. Travelstead nor his lawyers responded to phone calls requesting an interview about the bankruptcy case and other matters. Last Wednesday, his lawyers, while declining to discuss any details, nevertheless said that Mr. Travelstead "refutes his adversaries' allegations." On Friday, his lawyers for the first time suggested that Mr. Travelstead would be available for an interview, sometime this coming week.
In court, his lawyers have denied all allegations of misconduct, including what one lawyer called "the drumbeat of charges" lodged by creditors.
Patrick J. B. Donnelly, a Baltimore lawyer and longtime friend who sometimes represents Mr. Travelstead, noted that "a lot of people made money with Ware" over the years. Others in the developer's circle added that many of his troubles were a result of unforeseen problems that occurred in the course of building what one described as "gigantic visionary projects" that ultimately changed the face of Barcelona and London. They also disputed the validity of many of the allegations in the lawsuits.
"These are things being done for business purposes," said Martin Kabat, a financial director of one of Mr. Travelstead's companies and a defendant in the Barcelona case, referring to the lawsuits.
Still, Mr. Travelstead's situation looks dire. The developer, who is 59 and lives in Barcelona with his third wife, Cheryl Stone, is facing two important hearings this week in Baltimore. At the first, he will be trying to fend off the foreclosure threatening his Australia operations.
The outcome of that hearing could well affect the subject of the second hearing: the degree of control he should retain over the sale of his other assets to satisfy creditors. A committee representing that group -- which includes his former wife Edythe, some of his ex-lawyers, a former partner and associate at First Boston and his ex-bookkeeper -- has accused him of having "lied under oath" and hidden some of his assets. In court, his lawyers have said that any discrepancies were unintentional and have been clarified.
FEW people who know Mr. Travelstead -- including Edythe Travelstead and many current and former top executives at First Boston, the securities firm and investment bank that has merged with Credit Suisse -- are willing to say anything publicly about the developer, citing either distasteful memories or Mr. Travelstead's combativeness. The securities firm has also declined to comment other than to confirm that Mr. Travelstead had worked with it in the 80's.
Mr. Travelstead was a virtual unknown in 1978 when he met executives from First Boston at a trade conference in Chicago. Mr. Travelstead, a son of a building contractor from Baltimore, had already had a peripatetic career in sales and real estate. In 1973, he was a consultant to Richard Bass, a millionaire adventurer who owns the Snowbird ski resort in Utah (and is unrelated to the more well-known Bass brothers of Fort Worth). At one point, Mr. Travelstead flew to Teheran to try to persuade the Shah to invest in the resort. Nothing came of it and Mr. Travelstead and Mr. Bass eventually had a bitter falling out.
A failed attempt to buy a ski resort in Steamboat Springs, Colo., left him and Edythe, an interior designer, deeply in debt. They opened a design firm in North Carolina, but Mr. Travelstead still had grand plans.
Enter the bankers from First Boston, who hired him in 1978 to solve some lighting problems at the firm's newly leased headquarters at One New York Plaza, at the southern tip of Manhattan. Within days, Mr. Travelstead was proposing what was then a daring alternative for an investment bank: moving away from the financial district to a planned tower in midtown, Park Avenue Plaza.
He negotiated a lease at below-market rates with the developer, Mr. Fisher of Fisher Brothers, and got an equity stake in the tower while arranging for a $104 million construction loan. At the same time, Mr. Travelstead sold the lease at One New York Plaza for a quick $7 million profit. This allowed First Boston, which was having a bad year, to avoid reporting its first loss ever. George L. Shinn, then the chairman of First Boston, and Peter T. Buchanan, who was its president, were, in the words of several investment bankers, "eternally grateful."
One senior executive at the firm who spoke on condition of anonymity said: "It was a rather spectacular deal. We got a great office and made a lot of money. It sparked our interest in real estate and showed he had certain talents."
Indeed, First Boston soon became the first investment bank to invest heavily in real estate projects, a path that others soon followed. Heading up the new operation was Mr. Travelstead, who had worked out an unusual relationship. Instead of signing on as an employee, he acted as a partner, seeking out real estate deals in which First Boston would invest for itself as well as lend him money for his own interest.
Armed with the prestige and clout of First Boston, Mr. Travelstead was suddenly everywhere, a welcome partner with well-known developers, like Mr. Wilpon, at 575 Fifth Avenue, an office tower in New York's diamond district. Mr. Travelstead seemed to have the golden touch, though his plan to transform the south end of Miami Beach into the "Venice of the South" ended in a legal battle with city officials over financing. His strength was in the vision, former associates say, not the details.
He sold his and First Boston's stake in 712 Fifth Avenue, across the street from Manhattan's Trump Tower, to the developers David Solomon and A. Alfred Taubman for a healthy profit even before the building was finished. Mr. Travelstead and First Boston then teamed up with Mr. Solomon to build Tower 49, at 12 East 49th Street, where Mr. Travelstead opened an office for his own company, the Travelstead Group. That building was sold in 1986 to a Japanese company for $305 million, or $550 a square foot, still the highest per-foot price ever paid for a New York office tower.
As fast as the profits poured in, Mr. Travelstead acquired the opulent trappings so characteristic of an era that raised deal makers in real estate and on Wall Street to the level of cultural icons. He had a triplex on Park Avenue in Manhattan, a mansion in Greenwich, Conn., a yacht and limousines. Fond of the grand gesture, he picked up the tab for luxurious vacations in Barbados, Sardinia and Venice with a group of close friends, including Mr. Perella, who went on from First Boston to form his own firm with Bruce Wasserstein and is now with Morgan Stanley.
"In those days, First Boston seemed to pretty much give Ware carte blanche," a former First Boston executive said. "He was moving up. The merger boom brought First Boston to prominence. And he and Perella were always the best of friends."
Mr. Perella declined to comment about his friendship with Mr. Travelstead, a relationship that ended in a falling out in 1990, say a number of people who knew both men.
While many wealthy investors found Mr. Travelstead to be charming and brilliant, he could also be an explosive bully, according to many former colleagues, screaming at subordinates and associates alike and using his imposing frame in a calculated effort at intimidation. Mr. Travelstead's brother, Malcolm, a banker who has worked with him in the past, testified during one of Mr. Travelstead's lawsuits that he "was not a person who likes to be confronted."
Colorful myths have swirled about Mr. Travelstead, some apparently of his own creation. According to friends and associates, he has frequently claimed to be a co-owner of the Mets, and earlier this year he even testified to that effect in a deposition. The Mets organization, however, says the developer never owned a share of the team, though it is suing him for nonpayment on his luxury skybox. He denies owing any back payments.
Mr. Travelstead is best known for the project that would consume him for more than two years -- Canary Wharf. In 1985, Michael von Clemm, chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., then the European cousin of the First Boston Corporation, was considering leasing space in a banana warehouse in London's Docklands. But where Mr. von Clemm saw cheap space on a dilapidated pier, his American adviser, Mr. Travelstead, saw what other developers would not have imagined: a vast $4 billion office complex on 71 acres that could become the new headquarters for London's financial district. He persuaded First Boston, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley to put up the money for the mega-project, while he retained a 16 percent interest for putting together the deal.
Yet Mr. Travelstead's much-vaunted sales skills abandoned him when it came time to sign up tenants. "The Brits are scared of scale," he said to a reporter at the time. "Size is something they just don't deal with very well."
The project's enormity is what eventually prompted a skittish Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse to begin pulling out of the venture in 1987. Mr. Travelstead floundered as he tried to line up tenants and new partners who would not push him aside. Mr. Buchanan, his patron at First Boston, then opened negotiations with Paul Reichmann of Olympia & York that resulted in the Canadian developer's taking over the project. Mr. Travelstead collected an estimated $8.5 million for his stake and his fees. Although Canary Wharf is considered a success today, the complex dragged Mr. Reichmann's company into bankruptcy in 1992.
AFTER the Canary Wharf escapade and the crash of the stock market in October 1987, First Boston wanted out of the once-rewarding real estate market and its arrangement with Mr. Travelstead.
The firm made money at the beginning of the relationship and lost money at the end, said a former managing director at First Boston. "My guess is that the losses exceeded the gains," he said.
Nowhere is that more evident than at 383 Madison Avenue, the block-square former Manhattan Savings Bank building near Grand Central Terminal that Mr. Travelstead and First Boston bought for $80.5 million in 1982 with Arab partners. Mr. Travelstead had boldly declared that he would build a 140-story tower on the site, using development rights from the terminal. But the quixotic vision for the tallest building in the world would turn into a loss of tens of millions of dollars, as a court battle with the city over transfer of the rights dragged on for nearly a decade.
Even after his 1988 divorce from First Boston, Mr. Travelstead controlled the project, refusing to sell the site to Mr. Fisher for $215 million, much to the outrage of two top First Boston executives, Jeffrey Parker and Robert Razziano, according to internal First Boston documents. First Boston finally shed Mr. Travelstead from the project in 1992 and sold the building four years later to the Arab partners for $55 million. The building still sits vacant, although the Bear Stearns Companies plans to erect its new headquarters on the site.
Frustrated in New York or London, Mr. Travelstead turned in 1988 to Barcelona. Eduardo Canet, a former First Boston executive who had jumped to Mr. Travelstead's company and become a close friend, had been developing the hotel, office and retail complex there. Mr. Travelstead eventually shoved Mr. Canet aside and took over, according to a court decision in a lawsuit brought by Mr. Canet. After initially having trouble raising capital, Mr. Travelstead found Sogo, the Japanese department store company, which was willing to put up all the money for the project and give him a 50 percent stake. Sogo was less interested in the centerpiece of the project -- the 44-story Hotel Arts, billed as the finest in Europe -- as it was in finding the right spot for its first department store on the Continent.
ALTHOUGH Mr. Travelstead hired top architects, the project careered out of control and, except for a few hotel rooms, did not open in time for the Olympics. Sogo ended its partnership with Mr. Travelstead in 1993 and later sued him in United States District Court in Manhattan, accusing him of mismanagement and fraud. (Mr. Travelstead denied the contentions.)
But Sogo dropped the suit the next year after Mr. Travelstead flew to Tokyo to talk to company executives, according to court documents in a related case. In an about-face, Sogo, which declined to discuss its relationship with Mr. Travelstead, granted the developer options to buy the 29 luxury apartments in the Hotel Arts while also lending him $3 million. Sogo also invested in the local Planet Hollywood franchise. The company's department store in the complex failed in 1996.
(Only much later did Mr. Travelstead's other partner at Planet Hollywood, Raymond Velazquez, a former special agent with the Justice Department, learn that the developer had secretly granted Sogo a 35 percent interest, thereby reducing Mr. Velazquez's stake to 32.5 percent, from 50 percent, according to papers in the lawsuit he filed earlier this year in Federal Court in Miami against Sogo and the Travelstead Group. In that suit, Mr. Velazquez contended that Sogo and Mr. Travelstead conspired to defraud him as part of a scheme to avoid millions of dollars in American tax liabilities, accusations that both parties deny. As the Miami suit continues, Mr. Velazquez has opened up another front by bringing the criminal charges in Barcelona.)
After settling his dispute with Sogo, Mr. Travelstead planned a gala party in Barcelona for Christmas 1994 to market the apartments, using Lady Thatcher as a drawing card. Mr. Travelstead met Lady Thatcher in London during his association with the Canary Wharf project. He prevailed on a mutual friend, Lord Alistair McAlpine, whose family owned a construction company that served as a general contractor at Canary Wharf, to persuade the former Prime Minister to take an all-expenses-paid holiday in Barcelona.
Mr. Travelstead provided the same amenities to Jack Demorest, an independent investor who had given Mr. Travelstead $500,000 the year before to be put into a Travelstead company that would buy and sell the Hotel Arts apartments.
Mr. Demorest said in an interview that he was "swept off his feet" by the first-class treatment and the opportunity to meet Lady Thatcher. During a weeklong stay, Mr. Demorest said, Mr. Travelstead urged him to leave his $500,000 in the company, which would quickly sell them at a big profit to Lady Thatcher, Lord McAlpine and others. No such purchases or sales ever occurred.
Nor did Mr. Travelstead repay the money. So Mr. Demorest sued in Federal Court in New York in May 1995. Eight days later, Mr. Demorest said, he was repaid and settled the case.
By then, Mr. Travelstead was already in Western Australia. In partnership with Lord McAlpine and Karen Dobson, a former First Boston executive who had worked with Mr. Travelstead in Barcelona, he bought control of Australia City Properties, a struggling real estate company owned by the McAlpine family. The company's large portfolio, which included the luxurious Cable Beach Club Resort in Broome and the valuable Bishops See development site in Perth, had about $160 million in debts. Mr. Travelstead was able to gain control for about $38.8 million, putting up a small amount himself and financing most of the rest with bank loans.
He basked in the press coverage, telling reporters he would invest as much as $380 million to create new luxury developments.
IT was a brilliant deal -- that is, until he borrowed $3.8 million in two loans from the Australian operation, which was owned by Blockless, a company formed by Mr. Travelstead and Ms. Hobson and registered in the Netherlands.
Under financial pressure in early 1996, Mr. Travelstead, as the majority shareholder of Blockless, tried to extend for one year the short-term loans to himself. He needed the money to pay back $5 million he had borrowed from Planet Hollywood in Barcelona, he said in depositions. Ms. Hobson blocked him, however, and the two have been wrestling for control of Blockless ever since.
"Mr. Travelstead had now systematically cleaned out Blockless's bank account," Ms. Hobson testified in a deposition in a related hearing in Bankruptcy Court.
Mr. Travelstead's problems were compounded in February 1996 when Mr. Canet, who had been pushed aside in Barcelona, won a case in Federal Court in Brooklyn against Mr. Travelstead, entitling him to a share of the profits in a number of deals they had been in together over the years. (Earlier this year, he was awarded $3.15 million. Mr. Travelstead is appealing.)
Mr. Travelstead was hit with another stinging financial defeat a month later. This one grew out of the $3.2 million purchase of a 544-acre farm on the eastern shore of Maryland and a separate purchase of a house nearby, both in 1995. As part of the first deal, he gave a second mortgage for $570,000 to Timothy E. Wyman, a private investor. Mr. Wyman obtained a $1.2 million judgment and began foreclosure proceedings in May 1996 against Mr. Travelstead after he failed to repay the second mortgage.
Just days later, Mr. Travelstead filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Although the $58.7 million in assets that he listed far exceeded his $9.8 million in debts, he needed protection, he said, because the bulk of those assets could not easily be sold. Chapter 11, he contended, would give him the time he needed to arrange an orderly sale to satisfy the claims against him.
But Mr. Travelstead's financial activities were hard to track, since he initially failed to open a debtor's bank account and he said he had neither a checking account nor a credit card because his company paid all his expenses. Creditors became increasingly nervous as he filed a series of constantly evolving accounts of both the nature and the value of his holdings.
Karen Moore, the assistant United States trustee who is functioning as an impartial overseer in the bankruptcy matter, filed a motion last February to convert the case to a Chapter 7 liquidation. Ms. Moore said she had concluded that Mr. Travelstead had failed to provide "any credible financial information whatsoever." Under a Chapter 7 liquidation, a trustee would take control of all of Mr. Travelstead's holdings for eventual sale.
But in September, without issuing an explanation, Ms. Moore abruptly changed direction, agreeing to a settlement proposed by Mr. Travelstead's lawyers. The settlement stopped short of a liquidation, although it did provide for the appointment, under Chapter 11, of a so-called liquidating agent. The agent would manage the sale of assets, but only those assets that Mr. Travelstead has listed with the Bankruptcy Court.
The decision stunned the creditors committee, which included Mr. Canet; Virginia Kowalsky, Mr. Travelstead's former bookkeeper, and, until recently, Edythe Travelstead, who voluntarily withdrew. The lawyer for the committee contended in court that Mr. Travelstead's filings and testimony continued to be littered with false and misleading statements.
Mr. Travelstead had maintained, for example, that his company owned stock in a large ranch controlled by the family of Mr. Babbitt, the Interior Secretary. If the company owns the stock, it will not be part of the bankruptcy case. The stock certificates, however, are in Mr. Travelstead's name and dividends are paid to him individually. A spokesman for Mr. Babbitt said last week that he had sold his interest in the ranch to Mr. Travelstead -- describing him as "an old family friend" -- after joining the Clinton Administration.
Now, as this week's hearings approach, the issue for the creditors is whether they stand a better chance of getting paid by accepting the compromise Chapter 11 plan or by continuing to battle for a Chapter 7 liquidation. By most accounts, only the Australian properties could generate enough money to satisfy all the claims, which is what makes the hearing on the foreclosure so important. If the Bankruptcy Court decides that it does not have jurisdiction in that matter, and thus cannot forestall a foreclosure, the creditors may have lost their best shot, perhaps making a move to Chapter 7 inevitable.
Whatever happens, Mr. Travelstead appears to have given up on the international real estate game. He is not known to have any new projects. In a recent deposition, he said he was "semi-retired."
Mr. Cordish, Mr. Travelstead's childhood chum and a Baltimore-based developer who has built 33 profitable projects, says the two men have taken very different paths since their early days.
"Ware's projects are special and, ultimately, successful," he said. "I don't mean for the developer or his partners, or maybe even for the next guy in. But London today is better off with Canary Wharf, and the Barcelona project is a clear winner."
Mr. Velazquez takes a darker view.
"When I met Travelstead, he was the most charming, most intelligent individual I ever met," he said. "It turned out that of all the con men I have dealt with in my life, he is the most cunning and ruthless."

HEADLINE: The Germ Warfare Threat

 BODY:
Though the crisis over Iraq's biological weapons has eased for the moment, Americans should not be complacent about the dangers of germ warfare. The threat that a lethal bacterium or toxin might be used on the battlefield or in a terrorist attack is real. The United States, from the Pentagon to local police departments, is not yet adequately prepared to deal with the danger.
It is relatively easy and inexpensive to produce biological agents like anthrax or plague, and not hard to conceal them. All it takes is a pharmaceutical plant, or a brewery. Many of the world's rogue regimes, including those in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and North Korea, are working on such weapons, as are terrorist groups. 
 For aggression-minded countries or terrorists, biological weapons can seem an appealing way to offset America's overwhelming nuclear, conventional and economic power. No hostile country has yet perfected reliable means of delivering these weapons to the United States and known incidents of biological terrorism have been rare. Still, a determined country could launch a biological attack on its neighbors using missiles, artillery or aircraft mounted with spraying tanks. Terrorists could use trucks or aerosol canisters or target vulnerable food supplies. Washington and local governments across America still have much to learn about preventing or coping with such an attack.
An international convention bans the development, production, transfer and stockpiling of biological weapons. Unfortunately, the agreement lacks reliable verification or enforcement provisions, a problem the Clinton Administration is now trying to fix. But even that will not stop countries like Iraq from pursuing programs in secret, using home-grown ingredients and shutting international inspectors out of sensitive locations.
The Clinton Administration's efforts to prepare for a biological attack have been spotty, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency poorly engaged but the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Centers for Disease Control providing some helpful assistance. The Pentagon, which has done more research and spending on biological protection than any other agency, needs to do a better job of sharing its expertise and equipment with local civilian authorities. In response to pressure last year from Senators Sam Nunn, Richard Lugar and Pete Domenici, it has now begun to do so.
Most consequences of biological weapons are treatable if detected and diagnosed quickly. That requires training in recognizing unusual symptoms under intense stress. New York, Washington, Atlanta and Indianapolis have begun serious preparations for responding to biological terrorism. Most other American cities have not.
An expert panel meets regularly with New York officials to identify needs. Outside trainers provided by the Pentagon have prepared 4,000 city police, fire and emergency workers to teach coworkers how to respond to biological attacks. New York also involves hotels, transit agencies, private security firms and hospital emergency rooms in its preparations and has plans for obtaining vaccines against common biological agents. Though New York is acquiring some field kits used by American military forces to detect and identify biological agents, the Pentagon has declined to provide the most sensitive models.
New York's program is one of America's most advanced. But even it needs improvement and fuller Federal cooperation. With the use of biological and chemical weapons more likely than nuclear attack, all levels of government must work harder to protect Americans from the terrifying dangers.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Giving Credit Where Debt Is Due

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
AS Frank Capra's mid-century holiday movie classic, "It's a Wonderful Life," crowds its way onto television screens, feel free to snicker at the moment when a desperate George Bailey screams at his negligent uncle for misplacing bank funds and threatening to plunge the family into debt.
"Where's that money?" he shouts. "Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal and prison!" 
 Scandal? Prison? How quaint. America, safe haven of the highly leveraged country and the highly leveraged corporation, is now home to the highly leveraged citizen. Debt is very, very cool.
 
Sub-Prime
Right now, consumers are firmly into debt overdrive as they pursue the annual rite of the holiday spending binge. Americans have even bestowed an affectionate new term on their credit cards: "mall money." That mall money is liberating, too. A recent survey of 1,000 consumers by the American Bankers Association found that two-thirds had no holiday spending plan, even though they typically end up taking about six months to pay off holiday debt. And these are not poor people. The same survey found that among those who were late with credit card payments, 44 percent earned more than $50,000 a year, while only 4 percent earned less than $15,000.
American consumers are carrying about $1.2 trillion in installment credit, up about 50 percent from just four years ago, and the average credit card holder has four cards and about $4,000 in high-interest debt. Nonetheless, lenders have begun to target the least creditworthy and most unsophisticated debtors-to-be, dubbing them "sub-prime" borrowers. Loan delinquencies are on the rise and personal bankruptcies continue to soar.
But hey, why worry? Even bankruptcy doesn't stop the solicitations from lenders.
Banks, which once upon a time emphasized savings and thrift, are now relentless marketers of debt -- or credit, to use the sanitized term favored by lenders. Billions of credit card solicitations compete for space in American mailboxes each year, with Banc One, MBNA, Citicorp, and Chase Manhattan jointly accounting for more than half of the volume.
Mortgages can be had for 125 percent of a house's market value, quite a repudiation of banks' traditional hesitation to lend no more than 80 percent against a home. Since late October, Fleet Financial Group has mailed more than one million blank checks in denominations ranging from $3,000 to $10,000, inviting borrowers to use the checks to pay taxes or "spruce up your home."
"What debt is doing is that it anesthetizes the purchasing process," said Stephen M. Pollan, a financial adviser and author of a new book, "Die Broke" (Harper Business). "Debt may be O.K. for a house or a car or an education, but for anything else you're an idiot. For a bottle of champagne or a new wardrobe you're going to go into debt? It's just instant gratification, a short-lived burst of fun, and it's not smart."
Debt is not the stigma it was for the generation that came of age during the Great Depression and World War II. So when did things change?
Cultural milestones are never easy to mark, but when it comes to consumer debt, Fresno, Calif., in September 1958 offers a likely one. Bank of America targeted Fresno for the first mass mailing of credit cards, as detailed by Joseph Nocera in "A Piece of the Action: How the Middle Class Joined the Money Class" (Simon & Schuster, 1994). Some 60,000 credit cards flooded the mailboxes of Fresno. A little more than a year later, two million credit cards were circulating around California.
"There had been no outward yearning among the residents of Fresno for such a device, nor even the dimmest awareness that such a thing was in the works," Mr. Nocera wrote. "Here began the trickle of what we now call financial products, aimed largely at the middle class, that would become, by the 1980's, an avalanche."
Still, in the 1960's most borrowers paid off their credit card balances monthly, as an aversion to financial risk born in the Depression held sway. It would take another decade and the arrival of runaway inflation to bring consumer debt into the mainstream.
"Credit cards were the enablers but inflation was the trigger," Mr. Nocera said in an interview. "People in the late 1970's started recognizing that it made sense to go into debt because of inflation."
America's trouble with debt is nothing new. After all, Georgia was founded as a debtors' colony, and Thomas Jefferson died a debtor after a lifetime of buying binges that would have made Imelda Marcos blush.
But for many years it was only an elite few like Jefferson who could take on inordinate debt as consumers. Farmers and other debtors largely borrowed in order to produce something. Puritans and Quakers regarded excessive personal debt as a sin, views that were widely and firmly held until relatively recently. In the 1800's, the end of the year did not entail holiday shopping sprees but was a time to pay off debts to begin the new year with a clean slate and a clean conscience.
"Debt was a horror in the 19th century," said Robert Sobel, a financial historian at Hofstra University. "Mortgages were much shorter in the 19th century, only about 10 years. Burning the mortgage was a big family event. Nowadays, people don't even think of mortgages as debt."
Of course, there weren't VCR's, Timberlands or Gap jeans to covet in the 19th and early 20th centuries. But once the emotional shock of the Depression subsided and the post-World War II consumer boom occurred, Americans were primed to take a new look at debt. All they needed were credit cards and a nudge from those burgeoning inflation rates.
 
Treading Water
Now the costs are adding up. The consumer debt spigot has been wide open for the past five years and some borrowers are beginning to tread water, despite the robust economy. Several credit card companies, including such rapidly growing issuers as Advanta, have taken a financial beating after coaxing risky borrowers with low introductory teaser rates. Charge-offs for bad credit card debt have risen sharply this year at Advanta and other big credit card issuers. And if the economy slows significantly, America's penchant for debt may take an even uglier turn.
"People think about money in a certain way until a cataclysm arrives that forces them to change," said Mr. Nocera, who added that it will probably take a sharp downturn in the economy before people think it wise to lighten their debt loads.
If this makes you queasy, just turn off "It's a Wonderful Life" and tune in the Lifetime cable channel. There, every weeknight, you'll find a game show called "Debt," which gives contestants the opportunity to win enough money to rid themselves of personal debt -- uh, credit.

HEADLINE: Persian Gulf;
Iran's Venture in Image Rehab

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TEHERAN

 BODY:
IT was a kind of coming-out party, with all eyes focused on Iran as it stepped forward after nearly two decades mostly shrouded from world view. What guests glimpsed at an international Islamic conference here was in some ways infuriatingly contradictory: a poised, gracious Iran eager to leave a good impression, but one also still burning with old resentments.
But then, ever since its rebirth in the 1979 revolution, Iran has been a far more complex creature than the one depicted in Western snapshots of fiery mullahs, subservient women and legions of martyrs. And if the gathering in Teheran last week was hardly an acknowledgment that the old view had been altogether mistaken, the huge turnout suggested a willingness to entertain the hope that Iran's coming of age may bring with it more maturity. Those looking for moderation could find evidence, or not. 
 There was the inaugural address by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, heir to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as the steward of revolution, with the usual tirade against Western influence. But then came more conciliatory remarks by the new President, Mohammed Khatami, whose calls for opening Iran to the outside world have given voice to a very different dimension of Iranian political thought. And while reiterating its opposition to the United States' policies toward Israel and military role in the Persian Gulf, Iran did not push those views on others, acting more statesmanlike than revolutionary.
 
The Dissident
Washington, of course, was not invited; had it been, it would have stayed away. Alone in the world, the United States remains intent on isolating Iran, regularly denouncing the clerical regime in terms that probably rank it second to Iraq in American demonology. But some of the symbolism on display in Teheran seemed to underscore a spreading view that Iran is not only too important to ignore, but is also perhaps a country with which others can do business.
From Saudi Arabia, which has shunned Iran as a most undesirable neighbor: a drapery from the door of the Holy Kaaba of Mecca -- a remarkable gift from the capital of Sunni Muslim orthodoxy to the rival Shiite Muslim regime that remains the world's only Islamic republic.
President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey, another ally of the West, exchanged embraces with Iranian clerics who regularly criticized his government for its secular orientation and its military ties with Israel. Even Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt -- on his visit to a city that has a street named after the militant Muslim Egyptian who assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat -- said the gathering had produced "some kind of improvement in ties" between his country and Iran.
Iran, for its part, has silenced its calls for an export of the Islamic revolution that toppled the Shah and sent shock waves across the Middle East. Mr. Khatami's stunning victory last May over a candidate supported by the religious establishment showed how far democracy has come. And while Ayatollah Khamenei is still the supreme leader in what remains a mullahcracy, the support that 69 percent of Iranians gave to Mr. Khatami shows the urbane face of those who never felt a kinship with the radical clerics.
"For the first time, we can see Iran as not just black or white, but as complex and more refined," a diplomat here said. "I'm not saying they are angels, but this is not a one-man dictatorship, like Saddam's in Iraq."
One question still difficult if not impossible to answer is whether overtures like those on display last week encourage moderation or coddle the worst elements in Iran. American views have veered from one extreme to the other, with little success on either end of the spectrum. The effort to reach out to Iran reached its most absurd and embarrassing proportion with the secret arrival in 1986 of the Bible- and cake-bearing mission led by Robert McFarlane, President Reagan's national security adviser, to which Iranian officials turned their backs. Since then, Washington's pattern has been to turn its own back on Iran until it forswears, for one thing, its support for violent opponents of a broader Middle East peace.
Iran, in turn, has said the economic sanctions imposed by the United States leave no grounds for any overture at all. But among its neighbors, Iran has begun to extend olive branches. It has played a restrained role in trying to mediate conflicts in countries like Afghanistan and Tajikistan, while working hard to promote warmer relations with American allies like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which until recently had followed the United States in regarding Iran as something akin to the devil incarnate.
It was the dividends of those efforts that were evident here last week as Iran took the reins for the next three years of the 55-member Organization of the Islamic Conference. Not only was the international gathering the largest to be held in Teheran since the revolution, but it far eclipsed in size and prominence an American-sponsored gathering in Qatar less than a month earlier, which was marred by an Arab boycott in protest of Israel's participation.
 
Still Skeptical
Misgivings within the Sunni-dominated Islamic world of Iran's Shiite regime still run so deep that few if any of those who attended were doing so to demonstrate wholehearted support for Iran's domestic and internal policies. Many were motivated first by obligations to an Islamic organization they hope can wield increasing weight, and perhaps second by a curiosity about Mr. Khatami, a man who had been unknown to many of them. Tiny oil-rich monarchies like Kuwait and Bahrain that have embraced American military protection remained skeptical of their giant neighbor's claims that it has no hostile intentions. "There are a lot of lookers but no buyers," a European diplomat said.
But in taking a fresh look at Iran, with its 60 million people, vast territory and considerable resources, the guests saw an Iran that, at least on the surface, had taken great pains to present a post-revolutionary face.
In the lobby of the former Intercontinental hotel, which was nationalized after the revolution, a mosaic that read "Down With the U.S.A." was removed, after 18 years, during a pre-conference renovation. In its place, computers offered direct, high-speed links to the World Wide Web. In guest rooms, televisions offered satellite programming, still officially against the law in the rest of Teheran. And while Ayatollah Khamenei's speech featured a fierce condemnation of Western civilization and what he called its gluttony, carnality and greed, Mr. Khatami, by contrast, quickly pronounced himself in favor of "the establishment of dialogues" to achieve "deep-rooted understanding of the cultural and moral dimensions of other societies."
That was enough for the State Department to declare that the United States, too, would "welcome and support the idea of an open dialogue between different cultures and civilizations." But in Teheran, many foreign residents and visitors said they believed that both sides could benefit by being less oblique.
"It is an open question whether these hints of moderation are tactical or strategic," a European diplomat said. "But it is incumbent on everyone, including the United States, to watch closely and listen."

HEADLINE: In America;
The Success Taboo

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Somehow over the past two or three decades a lot of black kids absorbed the message that academic achievement was something to be shunned. Excellence in sports or the various entertainment fields was one thing, a good thing, but high marks and academic honors were something else. Academic achievement, according to this mind-bogglingly destructive way of thinking, was a white thing, and thus in some sense contemptible. The tragic result has been that in many schools across the country black kids who apply themselves to their studies are often ridiculed and at times ostracized.
A black teacher in the Bronx told me in a despairing tone that she has male students who would rather be paraded in handcuffs before television cameras than be caught reading a book. I've had many students tell me in interviews that they are afraid to raise their hands in the classroom because they don't want to repeat the experience of being laughed at for giving the correct answer. 
 A black 17-year-old girl who worked part time at a mall in Marietta, Ga., was taunted recently by high school classmates who showed up at her job to express their resentment at the high marks she was getting.
Now, and not a moment too soon, comes Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League, with an ambitious first step toward turning this madness around.
"We haven't surrounded our young people with enough opportunities to excel academically and to be recognized for excelling," said Mr. Price. "We haven't had the rituals in our own community that reward young people for doing well."
The Urban League has drawn together 20 national black organizations, including the Congress of National Black Churches, for what it calls the Campaign for African-American Achievement. The idea is to improve the academic standing of black youngsters by encouraging and rewarding excellence in the classroom, and by improving the quality of the education that is offered to black youngsters in the public schools.
A statement announcing the campaign said: "We have to reverse the increasing gap in academic achievement between African-American and other children. We have to increase the low rates of enrollment of African-American youngsters in college preparatory courses and attack the inequitable allocation of resources for public education."
There is an urgency in Mr. Price's manner as he talks about this effort. He and his colleagues recognize that black men and women will have to be substantially better prepared educationally if they are to survive economically as we move into the 21st century. Employers, as Mr. Price noted, "expect much more in the way of academic preparation than ever before." And affirmative action, however one feels about it, is almost certain to continue its fade from the scene.
The achievement campaign will try in a variety of ways to generate enthusiasm among students and parents for the hard work that is necessary to succeed academically. This will not be easy in environments that are plagued by poverty, broken families, drug abuse, violence and the widespread notion that what is taught in the classroom is not relevant to the lives of the students.
The campaign will establish an honor society, called the National Achievers Society, to focus attention on black youngsters who excel academically. The first induction ceremony, to be presided over by Gen. Colin Powell, will be held next spring.
September has been designated Achievement Month by the campaign. The plan is to have Urban League affiliates, black churches and other organizations conduct a month-long series of high-profile events each year celebrating the efforts of black youngsters who are doing well in school.
Meanwhile, leaders of the campaign are working with professional organizations and universities around the country to determine where improvements in the public schools need to be made and what specific kinds of academic help are needed for underachieving students.
This is not a perfect plan. Much of it will be modified and some of it will fail. But it does send the crucial message that academic achievement is as important for black people as anyone else. It's a message that somehow has escaped the consciousness of too many black children.

HEADLINE: In New Math Standards, California Stresses Skills Over Analysis

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Seeking to quell a bitter dispute over how best to teach math, the California Board of Education has approved a set of standards for the state's public school students that emphasizes mastery of basic computational skills over the ability to analyze and solve intricate word problems.
But the lengthy list of expectations for students in all grades, which was approved by the board in a unanimous vote on Thursday night, seems to have fanned the controversy. 
 The state's elected Superintendent of Public Instruction, Delaine Eastin, has joined a number of mathematicians in deriding the board's standards as "dumbed down" and unlikely to elicit higher-order thinking from the state's 5.5 million public school students. But others, including those parents and politicians who have complained that calculators and computers were supplanting multiplication tables and long division in many classes, applauded the board's call for a return to the fundamentals.
The standards, which districts have the option to adopt but which will serve as the basis of mandatory statewide tests, make clear that multiplication tables should be memorized by the end of the third grade, long division mastered by the fourth and the Pythagorean theorem of geometry by the end of the 10th.
Students will not be permitted to use calculators on the state tests. And districts are advised to avoid introducing computers into math classes before the sixth grade.
Because of its size, California tends to influence national teaching issues and the standards are expected to be studied closely by other districts across the country.
Janet Nicholas, a board member from Sonoma, said the board had succeeded in emphasizing basic skills "without mandating experimental curricula and counterproductive learning fads."
Nonetheless, Ms. Eastin, a Democrat who was elected state Superintendent in 1993, lamented that the final standards document provided teachers with few clues about how to make mathematical formulas come alive for students in the nation's largest public school system.
"If you give a kid in America a column of numbers to add up, and then say find a percentage of that column and add it to the total, they will get the right answer most of the time," Ms. Eastin said. "On the other hand, if you give kids a word problem in which they are told to order a meal from a restaurant menu, compute the tax and tip, and add up the bill, they are flummoxed by it."
"Math instruction, if it only emphasizes basic skills, will put us at a terrible competitive disadvantage in a global economy," she added. "We need people who can problem-solve."
The onus is now on districts to decide whether to adopt the standards, but the campaign to sway their votes has already begun.
In a letter to the board, the National Science Foundation, which has awarded more than $50 million in grants to Los Angeles, Oakland and four other districts seeking a more progressive approach to math instruction, threatened to sever its commitments to districts "that embark on a course that substitutes computational proficiencies for a commitment to deep, balanced, mathematical learning."
"The wistful or nostalgic 'back-to-basics' approach that characterizes the board standards," wrote Luther S. Williams, an assistant director of the foundation, "overlooks the fact that the approach has chronically and dismally failed."

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls for Bill to Stop Drug Overpayment

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton called on Congress today to pass legislation that would bar drug suppliers from charging the Medicare system more for prescriptions than their wholesale cost.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton said that clamping down on drug overpayments would save $700 million over five years. He noted that a recent report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services found that what Medicare pays for drugs "bears little or no resemblance to actual wholesale prices that are available to physicians and suppliers that bill for these drugs." 
 Under current practices, Medicare pays a "sticker price" set by manufacturers rather than the average price actually charged by wholesalers, Mr. Clinton said.
For more than one-third of these drugs, the White House said, Medicare paid more than double the actual wholesale prices.
Mr. Clinton said his proposal would be included in his budget for the 1999 fiscal year.
He also said that he had ordered a moratorium on all new home health care providers coming into the Medicare program, a revamped renewal process for home health agencies already in the system and a doubling of audits to weed out bad care providers.
In the Republicans' weekly radio address, Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska argued that the recently negotiated treaty to curb global warning would give the United Nations control over the economic growth of the United States.
"This treaty will have a devastating effect on the American economy," Senator Hagel said.
"The Republican leadership in Congress will not allow the United Nations to dictate the loss of American jobs and higher energy prices for America's families, farmers and businesses," he said.
Under the treaty, negotiated earlier this week in Kyoto, Japan, the United States agreed to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
Senator Hagel urged President Clinton to immediately send the treaty to the Senate, where he predicted it would be defeated. Mr. Clinton has decided to delay a debate on ratifying the treaty until some developing nations also agree to support it.

HEADLINE: Catholic Bishops Finish Survey of Challenges to the Americas

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 13

 BODY:
A special synod of Roman Catholic bishops from North and South America convened here by Pope John Paul II has concluded a monthlong survey of the moral, social and economic challenges confronting the Western Hemisphere, from foreign debt to broken families.
The participants in this Special Assembly for America, which ended on Friday, listened to speeches, took part in workshops, prepared 76 proposals and wrote a final collective message. These will form the basis, one year from now, for a papal document on the tasks facing the church in the Americas -- home of about half the world's 1 billion Catholics -- as it approaches its 2,000th year. 
 But according to many of the bishops, the most significant result of the special synod -- one of several that will bring bishops together by geography rather than by topic over the next two years -- was the fact that they came together at all, from two continents that do not always see themselves as a single region.
"Some of the most important outcomes will be the ones that can't be quantified," said Roger Cardinal Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles and co-president of the synod delegates. "Borders and boundaries have fallen away, as we viewed this hemisphere as one."
At a final news conference on Thursday, other bishops discussed the novelty of addressing problems together.
"What struck me was that, despite the geographical differences, there was a brotherly community," said Archbishop Francois Gayot of Cap-Haitien, Haiti. "The synod has allowed us to meet the challenge of diversity within unity."
From bishops from Latin America came a preoccupation with the continuing burden of foreign debt on their countries, which they feel has caused profound economic and social dislocations. From bishops from North America came lessons in ecumenical sensitivity, learned on a continent where Roman Catholics have historically been in the minority and imparted to a Roman Catholic Church in South America that has long enjoyed dominance but has been alarmed by the inroads of Protestant evangelical movements.
But the 300 bishops gathered here also discovered how many problems are shared: declining vocations, single-parent families, immigration, globalized economies, securing the rights of minority groups, and what the bishops referred to as the "cry of the poor for justice."
"There are cases of injustice everywhere," said Archbishop Dario Castrillon Hoyos of Bucaramanga, Colombia. "The poor are not only in the South, but also in the North."
As many participants acknowledged, the synod's concluding message did not suggest any new departures. It was, as one bishop said, a "synod without tensions," and to some observers that suggested that the bishops were not addressing some of the more controversial issues dividing Roman Catholics. In that regard, they said, the mixing of South and North Americans may have served to dilute debate, and to produce broad generalities.
There was also criticism that the American synod, which was formally called only 14 months ago, was not as well prepared as a similar African synod, which had been in the works for four years before it convened in 1994.
The synod did hear an appeal, by Bishop Nestor Herrera Heredia of Ecuador, that the Vatican review a church policy that forbids divorced Roman Catholics who have remarried from receiving Communion.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO OFFER A CHILD CARE PLAN, WHITE HOUSE SAYS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton will soon propose a major initiative to help working families obtain child care, with a variety of new Federal subsidies and tax breaks, Administration officials say.
The purpose of the proposals, to be included in the President's State of the Union Message in late January and in his budget request a few days later, is to increase the supply of child care and to improve its quality. 
 Administration officials said that the President's proposals would include an increase in the Federal income tax credit that parents can take for child care expenses; a new tax credit for businesses that build or operate child care centers for employees, and an increase in the money that the Federal Government gives states to subsidize child care.
Although some details are not yet final, officials said that Mr. Clinton had made one firm decision: he will not propose national child care standards.
Proposals for such regulation have provoked bitter clashes in the past, with conservatives arguing that the Federal Government has no business setting standards.
Democrats said they saw child care as an excellent election-year issue. They said it appealed to voters, especially working women, and split Republicans, some of whom will be receptive to Mr. Clinton's ideas.
Since Congress adjourned for the year on Nov. 13, a bipartisan group of Senate aides has held many meetings to draft child care legislation. Moderate Republicans said they would support Democratic legislation or offer their own if the Republican leadership did not propose an alternative.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is coordinating the talks, said he hoped to submit the bipartisan proposals to Mr. Clinton before the State of the Union address.
Lawmakers see this year's experience with health insurance for children as a possible precedent. The legislation was pushed through Congress in six months, and the final package provided nearly five times as much money as the President had proposed.
Democrats hope to follow a similar timetable with child care next year. Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, want to control the child care issue, as well, but whether they can is unclear.
Conservatives on Capitol Hill said it seemed clear that Democrats and moderate Republicans would have the 60 votes needed to assure Senate approval of child care proposals like Mr. Clinton's.
The outlook is less clear in the House, where Democrats and some moderate Republicans are also pushing legislation.
In an interview, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican working with Mr. Dodd, said he expected Congress to approve an expansion of the child care tax credit next year. In addition, he said, "we can beef up the Child Care and Development Block Grant," which provides states with a total of $3 billion a year, mainly to subsidize child care for low-income families.
Rahm I. Emanuel, a senior adviser to the President, said: "Our child care proposals will help the most hard-pressed working families, who are trying to balance work and family. The proposals build on previous accomplishments, including family and medical leave, an increase in the minimum wage, a $500-a-child tax credit and the health insurance program for children."
A conservative aide to the Senate Republican leadership who insisted on anonymity said that Republicans felt compelled to offer their own proposals -- tax cuts and some Federal spending -- as an alternative to the President's ideas. Some Republicans deride the Administration's proposals as "Hillary care" because of the First Lady's interest in the issue.
White House officials said that Hillary Rodham Clinton had been more deeply involved in development of the President's child care proposals than in any issue since the health care debacle of 1993 and 1994.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton's package would also include these proposals:
*A new Federal program to help states check the criminal history records of people who work in day-care centers.
*Scholarships for child care workers, to subsidize their training and increase their pay. Federal officials said they hoped that such incentives would slow the turnover of child care employees, 35 percent of whom leave their jobs in any given year.
*Legislation to require Federal child care centers to comply with all state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements.
Civilian agencies of the Federal Government run 237 child care centers, while the Defense Department operates more than 800. Nearly 75 percent of the centers are accredited by private groups like the National Association for the Education of Young Children. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton wanted all the centers to be accredited.
The Senate has already voted to establish a tax credit up to $150,000 a year for companies that set up child care centers for employees. The proposal, offered as an amendment to this year's budget bill by Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, was approved by a vote of 72 to 28 in June. But it was later dropped in negotiations with the House.
Mr. Clinton's proposals coincide with a series of events that have heightened interest in child care.
With the unemployment rate at its lowest point in 24 years, some employers find that they have to offer child care to attract and retain workers. The new welfare law is increasing demand for child care because it requires welfare mothers to work.
In addition, the trial of a British au pair in the death of an 8-month-old boy in Massachusetts focused attention on the problems of child care.
And new scientific research indicates that brain development is profoundly affected, for better or worse, by a child's experiences in the first three years of life.
The President's Council of Economic Advisers has prepared a philosophical justification for Mr. Clinton's child care proposals. In a report to Mr. Clinton this week, the council set forth "economic rationales" for Federal intervention in the child care market, saying child care imposed "a sizeable financial burden," especially on poor families, who, on average, spend 18 percent of their incomes on child care.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is leading efforts to highlight child care as an economic issue. His chief of staff, Michael B. G. Froman, met this week with executives from Conagra, Motorola, Eli Lilly and several other companies that provide or subsidize day care for employees.
The Treasury will catalogue the experiences of these companies in the hope of encouraging other businesses to follow their example.
Charles R. Romeo, director of employee benefits for Conagra Refrigerated Foods, a unit of Conagra, said his company subsidized child care for business reasons, not as a form of philanthropy. Conagra, he said, had difficulty finding women to work at its turkey-processing plant in rural Huntsville, Ark., until it joined forces with the local Head Start agency and built a child care center.
Faith A. Wohl, president of the Child Care Action Campaign, an education and advocacy group, said, "Child care badly needs greater investment." Mrs. Wohl said that 60 percent of the money spent on child care came from parents, while 39 percent came from Federal, state and local governments and only 1 percent came from employers.
Among the Republicans most interested in child care legislation, besides Mr. Hatch, are Senators James M. Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Pat Roberts of Kansas. They have all sent aides to work with Senator Dodd's staff on a possible bipartisan bill.
In general, these Republicans appear ready to spend more money on child care, but do not want to tell states how to use it, and they think that states should keep responsibility for setting and enforcing standards.
Regulation varies widely among states, and in many states, large numbers of small day-care providers who operate from private homes are exempt from regulation.
Bruce Reed, assistant to the President for domestic policy, said, "We're not interested in some big Federal program directed from Washington that sets one-size-fits-all rules."
A White House lawyer said, "The Federal Government can certainly do more to encourage quality and safety in child care, but we've concluded that states are better suited to create their own standards."
Senator Dodd, a veteran of earlier battles over the issue, said: "Quality standards should be left to states and localities. I accept that." Insisting on national standards, he said, "could cause this whole effort to collapse."

HEADLINE: Man Is Arrested in Philadelphia Hate Crimes

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The authorities say they hope that with the arrest of Michael Gaither they have brought to an end a series of hate crimes over the last three years in northeast Philadelphia.
Mr. Gaither was arraigned on Friday on more than 100 charges stemming from the crimes that included arson, ethnic intimidation and causing a catastrophe. The defendant's bail was set at $2.45 million. 
 Among the accusations is that Mr. Gaither wrote a letter to the police threatening to hurt children as retribution for American atrocities in Germany after World War II.
As he was led to a police van on his way to jail, Mr. Gaither, 39, told reporters that he was not the one who put children in danger.
"How many millions of children did the United States bomb with napalm and everything else in this century?" Mr. Gaither said.
In all, Mr. Gaither is accused of leaving eight pipe bombs in and around Philadelphia, Sgt. Michael O'Donnell said. None of the bombs detonated.
Efforts to make an arrest intensified after the police received a letter last month threatening to harm children if the police did not pay $15,000 as retribution for United States actions in Germany after World War II.
"Who knows what's in these people's heads?" Sergeant O'Donnell said when asked about a motive.
Mr. Gaither, who lives with his mother in Philadelphia and is apparently unemployed, has no criminal record and had not been a suspect.
The police were led to Mr. Gaither after the department's radio room kept receiving harassing telephone calls. Investigators traced the calls to a few pay phones in one neighborhood and began staking out the booths.
On Wednesday, someone called the office of State Senator Henry Salvatore and acknowledged vandalizing the Republican Senator's office last year. The police said they traced the call and saw Mr. Gaither walking away from booth. He was arrested after a brief chase.
Mr. Gaither is also suspected of vandalizing the office Representative Robert A. Borski, a Democrat, whose office here was damaged at least three times from March and August 1996. Swastikas and the words "U.S. Out" were scribbled in black marker and a door and window were shattered.

HEADLINE: Getty Center Inaugurated in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13

 BODY:
On a brilliant, cool morning, dignitaries and celebrities including the Mayor of Los Angeles and the rock group Los Lobos presided over the inauguration of one of the largest arts centers in the country, the $1 billion Getty Center here.
The day seemed tailor-made for the event, with sunshine pouring over the acres of honey-colored marble, the modernistic buildings and the delicate fountains of the hilltop complex. The wisps of clouds made even more splendid the view the site commands of the Pacific Ocean and the San Gabriel Mountains. 
 "I have to confess we accomplished much more than I had any reason to expect," said Harold M. Williams, who has been president of the J. Paul Getty Trust since 1981.
Today's inaugural marked an important moment for Los Angeles, which has long struggled to be taken as seriously in art circles as it is in popular culture. The city has also struggled to recover from the devastation of a deep recession in the early 1990's, followed by an earthquake, sweeping fires and rioting in 1992.
With the economy here now booming, the celebrations today were an opportunity for Los Angeles to do something it is just starting to enjoy again -- feel good about itself.
In addition, the trust used the occasion to emphasize its efforts to contribute to the community rather than remain aloof, as it had been in the past. Denzel Washington, the actor, spoke this morning about the trust's role in helping children.
The campus-like Getty Center, which opens to the public on Tuesday, was designed by Richard Meier. Including its gardens, it covers 110 acres on the city's west side. The museum complex, a series of connected two-storied pavilions, contains artworks from masters like Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Walker Evans.
The collection is regarded as significant, but not encyclopedic. Nevertheless, it adds considerably to the prestige of a city whose museums have not had the breadth of the new Getty or buildings that cut such a striking architectural figure.
The opening brings to one location for the first time all the work of the Getty Trust, which consists of separate institutes for activities like research, conservation, education and museum management.
The opening also allows the museum to show its sizable collections in what have been described as some of the finest galleries built in recent years. They rely heavily on natural light.
The Getty Center, and especially the museum, is a marriage of the austere and the sumptuous. The buildings and the plaza are faced with off-white travertine marble. But the cool color scheme is offset by the rough hewn texture that has been left in some of the stone.
The outside of the museum and its big rotunda entranceway are signature Richard Meier designs, with crisp lines and a stark geometry. But the trust chose Thierry Despont, a French architect, to design the rooms in which the collection is shown. His designs are lavish, warm and colorful.
The trust on display today has come a long way since it was endowed by J. Paul Getty, an oil magnate and pragmatist who seemed more interested in the mechanics of running a good business than art.
He made his first important art acquisition in 1931, acquiring a Dutch landscape by Jan van Goyen in Berlin for $1,100.
Mr. Getty died in 1976 and gave much of his fortune, valued at about $700 million, to the trust. The endowment has grown considerably to its current level of about $4.3 billion.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Big-Name Men's Wear, From a Stranger's Closet

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
LIKE many a middle-aged male who labors in a Manhattan office, Steven Greene sometimes wears Armani. Unlike many, though, Mr. Greene, a public relations executive, buys his suits second-hand at a men's wear consignment shop that knocks as much as 90 percent off the original price.
"I had never been in a men's consignment store before, and I didn't know what it was," he said. "But when I walked in -- my wife urged me to go -- there were great cheap clothes in impeccable condition." 
 Men's consignment stores are still rarities, especially compared with used-clothing stores that cater to women. The concept, however, appears to be gaining acceptance in and near a few big cities like New York, where stylish suits and natty sport jackets are common -- but expensive -- attire. At least one such shop is in Manhattan -- Gentlemen's Resale, on the Upper East Side. Another, Gentlemens Agreement, opened 18 months ago in Englewood, N.J.
"It's a great deal for men, but it tends to be only in metropolitan areas, where labels like Armani and Boss have more pull," said Alexandra Carroll, who runs a thrift store in Paoli, Pa., and is the president of the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops. "You are not going to find it in suburban areas as much."
Many men cringe at the thought of buying used clothing, unless they are struggling through college, or are recently divorced, unemployed or otherwise down at the heels -- or in search of attire like that perfect Hawaiian shirt for a croquet party or Halloween costume.
And to some men, there is something almost unsanitary ("Yuck! That stain!) about such a purchase, though they may consent to picking up a used tuxedo for a few hundred dollars at a shop that does most of its business renting formal wear.
But attitudes can change, though slowly.
"A lot of men don't know about it," said Terry Selbert, a salesman at Gentlemen's Resale, referring to the five-year-old store on East 81st Street, between First and Second Avenues. He added that business had been so strong lately that the shop planned to move to larger quarters in the same neighborhood in February.
The appeal of a men's consignment store is obvious -- price. Mr. Greene, a relatively easy-to-fit, 42-long, bought his midnight blue, pin-stripe Armani suit for $200 at Gentlemens Agreement. The suit cost about $1,800 when new three years ago. He also bought a $1,200 Krizia Uomo for about $200.
"Men's clothing prices have gone through the roof," he said. "Who ever heard of paying $2,000 for a suit a few years go? But that's what some go for, even $3,000."
Mr. Greene has also bought about 20 dress shirts at about $10 to $12 each, a fraction of their prices when new. He draws the line, though, at neckwear. "They are a bit out of style," he said of the store's offerings.
Where do the duds come from? Many are placed on consignment by businessmen and professionals who have tired of the styles. (Mr. Greene's suits come from a wealthy gentleman in Westbury, N.Y., who wanted to remain anonymous.) Or the sellers are retiring and moving to Florida. Or they have outgrown the clothes because they have spent too much time either working out or dining out. (Generally, the sellers split the proceeds 50-50 with the store owner, who sets the prices.)
Mr. Selbert, the Gentlemen's Resale salesman, said the store sometimes received virtually new garments from people who work in the business and get them free or at a low price. He said one such suit, a Versace that sells new for $2,200, is priced at $450 at his store.
Mr. Selbert also said many men put up their old suits for consignment, rather than donating them to a thrift store, because they may think the value of such donations for tax purposes is more carefully scrutinized than in the past. They also get cash or a check on the spot, rather than a small reduction in next year's income tax.
The consignment stores lean heavily toward today's styles -- meaning that shoppers won't find geeky 80's-style suspenders or fuddy-duddy suits on the racks. The most sought-after items sound more like an Italian law firm: Armani, Brioni, Versace, Valentino and Zegna.
"They want Armani," said Toni Rusche, owner of Gentleman's Closet, a 10-year-old men's consignment shop in Houston.
OF course, a danger in buying a fashion-forward suit is that it can quickly become fashion-backward. "We don't take anything that is over three years old," Mr. Selbert said.
Sandi Zahn, a former saleswoman in the Garment District who is the owner of Gentlemens Agreement in Englewood, uses the same approach. "I don't take it if it is outdated," said Ms. Zahn, who opened her store in 1995. She also said she accepted suits only in larger, more popular sizes. "Just 40 and up," she said.
And none of the stores take ripped or stained clothing.
Ms. Zahn's best deal this month: a $2,600 Brioni suit, 42-regular, charcoal pinstripe, a couple of years old. "A steal -- $249," she says. "Won't last."
Ms. Zahn will agree to call regular customers when an item appropriate for them comes in, she said. Besides fashion-conscious executives, her customers include parents looking for clothes for their fast-growing teen-aged boys, she said. Others are high-society types in search of a cheap tuxedo. How cheap? $89.
"Same price as renting one," she said.

HEADLINE: Dim Asian Economies Casting Shadows in U.S.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Two freighters carrying logs from the Weyerhaeuser Corporation in the Pacific Northwest steam idly at sea near South Korea, their cargos undelivered -- perhaps undeliverable. Just as the ships approached port, the Korean buyers refused to pay for wood they no longer needed to build homes and furniture they can no longer sell while Asia's financial crisis spreads.
Tiffany, enjoying brisk jewelry sales on Fifth Avenue, is hurting in Hawaii; the Japanese tourists who normally visit and buy there are doing neither lately. And Reebok International, the shoe giant, reports that its sales to Asia's consumers are way off. Take the Rockport shoe boutique, a Reebok subsidiary, in Seoul's upscale Myondong neighborhood. With few customers to serve, sales clerks spend their time shining the shoes on display. 
 "People come in here and they realize this is an American brand and they don't buy," said Kim Myung Chal, the store manager.
Hundreds of stories like these are bringing the Asian financial crisis home to corporate America. So far, the effects have been small for most companies. Weyerhaeuser, Tiffany and Reebok may be hurting in the Pacific, but their sales worldwide are still rising. And added together, all the setbacks at worst only seem to be nibbling at the overall United States economy. Some companies even expect to profit from the turmoil by selling products in America that are ever cheaper to make in Asia with the region's falling currencies.
The national economy, in the view of many experts, is simply too big and too complex to be brought down by what has happened so far in Asia. "My line is always America has 130 million workers," said Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "You can go out there and find stories that affect a thousand companies and a million workers, and it is still not important in the larger picture."
But while the effect thus far appears to be marginal for most American companies -- a Weyerhaeuser official, for example, says the undelivered logs might cost the company several hundred thousand dollars, a pittance for a company with more than $11 billion in annual revenue -- the cumulative effect on the American economy as a whole could be harsh in the end.
Some of the damage might even show up at first as good news for consumers in the form of falling prices for Asian goods sold in America. But more Asian imports -- and they are already rising -- could swell the United States trade deficit to a damaging level and shrink American operations that make similar goods -- textiles, electronics and furniture for instance -- or push companies to move more operations abroad.
"It accelerates the move offshore; that is the bad news," said Jay Meltzer, director of Johnson Redbook Service, which compiles retail data. "And the good news is that it puts the kibosh on inflation. Every apparel company that I speak to talks of doing more sourcing offshore, and particularly now in Asia."
Many forecasters expect the Asian crisis to slow the growth of the American economy by only half a percentage point, to about 2.5 percent in 1998. But a few are talking about a decline of one percentage point, enough to cut back job creation and make the low unemployment rate edge up gradually.
The global trade agreement signed by 100 countries in Geneva yesterday -- committing them to dismantle barriers to foreign ownership of their banks and security firms -- could soften the impact on the American economy. The prospect that a Chase or a Citibank could soon take over a failing bank in Korea or Thailand might restore the confidence of foreign investors in these economies, some analysts say. The Asian currencies would then regain some of their lost value, and that in turn would reduce the pressure on American companies trying to compete with inexpensive Asian imports.
There is a more dire scenario -- that the panic in Asia becomes infectious, scaring American investors sufficiently to bring down stock prices. That would make millions of Americans feel less wealthy, undermining the consumer confidence that has sustained two years of strong economic growth.
"The Asian crisis, although a small thing, becomes the pin that pricks the stock market bubble in America, assuming there is a bubble," Mr. Krugman said.
In the meantime, the tales of damage to American businesses are accumulating. With Asians traveling less, passenger traffic on Pacific airline routes is growing at half the rate of last fall, shaving potential revenue from American carriers. Rubbermaid, which sells high-priced plastic toys in Asia, says sales are holding up surprisingly well, but they are in local currencies that translate into fewer and fewer dollars, also cutting into revenue.
Some of the hits are not so marginal. The Oracle Corporation, blaming Asia for a sharp decline in sales of the company's specialized software, saw the value of its stock decline by 29 percent last Tuesday -- a reminder that the prospect of falling profits can be deadly on the stock exchange. And in recent months, mutual funds that invest in Asian securities have shrunk in value by $5.5 billion.
Most big American companies are playing down the significance of their losses. The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's largest bank, buys and sells Asian bonds, a bit of trading that cost it $160 million in October, the company said. Citibank, J. P. Morgan & Company and Bankers Trust New York have reported similar losses, and these are likely to show up in fourth-quarter results as slightly lower-than-expected profits.
"The one thing we are proud of," a Chase official said, by way of rationalization, "is that through all this turmoil, we are at least making a market in Asian securities, protecting a rich franchise for the long term."
Some companies are turning a profit unexpectedly, or balancing a loss in one area with a profit in another. The Eaton Corporation, a manufacturer of machinery controls in Cleveland, also makes rubber hand grips for golf clubs in Thailand. The grips are sold worldwide in dollars, while the costs are in Thai bahts, a currency whose rapid decline in value set off the Asian crisis last July.
"It is a short-term benefit; sooner or later inflation in Thailand will overtake the devaluation, and our costs will rise, but not right away," said Stephen R. Hardis, Eaton's chairman. Meanwhile, buyers of Eaton's machinery controls in Asia have not cut back orders, although Mr. Hardis says he is bracing for that to happen.
Western Digital of Irvine, Calif., is another case in point. Western makes most of its disk drives in Singapore and Malaysia, selling 10 percent to 15 percent in Asia and the rest in the United States and other foreign markets. Sales in Asia have fallen, but profits are rising. The disk drives are sold in dollars, while manufacturing costs are incurred in the weakening Asian currencies.
"We are on both sides of the profit and loss equation," said Duston Williams, Western Digital's chief financial officer, adding that the net result has been higher profit so far.
That equation also applies to Rockport, which makes casual shoes in China and Indonesia for sale not only in Asia -- only 15 percent of its market -- but also in the United States, which accounts for two-thirds of its sales. The Asian sales are collapsing: The owner of the Seoul store is having so much trouble selling Rockports that he intends to switch soon to a non-American brand. But the cost of manufacturing Rockport shoes is falling, while the price of shoes in America is not, at least not yet.
"We have seen a softening of our sales throughout Asia," said Kenneth Marshall, a Rockport senior vice president, "but to a certain extent the currency devaluation has been favorable to us from a sourcing point of view."
Car sales are also falling in Asia. For the Chrysler Corporation, the percentage decline is steep but the number of vehicles is relatively small: a 31 percent drop in November to 59,000 vehicles sold so far this year out of worldwide sales of 2.8 million. But pressure is growing to offset this loss by selling more cars in strong markets, particularly the United States, perhaps through discounts and price cuts that shrink profits.
That kind of pressure, multiplied across corporate America, could result in job cutbacks and slower economic growth. But many American executives are optimistic.
"The downward pressure in Asia means a greater competitive environment in North America," said Wynn Van Bussman, a Chrysler economist, "but only a temporary dent in our plans to expand across the world."

All Quiet on Some Fronts: Selig Is Silent on Big Question

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Before Bud Selig can drop the "acting" from the unofficial title by which he has been known for more than five years, or before he can shed the label entirely, he has to decide which part of his life is tugging harder at his head and heart: his team and its park-under-construction or Paul Beeston.
"The whole world knows how Paul and I feel about each other," Selig said, discussing his relationship with baseball's still-new president and chief operating officer. The world knows, too, about Selig's love for the Milwaukee Brewers and the fascination he has with their -- his -- new stadium. 
 Beeston wants Selig to become commissioner; he feels so strongly about it, in fact, that if someone else gets the job he very likely will look for work elsewhere. He did not say that in a recent interview, but another baseball official said he has told Selig that.
"My whole feeling has been that if I could influence Bud to stay by doing my job properly and making it easier for him, then I've done my job," Beeston said. "I would love for him to stay. I have a great relationship with him. I work well with him. I have no hesitation in telling him what I think or what I think we should be doing."
Except for saying that his position has not changed, Selig is reluctant to discuss the continued speculation about him and the job of commissioner. But the same baseball official who talked about Beeston's possible departure said it has become a very powerful factor in Selig's thinking.
Selig, however, continues to interview candidates with the Colorado Rockies' owner, Jerry McMorris, who is chairman of the commissioner search committee.
"He has been straightforward with these candidates as we boil them down," McMorris said. "He's been consistent with me. I'm absolutely convinced we are moving ahead to pick a new commissioner."
McMorris, however, also sees the possibility that some owners will call on Selig to take the job.
"I think there's always a chance of a draft movement," he said. "I don't honestly believe Bud will accept even if the draft was strong enough to give it to him. He's made it clear he's not desirous of doing it. I know what I'm saying defies conventional wisdom and in baseball anything can happen."
The commissioner search has been so quiet that some people are skeptical that it is taking place. But the secrecy has held because only Selig and McMorris have been involved in the interviewing process that has reduced the list of candidates, one official said, to three.
"We have told the executive council we would be in with our recommendations at our next meeting," McMorris said. That meeting will be before the owners' quarterly meetings the middle of next month. "I could be very comfortable with several of the candidates," he said. "I haven't tried to rank them."
McMorris gave Beeston high marks for the job he has done in only a few months since leaving the Toronto Blue Jays.
"Everybody on the business side and the baseball side has appreciated having Paul there," he said. "He's in meetings, he's in there digging, he's taking suggestions, he's following up. In executive council meetings, he's coming in with things we haven't been hearing."
Beeston, a 52-year-old Canadian, is a man who loves his job. "I've never been happier," he said. "Right now the challenges are not only invigorating but they're exciting. I think it's really going to work. I have my frustrations some days, but I had frustrations when I was with the Blue Jays."
Beeston, sitting in his Park Avenue office, was talking about getting baseball back to the growth it had before the strike and moving beyond that stage. He believes Selig could be a major part of that thrust.
"I can't tell you if he'll do it," Beeston said. "I would like to think at least his actions lead me to believe that perhaps he will. But I don't know."
In his campaign to persuade Selig to just say yes, Beeston often asks him, "When are we going to end this charade?" But Selig is apparently not ready to end it.
"It's tough," said Beeston, who was the Blue Jays' president for eight and a half years. "I understand what he's going through. I went through it pulling away from Toronto. Those first two months when Toronto was playing, you wanted to be home for the home games."
Another baseball official agreed with Beeston. If anyone believes that Selig won't be the commissioner, the official said, "I'd like to sell him the Brooklyn Bridge, too."
 
The $30 Million Question
Andy Benes, meet Jody Reed.
Unless the Players Association can convince baseball's new arbitrator, Dana Eischen, that the contract negotiated by the St. Louis Cardinals with Benes's agent, Scott Boras, was concluded in a timely manner, the pitcher could be facing a future with considerably less than the $30 million he thought he had for the next five years.
Management's player relations committee maintains that the deal was reached after an extension granted to the Cardinals and Boras last Sunday night had expired. The only way the contract can survive is if the Players Association files a grievance and prevails.
Four years ago, in a different but nonetheless painful circumstance, Reed, on his agent's advice, rejected an offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers for three years and $7.8 million, a nice wage for an average infielder at that time. Reed wound up signing a minor league contract with Milwaukee that called for a $350,000 salary if he made the team. In later years, instead of $7.8 million, Reed earned $2.2 million.
 
Spoljaric the Starter?
Paul Spoljaric, meet Andy Pettitte.
Lou Piniella, Spoljaric's manager in Seattle, is the one making this introduction.
Saying he is considering the 27-year-old left-hander as a candidate for the fifth starting spot in the Seattle pitching rotation, Piniella remarked: "He's got a good arm, he's got all the pitches, all the tools to start. If a kid like Andy Pettitte can come up through the Yankee system and do as well as he has, we see no reason why Spoljaric can't do the same for us coming up through the Toronto system."
Spoljaric, who moved to the Mariners with Mike Timlin last July 31 when Jose Cruz Jr. went to Toronto, was a starting pitcher for his first five years in the minor leagues, then was converted to relief in 1995. But Piniella said he saw "flashes that lead me to think he could be a good starting pitcher."
"I'm talking about a kid who has a good arm, who's strong, that's got three quality pitches," he added. "You would assume that a young man with that type of equipment certainly can pitch well. I brought up Pettitte as a good-looking strong pitcher. Pettitte has done an outstanding job. He's one of the top pitchers in baseball right now. Spoljaric doesn't have his experience, especially as a starter, but we've always liked his arm."
 
Leaving Kansas City
 In 1996, the Kansas City Royals had the weakest offense in the American League, so last winter they acquired Chili Davis, Jeff King and Jay Bell, then added Dean Palmer to their lineup just after midseason. The only member of that quartet who remains is King. The others have departed as free agents, taking with them 27 percent of the Royals' 1997 run production and 38 percent of their home runs.
 
Red Sox's New Attitude
 The Boston Red Sox masqueraded as a small-market team a year ago when they failed to offer Roger Clemens enough money to keep him from defecting to the Toronto Blue Jays. Now they have broken the bank -- theirs and everyone else's -- and created a new economic plateau by giving Pedro Martinez $75 million for six years.
The stunning signing prompted one baseball official to lump the Red Sox with some other teams and call the group "the five biggest hawks in baseball." The official referred to the hard-line position the Red Sox, the two Chicago teams, Atlanta and Florida in the marathon labor dispute and their subsequent contributions to the surging salary scale.
The White Sox gave $11 million a year to Albert Belle, the Marlins $10,166,667 to Gary Sheffield, the Cubs $10,625,000 to Sammy Sosa, the Braves $11.5 million to Greg Maddux and now the Red Sox $12.5 million to Martinez.
The $17.5 million salary called for in the option year of Martinez's contract (it would be for 2004) is the largest single-season salary to appear in a baseball contract. Previous high: $12.5 million for Maddux in 2001 and 2002.

Officials Say President Is Readying Child Care Plan
President Clinton will soon propose a major initiative to help working families obtain child care, with a variety of new Federal subsidies and tax breaks, Administration officials say.
The proposals, to be included in the State of the Union Message in late January, would include an increase in the Federal income tax credit that parents can take for child-care expenses; a new tax credit for businesses that build or operate child-care centers for employees, and an increase in the money that the Federal Government gives states to subsidize child care, the officials said. 1

HEADLINE: Union Tied To PRI Facing Ouster at Site In Tijuana

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Korean owners of a Tijuana factory have agreed in principle to cut ties to a government-controlled union with which they had signed a secret contract and to recognize an independent union formed by plant workers. The effects of the preliminary accord could reverberate through thousands of manufacturing plants across Mexico.
The preliminary agreement, which caps a turbulent six-month organizing drive, would, if formalized in legal documents, decertify a union affiliated with Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Executives at the Han Young truck chassis plant had signed a "protection" contract with the union affiliated with the PRI under which skilled welders were paid 85 cents an hour and blocked from forming their own union. 
 Jubilant union organizers, as well as officials of the Baja California state government and Han Young management, announced the preliminary accord late Friday. But today the same people said that a last-minute dispute had arisen over whether a state official would add his name as a guarantor or only as a witness, delaying signing of the five-page agreement. It was not immediately clear whether the delay put the accord at risk.
An agreement would be historic, labor organizers said, because never before have workers in any of Mexico's 2,700 tax-free maquiladora assembly plants succeeded in forming an independent union with no ties to the main government-controlled labor federations.
"This is a historic victory for our movement," Enrique Hernandez, an independent organizer who worked with the Han Young strikers, said in an interview Friday. "For the first time, workers in a maquiladora plant have won a fight to choose the kind of union they want."
In a statement, Han Young de Mexico S.A., a contractor for Hyundai Precision America, which makes tractor trailers, said: "In the end, the goal of every company based on foreign investment is production. Han Young has no objection to free labor association. The company will accept the union representation that the workers choose."
After American supporters of the Han Young workers called a boycott of Hyundai automobiles on Oct. 22, there were demonstrations in front of Hyundai dealerships in 25 American cities.
Mary Tong, director of the San Diego Support Committee for Maquiladora Workers, said she would send an E-mail message to a nationwide network of trade unionists and other sympathizers calling off the boycott once the accord is signed.
Alejandro Monraz Sustaita, deputy legal director for Baja California's state government, who mediated the 12 days of negotiations, said late Friday that the accord was backed by the state government but was not legally binding.
He said Han Young management had agreed to recognize the new union and reinstate several workers dismissed during the long dispute, paying them back wages. The workers committee agreed to withdraw several unfair labor practices suits, he said.
The state government has pledged to used its influence to insure that a state labor panel officially recognizes the new union early next year. The new union is to be called Unidad Obrera, or Worker Unity.
Government mediators urged Han Young executives to come to terms with the striking workers "to resolve a conflict that was getting out of hand," Mr. Monraz said.
Several Han Young welders said on Friday that they were abandoning a hunger strike, called to protest both the dismissal of 12 of the plant's 119 workers and what they have called a fraudulent Oct. 6 union election. But on Saturday they said they would not break their 23-day fast until the agreement was signed.

Default by Korea Feared

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
It is nail-biting time in South Korea as the nation's former miracle economy edges toward possible default on foreign debt. A record-breaking $57 billion bailout led by the International Monetary Fund failed to restore confidence in the Korean economy because foreign investors doubted the nation would seriously undertake reform of its debt-ridden financial system. 
 The South Korean currency, the won, went into a free fall. A credit squeeze sent businesses large and small scrambling to obtain funds merely to finance their day-to-day operations. By the end of the week Seoul was searching for new ways, and new money, to ward off a default that some analysts think could trigger a domino effect, hurting Japan and ultimately the United States.

HEADLINE: Albright Says South Africa Is a Model for Ties With U.S.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PRETORIA, South Africa, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today held up the United States' relationship with South Africa as an example of the type of ties it wants with countries across Africa.
The theme of Ms. Albright's weeklong tour of sub-Saharan Africa has been developing new partnerships with new leaders who embrace democratic reforms instead of the repression of the past. 
 "Nowhere is that truer than in our relationship with South Africa," Ms. Albright said, adding that the United States should "lecture less and listen more" and focus on economic development and trade rather than aid.
Ms. Albright, who met first with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and then separately with President Nelson Mandela, said, "We couldn't find problems." Mr. Mbeki agreed during a joint news conference and joked, "We tried to look for a few problems this morning and we didn't find any."
Nonetheless, the United States has been displeased with two visits that Mr. Mandela made to Libya to see its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, this fall. The two countries also have different ideas about the best approach to the Sudan, which is on the United States terrorist list. Earlier this week, Ms. Albright met with Sudanese opposition leaders and encouraged them to work together against the Islamic Government. South African leaders have taken a more neutral stance.
On another issue, South Africa initially balked at American-backed plans to train an all-African peacekeeping force, saying that African nations should lead the effort.
Mr. Mbeki is expected to be elected next week to succeed Mr. Mandela as head of the African National Congress, and he is likely to become President in 1999. And Mr. Mandela, by Ms. Albright's side, told her he would soon be playing second fiddle.
Mr. Mandela, was a political prisoner for 27 years before his release, which led to the transformation of South Africa. Ms. Albright said of him, "I stand in the presence of one of the great men of our century."
Asked about Libya, Mr. Mandela said he had invited Colonel Qaddafi to visit him in South Africa. Ms. Albright dismissed the topic, saying it was best handled in diplomatic circles.
The United States and South Africa are both trying to end the continuing violence against refugees in Rwanda, where 500,000 Tutsi were killed in a 1994 massacre by Hutu extremists.
They also are working to urge President Laurent Kabila of Congo, who met with Ms. Albright on Friday, to insure democratic reforms. Mr. Kabila took power in May after ousting Mobutu Sese Seko, whose dictatorship lasted three decades.
"We are of the same mind," Mr. Mbeki said, calling for the "cultivation of a culture of democracy and respect for human rights" across the continent.

HEADLINE: Asia's Surrender

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
For a decade, Asia's rising wealth has given the region's leaders the confidence to shrug off American demands that Wall Street powerhouses, huge foreign banks and insurance companies be granted full access to their markets.
But if money talks, the absence of money screams. And early this morning in Geneva, in the most vivid example yet of how Asia's sudden reversal of fortunes may also shift the world's financial balance of power, countries that only two years ago balked at concessions bowed to most of Washington's demands to open their financial markets to global competition. 
 It may take years before trade experts and economists can measure the impact of the 102-nation financial accord that was initialed in Geneva, committing countries to open up their financial markets starting in 1999. Like the global-warming agreement that emerged this week in Kyoto, Japan, the economic effects defy neat charts and graphs.
But the political significance was clear. When investors were clamoring for the right to pour money into Asia, the region's governments could set rules that clearly favored local companies and political favorites. Now that they are desperate to attract those investors back, they are suddenly eager to listen to the complaints of institutions like Citibank and New York Life -- which have chafed for years at rules that restrict their right to buy up local banks or sell life insurance to a burgeoning middle class.
"These are negotiations that have been going on for years, and we've had to try to wear down governments one at a time," Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative, said today after a long night of last-minute negotiations with Japan and Malaysia, both of which balked at letting American insurance companies go head-to-head with their own. "But it clearly helped that, in the end, they knew that they would compound their own problems if they sent a message that they would continue to close off parts of their markets to foreign investors."
Considering the smoking wreckage of collapsed financial institutions in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan, everyone at the table in Geneva feared that failure to reach an accord might send another shock to markets around the world. And in the end, some of the biggest concessions came from countries that have been forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund and to the United States for emergency financial aid, in hopes of restoring enough stability to their battered currency and stock markets to convince Western investors to come back.
"The difference from just two years ago," Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said today with considerable understatement, "is that in many countries the problem has shifted from managing capital to attracting capital." He was referring to the American decision in 1995 to scuttle an earlier version of this agreement rather than accept far less generous concessions from Asian countries that wanted to keep their markets closed.
Clearly, the deal struck today under the auspices of the two-year-old World Trade Organization fell far short of a clean win for Washington or Wall Street. American negotiators got much less from some nations than they had hoped, though by threatening to walk away from the table again they forced several countries -- notably Japan -- to make major last-minute concessions.
"If you let me draft the agreement, it would say that American companies could hold 100 percent of all their subsidiaries overseas," said Gary G. Benanav, the chairman of New York Life Worldwide Holdings, in a briefing at the White House today. "Obviously, it doesn't say that. But it's very good."
Indeed, just as many of the countries that a few months ago relished the label of "big emerging markets" were under pressure to strike a deal, so were Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Ms. Barshefsky. If the United States once again scuttled the accord because foreign market opening offers were insufficient, American officials feared they might worsen the financial instability that they are struggling to contain. And Ms. Barshefsky was clearly concerned that walking away from an accord could fuel the growing perception that the United States is using its status as the world's sole superpower to dictate how other nations must run their economies.
Resentment of American economic power is already palpable around the globe these days. And already there have been accusations that the United States, operating behind the scenes at the I.M.F. headquarters a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, has insisted on a laundry list of market-opening concessions from countries in return for a financial lifeline.
"There is a real risk of the revival of anti-Americanism," Clyde V. Prestowitz, Jr., the president of the Economic Strategy Institute, said here on Friday. "People all over town feel that they have to tread lightly, because the backlash next year could get pretty ugly."
Still, the United States clearly sees a chance to use Asia's crisis to score some economic points and some philosophical ones as well. A senior Administration official noted that "these are countries that for two decades have followed the Japanese model -- keep a tight control on your financial institutions and you control your economy."
Now, he said, "they have discovered the dark side of that strategy," the risks of ignoring sound financial practices like lending money to good borrowers -- instead of good friends.
The crisis in Korea, which worsened considerably this week, is perhaps the most vivid instance yet of how sloppy lending practices, cronyism and a closed financial system can lead to disaster.
Now several of the countries that were nurturing their own securities industries and banking empires -- hoping to build them into world powerhouses, as Japan did from the 1960's through the late 1980's -- are suddenly far more interested than they were a few months ago in bringing in major American and European companies. Those companies, they hope, will bring with them a fairly steady stream of capital.
Not everyone is on board. South Korea, for instance, has long kept a ceiling on the stake foreigners can hold in a securities company, and its negotiators barely budged in these talks, chiefly because their crisis-riddled Government was trying to keep the country out of default. But American officials seem confident that as part of the conditions for international aid to Korea, the country will discover that it has no choice but to open up.
The question hanging over the Clinton Administration, however, is whether its power to force future trade deals could be short-lived.
Congress has refused to grant Mr. Clinton negotiating authority, largely because of Democrats suspicious that most traditional trade deals end up working against the United States. It will be hard to make that case with this accord, because the American financial market is already wide open. But the Administration hopes to make the case that in areas where America holds a clear competitive edge -- especially in services like high finance -- it is foolish not to participate in the writing of new global rules.
"The rules are getting written with us or without us," Ms. Barshefsky said this week. "But I've never known a foreign country that voluntarily wrote the rules in a way that would be favorable to American interests."

HEADLINE: Economic 'Flu' Isn't Asia's Alone

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You should consider dropping the "Asian flu" metaphor from accounts of the financial crisis ("Many Players, Many Losers," Business Day, Dec. 10). 
 To suggest that a mysterious virus is to blame seems culturally condescending and is also wrong. This debacle originated in New York as well as in Jakarta, Bangkok, Seoul and Tokyo.
A more accurate metaphor would evoke psychological disorder. It afflicted global bankers and financiers, both American and foreign. Their lending and investing gradually became unhinged from the economic reality, as soaring returns fostered delusions of invincibility. This binge ended abruptly, as manias do. Their borrowers are smashed. Naturally, the lenders are depressed.
The United States and the International Monetary Fund propose to make them feel better by rescuing those creditors from their mistakes. Our United States credit (and tax money) will replenish failed borrowers so that they can pay back the notes held by our worried bankers. So bankers will start lending to them again. This is a bizarre approach to therapy; it rewards the patient for his own reckless illusions.
I do observe one form of "contagion" in the present crisis. It's a virus called self-doubt, which appears to be spreading among the usual cheerleaders for global finance. This is a healthy sign for the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Math Acceleration Should be Nurtured

 BODY:
I was appalled to read about the stance taken by the Garden City school administrators re: the Wertis child's request to get credit for a math course in which she received 100 on the New York State Regents exam without having taken the course, and similarly having her language endeavors impeded. "Student Denied Credit in Math Acceleration," Nov. 23.
As a Garden City resident and mother of four, I am aware that we've gone through many administrative changes in the last few years, but I can't believe that our community would endorse such educational malfeasance. An educator's job is to educate, not to hold back; every teacher's responsibility is to take each child as far as she can go intellectually. I also can't believe that any administrator would really countenance a child's sitting a full year in a class provably beneath that child's ability. I, as a parent, certainly understand the Wertis family's rage. 
 This incident doesn't necessarily represent the whole picture in Garden City. In a similar situation, one of my high school-aged daughters was allowed to test out of basic or intermediary courses in Spanish, math, economics, and also given the option to take a year of Independent Study with an English teacher rather that the standard advanced placement course.
Some children are unbelievably self-motivated; holding them back would be impossible.
Given the encouragement, such children will plot out their own areas of discovery -- as long as they have caring adults who give them opportunities to pursue their intellectual explorations. The reality is that society needs just such children to move forward.

HEADLINE: It Is Better to Give Than to Receive

BYLINE: By Claudia Dreifus; Claudia Dreifus is a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine and the author of "Interview," a collection of Q. & A.'s.

 BODY:
On a recent saturday, vartan gregorian, the president of the Carnegie Corporation, pointed to a solid wall of books in his new office that had just arrived from his old one. "For the first few months I was here, I had empty shelves," Gregorian said. "All my books were still at Brown University. It was unnerving to greet people in such a bare room. But now I can settle in. Even the most elegant room feels empty without books."
It doesn't take long to discern that books are at the center of Gregorian's life. As a boy in a provincial town in Iran, Gregorian, now 63, first absorbed a sense of the wider world at the library, reading novels in Armenian and Persian. In 1956, when he landed in New York as a scholarship student, the first institution he visited was the Public Library on 42d Street, which astounded him as "this grand building where you could look at any book you wanted without presenting your identity papers." 
 After getting a Ph.D. from Stanford, Gregorian wrote his own book, "The Emergence of Modern Afghanistan 1880-1946: The Politics of Modernization." He went on to teach at the University of Texas and at the University of Pennsylvania, where he became the dean of Arts and Sciences and, eventually, the provost.
In 1981, Gregorian took over the presidency of the New York Public Library, which was then a decaying, underfinanced and demoralized institution. He brought high-profile leadership to the library, initiating programs to restore its books, its buildings and its standing at the center of New York's cultural life. That accomplished, he moved on to the presidency of Brown. And now, at Carnegie, he'll manage an endowment of about $1.5 billion, to be spent on education and world peace. He is also planning to write a book with the working title, "The Concept of the Educated Person From the Renaissance to the Present."
Q: Now that you're a donor rather than a fund-raiser, do you have any insights on whether it's better to give or to receive?
Vartan Gregorian: Oh, I think it's better to give. Much better. Since coming to Carnegie, I'm beginning to understand St. Francis of Assisi's dictum that it is in giving that we receive -- the receiver finishes the task that the giver has begun. It's something like, when a reader reads a book, he finishes the work started by the author.
Q: People say that you've been a grandmaster of receiving. David Rockefeller tells a story of how you once raised $2 million from him on a day that he hadn't planned on giving anything.
A: It was three million. Brooke Astor, Dick Salomon and I went to see him for the New York Public Library. And I was not supposed to make the solicitation. But -- can you imagine me saying this? -- I jumped in with, "Relax, David. I'm not going to ask you for $10 million, only 3." And he did give three million. A year later, at a dinner, he put his arm around me and said, "Thank you, Greg, for saving me $7 million." And you know, all these years it has bothered me: would I have gotten $10 million if I'd asked?
Q: What makes you such an effective fund-raiser?
A: The fact that I -- this David Rockefeller story aside -- seldom ask for money. I appeal to people's intellect and social conscience rather than to their guilt and their vanity. Second, I'm not an ideologue -- I don't ask people to give to ideological causes.
Q: Is there a seamy side to fund-raising?
A: Not for a good cause. Now, what I do find hard is that you sometimes try to please a donor by suppressing your own views. There have been times when I refused to try to raise funds from one or two people because I didn't respect them. These were very rich people without integrity or moral standing. Also, when I was president of the New York Public Library, there were several politicians I wouldn't go to for help, because they were the most arrogant sorts of people, and I was afraid I might hurt the institution by going after them -- no, I won't name them here.
Q: One Brown alumnus, Ted Turner, recently shook the philanthropic world by pledging a billion dollars to the United Nations. What was your take on his action?
A: That it was very important. Before Ted Turner announced his billion-dollar gift, he asked me, "What's the biggest gift ever given?" I told him, "If you have to ask, you can't afford it." He said, "Well, how about a billion?" I told him, "A billion isn't what it used to be."
After he made the announcement, Ted Turner came to see me. He told me that I was responsible for his giving in general -- because I initiated him in the art of giving. He said, "The first check I wrote to Brown, for 25 million, my hand was shaking. Now it doesn't shake anymore."
What Ted Turner has done is raise the national bar for giving -- along with Walter Annenberg and George Soros, both of whom have really provided enlightened leadership in philanthropy. Turner thinks that instead of having the Forbes 400 richest people, they should print the 400 most generous people.
Q: Who would be on your personal list?
A: Brooke Astor. Because she had the idea that her husband's wealth was made in New York and she would give it in New York, and she did not give it abstractly: she has visited every project she has funded. The Rose brothers, Fred and Dan Rose -- they also give to New York because their wealth was made here. Walter Annenberg -- he raised the bar because he has given away more than $2 billion. Ted Turner, in terms of the environment and the use of CNN to raise consciousness. The late Richard Salomon, who used to say, "You have to give until it hurts." Irene Diamond -- she had so much impact on helping to solve AIDS. Agnes Gund, who gives anonymously if she can. David Rockefeller -- the public part of what he's done is the tip of the iceberg.
Barbara Goldsmith, the writer, has organized a group of publishers and 100 writers to sign a declaration that they will publish only on acid-free paper. This was a tremendous thing for libraries everywhere. The Gottesman sisters -- the three of them and their spouses have been tremendous to the library, the Jewish Museum and other institutions. Randolph Hearst, and his corporation. Very quietly, he's put a major effort into improving the schools in Bakersfield, Calif.
Q: I notice that the richest man in America is not on your list -- Bill Gates. In fact, he's long been criticized for not being philanthropic enough. Last summer, though, he announced that he was giving American public libraries some $400 million in cash and software so that they can be connected to the Internet. Did you have anything to do with this gift?
A: Three years ago, I went to see him about providing a digital reference library to American high schools. I explained how doing that would eliminate the class distinction of rich school districts having access to these materials while poor ones don't. I spent two hours with him and did not hear anything except some voice-mail message to the effect of, Why don't you be a pro bono adviser to me, like you are to Walter Annenberg?
Q: Aha, so that's the secret of Bill Gates's success: you go to him for money, and he asks you to work for him for free.
A: Something like that. Recently, though, I got a fax saying that he'd like me to be a trustee of his foundation and that this money would be for public libraries rather than school libraries. And I am happy to tell you that I've been to a trustees meeting, and the first place this gift is going to is libraries in Alabama, one of the poorest states in the country.
Q: About your new job: the Carnegie Corporation has two primary missions -- education and peace. Your predecessor, David Hamburg, emphasized education. Will you also?
A: Hamburg did both. I've just begun to settle in, so I can't give you too many concrete plans. I can describe areas of interest, though. Overall, I'd like Carnegie to do things that nobody else is doing now, but I'd also like to promote cooperation with other foundations.
The way I see it is, if Soros is studying the Russian economy and Bertelsmann is studying Soviet military demobilization and Carnegie is studying Russian nuclear waste, why can't we issue a single report and call it "Russia in the 21st Century"? This way everyone can get credit and we can also have a bigger impact and get some debate going.
I'm very worried about Russia, with its tremendous nuclear arsenal, unpaid military forces, impoverished scientists.
Q: But what can a foundation do? You're not the State Department.
A: I think, for instance, we could pay some attention to the universities of the former Soviet Union. In many regions of Russia, they are still using Soviet textbooks. Professors have become part-time entrepreneurs. Higher education has almost completely collapsed. This is one area where the various American foundations can act. We won't act as lobbyists, but we can educate people.
Q: What about domestic American concerns?
A: Again, I can give you an outline of issues that attract me. Campaign-finance reform, immigration, the role of technology in the future of the teaching of the liberal arts, telecommunications policy are a few areas.
And the education of journalists. Journalism schools are teaching journalistic techniques rather than subject matter. Journalists should be cultured people who know about history, economics, science. Instead they are learning what is called nuts and bolts. Like schools of education, journalism schools should either be reintegrated intellectually into the university or they should be abolished.
I'm also interested in the aging of America. In a few decades, one in four Americans will be 65 or over. All the entertainment and all the cultural programming is done primarily for teen-agers and the middle-aged. The elderly are considered a health factor, but no one is paying attention to their cultural and educational needs.
Q: The former Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander now heads a private organization called the National Commission on Philanthropy and Civic Renewal, which issued a report criticizing the large foundations for pushing what he terms "broad social theories" instead of concentrating on "well-defined, concrete problems." His basic point was that the big foundations are nothing more than agents of big government.
A: I don't agree with him. Foundations were created to do things that government could not. And that's the way it ought to be.
Q: As government spending for domestic social programs has declined, there's been a call for private charity to fill the vacuum.
A: Foundations can only study and serve as catalysts. Their function is to stimulate, assist, ask questions and risk being critical. They cannot replace ongoing, sustained national commitments. For example, education in America is something like a half-trillion-dollar-a-year enterprise. We're talking about each foundation perhaps giving a billion or two. That won't even pay for the olive in the martini.
Q: Some people in the foundation world are saying that you're going to put a lot of Carnegie money into conflict resolution. True?
A: Well, that is a great interest of mine. One particular concern I have is the way some religious authorities are using secular powers to advance religious causes. And I'd like to see if there couldn't be more dialoguing among theologians of the various faiths so that every argument doesn't turn into a political argument but remains a theological dispute. I'd like to see more discussions with leaders of the three faiths that have Abraham at center stage -- Jews, Christians, Muslims. As an Armenian Catholic, I'd be interested in seeing why everyone is always emphasizing where they differ rather than where they have things in common.
Q: You grew up in the part of the world where religious conflict is intense.
A: I was born in Tabriz, in Iran. If you saw "Cinema Paradiso," that was my childhood -- there were two movie houses and the films changed every six months. We saw footage of Stalingrad and El Alamein in the newsreels, half a year after the events took place. However, the war came home to us in tremendous shortages. My mother died in 1941, when I was 6, from an infection because there were no medicines available.
The Armenian Apostolic Church -- where I was an altar boy -- and the local library were the only outlets for me. At the library, I read anything I could get my hands on, in either Armenian or Persian. Books were my treasures, because other than the church liturgy, they were the first signs of color I saw. Tabriz was a place on the sidelines of history, and it was oddly colorless.
Q: Don't people make lovely rugs in Tabriz?
A: Yes, and to this day people think that because I'm Armenian and come from Tabriz, I'm a great expert on rugs. They always say, "I have a beautiful rug -- I'd like your opinion." And I say, "I know little about carpets." And they say, "Oh, don't be bashful." So I go, turn the rug over, scratch the back of it and declare, "Magnificent!"
Q: Let's talk about the job you've just left. You were the president of Brown for eight years. Can you give us your valedictory to the life of a modern university president?
A: The country expects universities to defend civilization, provide leadership, keep the national memory alive, overcome all social problems and do everything that the family and the church haven't done. The modern university president has to build consensus, raise funds, deal with 10,000 laws and regulations and all the while keep the students, faculty and alumni happy. And you must do all this without ever losing your temper. And also without being controversial.
I found it very tough to not be able to express my own opinions freely. You had to be an exemplar, and you could never make mistakes. Another problem was not having any time to lead a contemplative life. On the other hand, there were so many joyful moments with the students. Graduation exercises, for instance. And then, every year you get 2,000 new students to educate. And I love that.
Q: But you found your nonacademic responsibilities draining?
A: The area of sexual mores, which university administrations are often being asked to adjudicate -- now, that was a problem. There weren't many cases like that, but when something did happen, it took up all your energy.
A lot of times it's one person's word against another's. How do you deal with that? Date rape is very problematic, especially if both parties use alcohol, which happens often.
I had to deal with one case, for instance, that had come all the way up to my level. A couple had sex off-campus and the issue was whether the second time was authorized or not. The woman said she didn't remember the second incident on the same night -- so it couldn't have been consensual. That shocked me. Because if the first incident on the same night is consensual, what is the second time? I do believe that no means no. But with this case I felt, Why are you bringing this to me?
Q: One of the big fault lines in higher education is over affirmative action. What's your position?
A: I think affirmative action is necessary, at least at this stage in our history. At Brown, we did have a program for women in engineering. If two applicants were equally qualified, we would admit the woman because we wanted to encourage women in this area.
In the end, affirmative action at the university level isn't even the answer. What is needed is to reform public education in order to eliminate the social disparities. How long will we need affirmative action? As long as K through 12 education is unequal and weak.
Q: Of all the jobs you've held in your lifetime, which was the most important to you?
A: The New York Public Library. When I got there, the library was in great decline. Yet there was no way New York could lose it. My approach was that if I failed to renew it, it would be a great martyrdom. If I succeeded, it would be a miracle.
There were wonderful people who made success possible, like Andrew Heiskell, the chairman, and Brooke Astor. The first thing we did was get rid of an ad campaign that showed the library being turned into a parking lot. Nobody wants to give to an institution that's in danger of becoming a parking lot.
Then we cleaned the front of the building, air-conditioned the library, renovated and modernized it and built hundreds of miles of stacks -- veritable catacombs -- under Bryant Park, adjoining the library. Bryant Park was a center of crime and drug dealing. One way to clear away the drug dealers was to put a fence around the library. This was the best $80,000 we ever spent. We blocked one corner for two years and it changed the path of drug dealing. Bryant Park was also dirty and bare. People stole the flowers and shrubbery. So we sent a bouquet to the Police Commissioner with a note: "These are the last flowers that will ever be seen in Bryant Park." He was so impressed -- the man had never gotten flowers at the police station before -- that he assigned eight officers to protect the shrubbery.
Q: Will you be able to be as much of a showman at Carnegie?
A: I'm not a showman. I'm a missionary and a public witness -- for a cause, a message, an institution. Let me illustrate. At the New York Public Library, I got sick of hearing about how bad all our schools were. So I said, "Why don't we celebrate at least the valedictorians of the public schools." I invited each valedictorian to Astor Hall and afterward had their collective picture taken on the steps of the library. It dramatized their excellence. And gradually, the politicians thought that they should be present in that picture. Soon you had borough presidents and city councilmen showing up for the ceremony. And this built support for the library. Is this showmanship -- or focusing attention on a good cause?
Q: Do you have a sense of what you would like written on your tombstone?
A: No, but I always joke that I'd like to be buried in those 90 miles of book stacks that we built under Bryant Park. It's quiet, and people will leave me alone. Besides, it's fully paid for. Anne Getty contributed more than a million dollars for the topsoil over those stacks.

HEADLINE: In Poll, Americans Reject Means But Not Ends of Racial Diversity

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

 BODY:
As the national debate over affirmative action intensifies, most Americans today endorse the goal of racial diversity in schools and offices, but reject some of the main methods used so far to achieve it, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll.
In a survey marked by ambivalence and tangled views, a majority of Americans did not want to end affirmative action immediately, as many politicians have proposed, but did oppose the idea of making hiring and admissions decisions based on race. 
 Even as they criticized preferences based on race and gender, however, Americans seemed eager to support affirmative action based on economic class. Majorities of both blacks and whites said they favored policies that give specific preferential treatment in college admissions and employment to people from poor families over those from middle-class or rich families.
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is consistent with a decade of previous polling on this issue. When the Times/CBS survey first began asking about racial preferences in 1985, Americans were evenly divided. But opinion turned overwhelmingly against racial preferences in the late 1980's, was particularly hostile toward them in the recessionary years of the early 1990's and has remained negative ever since.
The new poll also highlights the political land mines around this issue. Opponents of affirmative action are aggressively promoting measures in state legislatures and in referendum efforts that would ban the practice. But in general, the survey suggests that Americans are not so much inclined to abolish affirmative action as to search for a new but elusive middle ground.
Many people of both races said they were uncomfortable with the ways that affirmative action had been made into such a divisive matter, and they often tended to fault politicians for drumming the issue. Black respondents, however, were more likely to say that affirmative action was needed to redress bias in society, while whites were more likely to say that banning it was a positive step toward eliminating that bias.
"The whole issue is just another wedge tool used by the politicians," said Sylvester Haywood, 43, an insurance broker in Gary, Ind., who is black. "If everything was truly equal, if people could deal with each other on a rational level rather than on whims and emotions, of course, we wouldn't need affirmative action. But it's not."
But Barbara Elias-Baker, 51, a retired research chemist in San Francisco, who is white, said that while she supports "an extra effort in providing training programs for minorities," she believes that preferences based on race are divisive and unfair. "Quotas are not the way to deal with the problem of unemployment in minority neighborhoods," Ms. Elias-Baker said. "I've seen several cases where promotions were given to a Hispanic or a black and the candidates were on equal footing."
Both black and white Americans say that diversity is important in the nation's universities and workplaces and that they favor "special efforts" to help racial minorities compete. But asked if they supported policies that offer specific preference to qualified applicants based on skin color, strong majorities of whites said no, while the opinions of blacks varied significantly depending on how the question was phrased.
Reflecting the modern politics of race, the survey did not find wide differences in attitudes toward ending affirmative action based on what region people lived in. But it did find differences based on education and income. For instance, whites with a college degree were more likely to favor abolishing affirmative action (by a margin of 57 percent to 34 percent) than those with a high school degree or less (31 percent favor abolishing, 51 percent oppose). Similarly, those with annual incomes above $50,000 were much more likely to favor abolishing affirmative action than those who make $30,000 a year or less.
The Times/CBS poll, a nationwide telephone survey of 1,258 adults, was conducted Dec. 6 to 9. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The poll results also indicate that the issue of affirmative action, much like abortion, is particularly sensitive to semantics.
Black and white respondents tended to give similar answers to a hypothetical question about college admissions, in which a school can choose only one candidate between white and black applicants who are equally qualified. Asked whether the black applicant should be admitted to help achieve more racial balance in the college, clear majorities of both races -- 69 percent of whites and 63 percent of blacks -- said no, that race should not be a factor in the decision.
But there was a wide disparity between the races on a related question: "Do you believe that where there has been job discrimination against blacks in the past, preference in hiring or promotion should be given to blacks today?" Whites still said no to this question, by a margin of 57 percent to 31 percent. But 62 percent of blacks answered yes, while 23 percent said no.
 On the other hand, strong majorities of both races said they would favor "special educational programs to assist minorities in competing for college admissions."
Recent referendums have also offered contradictory readings on the public mood, and differences in wording may be at least partly responsible. In California last year, voters approved a measure banning the practice, in an initiative that was couched in language making any sort of "preferential treatment" in state-sponsored programs illegal. But in Houston last month, voters decisively said no when they were simply asked whether they wished to end the city's affirmative action programs in city hiring and contracting.
With some minor exceptions, the latest Times/CBS poll showed that respondents generally described their views about affirmative action programs intended to help women in the same way that they described programs based on race.
 
Three Questions, Complex Views
The complexity of views on affirmative action seemed particularly evident in a series of three questions in the poll that all began with the phrase, "In order to make up for past discrimination," and went on to ask respondents their views on particular policies.
For example, asked their views on programs that "give preferential treatment to racial minorities," only 26 percent -- including 21 percent of whites and 51 percent of blacks -- said they would favor such programs. Just 19 percent -- 15 percent of whites and 48 percent of blacks -- said they would favor programs that "impose quotas for racial minorities."
But asked their views about programs that "make special efforts to help minorities get ahead," Americans of both races seemed vastly more comfortable with this vaguer language. Fifty-five percent of the respondents, including 50 percent of whites and 80 percent of blacks, said they would favor such programs.
What, exactly, does "special efforts" mean? Follow-up interviews conducted after the poll with many of the respondents indicated that there was no consensus on this question. But in general Americans seem to feel that any kind of education or training programs that help to get people to the same place in some mythical "starting line" are good, while anything that gives one group a head start in the race itself is not good.
"I favor perhaps making an extra effort in providing training programs in the schools for minorities to get their skills up to par so they can compete with all other ethnic groups," said Denise Siino, a 39-year-old freelance journalist in Santa Ana, Calif., who is white. But, she added, "No ethnic group, including whites, should get preferential treatment in job placement or college admissions based solely on race."
Many black Americans also voiced serious qualms about preferential treatment based on race. "You can't make up for past mistakes by making hiring preferences," said Ruby Hall, 59, a retired accounting technician in Forestville, Md., who is black. "In many cases the jobs are available but people aren't qualified because of their education."
Ms. Hall said she would support programs that help children who lack basic reading and writing skills reach college.
"This would include special education classes or tutoring programs," Ms. Hall said. "This needs to start as early as the third grade in elementary school so kids don't fall behind."
 
Blacks and Whites: Opinions in Contrast
Still, there were often wide gaps in the ways that white and black Americans viewed affirmative action. Blacks were much more likely to support any kind of affirmative action program, and were much more likely to say that discrimination persists in the workplace and in society at large.
Blacks and whites also exhibited sharply contrasting views in their responses to a question about what constitutes a bigger problem in the workplace -- blacks losing out because of racial discrimination, or whites losing out because of affirmative action.
The overall pool of those surveyed was almost exactly split on the answer. But white people, by 39 percent to 31 percent, described "whites losing out" as the bigger problem, while black people, by 63 percent to 10 percent, said "blacks losing out" was a bigger issue. (Remaining numbers for both races either said both problems were equally serious or said they didn't know.)
Whites were also much less likely to say that race has ever been a factor, one way or the other, in whether they got a job or promotion. Eighty-three percent of whites said they believed it simply had never been a factor for them, but blacks offered a much more textured range of answers to this question: 21 percent said their race had helped them in such a situation, 26 percent said it had hurt, 5 percent said it had helped in some cases and hurt in others and 46 percent said it had not been a factor.
Among all those of both races who said they favor banning affirmative action, whites were much more likely than blacks to say they would stand by that view even if it meant fewer black professionals and university students. Given a specific example of a professional field, white people were also much less likely than blacks to say that affirmative action programs were necessary "to make sure there are more black doctors."
 
Races Seem Close On Core Principles
In many other ways, though, the two racial groups seemed closer on the issues than often seems to be assumed when the subject of affirmative action comes up for discussion.
Both races seemed to agree on some core principles, among them that laws are still needed to protect racial minorities from discrimination, that racial diversity is an important aim, that special efforts and "outreach programs" to help minorities advance are acceptable and even laudable, but that specific racial preferences often are not.
Blacks and whites were also much more likely to say that, in general, white applicants for schools and jobs win out over equally qualified black applicants and that white people have a better chance of getting ahead in society than black people do.
And, given a more open-ended way to explain their views on affirmative action than a straight favor-or-oppose question, Americans of both races would seem to agree that the programs need to be preserved in some fashion.
Asked what society should do with "affirmative action programs giving preference to some minorities," people were much more inclined to say that they should be maintained or revised than they were to say that they should be abolished.
In the poll, 24 percent of respondents (21 percent of whites, 36 percent of blacks) favored leaving the programs alone, and 43 percent (41 percent of whites, 56 percent of blacks) favored changing them. But only 25 percent (30 percent of whites and 3 percent of blacks) said they would "do away" with such programs.
Similarly, despite the vote in California that basically asked whether affirmative action should be banned immediately, respondents in the poll seemed much more comfortable with a more amorphous option.
Asked whether affirmative action programs should be ended now, phased out or continued, just 12 percent of those polled -- 13 percent of whites and less than 1 percent of blacks -- said they should be ended now. Forty percent (45 percent of whites, 17 percent of blacks) favored phasing out the programs, and 41 percent (35 percent of whites, 80 percent of blacks) said they should be continued.
The poll focused on the attitudes of white and black Americans and, while members of other minority groups were surveyed, their numbers were not large enough to provide a statistically reliable snapshot of the attitudes of Hispanic and Asian Americans.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 6-9 with 1,258 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
Black Americans and residents of California were sampled at somewhat higher than normal rates in order to facilitate analysis of these groups, and were then weighted back to their proper proportion of the overall population.
The results have also been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for blacks taken as a group it is plus or minus seven percentage points.
There were insufficient Asian or Hispanic respondents in the poll to separate out either of those groups' views with confidence.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;
Muni Bonds: You Can Take Them With You

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN 

 BODY:

Q. I'm retiring and moving to Florida. Do I have to sell my New York State municipal bonds and replace them with Florida bonds?
 
B. INGHAM
Syosset, N.Y. 
 A. Setting up shop in a new location usually causes some confusion. Years back, for instance, General Motors realized that Nova, its popular Chevy model, meant "It won't go" when translated into Spanish.
But one thing is certain: When it comes to a municipal bond, you can take it with you. No law prohibits you from owning the bonds of one state after you have moved to another.
However, most municipal bonds do have a home-state advantage. Such bonds are typically free from Federal income tax. But when you live in the issuing state, the interest is usually free from state and local income taxes, too. Generally, this is not so with out-of-state bonds: If you live in, say, California and own New York municipal bonds, you will pay California tax on the bond income.
But that does not mean you should necessarily sell or swap your New York bonds for Florida ones. To decide, do the math.
Specifically, you must determine if the yield on the New York munis, minus the taxes you must pay Florida on those out-of-state bonds, will be greater than the yield you would get on Florida municipal bonds. The calculation demands a close look at yields, tax rates and commissions.
For the most part, the current interest-rate climate dictates bond yields. Variations tend to reflect the differences in bond quality -- their credit ratings, maturities, call provisions and so on. But you may still want to comparison-shop because, just like the highway speed limit, bond yields can vary slightly from state to state. This is a result of the supply of and demand for the bonds.
Florida may be as renowned for its freedom from an individual income tax as it is for Key lime pie. But the Florida life is not all sweet when it comes to investment income. The state levies a tax on intangible personal property, like cash, stocks and most bonds (but not Florida munis).
The intangibles tax sets a rate of $2 for every $1,000 worth of investments, as measured by their fair market value. However, the first $20,000 ($40,000 for joint filers) of your bonds is exempt from all tax. The next $80,000 ($160,000 for joint filers) is subject to an assessment of only $1 per $1,000. Only for investments in excess of $100,000 ($200,000 for joint filers) would you pay the full $2 per $1,000.
In other words, unless you are a mogul or a movie star, "you may discover that in the case of Florida, the tax is quite minimal" on out-of-state munis, said Marybeth Whyte, a director at Salomon Brothers Asset Management. For instance, for a single person, the tax on the market value of $80,000 of bonds would be only $60 and the tax on $100,000 worth would be $80 -- about the price of a day at Disney World.
But commissions must also be considered. At a typical 1 percent commission, it would cost $2,000 to sell $100,000 in muni bonds and then to buy new ones. And if your New York bonds have appreciated, you may also have to pay tax on the gains.
The commission seems hefty compared with the $80 tax. But before deciding to stay with your New York bonds, remember that you will pay the commission only once. The intangibles tax will be due every year. If your New York bonds have 30 years to maturity, for example, your intangibles payments will total $2,400.
After you have crunched the numbers, you can decide whether to hold your old bonds or to buy new ones. But there are other considerations.
If you opt to swap, for example, you may want to buy Florida bonds with a longer duration than the ones you are selling. By extending the maturity, you can normally receive a higher yield and make up some of the outlay for the commission and any taxes due on the gains. However, during that longer time there is a greater risk of rising interest rates, in which case the value of your bonds would fall. That doesn't matter, of course, if you hold them to maturity.
You may also want to check with a Florida broker. "A local broker may have better access to the Florida muni market," said Robert Zipf, author of "How the Bond Market Works" (Prentice-Hall, $17.95).
Another factoid: The Florida intangibles tax is figured on your investments as of one day only, Dec. 31. It doesn't matter what you own during the rest of the year. Think of it as the Sunshine State's own little way of saying "Happy New Year."
Despite all the fine points, there are general rules for munis and moving. For example, if you are going to a high-tax state, like Massachusetts or New Jersey, a bond swap is more likely to be in your interest than if you go to a lower-tax state.
Also, watch your tax bracket. If you are retiring as well as moving, you may no longer be in a bracket high enough to make munis worthwhile. The best course, then -- assuming you want to keep holding bonds -- is to sell your munis in favor of Treasuries, which are federally taxable although exempt from state and local taxes, or corporate bonds, which are taxed at all levels.
Nevertheless, many people who own muni bonds are in too low a bracket for the bonds to make sense, Mr. Zipf said. So why do they own them? Three reasons, he said. Some investors just prefer not having to set aside a portion of their interest checks for taxes. Others may have fallen into a lower tax bracket -- through a job change, retirement or a business loss -- since the original purchase was made. And some buyers simply do not realize that they could be getting a better return from a taxable bond.
But if muni bonds are right for you, pack a calculator with the sunscreen when you head to Florida. Don't expect to avoid the hard work even on the "miracle flight" -- the name a flight attendant friend of mine has given her New York-Florida route. About 20 wheelchairs are requested for the flight's pre-boarding , but, oddly, not for disembarking. Moments after landing in Fort Lauderdale, most of the former invalids are seen striding briskly into the sunshine. Our very own Lourdes.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A listing of state tax provisions with the Minding Your Business column on Dec. 14, about investing in municipal bonds, referred incompletely to six states' treatment of those investments. Those states -- Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and Wisconsin -- levy taxes on only some of the bonds they have issued, and in some of the states, the exempt bonds are numerous. A reader's letter dated Jan. 9, pointing out the error, was delayed in routing at The Times.
 

GRAPHIC: Charts: "When Tax-Free Makes Sense"
Municipal bonds have lower yields than taxable bonds. In return, the muni investor generally pays no Federal income tax and often no state or local income tax, either.
The higher the tax bracket, the more appealing munis are. Investors in the 39.6 percent bracket would need a taxable bond yielding 8.28 percent to get the same return, after taxes, as from a muni yielding 5 percent. But for investors in the 28 percent bracket, the taxable-equivalent yield for the same muni is just 6.94 percent.
As a group, munis now have relatively high yields, paying 5.26 percent on average, according to the Bond Buyer index. That is about 90 percent of what comparable, federally taxable Treasuries earn -- well above the normal range of 75 to 80 percent. Chart shows muni and equivalent taxable yield by tax bracket.
 
"Unusual States"
Most states have an income tax and impose it on out-of-state munis but not on in-state bonds. Still, there are exceptions, including these.
 
* Seven states have no income tax: Alaska, Florida*, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wyoming.
 
* Six states tax both in-state and out-of-state munis: Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin.
 
* Three states have income taxes, but impose them on neither in-state nor out-of-state munis: Indiana, Utah, North Dakota.+
 
*Florida does impose an intangible personal property tax on out-of-state munis, however. +Only if investors use the short state-tax form.

HEADLINE: Iraqis' Suffering Widens as U.N. Sanctions Drag On

BYLINE: By HADANI DITMARS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The restaurants and cafes are often empty. Movie theaters are closed, and the few nightclubs left in this once bustling, prosperous city are frequented by a handful of wealthy "embargo cats" -- smugglers who have made a fortune evading the United Nations sanctions to import everything from tires to lingerie.
The trade embargo, which was imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, has cut across class lines, from the poor of Saddam City in the popular quarter of Baghdad to the rapidly disappearing middle class. 
 Taxi drivers with doctorates are commonplace as people struggle to get by on an average monthly income of less than $5, down considerably from 1991. Government bureaucrats who once earned comfortable salaries now take home the equivalent of $2 dollars a month and drive broken-down cars with smashed windshields and rusting engines. Spare parts are restricted by the embargo.
American officials hold President Saddam Hussein responsible for the economic and social collapse of his country. The Iraqi leader, they insist, is cynically using his populace as pawns in a public-relations effort to gain relief from the sanctions, which the United Nations has said will remain in effect until its inspectors verify that the country has destroyed its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
Mr. Hussein, in turn, blames the embargo for the suffering of the Iraqi people, and has repeatedly criticized the United States for its insistence that it remain in place.
The United Nations has allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion in oil every six months to pay for food and medicine. Iraqi officials say the amounts are insufficient and that the program is slow and inefficient at distributing the aid.
Whatever its cause, the suffering in Baghdad and surrounding cities appears real.
According to Unicef, which relies largely on Iraqi-provided statistics, the infant mortality rate has nearly doubled in the last six years -- from 61 per thousand in 1991 to 117 per thousand today.
The average number of children under 5 killed by respiratory infections, malnutrition and diarrheal illnesses has increased from 500 a month in 1991 to 8,000 in 1996. The United Nations agency estimates that one third of the children in Iraq are malnourished, a figure comparable to sub-Saharan Africa.
Eric Falt, a spokesman for the United Nations relief operations in Iraq, said, "The status of Iraqi children can now be associated with the most disadvantaged countries in the world." Mr. Falt said the meager rations given to Iraqis under the United Nations program were simply not enough.
The per capita distribution per month includes about 20 pounds of flour, 5.5 pounds of rice, 4.4 pounds of sugar, 5.4 ounces of tea, 2.2 pounds of chick peas and beans, 5.4 ounces of salt, 2.2 pounds of cooking oil, 9 ounces of soap, 12.6 ounces of detergent, and 6 pounds of infant formula for children under 2.
The so-called food-basket does not include any animal protein, vitamins or minerals. It includes no meat, fish, poultry or fruits and vegetables.
These rations were in place for August and September. They have since been smaller, mainly because of delays in delivery and in the United Nations Security Council's approval of the contracts for oil sales.
The food aid reaches Iraq through a circuitous process. First, the United Nations sanctions committee in New York authorizes Iraq to pump oil, which is then sold on the international market. The money is deposited in a bank account controlled by the United Nations, which must approve each food purchase. Distribution of the food in Iraq is then handled by the Iraqi Government in central and southern Iraq and by United Nations officials in northern Iraq.
The lack of food is felt keenly in Saddam City, one of Baghdad's poorer neighborhoods. Malek, a 13-year-old market boy, quit school two years ago to support his family. He spends 12-hour days as a delivery boy in the local market, where he and bands of other children ply their trade with rusting iron carts, carrying produce back and forth for vendors.
In the rain, he walks in cracked plastic shoes through streets strewn with sewage. His breakfast on a recent morning was a thin porridge of leftover rice and beans. Supper may be some bread with a little oil.
The skinny youth has an old-man's face, pale and drawn with dark circles. He says his father is too ill to work, and the kidney operation he needs is far beyond the family's meager means. His two older brothers, ages 16 and 21, have been unemployed since the embargo began.
Malek said he hoped to become a doctor some day, but has no immediate plans to return to school. Although his friends chant "Down, Down America" almost haphazardly, as a kind of nursery rhyme, he does not seem to share the sentiment.
"One day, when I'm rich, I want to go to America," he said wistfully. On a good day at the market, Malek earns about 80 cents.
Meanwhile, in a once-middle-class neighborhood 15 minutes away, Kamal, a cafe owner, serves his first cappuccinos of the day to a young couple dressed in relatively stylish attire. The man wears what appears to be a Rolex; the woman wears gold jewelry.
"Embargo cat" he whispered to a foreign visitor, describing a customer willing to pay half a civil servant's monthly salary for two coffees.
Kamal cannot afford to drink at his own cafe. His family, he said, can afford to eat meat only three times a month.
But he has been to America, and many other places. Now, though, he must live in Iraq.
Before the war, he was an engineer for an Arab company in the Persian Gulf.
When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, he was unceremoniously dismissed by his Saudi employers. Officially, he was given "open leave" with a chance to return, but he does not expect to do so anytime soon.
Kamal took over the cafe from his father in 1991, and manages to eke out a living of $60 dollars a month.
"It's not enough" he said, "but somehow we get by." To feed their two children, he and his wife have sold most of their prized possessions -- silver, jewelry, china -- the likes of which can be seen in shops throughout Baghdad's better neighborhoods.
He refuses to let his children work -- something he sees as an option only for the lower classes -- and insists that they stay in school. His income is only slightly higher than that of Malek's family. And he worries about his children.
What if one should get sick? Last year, he managed to buy a special inhaler for his severely asthmatic son, at $100. "I can't depend on the hospital anymore," he said. "If I took him there it might take three hours before they could help him. By then he might already be dead."
Often, Kamal must choose between buying nutritious food for his children and providing them with medicine when they are sick. Even the price of a bottle of aspirin is formidable.
If any of his few remaining possessions are stolen, Kamal said, he could be in financial ruin.
As a safeguard against Baghdad's rising crime rate, Kamal has recently purchased a German Shepherd dog.
"This allows us to leave the house for a few hours," he said. "Before the dog, someone had to be there all the time."

HEADLINE: Down Country Roads, Come Modern Phones

BYLINE: By DAVID BATSTONE 

DATELINE: PAICINES, Calif.

 BODY:
Lisa Knutson once believed that sharing a phone line with seven other ranches in rural California was romantic.
But in late 1995, she began marketing nutrition products out of her home near Tres Pinos, an hour's drive southeast of San Jose. The business quickly attracted her neighbors' interest. 
 "I can't tell you how many times I was interrupted in the middle of a sales call to be asked when the line would be free," Ms. Knutson said. "Other times I was the one waiting hours for an open line."
Eight months after starting her business, Ms. Knutson and her husband sold their home and moved to a more populated region -- mainly, she said, so she could get phone service from Pacific Bell.
Too bad she didn't live a few miles to the south. On his ranch in Paicines, about 13 miles from Tres Pinos, Rex Bryan runs the Pinnacles Telephone Company, laboring so that ranchers and farmers need not make the choice between rural life and modern technology. While more than half of Pinnacles' customers were on party lines six years ago, today they all receive private service.
Pinnacles is the smallest of 11 telephone companies still independently owned in California. With annual revenue of slightly more than $1 million, it reaches 185 subscribers in an area that stretches across 200 square miles -- but not, unfortunately for the Knutsons, as far north as Tres Pinos.
Mr. Bryan established Pinnacles in 1953 after he acquired a single "farmer line" then used by 30 ranches. The previous owner offered Mr. Bryan the title to his tiny phone business if he would pay for a $500 roll of copper wire that had recently arrived at the county railroad dock. A decade later, Mr. Bryan paid $1,200 for a second local line. While both lines date to around 1906, they remain Pinnacles' main signal routes.
Little else has stayed the same. Pinnacles' plant assets now total nearly $2 million, and its annual operating expenses run close to $466,000.
During the last two decades the company has directed roughly 60 percent of its spending to technical upgrades.
Mr. Bryan's company, much like the 94 other privately owned telephone companies with fewer than 500 customers across the United States, does everything possible to keep pace with rapid changes in telecommunications technology. Rural residents, whether they raise cattle or harvest grain, rely on communications as much as transportation to get their products to market. Timing is everything, so they value the ability to get crop reports over the Internet or fax stock projections to commodities traders.
Some aspects of rural life do not adjust so quickly to the rhythm of the network economy. Mr. Bryan says, for instance, that a majority of his customers are in no rush to get off party lines.
Charlotte Berberick, 90, was one of Pinnacles' first customers. She still recalls the ring -- four shorts and a long -- that signaled an incoming call on her ranch's 10-party line. Ms. Berberick acknowledges that neighbors did drop in on one another's conversations. "No one had a television then, and very few folks owned a radio," she said. "We needed to entertain ourselves somehow!"
Another longtime Pinnacles customer, Fern Fancher, 79, said party lines contributed to a stronger community life. She cites several occasions when neighbors alerted one another of an approaching grass fire or other emergency with a single call, and help was soon on its way.
Such an intimate community, however, often means a loss of privacy. When Ms. Fancher's father-in-law died, his widow called and asked Ms. Fancher to pass on the news to relatives on a neighboring ranch. No need, for by the time Ms. Fancher arrived, the family was already grieving. "From that day on," she said, "I treated every phone conversation as public."
Pinnacles made its first big technical overhaul in the early 1970's, bringing overhead lines underground and converting open wires to insulated copper. Despite steady upgrades in ensuing years, more than half the company's customers were still on party lines by 1992.
More far-reaching changes accompanied Pinnacles' turn toward fiber optic cables about six years ago. It costs slightly less to lay copper wire than fiber optic cable -- about $10 a foot, compared with $10.50 -- but a pair of copper wires can serve only eight subscribers, while hundreds can fit on a fiber optic line. In a single year after installing its first fiber optic cable, Pinnacles made more progress than it had in the previous 20 years. Every customer had a private line, and several ordered a second one.
Pinnacles also recently installed digital switches that allow customers to choose among long-distance carriers, and it plans to introduce lines for high-speed Internet access within a year.
Mr. Bryan stresses that his company could not keep pace with telecommunications technology without the aid of the Universal Service Fund, a $793 million Federal program that puts a tax on all phone customers and uses the proceeds to subsidize phone companies with customers that are costly to serve, like those in remote areas.
Not that public assistance is the main source of income for Pinnacles. The money from Universal Service represents only 13 percent of annual operating revenue, while roughly 21 percent comes from the company's share of payments for long-distance calls.
All the same, Mr. Bryan argues that rural areas would become isolated if Universal Service did not exist. "The valuable stakes are the metropolitan zones," he explains. "Large phone companies can't make money out here."
Several years ago Mr. Bryan ran a phone line five miles up a creek for a new customer who lived in the high-elevation Gabilan Range. He had no choice but to attach the line to trees along the creek bank. Every winter he can count on at least one tree falling during a storm and damaging the phone line.
That adds up to a lot of time and expense for a single customer. But Mr. Bryan, whose 1996 earnings were close to $140,000, says his company is not driven solely by profits. "I simply enjoy serving the public and doing some good," he said.
Pinnacles' customers do value the personal relationship they have with their phone company, and hope it continues to thrive after Mr. Bryan, now 80, turns the business over to his two sons.
Ms. Fancher, a widow who lives alone, tells of being awakened at 3 A.M. one stormy night by a car turning into her driveway. Through sheets of driving rain she could make out Mr. Bryan's figure running to her door. The central office had received a faint signal that sounded like a 911 alert, so Mr. Bryan had visited each customer who lived alone to make sure they were not in trouble.
"The sky was falling, yet he felt he had a duty to take care of us," Ms. Fancher said.
Mr. Bryan worries about the future of his community. San Jose is sprawling in its direction, and he notes that commuters and weekend ranchers are beginning to make their presence felt.
Still, the potential of a more lucrative business climate for his telephone company holds little allure.
"I'm still a farmer, born and bred," he said. "And like all my ilk, I hate the plague of development."

HEADLINE: Tumbling Technology Stocks: Problems Go Beyond Asia

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The wreckage was devastating. In a matter of days, an entire herd of technology stocks was taken out to pasture and slaughtered.
The shares of little-known companies like the Quantum Corporation and Applied Materials, as well as members of the "fab five" of the technology world -- Oracle, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and I.B.M. -- were all battered in what turned into the worst week in a decade for technology issues. 
 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 6 percent of its value last week, and indexes that included only technology stocks were hit even harder.
A big reason was the growing fear among investors that the economic crisis now engulfing much of Asia would soon stunt the growth of a whole legion of technology companies. Indeed, many of those companies had bet on Asia as a platform for sales and earnings growth.
But the problems facing the industry go well beyond Asia. For months, many technology companies have been feeling the pressures of stiff pricing competition, a glut of components and a worldwide slowdown in personal computer sales.
As a result, when the Asian troubles sharpened last week, many investors who had long considered pulling back from technology stocks went into full retreat. And when a host of companies fed the fears by announcing weaker earnings forecasts and swollen inventories, the entire sector was punished.
"If you make computer components, you had a problem whether Asia collapsed or not," said Roger McNamee, a principal at Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. "Everybody is using Asia as an excuse. But Asia was just the latest catalyst for selling."
The dismal performance of technology stocks is significant because the technology sector has grown into one of the largest and most closely followed by investors. It increasingly sets the tone for the broader stock market. If the coming week brings even more warnings of earnings shortfalls, the tone could get even nastier.
The recent selloff was best viewed through the prism of the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index, where 94 of 100 issues fell last week, with 2 issues losing nearly a third of their market value. For the index, which dropped 9.8 percent, it was the worst week since October 1987, when technology stocks collapsed along with the broader market.
"I don't think people realize the carnage that has taken place," said James Renck, a portfolio manager at Merrill Lynch Asset Management. "A lot of stocks are down 50 to 70 percent since mid-October."
Particularly hard hit were shares of semiconductor makers and companies that sell the capital equipment that helps manufacture semiconductors -- both of which have heavy exposure in Southeast Asia.
While Oracle, a data base software maker, dropped 27 percent last week on record volume after the company reported disappointing earnings, large declines were also seen in semiconductor companies like Applied Materials, which plummeted 25 percent, and LAM Research, which dropped 22 percent on earnings worries.
As a result, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 14.7 percent last week. For the year, the index is up just 3.3 percent while the broader market is up more than 20 percent.
That disparity worries technology investors, many of whom have been riding the crest of a huge growth wave. In 1990, for instance, the market value of the 10 leading technology companies was about $50 billion. Today, Microsoft alone is worth $165 billion and the top 10 technology companies are worth close to $650 billion.
"Technology is still going to be a great area," said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist, a newsletter based in Nashua, N.H. "The problem is, investors have to separate the business from the market valuations. People wonder why stocks go down 20 points in a day; it's because the stock market was out of control. It was so ga-ga over the industry. Now those stocks are going to correct."
Behind the big selloff, though, are indications that the technology industry is undergoing a subtle but momentous shift in the way it does business, one however that many industry experts say will benefit consumers by resulting in cheaper, more powerful computers.
One change is that disk drive and semiconductor manufacturers are now under great pressure to find more efficient ways to produce, partly because of the success of the "just in time" inventory model used by Dell Computer.
"All that's going on is the industry is deciding it's going to be more efficient," Mr. McNamee said. "The whole supply chain is being optimized. It's being forced to conform to the model of Dell."
Whether component companies can accomplish this, however, is still unclear. "Semiconductor plants cost $1 billion to build and two years to put in place," Mr. Hickey at The High-Tech Strategist said. "That's a difficult process. Dell just assembles and tests computers."
Some analysts, however, say that the twin troubles of turmoil in Asia and an oversupply of components in the rest of the world, will force the industry to push even harder to optimize its manufacturing channels, creating even cheaper computers that could, in turn, open up an even larger consumer base.
"When you can buy a good multimedia PC for $1,000, that opens up a whole new group of buyers," said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter.
In fact, many analysts expect the industry to shake off its recent troubles, and the stocks are likely to begin another sharp growth phase. That is largely because most analysts believe that technology components will continue to grow exponentially. Semiconductors, for instance, are already being used in cars, toasters, refrigerators, computers, televisions, even Nike sneakers, almost anything that processes signals.
"They've been shooting all the tech stocks, even the ones that don't have exposure in Asia," said Thomas Thornhill, director of technology research at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. "But that's going to be corrected because the end consumption of technology remains on a relatively constant, upward trend."

Last week was the worst week in a decade for the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index, which includes the top 100 technology stocks in the country. The index lost 9.8 percent of its value. Only in the crash week of 1987 did the index ever do worse. Last week saw 94 of the 100 stocks drop, and two of them -- System Software and Kulicke & Soffa, both of which mentioned problems with Asian sales -- lost more than a third of their value in just five days. Graph shows the largest weekly drops for the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index.

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
With a Film Due, Homage To Bond. James Bond.

BYLINE: By SREENATH SREENIVASAN 

 BODY:
The latest installment of the James Bond series, "Tomorrow Never Dies," reaches theaters this week, and Bond mania -- building through weeks of incessant marketing -- is bound to reach fever pitch. The World Wide Web offers sites aplenty for true Bond aficionados as well as the merely curious.
MGM/UA has two sites aimed at fans impatient for the new movie. One is the unsubtle www.tomorrowneverdies.com, filled with trailers, photos, movie-related information, a Bond role-paying game and links to companies that have made deals to have their products featured in the movie. 
 The other is a disappointing "Official James Bond Home Page," which seems nothing more than a brochure to sell Bond-related merchandise.
"The Web's amazing -- the tremendous amount of Bond sites out there cover all things Bond," said John Cork, a director of the Ian Fleming Foundation in Burbank, Calif., an organization dedicated to preserving the legacy of the author and his most famous creation. "The best part is that most of the best sites are made by fans."
The foundation's site features the Web magazine "Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" (Mr. Fleming is said to have described his novels as being of the "bang-bang-kiss-kiss variety"), and updated information about the movies and other aspects of Bond lore. It has a set of frequently asked questions about James Bond, along with the answers. (Among them: "Just who is this James Bond guy anyway?" and "Some of these actors look awfully old. When were they born?")
While the perception is that Bond is popular mainly with males, one of the best starting points for Bond sites is run by a woman. Kimberly Last, a fan in Chicago, started her site in December 1994 and has since built a fan following of her own.
"I was not much of a Bond fan until Pierce Brosnan took over," Ms. Last said, referring to the actor who assumed the role of the dashing spy in "Goldeneye," the last Bond film. "But now I really enjoy putting everything I can find in one place."
Her site, James Bond, 007 OHMSS (On Her Majesty's Secret Service), has some obvious resources (a profile of Mr. Brosnan, for example) and some not-so-obvious ones (the lyrics of most Bond movie songs). One section, the Literary Bond, has extensive information about Bond's creator and the authors who continued the series after his death. Ms. Last also has an exhaustive set of links to other Bond sites.
Another comprehensive fan site, Nuvs' 007 Shrine, is a tribute to James Bond. The site, which is run by Navin Jain, a college student in Buffalo, uses plenty of multimedia resources and also something rare in the world of Bond sites: negative comments about the newer films. A fan in Britain who saw a press screening last week reported on the site that the new movie was "not a Bond film but a 90's parody of a Bond film."
A more detailed negative look at the movies is available at the James Bond Movie Faults site, which is dedicated to finding "all the faults, blunders, mistakes, bloopers, errors and flaws" in the films.
A serious approach to the subject of Bond is taken by a Web magazine, Her Majesty's Secret Servant. It includes articles, interviews and some intellectual content.
Guns, cars and gadgets all play important roles in the series, and most sites feature a section on them. One site, run by a high school student in Ireland, has details on the toys that make Bond tick.
And anyone who nearly flunked out of school because of a Bond obsession, or just wants to obtain college credit for their interest in the character, should look up the site of Eastern Caribbean University on the island of St. Kitts, which offers Bond studies courses over the Internet. Among them are "Geo 30071: Economic Geography of Bond Films and Their Impact on Countries," "Bus 30074: Marketing of Bond Films Worldwide" and "Eng 300710: Comparisons of Bond Films/Novels."
Those who think they know their Bond trivia can test themselves at Quizland's Bond site. It even provides rankings of the top scorers among recent players. Sample questions: What rank does James Bond hold? (Royal Navy commander). What children's book did Ian Fleming write? ("Chitty Chitty Bang Bang").
Copyright appears to be something easily ignored in the world of Bond, as most of the sites contain photographs and articles that are obviously taken from elsewhere and are often not credited. Almost every site seems comfortable acquiring such material.
Fans who want to go beyond vicariously enjoying Bond in movies and books can check out the Commanders Club, the site of a group "dedicated to the preservation and celebration of the lifestyle of a Scottish peasant named Bond, James Bond." Members of the San Francisco-based group dress up in tuxedos, go to casinos and pay attention to their "007 Day Planner," which marks Bond dates and anniversaries. The first listing: Jan 4, 1900, the birthday of a Philadelphia ornithologist named James Bond, after whom Mr. Fleming named his character.
A site that includes an extended discussion of the late ornithologist is run by William E. Kelly, who reports that Mr. Bond's widow wrote to him to say that her husband had always resented the invasion of his private life through the "theft" of his name by Ian Fleming.
"He wishes he could be left alone to do his work, which means everything to him," she said, "and put 007 behind him."

Charitable giving is in. Americans are donating $150 billion a year to charity. Nonprofit organizations now number more than one million. People are taking an increasing interest in volunteerism. And some publications are reaping the benefits.
"People are looking more to philanthropic sources for new ideas and leadership in a period when government is shrinking," said Susan Vail Berresford, the president of the Ford Foundation. "And people who publish magazines and newspapers see that as a new market." 
 Industry statistics prove it. Circulation at the Chronicle of Philanthropy was up nearly 5 percent for the six months ended June 30, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. And The Nonprofit Times, which is not audited, said its paid circulation has increased 50 percent since July 1996, to 4,000. It also has a controlled (free) circulation of 30,000.
New publications have come on the scene, including regional publications, newsletters and Internet offerings, like Guidestar, the Donor's Guide to the Nonprofit Universe, a free service with information on the programs and finances of more than 600,000 American charities and nonprofit groups. And mainstream publications seem to be taking a new interest in philanthropy, publishing lists of the most generous donors.
"We're riding a monumental interest in the subject of philanthropy and giving back," said W. Randall Jones, the chief executive of Capital Publishing, which in March started The American Benefactor, a glossy consumer magazine financed by Fidelity Investments.
Other publications that have sprung up over the last few years include Who Cares: The Tool Kit for Social Change, based in Washington, which started in 1993 as a magazine for young people and was reissued this fall with more nuts-and-bolts advice for nonprofits. It also increased its frequency to six times a year from four and tripled its circulation to 50,000. "The era of big government is over," said Leslie Crutchfield, the founding editor. "The era of big citizenship has begun."
The magazine More Than Money, published in Eugene, Ore., by Impact Project, a nonprofit group, has a circulation of 1,000 and covers topics like what makes giving satisfying. "Our publication focuses on the personal side of what it's like to have more money than other people," said Allen Hancock, the publisher. "How to make the experience of having money something positive and meaningful."
These publications are distributed primarily through nonprofit organizations and foundations. The American Benefactor, which is not sold on newsstands, is distributed as a gift to principal donors and prospective patrons of 3,000 nonprofit groups. Advertisers in these publications range from software companies and marketing services to Timberland boots.
People in the philanthropic world give several reasons for the surge of interest in charities, chiefly a strong economy and baby boomers at the peak of their earning years. Then there are the reliable reasons for giving, ranging from pure altruism to raw egotism, from social climbing to a desire to buy one's way into heaven (about 40 percent of charitable contributions go to religious organizations).
There has been a growing interest in taking social action as well as writing checks, people in the nonprofit sector say. This may explain the success of Build, a magazine started about five years ago by Do Something, a nonprofit organization in New York that encourages young people to take action in their communities. Build is distributed free to 100,000 people through a network of national nonprofits.

HEADLINE: Theorist's Task: Make Old Laws Fit in Digital World of Microsoft

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Into the epic legal battle between the world's most powerful software corporation and the U.S. government, enter the quixotic Lawrence Lessig, a 36-year-old Harvard law professor who speaks softly and espouses radical new -- and stubbornly non-partisan -- ideas about how traditional legal principles translate into cyberspace.
Anointed a "special master" in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. last Thursday, Mr. Lessig has five months to interpret the questions raised by the case, in which the government claims that the Redmond software giant violated a consent decree when it required computer makers to sell its Internet browser software with its Windows 95 computer operating system. 
 A constitutional scholar and by all accounts one of the leading intellectuals of his generation in American law, Mr. Lessig is not an anti-trust specialist. But he is a certified computer whiz whose career accomplishments include almost single-handedly propelling the Supreme Court's computer system into the modern age when he clerked there in 1990.
In choosing Mr. Lessig for a job that may help redefine how anti-trust doctrine is applied to the ephemeral realm of software, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson appeared to underscore the importance of achieving a better understanding of the relationship between new technology and existing law, legal experts said.
Mr. Lessig, whose father's steel fabricating company built bridges up and down the east coast while he was growing up, has spent the last several years formulating legal bridges between physical space and cyberspace. Driving much of his scholarship is the concern that, almost unnoticed, computer code has taken on the governing properties of law -- and moreover, that it is a more potent regulator of behavior than law could ever hope to be.
Unless Constitutional principles like free speech and privacy protection are consciously transported into the electronic domain and embedded in its architecture, Mr. Lessig has argued, the "tyranny of code" will dominate.
In an interventionist position that has won him few friends among the libertarian Internet community, for instance, Mr. Lessig contends that free speech principles might be better served by limited government regulation of pornographic material on the Internet than the voluntary adoption by Internet firms of a software standard that could block such images. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in her opinion on the Communications Decency Act case, also cited an article of Professor Lessig's for the idea that the Government might zone the Internet by age.
"The most effective way for government to regulate in cyberspace is to regulate its code," Mr Lessig said earlier this month. (Mr. Lessig, who has been vested with many of the powers of a judge, declined to comment on his appointment Friday.)
How Mr. Lessig will apply his theories on the powerful nature of code to the Microsoft case, if at all, is unclear. The software firm has long held that the traditional doctrine of anti-trust stifles innovation when applied to its fast-evolving industry. But Judge Jackson, who barred the company from packaging its Internet Explorer browser with Windows 95 last week pending a final decision, emphasized that the old rules still applied.
Lawyers familiar with Mr. Lessig's work suggested he might construct another catwalk between the two positions that would seek to embrace the underlying principles of anti-trust law in the new context.
"There is a question of when something becomes unlawful 'tying,' and how that analysis is different when you are dealing with technology as the bundler," said David Post, a law professor at Temple University and co-director of the Cyberspace Law Institute. "I think it's fair to conclude from his writing that Larry is suspicious about the market power over the basic architectural features of this landscape, which means the operating system."
Mr. Post, who discussed the subject with Mr. Lessig when they met by chance in an airport lounge awaiting a flight to Washington a few days before the ruling, said he received a flurry of calls over the weekend as lawyers from all sides tried to size up the new force on what many in the computer industry consider to be a watershed case.
As Mr. Lessig's curriculum vitae was faxed around the country and his journal articles downloaded from Lexis, some attorneys speculated that his association with the University of Chicago, which is known for embracing free-market approaches to law and economics, was a good sign for Microsoft.
Mr. Lessig studied for a year at Chicago's law school and taught there for a number of years before going to Harvard. He also clerked for two well-known conservatives closely associated with the school, Supreme Court Justics Antonin Scalia and 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner, after graduating from Yale Law School.
But Gary L. Reback, the attorney for Microsoft's rival in the browser market, Netscape Communications, and a persistent legal gadfly in matters involving Microsoft, said he was encouraged by Mr. Lessig's knowledge of technology.
"He's young, and I suppose it's unusual for someone so young to play this kind of role in the case of the century," Mr. Reback said. "But he will surely understand what's at stake, and that's half the battle."
Cass Sunstein, a law professor at Chicago who along with Mr. Lessig helped pioneer a new doctrine they call the "New Chicago School," warns against jumping to any conclusions about his former colleague's political alignment.
"I would be very cautious about assuming because he has been a Chicago affiliate that he has the usual Chicago view on antitrust law," Mr. Sunstein said. "He may, but he's an independent thinker. In fact, he's a very independent thinker."
Born in South Dakota and raised in Williamsport, Penn., 90 miles north of Harrisburg, Mr. Lessig's views were not always so unconventional. In high school, he was chairman of a group called Teenage Republicans for the State of Pennsylvania And in 1980 he took a semester off from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received degrees in economics and management, to run a campaign for a Republican state senator.
After studying philosophers in England at Cambridge University's Trinity College, however, Mr. Lessig returned to the United States to attend law school with a new political outlook. He dabbled in the postmodernist Critical Legal Studies movement, which attacks law as a tool of the powerful.
But colleagues say he may have been unable to subscribe to such theories because he is too driven by a belief in traditional legal values and law's power to promote social progress and remedy injustice.
He has taken a major role in helping to write the constitution for the former Soviet republic of Georgia, and is a leader of the activist "New Chicago School" which identifies "social norms" as a regulatory force that can influence behavior like smoking, or wearing a seatbelt.
"He was always passionate about his ideas," said his father, Lester O. Lessig, Jr., reached by phone from his home in Hilton Head, S.C. "When he went into teaching he felt he had the ability to have a greater impact than if he had done anything else."
Although the younger Mr. Lessig owned one of the first IBM personal computers, he is now one of a dwindling breed of Macintosh users. He likes opera and Lyle Lovett, and usually wears headphones while at the keyboard. He plays squash, agonizes over decisions, and strives for fairness even in grading student papers.
Even those who disagree with him cited Mr. Lessig's extreme fair-mindedness combined with a willingness to take unpopular positions as qualities that would stand him in good stead as he develops his analysis of digital age anti-trust doctrine. At a computer industry gathering dominated by cyber-libertarians earlier this year, the lanky Mr. Lessig, propounded his belief that a software standard for filtering indecent material posed a danger to free speech.
Mr. Lessig radiated a quiet intensity last winter as he told an unsympathetic audience that "PICS is the devil." But when pressed by civil libertarians to state whether he is in favor of Government regulation of cyberspace, Mr. Lessig qualified his position, acknowledging that criminal penalties connected to the regulation of speech in cyberspace might well be unconstitutional.
"The fact that he's responsive to criticism suggests that he has an open mind," said Mike Godwin, chief counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has argued with his views. Mark Snyderman, a friend who clerked with Mr. Lessig on the Supreme Court and is now a labor lawyer for the Coca-Cola Co., witnessed what was perhaps Mr. Lessig's first demonstration of the power of computer code over the legal system, when as a clerk he was enlisted to help show Justices Scalia and O'Connor the difference between composing a decision on the Court's ancient mainframe system compared to a personal computer.
Both he and Mr. Snyderman were at computers -- Mr. Snyderman using a terminal connected to the mainframe, Mr. Lessig using a PC. "We had identical documents on both computers," Mr. Snyderman recalled. "Larry said, 'Now imagine you're writing something and there's a word you've written and you think there's got to be a better word that works here. What do you do under the old system?'
Mr. Snyderman's response at the time was the stand up, go to a shelf and get a thesaurus.
" 'What do you do under the new system?' Larry hit the thesaurus key. Scalia went wild. That's it, he was compeletly sold."

HEADLINE: Walter James Levy, 86, Oil Consultant, Dies

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Walter James Levy, a New York-based oil consultant who was considered the dean of United States oil economists, died Wednesday at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 86.
In a business charged with intrigue and fierce rivalries, Mr. Levy was respected for his integrity, rectitude and trust. He owned no oil stocks, and his word was taken as solid by rival companies and oil-rich countries from Indonesia to Venezuela. 
 Whether consulted by companies or various governments, Mr. Levy made no secret of his dealings with competitors. His opinions and market analyses were sought and widely read until he retired about 10 years ago.
In World War II, Mr. Levy headed the petroleum section of the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. After the war, he guided the petroleum sector of the Marshall Plan. In 1948 he became chief of the petroleum, oil and lubricant division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, which administered the plan to mend Europe's shattered economies and provide the political stability for democratic institutions to thrive. He filled that job until 1949 and continued to advise the E.C.A. until it ended its mission two years later.
In the ensuing decades, he ran his own business, the W. J. Levy Consultants Corporation, with offices in New York and London. His horizons widened from the strategic role of oil in war and reconstruction to a world emerging from colonialism and foreign tutelage.
It was a world in which sizable pools of crude underground betokened vast riches to which foreign corporations usually held the keys. Mr. Levy helped renegotiate oil leases between states that wanted to tap their own resources effectively and companies that feared outright nationalization.
His clients included India, Brunei and Saudi Arabia as well as the United States and European countries. In 1979, West Germany bestowed on him the Commander's Cross of the Federal Order of Merit, one of many honors he received.
Walter Levy was born in Altona, Germany, now a part of Hamburg. He studied at the Universities of Berlin, Freiburg, Heidelberg, Munich and Kiel, where he received a Doctor of Laws degree.
He migrated to England in 1933, found work at the Petroleum Press Bureau and wrote a book about oil in war that drew the interest of British economic officials. He provided them with briefings, but when war broke out in 1939 he was branded an "enemy alien" and moved on to New York as a freelance economist.
When the United States entered the war, the newly formed O.S.S. beckoned and he became section chief in the Enemy Oil Committee, analyzing German petroleum resources and pinpointing supply routes, refineries and synthetic oil plants for air attacks.
He was in charge of petroleum research at the State Department before he joined the Marshall Plan administration. After opening his private consultancy, he continued to advise numerous Government branches, among them the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department, as well as the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.
He wrote articles that appeared in magazines and newspapers around the country and was the author of "Oil Strategy and Politics, 1941-1981" (1982).
Mr. Levy's wife, Augusta Sondheimer Levy, died in 1981 after 40 years of marriage.
He is survived by a daughter, Susan Levy of Altamonte Springs, Fla., and two sisters, Herta Grove of Philadelphia and Kate Freyhan of Bedford, England.

HEADLINE: Turkey, Rejected, Will Freeze Ties to European Union

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Stung by the European Union's rejection over the weekend of membership talks with Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said today that his Government would freeze its political contacts with the Union and seek a "strategic partnership" with the United States.
Mr. Yilmaz, who is scheduled to meet President Clinton in Washington on Friday, said Turkey "will have no political dialogue with the European Union from now on." 
 Turkey's decision to limit contacts with Europe's most important bloc came only days after Islamic leaders from around the world, meeting in Iran, voted to condemn Turkey for its military ties to Israel.
By taking steps that risk alienating both European and Islamic nations, Turkey appeared to be counting on increased support from the United States, an old ally, and Israel, a new one. Mr. Yilmaz said Turkey did not fear being left with few friends.
"We have very close relations with the Turkic republics of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and very good relations with Balkan countries except Greece," he said. "Turkey will not be isolated. But nobody should believe that Turkey will be forced to accept some unacceptable formulas just to enter the European Union."
At its meeting in Luxembourg over the weekend, the European Union agreed to open membership negotiations with 11 of its 12 applicants. But it offered Turkey only a vaguely defined "strategy of rapprochement" and said it should improve its human rights record and treatment of minorities as well as compromise on issues related to Greece and Cyprus.
The United States has been pressing the European Union to admit Turkey, which American officials believe must remain a key strategic partner of the West. European leaders are reluctant, fearing the high cost of admitting such a large and turbulent nation as well as the number of Turks who might flood into their countries. Some have also wondered aloud if a Muslim country can be considered part of Europe.
In an interview in his office today, Mr. Yilmaz said of the European Union's action: "We reject these preconditions. The aspect of the Luxembourg summit that disturbed us the most is that certain Central and Eastern European countries that are behind us economically and that only began taking steps toward democracy in the last five or six years were given a status ahead of ours.
"For those countries, including Cyprus, there is a very clear prospect of membership, and even a timetable. For Turkey there is none. We see this as very clear discrimination. If the European Union persists in such discrimination, we will have no place in such an organization."
Mr. Yilmaz, who heads a shaky five-month-old minority Government committed to secularism, said the reasons European leaders gave for turning aside Turkey's application were "not the real reason." Asked what the real reason is, he replied, "Religious discrimination, of course."
"So we come to the conclusion that even if we meet all the conditions being put to us, the real argument against our membership will still be there," he said. "The most important decision in Luxembourg, I believe, is the construction of a new Berlin wall, a cultural Berlin wall."
In freezing its relations with the European Union, Mr. Yilmaz said, Turkey will no longer discuss political questions, including the Cyprus issue, with its representatives. He also said Turkey would stop cooperating with delegations from the Union or the European Parliament that come here to study the human rights issue or the war against Kurdish insurgents.
He charged that the European Union had in effect taken the Greek side in disputes over Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations, a posture he called "impossible to accept."
He said that by deciding this weekend to open membership talks with the pro-Greek Government of Cyprus, the union "will also be responsible for negative developments on the island from now on."
Mr. Yilmaz praised the United States for having "a strategic point of view, unlike the European Union." But when asked how he would like a new partnership between Turkey and the United States to develop, he said only that he wanted the American side to lower tariffs on Turkish textiles and to support construction of an oil pipeline across Turkish territory.
Although American officials have quietly urged their Turkish counterparts to make some concessions on issues raised by human rights advocates, Mr. Yilmaz offered none today. He said he could not interfere with a court that seems to be preparing to ban the country's largest political party on the ground that it foments Islamic fundamentalism. He also described the country's most prominent prisoner, Leyla Zana, a Kurdish nationalist and former member of Parliament, as a confessed terrorist, evidently crushing hopes that she might soon be released.
The European Union has for years refused to act on Turkey's application for membership, and few were surprised by the outcome of the Luxembourg meeting. Several European leaders urged Turkey to embrace the proffered "strategy of rapprochement," but a member of the European Parliament who closely follows Turkish affairs, Claudia Roth, said the offer showed the union's "determination to hold Turkey at bay."
On the eve of the meeting, the host, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, spoke bluntly about Turkey's prospects. He said Turkey "has a place in the E.U., but this will take decades."
"It cannot be that the representatives of a country in which torture is still going on can sit at the table of the European Union," Mr. Juncker said on Thursday. "I do not believe the human rights problems can be solved in three to five years."
A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected Mr. Juncker's comments as "unacceptable, baseless, humiliating, deplorable."
Mr. Yilmaz's four-day visit to the United States, which will begin in New York on Wednesday and end in Washington on Sunday, is to be packed with meetings. Three American Jewish organizations will present him with an award, partly a gesture of thanks for his role in moving Turkey into a close partnership with Israel. He will visit the stock market, meet senior Administration officials and energy company executives, appear on television programs and have brunch with former President George Bush.

HEADLINE: Rosemarie Rogers, 61, Refugee Migration Expert

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Rosemarie Rogers, a scholar of international migrations and former academic dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, died on Nov. 28 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 61.
The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone-marrow cancer, said her husband, Peter P. Rogers, a professor of environmental engineering at Harvard University. 
 Dr. Rogers was a native of Austria, and her fluency in several languages led her to a career in international relations. She lectured in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before moving to the Fletcher School, where she advanced to a full professorship and served as academic dean from 1985 to 1987.
Her more than 50 papers, monographs, book chapters and books reflected her research on international migrations, including forced migrations and refugee policies.
At her death she was completing a comparative study of the migration policy of six Western European countries. In it she documented the difficulties host countries have, on the one hand, encouraging migrants to return home, and on the other, integrating them into their own societies.
Her recent research was foreshadowed in an earlier book, "Guests Come to Stay: The Effects of European Labor Migration on Sending and Receiving Countries" (1985). Another volume, written with Emily Copeland, "Forced Migration: Policy Issues in the Post-Cold War World" (1993), was widely distributed by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and various national governments.
Dr. Rogers was born Rosemarie Straussnigg in Klagenfurt, Austria, and studied at the Universities of Vienna and Innsbruck, the University of Texas and the Sorbonne. She settled in the United States in 1958 and earned a doctorate in political science at M.I.T. in 1967.
She served on the board of the World Peace Foundation.
Besides her husband, Dr. Rogers is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Cambridge, and Justin, of Albuquerque, N.M.

HEADLINE: Calls Rising For Food And Housing

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Despite a surging economy and low unemployment, the demand for emergency food and shelter continued to grow this year, the Conference of Mayors said today.
A conference survey of 29 cities, to be released on Monday, said that requests for emergency food rose an average of 16 percent, the largest increase since 1992, the survey found. Among the reasons, officials said, were low wages and high housing costs. Nearly all the cities expected demand for food and shelter to rise next year as well. 
 Requests for emergency housing, however, were up just 3 percent, the smallest increase in the survey's 13-year history. Of the homeless population, about 47 percent were single men, 36 percent families with children, 14 percent single women, and 4 percent minors, the survey found.
The study, based on self-reporting by the cities, which varied widely in detail, found that: emergency food assistance requests increased in 24 of the 29 cities; about one-fifth of emergency food help demands was estimated to have been unfulfilled, and 17 cities had increases in shelter requests, while the number of emergency shelter beds decreased an average of 3 percent in all of the cities.
Only Alexandria, Va., and Charlotte, N.C., reported that no food assistance request went unanswered. And Charleston, S.C., reported a 23 percent reduction in shelter demand by single adults, because the city said it provided "an array of services in an accessible location."
More common, however, were reports of fewer beds and tougher eligibility requirements.
"Admission criteria to emergency shelter has been tightened, and the word is out that emergency shelter is not an option that a needy person can depend on," St. Paul officials reported. "So many do not ask."
Other cities surveyed were Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; Denver; Detroit; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles; Louisville, Ky.; Miami; Minneapolis; Nashville; New Orleans; Norfolk, Va.; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; Providence, R.I.; St. Louis; Salt Lake City; San Antonio; San Diego; San Francisco; Santa Monica, Calif.; Seattle, and Trenton.

HEADLINE: Thailand Economic Crash Crushes Working Poor

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PATHUM THANI, Thailand, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Six weeks ago, the seamstresses at the P.A.R. Garment Factory here on the outskirts of Bangkok arrived at work to find a sign on the gate that read: "The company is closed."
Uniformed guards told them to go home. The factory was bankrupt. But many of the workers -- migrants from poor rural areas -- had nowhere else to go. 
 So they stayed, sleeping on straw mats on the sidewalk by the factory gate, waiting for some stroke of good fortune they know will never come.
"We can't find work at another factory because other factories are closing too," said Song Siwang, a 37-year-old seamstress. "And we don't want to go back to our home villages because there is no work there either."
Since the summer, Thailand and its Southeast Asian neighbors have been gripped by the region's worst economic crisis in decades. Currencies and stock markets are plummeting, banks and businesses are closing and jobs are being lost by the hundreds of thousands.
The 449 people at the factory here who lost their jobs here are among some four million rural migrants who flooded into the capital during the last decade, when Thailand had one of the world's fastest-growing economies and everybody dreamed of riches.
"I came to Bangkok because I thought life here would be wonderful," said Suthasini Keoleklai, 29. "I thought I would make a lot of money and be a wealthy person."
Now she and the other workers here -- still as poor as ever -- are part of the first wave of layoffs in an economic catastrophe that could cost two million jobs by the end of next year, according to Pasuk Phongpaichit, an economist at Chulalongkorn University.
Their story is the story of poor workers throughout Southeast Asia who in growing numbers are expected to lose their jobs in the months to come, some of the last to benefit and the first to suffer in the region's economic rise and fall.
Ms. Pasuk is co-author of a book published last year titled "Thailand's Boom!" (Silkworm Books) in which she describes the astonishing transformation of this rural nation into an exemplar of the "Asian miracle," with 8 percent annual growth, thriving new industries and an expanding middle class.
Few nations have experienced the kind of building spree that turned Bangkok's skyline, in a blink, into a chaos of odd-shaped towers. Few have indulged like Thailand in car-buying: it is one of the world's leading markets for Mercedes-Benz sedans and the leading purchaser, after the United States, of pickup trucks.
But there was always an underside to the boom: fully 60 percent of the country's 60 million people remained poor. Half the nation's wealth was in the hands of its richest 10 percent. The disparity in income between the country's rich and poor became one of the five sharpest in the world, according to World Bank figures.
Throughout the region, to varying degrees, economic growth has brought the greatest benefits to a privileged few. The poor majority often gained better health care and better social services, but they remained poor.
Miss Suthasini, who came to work at the P.A.R. Garment Factory a decade ago, has lived this side of Thailand's boom.
"In these 10 years my country has grown rich," she said, "but not me. Nothing for me has improved."
She earned the minimum wage on her first day of work 10 years ago and she earned the minimum wage on her last day, last month. Far from making her wealthy, her salary of $3.50 a day was not even enough to cover her basic needs.
Like the bankers and property developers whose profligacy helped cause the country's crash, Miss Suthasini has been left not only jobless but also in debt. She owes $40, or nearly two weeks' pay.
Beyond this, she has little to show for Thailand's economic boom.
The lives of the country's new middle class have been transformed by their new wealth. Even if they lose their jobs, they have new homes, new cars, a new appreciation for wine. But the people who worked at the P.A.R. Garment Factory have been left with almost nothing.
"The role of the poor in the boom has been to create the wealth," said Ji Ungpakorn, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn. "Now when the boom turns to slump, some of them will be cast aside, and they have nothing to cushion them at all."
Miss Song is one of 10 children in a farming family in Thailand's poor northeast, a region that suffers chronically from a cycle of drought and flood. All but one of her siblings also migrated to Bangkok -- the sisters as factory workers, the brothers as drivers.
"These were the only jobs we could get," she said. "None of us finished elementary school."
"I love sewing," she said. But she had only four years of schooling and she could not read the labels on the garments she made for Gap, Nike and London Fog. She is not unusual. Eighty percent of the country's work force has not progressed beyond elementary school.
As Thailand searches for silver linings in its time of hardship, a mood of nostalgia has emerged. These hard-pressed factory workers can return to their farms, people say, and to the gentle traditions of former times.
This is an illusion, said Mr. Ji, the political scientist. "The past is gone."
The boom years transformed the country's farms and villages as well, tying them more closely than ever to the economy of the cities. In many places, Ms. Pasuk said, much of the rural population depends on the earnings of family members in Bangkok.
"We came to the city to work and send money home to our parents," said Miss Song. "Now we are losing our jobs. Who will support my family? If I go home, who will support me?"

HEADLINE: IRANIAN PRESIDENT CALLS FOR OPENING DIALOGUE WITH U.S.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Dec. 14

 BODY:
President Mohammed Khatami of Iran aimed a conciliatory message at the United States today, saying that he hoped to re-establish a discussion with the American people that has been virtually suspended since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
The tone of Mr. Khatami's remarks, at his first news conference since he took office in August, was markedly different from that usually heard from Iranian leaders. He declared "great respect" for the "great people of the United States" and even his criticism of the Government in Washington, which he said stood in the way of possible reconciliation, was restrained. 
 "I hope the American politicians would understand their time better, understand the realities, and move forward," Mr. Khatami said.
At the "appropriate" time, he said, "I will present my words to the American people."
"I would hope for a thoughtful dialogue with the American people and through this thoughtful dialogue we could get closer to peace and security and tranquillity," he added.
But the Iranian President stopped short of saying that he expected renewed official contacts between the two Governments, and he did not spell out how he intended to reestablish this dialogue with Americans.
Mr. Khatami, 55, a Shiite Muslim cleric who won a landslide victory last May over a candidate supported by the country's religious establishment, is generally regarded as the most moderate official to emerge in Iran's top ranks of power since shortly after the revolution, which overthrew Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlavi.
The United States severed its relations with Iran after Islamic revolutionaries seized the American Embassy in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The two states, close allies while the Shah was in power, have remained hostile ever since, and the United States has tried with little success to enlist allies in isolating Iran through political and economic sanctions.
American officials have said they have been watching closely for signs that Mr. Khatami's triumph might mark a shift in Iran's orientation toward the United States, and his remarks were certain to be scrutinized by the State Department and other agencies that have been reviewing policy toward Iran.
 In Washington, a State Department spokesman, James B. Foley, cautioned that "it's too early to tell whether this represents an offer or not." He said the United States has been "open to a dialogue" with Iran, but has "stipulated that the dialogue would have to be official and authoritative, acknowledged publicly by the Iranian Government."
 If such a dialogue occurred, Mr. Foley said: "We would certainly be raising with the Iranians our concern about aspects of their foreign policy, which are deeply troubling to us, concerning weapons of mass destruction and terrorism and the like. But we are open to a dialogue and would expect they could raise issues of concern to them as well."
President Khatami has generally adopted a low profile since he took office in August, rarely speaking out either to reporters or to the Iranian public. His more conciliatory approach has been somewhat overshadowed by the fiercely anti-Western pronouncements of other Iranian leaders, including an address delivered last week to an Islamic conference here by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.
Aides to Mr. Khatami say he has been wary of saying anything that might promote a backlash among Iranian conservatives. They also concede that it remains unclear how much influence the new President can wield within Iran's complicated power structure, particularly regarding foreign policy.
But Mr. Khatami clearly intended that today's remarks be widely heard. In addition to Iranians, his audience included several dozen journalists from the United States, Europe and Arab countries who had been granted visas to cover last week's Islamic conference.
As he answered reporters' questions for more than an hour, Mr. Khatami sounded a fresh tone, even suggesting that it was "a source of sorrow" to him that the United States and Iran had not done more to patch up their differences in the nearly 19 years since the revolution.
He said that the "first step" toward a dialogue would be for American politicians to "understand their own time" and recognize that it was a mistake to maintain their efforts to isolate Iran.
"Instead of talking with forked tongues we want to have a rational dialogue," Mr. Khatami said. "We want to have a dialogue of civilizations."
Mr. Khatami's message might help to mute American objections to closer ties with Iran, but there was little in what he had to say that appeared sufficient to allay what have been the United States' principal concerns.
He did not address allegations that Iran is attempting to acquire nuclear weapons, a charge that his country has repeatedly denied in the past. He said Iran was opposed to terrorism, but made an exception for "the legitimate defense of people in occupied land," thus offering an implicit justification of Iran's support for Hezbollah and other militant groups fighting against Israeli occupation.
And while he said that Iran was "not going to take any action" against a broader peace in the Middle East, he criticized as unjust the approach being promoted by the United States. Mr. Khatami singled out Israel and its "Zionist regime" as "the only country which we do not recognize these days." His reference was not merely to Iran's lack of diplomatic relations with Israel, but to the latter's legitimacy as a state. The other country Iran previously placed in this category was apartheid-era South Africa.
But the overall thrust of Mr. Khatami's message toward the United States was both warmer and more specific than anything that even he has had to say in the past, and it appeared to mark a new phase in Iranian efforts to mend fences with old foes.
In the last month alone, the Iranian President noted, Iran and the European Union have patched up differences that had resulted in the withdrawal of the European ambassadors, while its playing host to the Islamic conference helped Iran to begin rebuilding ties with neighbors like Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
The Islamic conference, attended by representatives of 54 countries, proved that Iran is not isolated, Mr. Khatami said.
In calling Washington's attempts to ostracize Iran dated, Mr. Khatami cited in particular an American law that calls for sanctions against companies worldwide that invest more than $20 million a year in Iran's energy industry. A consortium of French, Malaysian and Russian firms recently defied the law by signing a $2 billion contract for investment in Iran's natural gas industry.

HEADLINE: In Bosnia, U.S. Shouldn't Be Choosing Sides

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Now that the party of Biljana Plavsic, the Bosnian Serb president, has lost its hold on the National Assembly of the Serb enclave in Bosnia, to whom will the United States turn to influence peaceful policy in the region (news article, Dec. 8)? 
 As a supervisor for election monitoring in the Serb Republic of Bosnia conducted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe last month, I witnessed developments there firsthand since since the war ended.
Unemployment is upward of 90 percent. Factories and mines, shut down during fighting, operate at 5 percent to 10 percent of prewar capacity. Students attend classes in school buildings in dire need of reconstruction.
As a result of politicians' refusal to assist the international community in indicting Serbs charged with war crimes, people who live in the Serb enclave receive only 6 percent of international aid for reconstruction in Bosnia.
Concentrating democratization efforts on Ms. Plavsic has proved fruitless. Why not focus United States policy on stabilizing a war-torn people rather than on choosing political sides?

A Tone of Conciliation From Iran's President
President Mohammed Khatami of Iran professed "great respect" for the United States and said he hoped that American politicians would "understand their own time" and stop trying to isolate his country. A1
 
Iranian and American diplomats have been exploring ways to end the civil war in Afghanistan. The meetings, held at the United Nations, began after the moderate Mr. Khatami became Iran's first popularly elected President in August. The talks are aimed at devising a power-sharing arrangement between the militant Taliban movement that controls most of Afghanistan and a loose coalition of resistance leaders in the north of the country. A12 

Hutu Kill 272 in Rwanda Attack
Hutu guerrillas killed 272 people and injured 227 others in a Tutsi refugee camp in Rwanda, leaving behind pamphlets preaching genocide. The attack was part of a campaign apparently aimed at making the country ungovernable. A1
 
Turkey Ends Europe Dialogue
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey said his Government would freeze its political contacts with the European Union and seek a "strategic partnership" with the United States. The move came after the European Union rejected talks on Turkey becoming a member, and after Islamic leaders at a conference in Iran voted to condemn Turkey for its military ties to Israel. The European Union has criticized Turkey's human rights record. A3
 
Clinton to Visit Troops in Bosnia
President Clinton is planning to go to Bosnia next week to visit American troops before Christmas and to begin building a public case for keeping them there past the current deadline of June, Administration officials said last night. A8
 
Talks May Move Out of Belfast
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said he and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain would try to invigorate the sluggish Northern Ireland peace talks by moving some of the sessions early next year from Belfast, the northern capital, to Dublin and London. Mr. Ahern also confirmed that he and Mr. Blair were working on a detailed list of proposals for the Protestant and Roman Catholic delegates to the talks. A8
 
Yeltsin Makes Appearance
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia appeared in public in an effort to allay growing doubts about his health. Mr. Yeltsin, 66, spoke at a polling place in a Moscow sanitarium, where he cast his ballot in municipal elections. He said he entered the sanitarium last week after catching a cold. He said that although he felt ill he was alert and that "there is control." A5

U.S. to Announce Rules Governing Organic Foods
The Department of Agriculture will perform an about-face today and announce a sweeping set of proposed regulations that would cover all organically grown food, from the farm to the consumer. The proposed rules would define exactly which products, whether raw or processed, could be labeled organic food. They also set standards for the production and handling of organically grown crops and organically raised meat and poultry -- for example, prohibiting the use of antibiotics in animals, except to treat illness. A1

Tobacco's Lobbying Effort
The nation's five major tobacco producers, led by Philip Morris, will have spent more than $30 million on lobbying by the end of 1997, and are expected to spend far more than that next year, according to Senate records and interviews. The companies' focus is the shaping of comprehensive tobacco legislation that they hope will help shield them from liability claims and raise their corporate share prices on Wall Street. A1

Fraternity Leaders and Drinking
A study reported that fraternity leaders were among the heaviest drinkers and out-of-control partygoers, casting doubt on the efforts by some colleges to have those leaders help curb excessive drinking. A20

Building a Benign Arsenal
The llama is one of a handful of creatures in an animal arsenal that a small but growing number of environmentally minded Western ranchers hope will replace lethal means of coyote control. A17
 
Demand Rising for Aid
The demand for emergency food and shelter continued to grow this year, despite a surging economy and low unemployment, the Conference of Mayors said. A conference survey of 29 cities said that requests for emergency food rose an average of 16 percent, the largest increase since 1992. Among the reasons, officials said, were low wages and high housing costs. A16
 
Freight Rail Service to Resume
Union Pacific Railroad, the nation's largest rail carrier, will resume carrying containers and truck trailers to Houston and Dallas from Chicago today. Northbound service is to resume on Wednesday. Normal service was disrupted six weeks ago by congestion caused by Union Pacific's merger with Southern Pacific. (AP)

City to Favor Working Poor Over Welfare Recipients
The New York City Housing Authority, trying to reverse the concentration of the desperately poor in public housing, will soon begin to favor working families over welfare recipients when it fills vacancies, a move that advocates for the poor say will shut out those who need housing help the most. The measure follows a nationwide trend in which housing authorities are seeking to lure the working poor back to public housing as an antidote to the economic and social problems that plague many housing projects. A1

Collaborating Against AIDS
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center has opened a center at Gay Men's Health Crisis, in what officials described as the first large-scale collaboration between a major New York City hospital and an AIDS social service agency. The AIDS center will offer medical services and experimental treatments to clients, who will also have access to the services at Gay Men's Health Crisis. B3

Hotel Rooms at a Premium
Rooms are extremely scarce in the city's hotels. The average occupancy rate is expected to be about 86 percent for 1997, up from 74 percent in 1993, according to Coopers & Lybrand Lodging Research Network. On weekends during peak seasons, there are few, if any, rooms available in the entire city. The supply is scarcest in hotels that cater to tourists. And as the larger chain hotels fill up, people are shunted to smaller, older, independent hotels. B3
 
A Life in Squalor
People who live as squatters in a Harlem apartment building where an 11-year-old girl was found dazed and covered by sores acknowledged that they knew she never went to school, almost never ventured outside and rarely even got out of bed. And yet it never occurred to them to call the police or reach out to her, they said, because in the disintegration and chaos that prevailed inside their four-story building, she seemed no more in danger or distress than any of the other poor and often addicted residents who were constantly hungry, cold and dirty.

HEADLINE: In Turnabout, Housing Authority Will Begin Favoring Jobholders

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The New York City Housing Authority, trying to reverse the concentration of the desperately poor in public housing, will soon begin to favor working families over welfare recipients when it fills vacancies, a move that advocates for the poor say will shut out those who need housing help the most.
The measure follows a nationwide trend in which housing authorities are seeking to lure the working poor back to public housing as an antidote to the economic and social problems that plague many projects. And it comes as Congress is considering a bill that would go much further, repealing the landmark 1937 Federal housing law and cutting roughly in half the number of extremely poor tenants in projects, through attrition. 
 The city's Housing Authority, by far the nation's largest, has long been considered the most successful because it was able to maintain a better balance of working-class and poor tenants than other cities. But over the last decade, it has seen the percentage of tenants with jobs fall to less than a third from nearly half, in part because of Federal and city rule changes favoring the poorest.
Officials assert that the new plan, which a Federal judge recently approved after a two-year court battle, is the only way that the authority can continue to prosper as many other cities either tear down housing projects or watch them devolve into violent warehouses for the poor.
"I sincerely believe," said Ruben Franco, the authority chairman, "this is the one initiative that will have the greatest impact on the stability of the public housing community in this city. Anytime you have too many very poor people living together, with a significant number of social problems, you run into trouble."
Opponents of the new rules say the primary reason the authority wants to favor working applicants is to generate more money as public housing funds from Washington dwindle, not to cut crime at the projects or mend their social fabric.
"They are doing this in response to budget cuts," said Scott Rosenberg, litigation director for the Legal Aid Society of New York, which successfully sued to stop the plan in 21 of the system's 320 projects where it was likely to interfere with a desegregation plan imposed in an earlier court case. He said the system already screened applicants thoroughly to weed out those with criminal backgrounds and other problems. "The real issue is that the Housing Authority is seeking more income by the somewhat perverse means of excluding those in greatest need," he said.
At a time when other housing programs for the poor, like rent subsidies and incentives for building low-income housing, are also being frozen or cut, the Legal Aid Society and housing advocates say the change will be devastating for tens of thousands of applicants on welfare who look to public housing as a way to escape unsafe, overcrowded apartments and cycles of poverty.
The new plan breaks a longstanding policy that gave equal weight to applications from families on public assistance, the elderly and working people. Combined with Federal rules that gave preference to many low-income applicants, the old policy had the unintended effect over the last decade of giving many more vacant apartments in housing projects to welfare recipients. As a result, working families began to find public housing increasingly unattractive.
By 1995, 77 percent of new admissions were people in the lowest income category, while only 8 percent of new applicants were working families. And dozens of projects, like the Coney Island Houses in Brooklyn, became known as virtual dumping grounds for the very poorest.
The change in policy will essentially juggle the order of the top part of a huge waiting list of about 130,000 applicants for the system's 180,000 apartments, 6,000 to 8,000 of which become available every year.
In the 299 projects where Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the new plan could proceed, the authority will assign the highest priority code to families whose incomes are near the upper limit of the eligibility cutoff for public housing, which means they are most likely working (for example, a family of four making about $39,000 a year).
The poorer the family is, the lower its priority code will be. But only families with members who are working, are receiving unemployment benefits or are unable to work because of disabilities will be given any priority code at all. The change will also reorder the list of applicants preferred under the Federal rules so that working families will also be favored over welfare recipients.
Because only those people with the highest priority ratings are usually called in for eligibility interviews, housing advocates say the plan will make it next to impossible for anyone not working to get in when the change takes effect early next year, an assertion that Mr. Franco of the Housing Authority disputes.
"It may slow down the availability of some units for some families, but we vehemently disagree that they will never be able to get in," he said, adding that the authority will still honor an agreement with the city to house about 1,400 homeless families a year who are referred from municipal shelters.
Housing officials admit, however, that the change -- along with an advertising campaign planned to try to change working families' perceptions of public housing -- is expected to shift dramatically the income mix in projects over the next decade.
It is a change that officials say many of the 600,000 tenants now in public housing welcome as a way to improve their homes. But tenants and tenant leaders appear to be more ambivalent.
"I have mixed feelings," said Sarah Martin, a tenant leader at Grant Houses in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, who has lived there 40 years. "I know working families who have come and looked at apartments here, and they've turned them down. Long-term welfare people have turned this place around in a very negative way."
But she added that she had also watched some welfare families lift themselves out of poverty with the help of low public housing rents, and she said she worried what would become of such families now. "I wish I had a magic pill to fix that," said Ms. Martin, a retired cafeteria worker and health care assistant who raised five children in public housing. "But I don't."
For many of those without jobs who have been waiting as long as five years for public housing in New York City, word of the changes has brought apprehension and anger and now a degree of despair.
Shawana Gerard, a 25-year-old single mother, lives in a dilapidated two-bedroom apartment in East New York, Brooklyn, with five other family members. At night, she shares her bed with her 2-year-old daughter, as well as with her own younger sister. She says she is forced to subsist on welfare because raising a 2-year-old and attending community college make it impossible to hold a job.
"Before I had my daughter, I had jobs, and now that I have her, I do the best I can do," Ms. Gerard said. "This isn't fair. I put so much time into trying to get into public housing. I was trying to get in there so I could make it."
The changes follow efforts by other large cities like Chicago and Baltimore to try to attract higher-income tenants and are a preview of what could happen on a much greater scale across the country under a sweeping housing bill passed by the House of Representatives last summer.
The bill, sponsored by Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island Republican, has been promoted as the most realistic alternative to save public housing in an era of shrinking housing budgets. It would loosen Federal rules to let housing authorities admit tenants with much higher incomes. It would also retool rent policies so that payments would not necessarily rise along with income, a rule that housing officials say discourages residents from getting off welfare.
Republicans characterize the bill, which will be taken up in a House-Senate conference early next year along with a similar Senate bill, as another major step in their efforts to move more people from welfare to work.
The measure has generated a debate that also cuts to the heart of the changes under way in New York: should such a basic need as housing be used in a carrot-and-stick approach to discourage dependency on government help?
Christopher Jencks, a professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University who has urged more financing for rental subsidy vouchers to help the neediest, said a consensus has grown even among advocates for the poor that housing projects must change directions to survive. But without other forms of government housing help, the poorest who are excluded from public housing will never be able to escape poverty.
"You've either got to put substantial additional resources in here," he said, "or we're at the end of what we can do."
But while the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development views Mr. Lazio's plan as too harsh, HUD officials suggest that housing programs cannot be excluded from the equation of welfare reform. This is especially true, they say, when everyone agrees there will never be enough Federal money for low-income housing for even half of those who need it.
"Housing is a privilege, not necessarily a right," said Sara Manzano, an assistant general counsel for the New York and New Jersey HUD office, which supports the changes in New York City. "We have to decide who gets the preference."

HEADLINE: 'Nutcracker' Dreams vs. Fiscal Reality

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
American dance companies came of age in the "dance boom" decades of the 70's and 80's. With age came new responsibilities. No more seat-of-the-pants operations: to get money from government and private donors, books must be balanced and show a profit, in a field where dreams had long been the currency.
With the 90's, an even sterner reality took hold, far more complicated than hand-to-mouth existence. As government and private support for the arts dwindled with the economy, fiscal responsibility remained the byword, with little diminution of the drive toward corporate-style growth and risk taking. 
 One of the most spectacular and public instances of the collision of dreams and reality came early this year with the news that Donald Byrd's company, called Donald Byrd/The Group, and his new, highly praised "Harlem Nutcracker," which had its New York premiere last December, were in serious financial trouble.
The ambitious production, which was only halfway through a six-week tour, cost $1 million -- more than six times the cost of other recent dances by Mr. Byrd. But the small experimentalist troupe was poised for major success. The choice seemed to be between stagnation and growth. Already heralded as an important American modern-dance choreographer, Mr. Byrd and his "Harlem Nutcracker" had drawn the kind of reviews and full houses that company administrators envisioned would propel him into the first ranks.
The strain of reaching for that next rung up the ladder nearly did the troupe in, plunging it into debt and a yearlong scramble for mere existence. Fortunately, the company won a second chance, and it has mounted another season of "The Harlem Nutcracker," which can be seen in its only performances in the New York area at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark from Thursday through Sunday.
For Mr. Byrd, now 48, "The Harlem Nutcracker" was a work especially close to his heart.
"Since 'The Nutcracker' is such an institution in this country, this was a way of expanding the 'Nutcracker' family by including another group of people," Mr. Byrd said in a recent interview. The choreographer, who is black, placed his production in a Harlem brownstone in modern times. He set "The Harlem Nutcracker" not to the familiar Tchaikovsky music but to the Duke Ellington-Billy Strayhorn "Nutcracker Suite" and a jazz score by David Berger. And he shaped the dance around a grandmother's memories of Christmases shared with her family.
It was the most spectacular production the company had ever attempted. Until "Nutcracker," no Byrd dance had ever cost more than $150,000. Twelve dancers were added to the 10-member company, along with four musicians. There were an astonsihing 500 costumes, with a touring staff of 44 and additional, pickup performers at each stop.
One reviewer described "The Harlem Nutcracker" as an "instant classic." And local producers noted happily that the ballet was drawing new black audiences. Ticket sales were strong.
But reports of problems had begun to circulate by late December 1996, when the troupe appeared in Los Angeles. The mothers of several dancers added for the production called newspapers in New York City, where the Byrd company is based, to complain that their daughters had not been paid. New York-based musicians were said to be prepared to take legal action against the company for unpaid wages. By January, the company acknowledged that it owed creditors $400,000.
 
Fighting a Threat To Its Existence
"The company's very existence was threatened, and still is," said Benjamin Mordecai, the theatrical producer and assistant dean of the Yale School of Drama, who was brought in to run this year's "Harlem Nutcracker" and its six-week tour. Mr. Mordecai has whittled production costs by streamlining last year's cumbersome touring schedule and cutting expenses. "They're not out of the woods yet," he said. "This tour will break even or come close. It is doing a lot to re-establish credibility for the company."
A little over one-third of the debt was paid off before the current tour began, and long-term discounted-payment plans have been arranged for nearly all the rest. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, which picketed the company's June season at the Joyce Theater, recently settled with the company, and last year's touring musicians have returned to the production.
In retrospect, company officials admit, the decisions they made last year may have been misguided, even irresponsible. But at the time there seemed to be little choice. Whatever else, their story suggests the contradictions of success in the arts today, when it is necessary to "act like the big boys," as Mr. Byrd puts it, in order to survive and grow.
In 1991, his company began to seek financial support for a new "Nutcracker." Mr. Byrd had come to dance relatively late, as a drama student at Tufts University, but made up for lost time with intensive training in ballet and modern dance here and abroad. He founded his company in 1978, two years after he began to choreograph, eventually developing a style rooted in classical ballet and modern and black vernacular dance.
By the 1990's, Mr. Byrd had established himself as an innovative creator of charged, high-energy dances with social themes that often touched on racial issues. Modern-dance and ballet companies in the United States and in France, Britain and the Netherlands performed his works. He had choreographed theater and musical productions for the director Peter Sellars and for the New York Shakespeare Festival and Center Stage in Baltimore and was in national demand as a teacher and arts adviser.
 
A Chance to Reach A New Level
In 1995, the company was working 45 weeks a year, with tours in Europe and the United States, mostly in small experimentalist theaters. It seemed ready to climb to the next rung or even higher.
Mr. Byrd began thinking about staging his own "Nutcracker" in 1989 after reading about a performance of the Ellington-Strayhorn score. The holiday classic has proved to be a cash cow for ballet companies, and he saw a chance to address specific issues about black Americans and the family. Government and private sponsors were expressing interest.
The initial production and tour budget was projected at $1 million. The National Endowment for the Arts was in trouble, and major foundations were phasing out or changing programs that supported the performing arts. But it seemed equally clear to Mr. Byrd and his advisers that a successful "Harlem Nutcracker" would in turn generate the money to support new dances and sustain community programs.
The company needed to "heighten its profile," as Elizabeth Powers, who was then executive director, put it. And everyone wanted to give Mr. Byrd the chance to create the piece he dreamed of. "Part of the problem in the dance field in general is that we all want so badly to see the work get made," Ms. Powers said. "If you don't, you have nothing."
A new booking agent was hired in 1995. By the 1995-96 season the operating budget had climbed to $850,000 from $500,000, excluding the tour. Mr. Byrd continued to work on "The Harlem Nutcracker" while the company raised money. It was slow going.
 
An Unusual Practice In the Dance Field
"But we'd been talking about the production for so long that people who were interested in presenting it started to wonder if it were ever going to happen," Mr. Byrd said. "We felt we should take advantage of that interest."
In the early fall of 1995, still short of its goal, the company held workshop performances of the piece, an unusual practice in dance. With a workshop, company officials reasoned, Mr. Byrd, as well as committed backers and fence-straddlers, could get a taste of the production.
As a fund-raising tactic, the company offered presenters co-commissioning credits for $80,000 to $125,000, in addition to performance fees paid to the company. By late spring last year, some $400,000 remained to be raised for start-up costs. With general operating costs and workshop and touring expenses added in, the total budget jumped to $1.8 million. Still, with major corporate and private support in place, the goal seemed tantalizingly close. But there were warning signs.
The expected buzz -- and money -- failed to materialize after the formation of a prestigious national fund-raising committee. The production budget was cut back to $750,000, and the office staff was cut to an overworked two people.
Looking back, Ms. Powers says, she should have been clearer about the problems. "I should have planned differently once the crisis became apparent, around August. But somehow or other I'd been pulling major rabbits out of hats, so I thought I could keep doing it."
The decision was made to go ahead with the tour. "It seemed a reasonable risk," Mr. Byrd said. "Not pie in the sky."
Ticket sales went well everywhere except Minneapolis. But the company, having spent advances from the producers' fees to pay for the production, was not making any money. A further blow occurred when one presenter made a last-minute decision not to pay an expected co-commissioning fee, worried, Mr. Byrd now believes, that the company was in over its head.
A board member helped out with a large loan, later forgiven, but it was not enough. Checks began to bounce in mid-December. "From that point on, the truth was out," Mr. Byrd said.
One problem, common in dance, was that reports of the troupe's sold-out performances convinced potential donors that the company did not need help. And as touring continued, unpaid bills piled up.
"Donald is brilliant, but he does a lot of mind-tripping," said one performer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I'm one of the few who haven't been paid in full. I still haven't seen a penny of my last two paychecks. I could really use that money."
 
Mixed Opinions On Going Ahead
Some have questioned the company's decision to go on. "I think it was definitely better for them to keep going," Mr. Mordecai said. "I don't think they would have been able to raise the money otherwise."
With hindsight, Mr. Byrd admits that the company was not prepared for the huge job of creating "The Harlem Nutcracker" on its own.
"Seeing how smoothly it is going now, I realize we could probably have done this in a better way if we had had more experience," Mr. Byrd said. And he wonders, he said, whether the success of "The Harlem Nutcracker" outweighs its many costs. "But after watching the performance last night, sitting in the house and watching the people with their kids, the grandmothers, all the black families who had come such a long way to see it, I thought, 'Well, maybe it was worth it.' "

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Quieting the Mouth That Roars

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

 BODY:
Wherever he goes and whoever he meets, Kevin Kelley, the World Boxing Union featherweight champion, gets the same question and the same request.
Why is he, a world champion born in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and raised in Flushing, Queens, getting second billing to Naseem Hamed, a fighter from Sheffield, England, on a boxing card at Madison Square Garden? And can he please knock out Hamed as quickly as possible when the two fight on Friday night for Kelley's crown and Hamed's World Boxing Organization title so that Hamed will shut up already. 
 "My aunt, who is a really religious lady and doesn't speak bad about anybody, called me the other day and said: 'Kevin, I saw those commercials and he's so arrogant and so nasty. That's not God-like. You need to give him a beating. He needs it,' " Kelley said in an interview at a Whitestone, Queens, restaurant on a recent afternoon.
Nothing would give Kelley more pleasure.
"The first round I'm going straight for that mouth," Kelley said. "I've been saving up everything for the bell."
For Kelley, this fight, which will be televised live on HBO as part of its World Championship Boxing series, is business and it's personal.
Hamed, 23, is the highest-paid featherweight in boxing history, with $12 million in purses and endorsements last year. And with his new agreement with HBO, which will pay him a reported $2 million a fight as long as he wins, Hamed has usurped Kelley on the cable network where Kelley has fought seven times.
Kelley believes a victory over Hamed will derail HBO's plans for Hamed and put Kelley in line for bigger paydays. Junior Jones (44-2) will defend his W.B.O. junior featherweight title against Kennedy McKinney (32-3-1) on the undercard.
Kelley, a slugger who describes himself as a fighter first and then a boxer, will be Hamed's toughest opponent to date. If Hamed can weather what Kelley throws at him, then Hamed can indeed thump his chest. The flamboyant Hamed brags without any prompting, and it's that kind of arrogance that rubs many people the wrong way. Toss in his narcissism, and it is like a thumb in the eye.
Here's what Hamed said about fighting Kelley in New York: "I could have brought Kevin Kelley to my own backyard and beat him up there. But I didn't want to do that. I wanted to come to his own backyard and bring him down in front of his own crowd, a place he loves. I've come right to the lion's den, where he's comfortable, where he can make no excuses after he's knocked out."
Kelley is clearly perturbed by Hamed. He cannot understand why HBO is spending $1 million on publicity for this fight to introduce Hamed to the American public. He does not understand why he wasn't able to get the same kind of multifight deal from HBO that Hamed got. The deal puts Hamed, an unknown quantity in the United States, in the same category as such HBO boxing stars as Oscar De La Hoya, Pernell Whitaker, Roy Jones Jr. and Lennox Lewis.
"We signed Hamed because we believe he is a talented fighter, he's very popular internationally and we believe that he can be just as popular here," said Lou DiBella, vice president of programming for HBO.
Hamed, who is of Yemeni descent but was born in Sheffield, has fought mostly in Europe. Hamed is 28-0, with 26 knockouts.
"This represents a great opportunity for Kevin," DiBella said. "He is a terrifically exciting fighter, and he is an HBO fighter. If he beats Hamed, then he will move up to a level of popularity that he didn't have before. If Kevin were to beat Hamed, I don't view it as a waste of money, because Kevin will benefit from the publicity that we've done for Hamed."
Kelley will earn an estimated $500,000 to $600,000 from all sources for this bout.
"I'm not in their economic scheme," Kelley said. "I guess I never was. But I helped make 'Boxing After Dark' popular. I opened the way for guys like Hamed to fight on HBO. I made featherweights popular here. It's like I'm the black sheep of boxing now. I'm the only world champion from New York City who hasn't fought here in five years. I don't get it."
He added: "I think they're jumping the gun with this guy. They're putting too much interest in a guy who no one knows and who is not from this city and who is not even from this country."
Kelley, 30, an only child whose mother is a postal supervisor and whose father is an electrician, is New York through and through. He bought a house in Valley Stream, N.Y., not too far from his old neighborhood in Flushing, Queens. He was a two-time New York Golden Gloves champion as an amateur. He was on the last boxing card at the old Felt Forum at the Garden in 1993.
Even his self-promotion, which began more as a matter of survival than self-absorption, is New York-style kitsch. As a house fighter for the Garden back in the late 1980's, Kelley promoted himself by handing out pencils with his name on them. He still does that, but has added lollipops, cookies, hats, T-shirts and jackets that bear his "Flushing Flash" logo (a red boxing glove grasping two gold lightning bolts). He used to rent a limousine and drive around the city promoting fights. But he refused to do much publicity for this fight against Hamed, because he said he wanted Hamed to have all the pressure.
Kelley has toiled for comparative peanuts for 10 years, has lost only once in 50 fights (47-1-2), but has watched boxers such as De La Hoya and Hamed "fight tuna fishes" and become very wealthy in a short span. He said he did not begrudge Hamed or any other boxer earning money or using shtick but thought they should not earn big money until they fought worthy opponents.
"These guys aren't fighting anybody, and people are throwing tons of money at them," Kelley said.
Kelley's ring record is dotted with tough campaigns, such as his 12-round World Boxing Council title defense against Jesse Benavides in 1994.
But his career has been a struggle. He spent two years as the No. 1-ranked featherweight by all three of the major boxing organizations and never got a title shot; he was 36-0 and 26 years old before he got his first one. He defeated Gregorio Vargas in a 12-round decision on Dec. 4, 1993, to win the W.B.C. crown, which he lost to Alejandro Gonzalez in January 1995.
He hit a low point three years ago when a promoter asked him to fight in a non-televised title bout in Ireland for $25,000. Kelley retired, but came back six months later. Those are the types of things he was thinking about while he toiled in seclusion in the Poconos in preparation for the Hamed fight.
"When I fight, I fight with everything that's in me," Kelley said. "I'm going to hit him with everything that I've ever been hit with. When the bell rings he's going to see me and know that I'm out to hurt him seriously."

Williams Is Hopeful, But Expects A Struggle

BYLINE: By JOHN MARINO 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Dec. 14

 BODY:
With no movement in his talks with the Yankees, Bernie Williams acknowledged today that negotiating an acceptable contract with his team would be a tough proposition. But he held out hope that an accord could be reached soon that would keep him playing in New York.
"I expect it to be hard," Williams said. "The kind of contract we're talking about isn't something that gets negotiated every day. It's been my relationship with them during the past years that everything I've ever tried to get, I had to fight for it. So I don't expect this to be anything different." 
 Williams spoke before the start of the fourth annual Carlos Baerga Celebrities Softball Game at Hiram Bithorn Stadium here. He had not publicly discussed his contract situation until this past weekend. The optimism in his comments reflected the diminished rhetoric between Williams and his agent and the Yankees as they near serious negotiations.
"I'm very optimistic about it," WIlliams said. "Hopefully, we'll get something done in the next couple of weeks. I certainly hope that something will be resolved before the season starts, or at least before the arbitration period starts."
Williams backed up the assertions of his agent, Scott Boras, that he has never made specific contract demands. Yankee officials, who made a five-year, $37.5 million offer last season, say Boras has spoken in general terms about a seven-year contract worth $10 million to $11 million a year.
"We've never mentioned any numbers," Williams said. "The only thing that we have asked for is to look at my situation and to compare it with players that have more or less my numbers and my time in the big leagues. And on that basis, make me an offer."
Boras has repeatedly compared Williams to Gary Sheffield, the Marlins outfielder, who signed a six-year, $61 million extension in April and Sammy Sosa, the Cubs outfielder, who signed a four-year, $42.5 million extension.
The Yankees, on the other hand, can use Cleveland's Kenny Lofton and Baltimore's Brady Anderson as comparable in the negotiations; Anderson recently signed a five-year contract that with noninterest-bearing deferred money is worth about $5.6 million a year. Lofton signed a three-year deal worth $8.1 million a year.
Yankees General Manager Bob Watson has said he had been advised that Williams could get $7.5 million in arbitration this year, while some agents contend Williams could get $10 million.
The Yankee center fielder also denied that Boras had caused any problems among Williams and his teammates and Yankee officials.
"There is a reason I hired my attorney," Williams said. "I certainly feel he is one of the best at what he does. You know, he's got a job to do. And his job is to do the best he can working on behalf of Bernie Williams. That doesn't necessarily mean a contract, but the relationship with the club as well. I think he's doing a pretty good job.
"There's been a lot of talk over the past years about him being a rough agent. But if you want one guy in your corner, you want it to be the kind of guy who is able to fight and has a well-made reputation of being a tough guy."
Williams said escalating baseball salaries should not surprise anyone.
"The economics of the game allow the owners, with their competitive nature, to try to outbid themselves in order to get the best personnel available," Williams said. "Fortunately, players are the recipient of that situation. In a way, it's great. I mean, we're living in an era right now that if you stay healthy and keep producing the way the top players are capable of producing, then they've got a chance to stay financially secure for a long while."
Williams said he is staying focused on his preparations for the coming season, and that living in his native Puerto Rico, where he spends most of his time when not playing in New York, has helped him keep things in perspective.
"I know it's been crazy up there," Williams said of the New York news media's coverage of his contract talks with the Yankees. "I'm very fortunate to be down here, and isolating myself a little bit from the situation. I'm spending a lot of time with my family and training very, very hard. I'm making a commitment that I want to be ready for next year and the years to come."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The CARLOS BAERGA celebrities softball game, which drew players like PEDRO MARTINEZ, MOISES ALOU, DAVE JUSTICE and SANDY ALOMAR, has raised more than $120,000 for charities in Puerto Rico over the past three years. This year, for the first time, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to a New York-based organization, the Queens Child Guidance Center.

HEADLINE: Where to Find New Designers' Labels

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO 

 BODY:
Just as designers are constantly seeking new places to sell their clothes, so are stores always on the lookout for new designers. How else can retailers differentiate their wares when the same big lines can be found in just about every store? And how else can they try to stay a step ahead of women's changing demands?
Fashion is a volatile business where standing still can mean economic death, so stores have to replenish stocks frequently to entice customers to make return visits. Offering new labels is one way to get a woman's attention. While exclusivity is not always possible in a highly competitive market, latching on to the next fashion star can give a retailer an inside track on developing an ongoing relationship with a designer. 
 There will always be women who feel safe in clothes like those their peers are wearing, labels that are immediately recognizable to their friends and associates. But to other women, safe means boring. They want to stand out, to be the first with the newest, and they're confident enough to venture into the unknown. And then, of course, there are women who want the latest fashions but either cannot or will not pay high designer prices, and a young designer's clothes are often more affordable.
The trick for retailers is to tempt all these women by presenting them with new design talent that is fresh enough to attract the adventurous and wearable enough to appeal to the timid. They may find this talent in a trade show, an East Village walk-up, an obscure boutique in Paris or simply by opening the office door to an unknown designer with a garment bag (that's how Calvin Klein, among others, got his first break).
"As we go into the millennium, there is a whole new group of designers we weren't familiar with a year ago," said Kal Ruttenstein, the vice president for fashion direction of Bloomingdale's. "The amazing and interesting thing is that they're doing some of the things top designers are doing, like sheer looks with touches of glitter, and doing them in a wearable way, so they can be worn off the runways and out in the evenings."
Some of these young designers are really new in business, while some have been toiling in relative obscurity until a big store gave them a chance.
Rebecca Taylor, a native of New Zealand, has had her own business in New York (in partnership with Elizabeth Hutchens) for just a year, after spending five years as an assistant designer to Cynthia Rowley. She makes dressy dresses and separates with a vaguely vintage air. Bloomingdale's and Barneys New York are selling her clothes.
Paul & Joe is Sophie Albou's two-year-old French label, which started with shirts and now includes a range of sportswear with an element of street style. The company carries the names of Ms. Albou's two sons. Her clothes can be found at Bloomingdale's and Barneys.
Yoshiki Hishinuma was designing clothing, theatrical costumes and home furnishings in Japan for 10 years before taking his fashion collection to Paris in 1992. His signature style involves intricate seaming and crinkled fabrics. The first store to carry his clothing in America, Henri Bendel, has had it for two seasons.
O Zen is a new label by Carla Sozzani, who owns the influential gallery-cum-fashion store 10 Corso Como in Milan, Italy. Her latest endeavor is marked by architectural shapes combined with flowing lines. Barneys New York introduced the line for fall. Henri Bendel will have it for spring.
After five years of designing the successful Parallel sportswear line, Katayone Adeli, who is based in California, started a collection under her own name earlier this year. Her sexy, body-conscious clothes were immediately picked up by major stores, including Bloomingdale's.
Theory, an instantly successful line of stretch sportswear, was brought out earlier this year by Elie Tahari, who is better known for career clothes, and Andrew Rosen, formerly of Anne Klein. It is sold in many major stores and trendy boutiques.
Isabel Marant is a French designer who started in accessories, switched to knitwear and evolved in the last few years into a full-fledged collection of clothing that blurs the line between day and evening. Her clothes are sold at Bendel's, Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman.
Jagoda Kursa, who was born in Poland, works in Paris, making hand-painted, handmade clothing of crinkly, fluttery fabrics. Bendel's will have her dresses and separates for spring.
Mark Kroeker started designing highly detailed and inventive ready-to-wear in New York last year after stints as an art director, interior designer and illustrator. Linda Dresner carries his clothes on an exclusive basis.
Fake is a London-based line of recycled cashmeres designed by Desiree Meyer, who cuts up old sweaters and reassembles them into abstract patterns or variations on the Union Jack. They are available at Barneys.
Cathryn Avison, whose clothes are also sold at Barneys, is a British designer who specializes in elegant dresses and accessories marked by embroidery and cutout work inspired by the 1920's.
Equality is a three-year-old California line designed by Anke Crispen, who is German-born and whose clothing has a vintage look with embroidery and velvet trimmings. It is sold at Barneys and Bloomingdale's.
IS, a five-year-old California company whose designer, Ilana Siboni, is a native of Israel, specializes in unusual fabrics cut into simple shapes. Barneys and Bloomingdale's carry the line.
Although it becomes more difficult each year for a new designer to sustain a business financially, these newcomers are at least getting a chance to take the next big step into label recognition.

HEADLINE: UAL's Results To Top Forecasts

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, said today that it expected its fourth-quarter income to exceed analyst estimates.
Shares in UAL rose $5.375, to $89.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 UAL said it expected per-share earnings to beat the $1.58 that analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation had forecast.
UAL's chairman, Gerald Greenwald, said that the booking trends for the fourth quarter and 1998 for the airline had not changed, despite the economic situation in Asia. UAL also said it believed that 1998 income would improve on 1997's record results.
While prospects for the Atlantic, Latin American and the South Pacific markets remain positive, the international environment could be more volatile, UAL said.
Revenue growth in the Pacific has been slower than in the United States for much of 1997, and is expected to continue into 1998, the airline said.
UAL said that the airline still faced a number of challenges, including increased costs resulting from recent labor agreements, increased maintenance expenses and the volatility in Asia.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Snow and Cold Hit Mexico, Causing Jump in Coffee Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Coffee prices soared yesterday on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York after snow and cold temperatures in Mexico raised concern that next year's harvest could be damaged.
On other markets, platinum fell to the lowest price in four and a half years. 
 Over the weekend, freezing temperatures swept into the states of Hidalgo and San Luis Potosi, which grow 4.5 percent of Mexico's coffee. Monterrey, in northern Mexico, recorded its first snowfall in 30 years. Temperatures stayed above freezing in Chiapas, home to about one-third of the nation's crop.
"There could be damage to next year's crop or delays to this year's harvest," said Charles Cronly, a vice president of trading at Harry J. Acer Corporation, a coffee trader in Palisades Park, N.J.
Because of damage from hurricanes this year, Mexico's coffee crop will probably be 5.2 million to 5.5 million bags, down from an estimated 6 million, said Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
The adverse weather comes as shipping delays from Mexico and Colombia have forced roasters to draw down inventories. The Green Coffee Association of New York said after markets closed yesterday that warehouse stockpiles in November were 1.515 million bags, down 25 percent from October. Traders had expected a decline of about 4 percent.
Coffee for March delivery rose 5.55 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $1.8545 a pound, the highest since Sept. 8.
Platinum fell to its lowest price in more than four and half years and palladium reached a three-month low amid expectations that a weak economy would reduce demand from Japan, one of the world's top importing countries.
"Concern about what is going to happen in the Far East is certainly pushing platinum and palladium prices down," said Frank Redden, a trader in Wayne, Pa., for Johnson Matthey, a marketer of precious metals.
Platinum for January delivery fell $8.20, or 2.3 percent, to settle at $352 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest for a most-active contract since March 18, 1993. March palladium shed $8.25, or 4.1 percent, to $191 an ounce.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Yen On Japan Business Pessimism

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday after a survey showed that Japanese companies' confidence in the country's economy had severely eroded.
The dollar touched an intraday peak of 131.45 yen, the highest since May 1992, after the Japanese central bank released its business confidence survey, known as the Tankan. The business confidence index fell to a level of -11 from +3 in the previous survey on Oct. 1. The survey figure represents the percentage of companies reporting that conditions are improving, minus the percentage seeing conditions worsening. 
 After the release, the yen recouped some losses as currency traders seemed wary about the expected announcement today of Japanese Government measures aimed at stabilizing the sagging financial system. "It's critical that they come up with a credible way to recapitalize their banks and not just throw all their money into a bailout fund," said Ricardo Gomes, foreign-exchange chief at Republic National Bank.
The dollar also erased earlier gains on the German mark as the mark remained strong against the yen.
"The markets are shifting into holiday mode," Mr. Gomes said. "It's fairly thin. It doesn't take much to move the markets now."
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 130.68 yen, up from 130.45 on Friday. It changed hands at 1.7740 marks, down from 1.7753.
Adding to the concern about Japan's economy, the Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah all dropped to record lows against the dollar yesterday. The Philippine peso and Singapore dollar also fell.
The dollar rose to a nearly two-month high against the British pound as prospects dimmed for another rise in British interest rates. The Bank of England has raised rates five times since May in attempts to slow inflation.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of industrial nations, said yesterday that British economic growth was likely to slow "considerably, to a more sustainable pace" in 1998 and 1999.
The pound was quoted at $1.6316, down from $1.6496. It was the dollar's highest level against the British currency since late in October.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 84.29, but Nasdaq Index Dips

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Cautious investors waded into the stock market yesterday, buying selectively and moving some broad market indexes higher after five consecutive sessions of declines.
But many preferred to stay in the shallow end of the pool, embracing a defensive posture and just purchasing stocks of domestic companies and other concerns they believe are less likely to be severely hurt by Asia's economic woes. 
 Aided by investors' more cautious stance were companies like Allstate and retailers like Costco, Safeway, and Wal-Mart, as well as newspaper companies such as Washington Post and Gannett. In addition, traditional havens like drug and pharmaceutical stocks of Pfizer, American Home Products, Merck, Eli Lilly, Abbott Labs and Schering Plough and Johnson & Johnson finished higher. Lilly, for example, rose 2 1/8, to 65 3/8, while American Home Products gained 2 3/16, to 74 13/16.
A 7.2 percent rise in South Korea's stock market yesterday and news that the Government would allow the country's currency, the won, to float freely did little to ease investors' concerns about the region.
"I'm trying to keep my portfolio as defensive and Asia-proof as possible until the stock market tells me it's safe to come out," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation.
"It's clear that the market has not gotten over its jitters," Mr. Johnson added, saying that investors are still worried that Asia's economic problems will lead to "more bad news announced by American companies." That expectation and concerns about eroding portfolio gains as the year closes, are keeping investors "very cautious about buying something new" this late in the year, said Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management in New York.
In these cautious crosscurrents, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.29 points, to 7,922.59, a 1.1 percent gain after falling more than 310 points or 3.8 percent last week.
Standard & Poor's 500-company stock index rose 10 points, or 1.1 percent, to 963.39. It also fell more than 3 percent last week.
Despite turnarounds in some previously battered stocks like Intel, Applied Materials, Cisco and Oracle, the Nasdaq composite index just failed to break into positive territory yesterday, ending down 0.02 point at 1,536.56.
And while some technology shares were stronger, several computer-related shares led by the Dell Computer Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation fell again amid renewed concern that the economic crisis in Asia will slow worldwide demand for personal computers next year.
Because of such declines, a growing number of portfolio managers say they are beginning to like some battered technology stocks at these cheaper prices, but few have backed up the rhetoric with purchases.
"Two months ago everything was up equally," said John T. Wilson, a portfolio manager for the $1.8 billion State Street Research Investment Trust. But "now defensive stocks are up and some technology stocks are on sale" and investment decisions are "less clear now. Do you really want to be selling Compaq in the 50's when its fallen from almost 80 and putting it into Bell Atlantic which has risen from the high 50's into the 90's?"
"Some of the risk has come out of technology and some defensive stocks are not as attractive," he said, but "no one wants to do anything too brave or too Draconian at year-end."
"If you could see some stability in the technology sector and the Pacific Rim, then people would put money to work," said Michael W. Clark, a managing director and head of United States equity trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But that's a big if."

HEADLINE: Albright in Africa: The Embraceable Regimes?

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Dec. 15

 BODY:
When Madeleine K. Albright flew to Africa last week to begin her first tour of the continent as Secretary of State, the aim was to open a new era in relations by embracing a "new generation" of leaders that Washington has cited as examples for others to follow.
But by the time Ms. Albright flew from Zimbabwe to Europe today, at the end of her seven-nation tour, events throughout her visit -- like the questions she faced from audiences here and there -- served instead to cast doubt on Washington's new African choices. 
 Ms. Albright made obligatory references to the need for democracy in almost every country she visited, but African commentators and critics of the Administration's new Africa policy noted that her very choice of countries seemed to undermine any American emphasis on democratic development in a continent still struggling with a heavy legacy of dictatorship.
Except for South Africa, power was won by the gun in every country Ms. Albright visited. And although Africa is not lacking in fragile but reasonably well-functioning democracies, Ms. Albright's visit with Nelson Mandela was her only meeting with an incontestably democratic leader.
In Congo, the centerpiece of Ms. Albright's tour, bitterness over her itinerary was particularly sharp. Congolese opposition leaders complained that Washington and the West generally gave only tepid support to their democratic struggle against the three-decade dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko, who finally fled an armed revolt in his country -- then called Zaire -- and died in exile earlier this year.
And once Mr. Mobutu was seriously threatened, Washington and many other Western capitals enthusiastically backed the rebel leader who overthrew him in the spring and who has since become President, Laurent Kabila.
"Frankly, we are somewhat confused by the signals Washington is sending to Africa these days," said Serge Kalonji, a Congolese opposition leader. "For years we were lectured about the virtues of democracy and the need for the rule of law, and we took this to heart. But in reality, if you want to get Washington's attention and respect, you are better off picking up the gun."
During their stop in Congo, as they did with other leaders throughout the trip, Ms. Albright and her entourage steadfastly played down Mr. Kabila's democratic and human rights shortcomings. Ms. Albright's announced tactic of "listening more and talking less" ultimately led to embarrassment, when Mr. Kabila gave a mocking performance at their joint news conference. Warning that he would continue to imprison his opponents, he smirked as he sarcastically pronounced "Vive la democratie" at the event's conclusion.
Ms. Albright was generous in her expressions of regret for serious flaws in Washington's past policies, notably its long support for Mr. Mobutu, and for its failure to react swiftly to the Rwandan blood bath, which saw half a million members of the Tutsi minority and some moderate Hutu there killed by the Hutu majority.
Critics of Washington's new approach say Ms. Albright's Africa team must go further still, if it is to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.
Washington's support or opposition to African leaders in the past was based almost entirely on cold-war calculations of national security and access to mineral wealth.
But, even absent the cold war, some critics say that Washington's new policies eerily mimic those of the past. Like Washington's discredited old allies, the new favorites on the continent -- leaders like Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia and Gen. Paul Kagame in Rwanda -- have been embraced largely for security reasons.
Mr. Museveni and his counterparts in Ethiopia and Eritrea are closely cooperating in an American-supported bid to unseat a strict Islamic Government in the Sudan that has for years tried to impose Islamic law on a non-Muslim south, and that Washington accuses of supporting international terrorism.
Washington's new allies in Rwanda and Congo, meanwhile, are counted on to keep a lid their countries, which are seen as potentially explosive, and therefore costly. But in each country, events during Ms. Albright's visit only underlined the precariousness of the United States' bet.
As Ms. Albright was leaving Rwanda, Hutu militiamen attacked a camp of Tutsi refugees in the country's northwest, killing hundreds. The same day, armed rebels overran Bukavu, a major provincial city in eastern Congo.
During her stop there, Ms. Albright expressed sympathy and understanding for Rwanda's leaders, who are mostly Tutsi and remain deeply scarred by the 1994 killing frenzy waged against their minority, who make up only 15 percent of Rwanda's people.
Left unaddressed, critics of Washington's policy say, is whether reconciliation in Rwanda can ever be achieved under minority military rule, or if United States support for the Tutsi Government is merely delaying another violent day of reckoning by a disenfranchised and angry Hutu majority.
While some of Washington's new African allies have begun to rehabilitate their devastated economies, they have been far slower to reform their methods of governing. Free elections are unheard of, and the arrest of journalists and other human rights abuses are common.
In official briefing papers for Ms. Albright's trip, shortcomings like these were neatly glossed over. Mr. Museveni in Uganda, for example, who does not permit multiparty politics, was called a "beacon of hope" who runs a "uni-party democracy."
Elsewhere in Africa, where multiparty elections are regularly held under international pressure, albeit often with flawed results, the American praise for Uganda was met with harsh criticism. Some saw the approach as hypocritical and patronizing, charging that the policy said, in effect, that the West does not expect Africans to uphold widely held standards of democracy or human rights that are emphasized in other parts of the world.
"In the 1960's, many American experts on Africa were supporting one-party states, citing Africa's supposed specificity," said Peter Rosenblum, projects director of the Harvard Human Rights Project.
"Today, we seem deeply unbothered by the widespread rights violations in Ethiopia, the failure of Uganda to secure the rule of law, or by the creation of a Tutsi military ethnocracy in Rwanda," he added. "In Congo, people in the Administration resent questions about human rights."

HEADLINE: U.S. Production Increased By 0.8% During November

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities surged eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, propelled by increases in the output of computers and motor vehicles.
The seasonally adjusted advance pushed the industrial operating rate of capacity to 83.2 percent, the highest rate since September 1995, from 82.9 percent, the Federal Reserve said today. 
 Though relatively high, that rate does not necessarily signal the development of inflationary bottlenecks, analysts said. That's because slacker economies, mainly in Asia, have left plenty of capacity worldwide to produce most manufactured goods.
Today's report comes just one day before Federal Reserve policy makers gather to set short-term interest rates. Most economists believe the Fed will opt to hold rates steady into early next year.
The November production advance was the sharpest since July and marked the 20th month without a decline.
"Information processing equipment and parts used in high-technology equipment contributed notably to the gain," the Federal Reserve said. "In addition, the production of motor vehicles, which had declined some in October, increased sharply."
Output of appliances, carpeting, furniture, aircraft, chemical products, construction supplies, lumber, electrical machinery and food products rose, too.
Production at factories alone rose 1 percent, the best gain since April 1996. Output at mines and oil wells fell two-tenths of 1 percent and at utilities, nine-tenths of percent.
Output of business equipment rose 1.5 percent after rising five-tenths of 1 percent in October.
Within that category, output of computer and office equipment rose 1.8 percent, while production of information processing equipment increased 1.1 percent, the Fed said.
Output of consumer durable goods increased an adjusted 2.5 percent after falling seven-tenths of 1 percent. Materials output rose an adjusted seven-tenths of 1 percent after increasing five-tenths in October.

HEADLINE: Dominicans, Scrabbling for Hope;
As Poverty Rises, More Women Head the Households

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
On a white counter in Josefina Disla's tiny kitchen a place of honor is reserved for a small ceramic statue of Our Lady of Charity, who, legend has it, saved three drowning fishermen from a Caribbean storm in the 17th century. La Virgen de la Caridad, as she is known to believers, is said to save those who have lost all hope.
In Ms. Disla's kitchen, the virgin is submerged in a crystal bowl filled with water and surrounded by hundreds of pennies. Each penny represents a wish: health for her three children, ages 14, 15 and 19, and for her 3-year-old granddaughter; jobs, mostly cleaning other people's homes and taking care of their children, and, more and more these days, a fervent prayer that her older daughter will not end up like her, a poor, single Dominican immigrant mother in a strange land. 
 Fervent though her prayers may be, she is up against daunting probabilities.
A growing share of New York City's Dominican households -- roughly half, according to a new study -- are headed by women. Like Josefina Disla, they are mostly single mothers confronting language barriers and a shortage of jobs for unskilled workers, and their lives, sociologists say, go a long way toward explaining the rising and alarming poverty of the city's Dominican community.
Dominicans are hardly alone at this intersection of single motherhood and economic distress. But nowhere is the phenomenon more common than among Dominicans, the largest and fastest-growing immigrant group in the city.
The reasons, experts say, are complex. Many are common to most immigrant groups; indeed, the process of immigration can often leave families in shreds -- by its very nature and because of legal vagaries that allow one member of a couple to get a visa but not the other.
But the Dominican family also faces special stresses, rooted in the national culture and in the extraordinarily fluid way in which Dominicans move between homeland and new land.
Ms. Disla's family had been scraping by together in the Dominican Republic until 1989, when her husband traveled to New York in search of a better-paying job. Ms. Disla and her children waited five more years for visas. When they arrived, they found that time had taken its toll. Ms. Disla's husband had started a new family with another woman. Soon after, he returned to the Dominican Republic, leaving Ms. Disla and their children alone in Washington Heights.
"We were a normal family before," said Ms. Disla's 19-year-old daughter, Elba Bautista, already a single mother herself. "I went a little crazy here. We all did."
Ms. Disla does not blame the United States for her husband's infidelity or the crumbling of her family. Instead, she points to the plight of immigrants, who, in their desperation to abandon the poverty of their own country, sometimes are willing to sacrifice the family unit for the opportunity to live in the United States.
Many arrive in New York alone, hoping to support the children and partners left behind in the Dominican Republic. Others say that once established here they plan to bring the rest of the family over.
Studies show how poverty among Dominican households in New York City is rising with the increase in the percentage of households headed by women. One released last month by professors from City College and Columbia University and based on an analysis of annual census surveys found that 49 percent of the city's Dominican households were headed by women, compared with an average of 25.6 percent for the city as a whole. At the same time, the study found that the poverty rate among Dominicans, 45.7, was almost double the overall poverty rate in the city last year (23.8 percent).
"The two go hand in hand," said one of the two principal researchers, Prof. Ramona Hernandez, a sociologist at CUNY. "When there are no fathers at home and when there are no good paying jobs for women, there is going to be poverty."
Indeed, another study, by the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, a privately funded nonprofit organization, shows that just over half of the children (50.9 percent) in Washington Heights, a predominantly Dominican neighborhood, receive public assistance. The citywide average is 33.8 percent. City statisticians have found that in 1990 a higher percentage of Dominican households received public assistance than any other immigrant group except for people from the former Soviet Union.
Professor Hernandez said that, aside from immigration, other issues conspired against the Dominican family. Traditionally, she said, some poor Dominicans have shied away from marriage because it is just too expensive and cumbersome to have a formal wedding and because, for many people in the Dominican Republic, there is little shame attached to a couple living together outside of marriage. In many cases, though, economic pressures drive men away, and the women are left destitute and with no legal rights to protect them.
"In our culture, the men are supposed to be providers," she said. "When the men can't do that, when they try and try and can't find jobs, they simply pack up and leave. Better to do that than to face the daily consequences of their failure. It happens back home, and it obviously is happening here, too. And then it's the women who have to pick up the pieces."
When her husband left, Ms. Disla, who had never worked outside the home, found herself with three young children and no way to support them. The jobs she found did not pay enough to allow her to afford child care. Ms. Disla was forced to solicit public assistance and find odd jobs, cleaning homes and baby-sitting.
Ms. Disla, who owned a home in Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights. Welfare checks and food stamps -- about $600 a month -- pay for part of her rent and for the food she puts on the table every day. Medicaid pays for her children's and granddaughter's medical bills and even for the insulin shots that keep her diabetes under control.
At 39, Ms. Disla is often depressed and sometimes unable to get out of bed. Without the support of her husband, she cannot live in the Dominican Republic. If she remains here, she can at least hope that her children will have better opportunities and that welfare checks will help to support her family. Already, her older daughter, Ms. Bautista, is studying English and hopes to become a bookkeeper.
Women like Ms. Bautista are sometimes aided by community organizations, such as the Alianza Dominicana and the Dominican Women's Development Center, which train them to become self-sufficient. But with limited resources and a constant stream of new immigrants needing services, agency workers say they barely scratch the surface.
"The numbers are certainly alarming, and so are the needs," said Ydanis Rodriguez, executive director of the Union of Young Dominicans, a group of professionals who are forming committees to study the problems of Dominican immigrants and who plan to seek the help of wealthy Dominicans, such as the fashion designer Oscar de la Renta and Juan Luis Guerra, a musician. "But the worst part, really, is the lack of hope: the belief that some of the poorest in our community have that, no matter what they do, they are not going to get out of where they are now."
Frida Marte, a member of Mr. Rodriguez's group, sees the consequences of poverty every day. She is a teacher at George Washington High School, where the majority of the students come from the Dominican Republic. Most of her students live only with their mothers, she said, and many do not even know their fathers. They come from poor households, where the mothers have to work two and three jobs just to feed the children and pay the rent. Many are at risk -- from quitting school to committing crimes to suicide. Recently, three George Washington students were arrested and charged with kidnapping and killing Nelson G. Gross, a New Jersey millionaire businessman. Last year, five girls attempted suicide, she said.
Ms. Marte may well understand her students perhaps better than most teachers. She is a single mother of two children, a 14-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy. The children have different fathers. Ms. Marte, who came from the Dominican Republic in 1970, when she was 10 years old, said she chose not to marry her first partner. The second time she married her child's father but he, too, left. Neither one of her children's fathers helps support them.
Ms. Marte leans on her family for help in buying clothing and winter shoes for the children. Yet, she says she feels lucky. Compared with the lives of her students, her children are fortunate that she has an education and a good job.
"I see how my students suffer every day," Ms. Marte said. "And it all starts with the home and their lack of self-esteem."
How her children view their lives and themselves is Argentina Urena's main preoccupation. A psychology student when she was in college in the Dominican Republic, she is particularly aware of her children's needs and how the fact that she is a single mother may affect them. These days, though, her boys, 8 and 12, seem to be more worried about how she makes a living than about their absent father, who left the family seven years ago.
Ms. Urena, who came to the United States 14 years ago, following her boyfriend, sells empanadas and other Dominican pastries and cold drinks in the streets every morning and makes gift baskets in a New Jersey factory the rest of the day. Her days begin at 6:30. Dressed for business, which in cold weather entails hiking boots, two pairs of pants, a knit cap and five layers of sweaters, she pushes her cart up and down St. Nicholas Avenue from 8 A.M. until noon. Three hours later, she is at the factory, where she works until midnight, making $6.17 an hour.
Her older son, Luis Javier, wants her to give up the empanada business and get another job, in an office or a house, anywhere but the streets. On Sundays, he reads the classified advertisements in the newspapers and suggests that she apply for some of the jobs. Ms. Urena has applied to several but has had no luck so far. Her younger son, Yadiel, recently punched a classmate who made fun of his mother on the school bus, chanting, "Quipe, quipe!" the name of a pastry Ms. Urena sells for $1.
Ms. Urena, 34, says she no longer thinks of what is best for her. She concentrates on her children's future and, while returning to the Dominican Republic remains a dream, she says she will not. "My children are American," she said. "This is their country, and this is what is best for them."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Fall in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fellyesterday as stocks gained on upbeat news from Korea over the weekend.
The 30-year bond fell 21/32, to 102 6/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.97 percent, from 5.92 percent on Friday. 
 Traders said signs of a return to global stock market stability could signal the end of the flight to quality that fueled last week's bond rally.
Bonds also slumped ahead of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting after a larger than expected increase in factory output. The increase of eight-tenths of a percent last month was higher than the four-tenths of 1 percent some economists had expected. It challenged the notion that the economy is slowing, which some thought would be hastened by the Asian market slump.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, believes rates are currently caught in a tug-of-war. On one side is the Asian financial turmoil, which some market participants believe will slow the United States economy and keep inflation low, not to mention the flight to quality by investors seeking shelter from those markets that have lowered short-term rates here and supported Treasuries for weeks. Also, the shrinking Federal budget deficit, rising stock market -- despite recent volatility -- strong consumer confidence and strong dollar. On the other side, he said, we have a strong United States economy that has the potential to accelerate inflation, with faster wage gains in a tighter labor market, rising consumer debt including delinquencies, along with personal bankruptcies. And in the middle, there is the Fed.
"The balance of these pro and con factors favors continued economic growth in 1998, albeit at a noticeably slower pace," Mr. Hoffman said.
Yesterday, yields slipped as market participants grew cautious ahead of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting and release of the November Consumer Price Index and housing starts, putting buyers on the side lines. Few in the market expect the Fed will take any action today, but even that did not dissuade the market from pricing the risk premium anyway.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., thought the market was also concerned about how the Japanese were going to remedy their banking problems. "That is more important than any of the other stuff," he said. "If no solution is found there is the threat that the Japanese can liquidate some of their Treasury holdings and that could put pressure on prices regardless of what the Fed does. That is the critical issue this week. Even the threat of it happening has put pressure on the market." "Nonetheless, I'm still sticking to a 5.80 yield on the long bond very shortly," Mr. Pugliese said.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:

HEADLINE: Clinton Hails Iran Overture but Isolation Policy Is Unchanged

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton today hailed conciliatory remarks toward the United States by Iran's new President, but his Administration remains committed to its policy of isolating Iran as punishment for its behavior.
In remarks to reporters during a White House picture-taking session, Mr. Clinton said he "would like nothing better than to have a dialogue with Iran." But at the same time, he listed his Administration's continuing concerns about what he called Iran's sponsorship of terrorism, its violent attacks on the peace process and its development and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. 
 Administration officials said President Mohammed Khatami's surprising expression of hope for "thoughtful dialogue" with America did nothing to persuade Mr. Clinton to alter, or even seriously review, the policy of isolation against Iran that has been in place since the fall of the Government of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in 1979 and the taking of American hostages at the embassy in Teheran later that year.
But Mr. Khatami's comments did intensify a debate that has been raging in the Administration on the best way to carry out that policy. Senior officials have argued for weeks about whether the United States should impose sanctions on foreign companies that do business with Iran in violation of American law.
And Administration officials said they were concerned that Mr. Khatami might have been trying to play into that debate by making Iran seem reasonable in the eyes of American allies, who strongly oppose Washington's sanctions policy.
Iran has bedeviled every American President since Jimmy Carter, whose Presidency foundered in part on the hostage crisis. Mr. Clinton throughout his Presidency has made an effort to stay away from Iran -- and even to increase its economic and diplomatic isolation.
The President's remarks do not reflect a substantial policy change, although an Administration official said they were intended to send a "positive response" to Mr. Khatami.
But Mr. Clinton and his team are still so committed to a policy of "dual containment" -- isolating both Iran and Iraq -- that they have resisted calls by Democratic lawmakers and independent experts to modify their policy on Iran. The United States has declined to order a full-scale policy review of Iran since elections there in May and has not conducted a government-wide intelligence assessment of Iran in the last year.
The most heated debate in the Administration over Iran policy is whether the United States should impose sanctions on companies in France, Russia, Malaysia, Canada and Indonesia that have signed ambitious deals to develop natural gas fields in Iran.
The White House has convened several meetings of the Administration's top national security advisers or their deputies in the last several weeks, but they have failed to reach a decision on the issue.
In such a meeting on Dec. 5, Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, presented a written analysis on the costs and benefits of sanctions against Iran, including the argument that imposing sanctions, as required by law, would seriously damage Washington's relations with European trading partners and with Russia, according to Administration officials familiar with the meeting.
But Mr. Eizenstat has said sanctions might be waived if the Europeans and Russians took tougher joint action against Iran, including punitive measures for its development of weapons of mass destruction and what the United States defines as its sponsorship of terrorism.
But other officials, including Leon S. Fuerth, Vice President Gore's national security adviser, argued strongly for imposing sanctions, saying the Administration's priority must be to punish Iran for its support of terrorism and its efforts to develop its military ability.
During the 1980's, Mr. Gore took a hard line against the Republican policy of engaging with Iraq, going so far as to blame Mr. Bush's policy for the war with Iraq. And as a potential Presidential candidate in 2000, Mr. Gore does not want to be seen as being soft on Iran.
The President's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and his deputy, James Steinberg, have been described by participants in the meetings as the "referees." Mr. Berger has made the point that waiving sanctions would cause a protest from the Republican-dominated Congress.
In another dispute, the State Department has praised Russia for cooperating with an American-led initiative to eliminate the transfer of missile technology to Iran. Officials at the Department have pointed to steps taken by President Boris N. Yeltsin to curb missile exports by Russian companies to Iran, including the expulsion of an Iranian diplomat for trying to buy Russian missile-engine blueprints.
But American intelligence officials who closely watch Iran and Russia say that despite the positive steps, they do not believe that Russian companies have limited their cooperation with Iran, and that in any case, it may already be too late.
"By having done what it has in the past two years, the Russians have allowed the Iranian missile program to progress so far along it doesn't matter what happens now," a senior intelligence official said.
Still, there are small, isolated signs of good will to rebuild a relationship of trust with Iran that has not existed since the fall of the Shah nearly 19 years ago.
In a bold rescue mission several weeks ago, sailors on a United States Navy vessel in the Persian Gulf saved the life of an ailing Iranian seaman by removing him from his vessel, a senior Adminsitration offical said. He was moved to the American vessel on a winch and flown in an American helicopter to Bahrain, where he underwent surgery before being returned to Iran.
And the Administration has allowed Karl F. Inderfurth, the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, to step up talks on Afghanistan at the United Nations that were begun by his predecessor and to include Iranian officials.
Meanwhile, Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat and a key foreign policy player in Congress, has added his voice to the chorus of experts on the Middle East who have called on the Administration to modify its Iran policy.
Over the last few months, he said he has told a number of senior Administration officials, including Mr. Berger, that the United States should abandon dual containment.
"I support the military containment of Iran, but slowly and gradually we should establish a reliable, authoritative dialogue," Mr. Hamilton said in a telephone interview. "I do not exclude commercial relations with Iran in the future. We need to review the policy."

Malaysia Taking Pledge of Austerity

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 15

 BODY:
For months, Malaysia resisted the pain, blaming foreign speculators, playing down its economic problems and leading analysts to brand it a country in denial.
Now, desperate to avoid the ministrations of the International Monetary Fund already under way in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, the Government here has swung into action. 
 Over the last 10 days, it has announced a program of austerity measures that some Malaysians are calling a home-grown I.M.F. plan -- abandoning aggressive growth policies the nation has pursued for a decade.
The measures are a belated but ambitious effort to rescue the economy. Since the beginning of the year, the currency has dropped by 35 percent, and the stock market has plummeted more than 70 percent in dollar terms -- most of that damage occurring in the last three months. Prices for imported goods, and even for some staples, are starting to rise.
"We must reassure the world that we will carry out what we have undertaken to do at whatever cost," Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said this past weekend, dropping his resistance to economic changes.
The task here now, as it is for other ailing Asian economies, will be to follow through on restructuring plans that challenge an ingrained way of doing business.
Gathering here today, the leaders of nine Southeast Asian nations expressed their frustration with the help they had received so far from the I.M.F. and called on the United States, Europe and Japan to help rescue the region.
"Despite the economic fundamentals of the regional economies being corrected and improved through the support and advice of the I.M.F., the depreciation of the currencies has continued unabated," said a statement by the leaders, who are marking the 30th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
As they met, together with leaders from China, Japan and South Korea, the currencies of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand all fell to new lows. Some other Asian currencies also declined.
Malaysia's economic retrenchment has been outlined in a series of statements by Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also Finance Minister and something of a foil to his aggressive boss, Dr. Mahathir.
Government spending is to be cut by 18 percent and officials' salaries, by as much as 10 percent. Several of Dr. Mahathir's ambitious building projects will be put on hold, and expensive imports like aircraft and ships will be halted. Military spending will be cut and most lending for construction will be frozen.
"We don't have any choice," Mr. Anwar said. "We have to take these tough measures if we want to boost the economy and restore confidence."
Bank credits will be restricted, he said, and there will be "no question of any bailout" for ailing banks and other financial institutions. "I have sympathy," he continued. "I don't want to see these guys go bankrupt. But there is a limit."
Last week, Malaysia's central bank governor, Ahmad Mohd Don, said, "We will not hesitate to close down any banking institution operating in a manner which is detrimental to the interests of its depositors or is insolvent."
In his remarks over the weekend, the Prime Minister agreed. "What is not viable must be killed outright so the survivors can be free to consolidate their positions," he said. "People unnecessarily employed should be retired."
Mr. Anwar acknowledged that these steps meant unemployment -- as many as 200,000 jobs -- and the possibility of social tension with a political cost. "Decisions now have to be purely economic," he said. "Obviously, we will have to undergo a period of slowdown before things get back on track."
In what amounted to a swallowing of national pride, he cut a previous estimate of annual growth in coming years to 4 or 5 percent, from a projection of 7 percent just two months ago. Financial analysts said the figure could be lower still.
In addition to less growth, the analysts said, the austerity measures would probably mean an increase in interest rates, a wave of bankruptcies and a rise in inflation.
Dr. Mahathir was out of town at an air show when Mr. Anwar made his first announcement on Dec. 5. The new austerity measures are a severe blow to the 72-year-old Prime Minister's ambitions, which have been expressed in showy and expensive building projects, with a goal of making Malaysia a fully developed nation by the year 2020.
"We must make sure that we no longer spend as we used to," Dr. Mahathir conceded in a statement late last week, in which he called on Malaysians to seek economies in their daily lives. "Small things like reducing the consumption of sugar from four spoonfuls to three or two will help," he said.
In detailing the austerity program today, Mr. Anwar said it was time to admit that there were serious problems with Malaysia's economy and that currency traders were not to blame for the current crisis. He said -- as economists have repeatedly -- that the country had benefited from foreign investment as its economy soared over the last decade by an average of 8 percent a year.
When currency traders attacked the Malaysian ringgit this fall, touching off a sharp fall in its value, as they had attacked the Thai baht earlier, Dr. Mahathir took aim at foreign speculators. He pointed his finger at the American financier George Soros and also said that Malaysia might have been the victim of a Jewish "agenda."
Economic analysts said his remarks only heightened the country's problems, raising doubts about its seriousness in dealing with the crisis and contributing to investors' nervousness.
The new measures address some of the causes of Malaysia's problems -- particularly the big infrastructure projects that have been handed out over the years to well-connected companies, without competitive bidding. These have been at the heart of a Malaysian sort of capitalism that has helped cement Dr. Mahathir's political control during 16 years as Prime Minister.
As Mr. Anwar said, "There is a perception that Government will not allow big players to be touched."
This will have to start to change, he said.

HEADLINE: Tax on Cigarettes May Rise To Help Pay for Health Care

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and legislative leaders tentatively agreed today to raise New Jersey's cigarette tax by at least 25 cents to help cover the cost of hospital treatment for uninsured patients, the Governor's top aide said. Additional money would come from the state's unemployment fund and the general budget, the aide said.
Michael P. Torpey, the Governor's chief of staff, said that lawmakers would probably introduce a bill on Tuesday that would likely provide $315 million annually over five years to help hospitals cover the cost of treating tens of thousands of uninsured people. The plan would also provide $101.5 million a year for the state's Hospital Relief Fund, which helps urban hospitals treat hundreds of patients with AIDS and tuberculosis. The program would expire after five years. 
 The state's current financing system, which expires on Dec. 31, provided $300 million this year for charity care and $71.5 million for the relief fund. But hospitals say they spend closer to $400 million annually on charity care.
Although legislative leaders were still arguing over the details tonight, Mr. Torpey said they might increase the cigarette tax by as much as 40 cents a pack. But only 25 to 30 cents would go toward charity care, with the rest going toward school construction projects. A 25-cent increase would raise about $125 million in revenues annually and provide about one-quarter of the money needed for charity care.
Smokers in New Jersey already pay a 40-cent tax on cigarettes, which cost about $2.35 a pack. In comparison, New York has a 56-cent cigarette tax. New Jersey is among about a dozen states that require hospitals to provide free treatment to uninsured patients who are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare and are unable to pay their bills. Since 1993, the state has used more than $2.2 billion from the unemployment insurance fund to pay for its charity care program.
Both organized labor and business groups have harshly criticized the current plan, which relies almost entirely on the unemployment fund. Union leaders have said it was unfair for the state to divert money from the fund to pay for medical care.
Mr. Torpey said the new plan would use about $250 million from the unemployment fund in 1998. But the state would decrease the amount it took from the fund over five years, eventually phasing it out completely, he said. It would make up the difference with money from the general budget, he said.
Mrs. Whitman recommended increasing the cigarette tax by 25 cents for the charity care program two years ago, but the State Legislature refused to consider her proposal. Democrats have been especially skittish about raising the tax, because voters punished them for supporting former Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990. But Senator Richard J. Codey, the new Senate minority leader, said tonight that he was not against using the cigarette tax to pay for part of the program.
Two years ago, the last time the charity care system expired, hospitals around the state were forced to cut staff and postpone payments to vendors while the Governor and legislators took more than six months to agree on a plan.
Roughly 1.3 million people in New Jersey have no health insurance, even though many of them have jobs, according to the United States Census Bureau. Union and business leaders have said that instead of relying on the cigarette tax and the unemployment fund to pay for charity care, New Jersey should tax employers who do not provide health insurance.
The new plan, which would likely be up for a vote on Thursday, would also provide a total of $67 million for two separate health insurance programs, including one for uninsured children and another for people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but whose employers offer no heath coverage.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Freedom of Corruption

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
International freedom of trade has taken on new important meanings, three of them.
It now means the freedom of Asian leaders, bankers and business executives, working in tight partnership, to drive their countries into chaos through institutionalized corruption, nepotism and crony capitalism. 
 It means the freedom of foreign investors to throw money at Asian banks without making sure of their long-term solvency, and to gamble risk free in local currencies.
They acted surprised when the inherently rotten machinery collapsed. Maybe they were. They never looked carefully into the kind of governments and business types they were supporting or the choke hold the government-business alliances put on the economy. Just the thought of that happening at home would have driven American investors into ecstasies of fury and sent out Federal prosecutors in battalion.
They did not see because they did not care. Interest rates were deliciously high. The currency game looked real profitable. They bought the blather about "Asian values" somehow eliminating the need for open dealing, inspection and auditing. Meanwhile, Asian leaders ruled their countries by economic dictates and personal regulations, from forbidding large families to forbidding chewing bubble gum.
Sophisticated, aloof study of Asian business-government partnerships would have shown the dangers. But investors danced right in. No, the foreign investors were not complete fools. They remembered Mexico and knew that if Asian economies collapsed, another bailout would be arranged, paid by U.S. and other taxpayers from international funds.
The Clinton Administration boasts that Mexico has repaid the bailout of foreign peso-gamblers. Mexican workers are not as jovial. Repayment came out of their hides.
So, the third new international trade freedom is the right of citizens of Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia and Korea to have more of their own hides peeled off. Corruption and the bailout to pay for it will force them to wait for more decades to get the medical care, social insurance and housing that their own skills and diligence had earned long ago.
But supporters of real free trade can take some heart -- its perversion can be stopped, maybe.
Two ways exist for the International Monetary Fund to make sure that penalty-free bailouts of economies destroyed from within do not happen yet again. They should be conditions of the $100 billion-plus Asian bailout.
The I.M.F. should appoint international investigation commissions for each sacked country, to dissect the endemic corruption in the former Asian tigers. Countries crying to be bailed out would have to promise to follow the investigations with trials.
Investigations await in fine variety. In Indonesia, we have the deals arranged by and for the Suharto family, their courtiers and agents abroad. In Thailand, we have the falsification of foreign reserves. In South Korea, the central bank arranged a pre-bailout bailout -- drawing down its reserves by secret loans to faltering Korean banks.
Japan has its problems, but it was quite open about the alliance among the banks, government and bureaucracy. When that anti-free-trade partnership wounds the economy, foreigners cannot pretend surprise.
And, spare us astonished cries from foreign investors when China's economy is destroyed by its very special Mafia -- the same combination as in other Asian countries, but with the Communist Party, police and army added on.
Now, as for foreigners who threw money at Asian banks, bought into crumbling companies or gambled in Asian currency, they deserve no compensation. At most, the insurance Americans get when they lose their money in a savings account should do -- $100,000 for each American investing company.
These companies should have to send checks to each stockholder, dividing the money. The company would have to throw in whatever was needed to make the check at least a nickel apiece.
Then, stockholders could keep the same company officers. Or they could choose officers who might look hard enough, and care enough, not to invest in organized, sanctioned corruption and then cry to the world, alms, alms.

Korean Currency Surges After Restraints Are Lifted
In what may prove to be a turning point in Asia's financial crisis, the South Korean won surged early today after the Government relaxed long-held restraints in how the currency is valued. The decision to scrap the artificial limits on the value of the won was announced late Monday.
Since agreeing to a record $57 billion International Monetary Fund bailout nearly two weeks ago, the won had fallen in value by almost half during that time. But the decision to float the currency may help restore investors' confidence in the Government's response to the crisis. Korean stocks also continued to climb early today. Page A1. 

First Dow Gain in Five Sessions
Cautious investors bought stocks selectively and helped the Dow Jones industrial average snap a five-session losing streak. The Dow rose 84.29 points, or 1.08 percent, to 7,922.59, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10 points, or 1.05 percent, to 953.39. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell marginally on declines in Dell and Microsoft. D12.
 
Bond prices fell slightly. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.97 percent from 5.92 percent on Friday. D7.
 
Microsoft to Appeal Court Order

U.S. Bancorp Adding Piper Jaffray
Shares of Piper Jaffray rose 22 percent, or $6.625, to $36.375, after the investment house agreed to be acquired by U.S. Bancorp, the nation's 15th-largest banking company for $730 million in cash. With the acquisition, U.S. Bancorp will have assets under management of about $65 billion. D4.
 
Ernst & Young and KPMG to Vote
American partners at Ernst & Young and KPMG Peat Marwick are to vote this week on a merger that would create the world's largest accounting firm. Regulators at the S.E.C. have expressed concern about this merger and the union of Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, which would reduce the number of major accounting firms to four from eight just a few years ago.

HEADLINE: Suicide Rate Higher in 3 Gambling Cities, Study Says

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

 BODY:
The dramatic increase in legalized gambling in the United States may be leading to a significant increase in suicide rates among both residents of and visitors to communities where casinos are thriving, according to a new study on suicide and gambling.
In the study, Dr. David Phillips, a professor of sociology at the University of California in San Diego, examined death certificates in major gaming cities in the United States -- Atlantic City, Las Vegas, Nev., and Reno -- and found that suicide rates were up to four times higher than in comparably sized cities where gambling is not legal. 
 Because there is a long lag in the compilation of death certificates nationwide, it was not possible to determine whether the 24 states that have legalized casino-type gambling within the last 10 years have experienced a similar increase in suicide rates, said Dr. Phillips, an expert on suicide.
The study by Dr. Phillips is reported in the December issue of the journal Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior. It is the first large-scale statistical investigation of gambling and suicide.
Earlier studies have shown that compulsive and pathological gamblers have many problems, including alcoholism and drug addiction, that contribute to suicidal behavior.
Still, several smaller studies have found gambling to be associated with increased suicide rates, white-collar crime, substance abuse and child abuse, Dr. Phillips said. For example, one study found that 3 of the 6 Atlantic City suicides for which the researchers had information probably occurred because of gambling problems.
Americans love to gamble, Dr. Phillips said, and spend nearly as much on gambling (6 percent of the G.N.P., according to a Standard & Poor's Corporation 1996 survey) as they do on family groceries (8 percent).
Dr. Lanny Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology in Washington, praised the study as "quality sociological research," and said the next step would be to design smaller studies that compared gamblers and non-gamblers -- matched for age, occupation and other factors -- over time, to see whether gambling itself was the direct cause of higher suicide rates.
But Frank Fahrenkopf, president of the American Gaming Association, an organization in Washington that represents major hotel and casino companies, said legalized gambling might have very little to do with suicide.
Mr. Fahrenkopf cited studies that say that people moving to the American West, where suicide rates are highest, find themselves isolated and without personal support systems and that these factors, not gambling, explain why they kill themselves.
Dr. Phillips said he got the idea for his study after talking to people who run Gamblers Anonymous telephone lines in Texas. He said callers would say, "I've embezzled all the company's funds, my kids can't go to college, there's no money left for groceries and I don't see any way out."
To look for an association between suicide and gambling, Dr. Phillips examined death certificates that tell how people died. Las Vegas has the highest suicide rate in the nation, he said.
Based on suicide patterns, one would expect a city the size of Las Vegas to have had 310 suicides in 1990, for example, but he found that the actual number in Las Vegas was 497.
Visitors to Las Vegas also kill themselves at a higher rate, Dr. Phillips said. For most cities nationwide, 1 in l00 "visitor deaths" on average is recorded as a suicide. A visitor death means that someone from another state dies while visiting the city in question. In Las Vegas, 1 in 25 visitor deaths on average is a suicide, four times the national average.
"In the case of Atlantic City, we can trace what happened before and after gambling was legalized," Dr. Phillips said. (A similar analysis cannot be done for Las Vegas and Reno because gambling there was legalized in 1931 and mortality statistics do not go back far enough to allow such comparisons.)
Atlantic City legalized gambling in May 1978. Before casinos opened, the residential suicide rate for the city was indistinguishable from adjacent communities in New Jersey. In 1975, the expected number of suicides for Atlantic City was 45 and the actual number was 52, a statistically insignificant difference. In 1990, after gambling had been in place for more than a decade, the expected number of suicides remained the same, but the actual number of suicides was 64 -- a statistically significant increase. In Atlantic City, 1 in 53 visitor deaths is a suicide, roughly double the national average.
The study cannot say for certain which people are killing themselves at a higher rate, Dr. Phillips said. It could be the local gamblers or visiting gamblers, spouses or children of gamblers, non-gambling relatives of gamblers or non-gambling residents who work in the industry. Nevertheless, he said, gambling or some factor associated with gambling is linked with the suicide levels.
Gambling also creates economic benefits in many communities, providing jobs where unemployment used to be high. Some groups may benefit while others lose, Dr. Phillips said, a trend that should also show up in mortality data. "I am starting to study that question now," he said.

HEADLINE: First, Army Neo-Nazis, Now Racists on Internet Worry Germany

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Dec. 15

 BODY:
At a time of growing signs of neo-Nazism in the German armed forces, a Government agency has registered new apprehension about surging racism in the former East Germany.
A report says that right-wing extremists are using the Internet to boast of "foreigner-free" zones, threatening to keep foreign-born residents out of certain discos and cafes. 
 For several years, right-wingers have used the Internet and computer bulletin boards to gain access to white supremacist web-sites in the United States and elsewhere and to send encrypted messages between extremists in Germany.
But the annual report published last week by the Government office that addresses issues relating to foreign residents was the first official allusion to the use of the Internet to stir up ethnic violence in the east. Racism there is widely ascribed to discontent over mass unemployment rather than the actual presence of a growing foreign population.
Germany has Europe's highest proportion of foreign-born residents -- almost 9 percent of its population of 82 million. But most of them live in prosperous western cities. Unemployment in the east is even higher than the national average of around 11 percent.
The biggest group of foreign-born residents in Germany is some two million Turks. But in recent years, there has been a huge influx of Balkan war refugees and asylum-seekers and clandestine immigrants from Eastern Europe and Africa.
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, the director of the office that issued the report, said that, in some areas of the east, "foreign residents and visitors are advised not to leave their homes alone after dark."
Right-wing extremists in at least 25 towns in the east, she said, had posted Internet proclamations of "foreigner-free" zones to be enforced by the extremists.
Typically, he said, an Internet announcement would say that "such and such a club has now been liberated."
But, Ms. Schmalz-Jacobsen said, "these are not liberated zones, but occupied zones."
German authorities were deeply alarmed by a wave of violent xenophobia after unification seven years ago. In 1993, the authorities launched twin crackdowns -- on right-wing groups and on illegal immigration -- hoping to suppress extremist politics and simultaneously to stem the flow of foreigners.
But that has not solved the problem, the report said, even though the number of crimes attributed to racism has fallen slightly -- to 2,323 in 1996 from 2,468 in 1995.
Right-wing extremism is generally attributed to an estimated 6,500 hard-core activists along with some 35,000 people classified by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution as Nazi sympathizers.
The display of Nazi emblems, like swastikas and stiff-armed salutes, is banned in Germany. But in recent weeks many Germans have been stunned by disclosures chronicling neo-Nazi activities in the army.
One scandal erupted when the news magazine Der Spiegel reported last week that Manfred Roder, a neo-Nazi with a criminal record of bombings, had been invited to give a speech to the country's most prestigious military academy in 1995.
The Defense Minister, Volker Ruhe, suspended a lieutenant general and instituted disciplinary action against a colonel because of the invitation.

HEADLINE: Campaign Accusations Divide 2 Prosecutors

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
The Justice Department was given evidence that a powerful Venezuelan banking family had funneled improper campaign contributions to the Democratic Party in 1992, but Federal prosecutors have shown little interest in pursuing the case, Manhattan prosecutors said yesterday.
Speaking at the sentencing of one of the members of the Castro banking family in state Supreme Court, the prosecutors said they had delivered witnesses and bank records to Federal agents in April 1997. But, they said, Lee J. Radek, who then headed the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation, replied in a letter that the investigators had interviewed one important witness in the case and had no further use for him. 
 The Justice Department sought to counter that impression yesterday, however, saying that it had pursued several leads since that initial interview and that the investigation remained open.
Mr. Radek's judgment has been the subject of controversy in the Federal campaign finance investigation. Earlier this fall, he was, in effect, pushed aside when Attorney General Janet Reno brought in a new prosecutorial team led by Charles G. La Bella, a career prosecutor from San Diego. At the time, law-enforcement officials complained that Mr. Radek had failed to investigate leads aggressively enough and had repeatedly been beaten to witnesses and evidence by news organizations following the case.
Federal Election Commission records show that about $92,000 in contributions to the Democratic National Committee came from individuals connected to the Castro family.
The Democratic committee said yesterday that it knew nothing of the $92,000 contribution.
"As with all contributions, if we receive new information we will review it and take appropriate action," said Steve Langdon, a spokesman for the committee.
Lawyers for some members of the Castro family have repeatedly denied making any illegal contributions.
The Castros controlled a banking and insurance empire in Venezuela before that country's financial collapse in 1994. Earlier this year, in Manhattan, three family members, including its leader, Orlando Castro Llanes, were convicted of financial crimes related to the collapse of their banks and corporations.
It was during that investigation that Manhattan prosecutors said they uncovered evidence of improper contributions to the Democratic Party. It is illegal for foreign citizens to contribute to American political campaigns.
One family member, Jorge Castro Barredo, faced up to 25 years in state prison and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors examining campaign contributions.
As Mr. Castro Barredo was sentenced yesterday to 3 to 10 years in prison, Manhattan prosecutors said he had given them important information about efforts to contribute foreign money to the Democratic Party and they revealed their conversations with the Justice Department about the case.
Other officials with knowledge of the case said yesterday that it might be too late to take any legal action because most campaign finance laws had a five-year statute of limitations.
Mr. Radek would not comment on the details of his exchange with the Manhattan prosecutors, but a Justice Department spokesman denied that his letter to Assistant District Attorney Richard Preiss on Oct. 17, 1997, indicated lack of interest.
"It does not say anything about what we may or may not do in the future," said the spokesman, Bert Brandenburg.
The conflict between Manhattan prosecutors and the Justice Department reflects a longstanding friction.
District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan has regularly criticized Federal prosecutors for failing to act on evidence that he regarded as solid.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Castro Barredo, a United States citizen, told them he was reimbursed by foreign companies for the contributions he made to the Democrats in 1992. It is illegal for foreign companies to contribute to American political campaigns, and it is also illegal to make contributions through a surrogate.
The Manhattan prosecutors said Mr. Castro Barredo was interviewed at length by Federal investigators. They said that they had also offered Federal prosecutors bank records and correspondence that corroborated his account of an illegal contribution scheme.
Last February, Mr. Morgenthau raised questions about the campaign contributions, saying the contributions appeared to be part of a scheme to violate United States campaign finance laws. At yesterday's sentencing, prosecutors said information about the contributions was first sent to the United States Attorney in Miami in October 1996. At some point after that, they said, the case was transferred to the Justice Department's public integrity section in Washington.
Prosecutors declined to speculate about why the contributions were made.
In 1991, Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn tried to seize $1 million from one of the Castro banks, maintaining that the money had been transferred as part of a money-laundering scheme. But the matter was dismissed at the request of Federal lawyers before any of the contributions had been made.
The prosecution of the Castro family was a highly unusual case for a local prosecutor to assume. After thousands of people lost money in the 1994 Venezuelan banking collapse, the Manhattan District Attorney's office took the case at the request of the Venezuelan Government.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Key Japanese Panel Devises $77 Billion Bank Rescue Plan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed Monday on a plan to use at least 10 trillion yen in public money to strengthen Japan's shaky banking system, the first solid progress in resolving this problem since four financial institutions collapsed last month.
The plan, announced by a special party panel, coincided with new evidence that the banks' frailty and Asia's deepening financial crisis were further undermining confidence in Japan's economy, the world's second largest. 
 An influential quarterly business survey released by the nation's central bank showed that Japanese executives had become far more pessimistic, which helped briefly send the yen down to a five-and-a-half-year low of 131.45 to the dollar.
The party panel, led by former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, proposed that the Government supply 10 trillion yen in bonds to the Deposit Insurance Corporation -- roughly equivalent to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States. The agency could then call on the Government to purchase the bonds back for cash as needed to help solve the financial crisis engulfing banks, securities firms and insurers.
Many of them are swamped in bad loans -- a situation that has incubated since the speculative "bubble" economy, and stock market, burst in 1990.
In share trading here today, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 104.89 points -- or two-thirds of 1 percent -- at 15,804.50 early in the afternoon session. It gave up one-tenth of a percent on Monday.
The debt problem took on new urgency last month when the four financial institutions failed, including Japan's oldest brokerage firm. The collapse of these businesses badly damaged public confidence and intensified pressure on Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to devise a rescue.
On Monday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he was attending a meeting with Southeast Asian leaders, Mr. Hashimoto promised to carry out a financial rescue operation quickly.
Some analysts have suggested that it will take more than 10 trillion yen -- which is equivalent to roughly $77 billion -- to strengthen the Japanese financial system, and the Miyazawa panel left open the possibility of raising more money. It suggested that the Government guarantee another set of bonds, of unspecified value, that would be sold directly by the Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The plan, while formally only a proposal, has the backing of powerful party members including Mr. Hashimoto, and is expected to take effect.
Yet political bickering in the governing party, which had threatened to scuttle the plan as it was taking shape last week, remained near the surface. Seiroku Kajiyama, who initially proposed a 10 trillion yen bond sale, criticized the Miyazawa panel, saying that its solution did not go far enough. He promised an alternative.
Mr. Kajiyama had also suggested last week that some part of the money go toward stimulating the economy through tax cuts or public works projects -- an idea that fiscal-austerity advocates in the party refused even to consider.
The Miyazawa plan stipulates that the bond revenue will be used only by the Deposit Insurance Corporation to strengthen the financial system. Under it, the Government would sell shares it owns in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone to raise the cash required to buy the initial 10 trillion yen of bonds.
Although these shares have been pledged to redeem other bonds, the Government needed a way to avoid the impression that the new bonds would be a form of deficit financing, which it has vowed to eliminate.
Some of the money raised would be used to recapitalize weak banks the Government has deemed salvageable.
Critics say, however, that such a measure leaves officials flexibility to revert to the old policy of saving all banks regardless of merit.
The Miyazawa panel's proposals also include expanding the role of the Resolution and Collection Bank, which is now responsible for disposing of failed credit cooperatives, to include similar responsibilities for failed banks. The panel also suggests extending public funds to policyholders of failed insurance companies and securities firms -- an indication that it expects those financial sectors to require a shake-out, too.
The plan further includes a Government guarantee of central bank loans made to cover the losses of banks that have already failed.

Endgame Shaping Up In Bids for the N.F.L.

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
The temptation is to cease chronicling the National Football League television negotiations until the winners announce their deals and one network that bid the ranch loses because the other networks bid bigger ranches.
Mind you, it's a temptation impossible to act on, for no subject on the business side of television sports boasts more endgame rumors than the N.F.L. television talks. 
 One subject that ran rampant yesterday was whether CBS brazenly opened its wallet to league officials during a meeting on Friday to show what it would pay to acquire what ABC or NBC have. All we know for sure is they met to discuss the parameters of the process. But did their chat become a mock auction? (And it's "Monday Night Football" for $500 million, Mr. Tagliabue!) Not likely.
The real action won't commence until CBS exhibits the full innards of its wallet. Its offer will set the floor, most likely, for NBC's American Football Conference rights and ABC's "Monday Night Football."
And yes, there's more speculation. One, that Fox's FX network is a big contestant for the Sunday night cable deal. That's a silly notion, what with its 35 million subscribers being less than half of TNT's or ESPN's. If a Fox cable service entered the mix, it should be The Family Channel. But selling a package to T.F.C. -- which bestows "The Three Stooges" on us but no sports save morning evangelism -- would mean that a blowout bid from Rupert Murdoch means more than the powerful promotion and identification that TNT and ESPN have long provided.
Second, a Thursday night package for CBS. That's been a ditsy idea for a long time. Not only would it place pro football against NBC's blockbuster prime-time shows, thus risking low-rated games, it would shift games from other networks and add more advertising to the market. But worse, it would make all the networks happy, rather than keep one watching forlornly from the outside.
For a little wisdom, we usher in Fox's John Madden. In 1993, he lost his job at CBS when CBS lost football then quickly regained it when Fox got the N.F.C. rights and decided he was worth $8 million a year.
"In '93, I learned nothing is for sure," Madden said from Sea Island, Ga., yesterday. "I thought CBS was always in the N.F.L. with the N.F.C. and always would be. I was going to broadcast on CBS and nowhere else. Every time I heard a rumor that Fox would bid, my reaction was, 'Yeah, but not us.' "
He added: "Looking back, I thought if anything would happen, I'd know it. But now I know, nobody knows what will happen. Anybody who says they know what will happen has to be guessing. There are too many 'yeah, buts' out there."
Regarding his future employer, Madden was equally firm. Will he stay at Fox? "I don't know that," he said. Will he join Al Michaels on "Monday Night Football," where he nearly landed in 1993? "I don't know," he said.
Alas, nothing is certain save for the uncertainty. Sometime soon, maybe this week or later, NBC, Fox, ABC, CBS, ESPN, TNT (and who knows, maybe UPN and The Food Channel), will meet with the league, be asked which packages they want, and learn the cost. That's when the real fun will begin.
You can be sure that CBS has learned the errors of its ways; four years ago under the reign of the pinch-penny CBS chairman Larry Tisch, the network declined to make an offer for anything but the N.F.C. package. Fox's $395 million-a-year bid paralyzed, then sank CBS; CBS's after-the-buzzer stab at trying to take the A.F.C. from NBC was flagged for a flagrant delay of game.
When the new deals are signed, the next game will be how much of each network's N.F.L. contracts will be written off as losses. Fox wrote off $350 million in 1994, estimating that figure to be the difference between what it paid and the ad revenues the broadcasts would generate. Murdoch hardly cared. With prices for the new contract poised to explode through the retractable roof, losses should explode, too. Then maybe an advertising recession will hit. Then, whose stock will plunge on the rotten news? Football is a tough game.
 
Women's Hockey on Tap
Lifetime Television, one of the three networks sharing Women's National Basketball Association broadcasts, is expanding into women's ice hockey tomorrow night with a pre-Olympic matchup between the United States and Canadian teams from Vermont. Margaret (Digit) Murphy, the Brown University coach who will be a first-time analyst beside Mike Emrick, said: "I think viewers will be surprised at how similar the women's and men's games are. The differences are subtle. There's contact, but not checking. Once in a while, you see big gangs and crunches. It's more flow, less whistles."
 
Airwaves
Ted Shaker is leaving as the president of Sports Illustrated TV to create his own production company. Shaker was formerly the executive producer of CBS Sports. . . . The Jets' rout of Tampa Bay on Sunday produced a 19.8 local Nielsen rating, while the Giants' victory over Washington generated a 16.7. Both games were televised by Fox.

HEADLINE: Fed, Seeing Few Signs of Inflation, Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, acting after the latest Government reports on the economy showed inflation remains benign despite vigorous economic growth.
The central bank's decision, widely anticipated by economists and investors, continued a pattern that suggests the Fed has set aside its usually predominant concern about an inflationary spiral set off by strong growth and low unemployment. 
 Instead, the Fed has chosen to focus on the paucity of early warning signals of inflation and on the need to maintain calm in the financial markets at a time when the crisis in Asia has unsettled investors.
With the bank's policy-making body not scheduled to meet again until February, analysts are increasingly divided over whether it will feel compelled to raise rates next year to make sure that inflation does not infect the economy, which is enjoying the third-longest expansion since World War II.
Some, in fact, are already arguing that the Fed's next move will be to cut rates to offset slower growth and the possibility that inflation's opposite, a general fall in prices, could hurt the economy.
At some point in 1998, "deflation risks will overcome inflation risks in Greenspan's mind," said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, referring to the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan.
The latest reassurance of subdued inflation came today with the Labor Department's report that consumer prices edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent in November to pull the 12-month pace down to 1.8 percent. Some reflection of Asian turmoil was found in the weakening price of goods.
For American consumers, weak currencies in Asia along with slack domestic demand represent "an unmixed blessing," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "The crisis will result in cheaper imports and lower prices in the stores. It will also reduce the worldwide demand for goods and may help slow our economy enough to forestall an interest rate increase by the Fed."
Workers, moreover, are able to spend. Real weekly earnings jumped an average 1.4 percent in November to a level 4.9 percent above that of November 1996, the Labor Department estimated.
Last month's surge reflected a nine-tenths of 1 percent rise in hours and a six-tenths of 1 percent increase in earnings per hour, a total slightly shaved by the month's inflation.
Still another set of figures today from the Commerce Department showed further gains in an already ebullient housing market powered by low interest rates. Builders broke ground on new homes last month at a pace that equaled 1,531,000 on an annual level. That was a modest eight-tenths of 1 percent faster than in October but considerably above what most analysts expected. Permits for future construction eased.
The one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index last month followed four straight increases of two-tenths of 1 percent. November's deceleration mainly involved a 3.9 percent drop in airline fares, moderately lower energy prices and a smaller increase for tobacco products.
The so-called core rate, which excludes the wide-swinging energy and food components, also rose one-tenth of 1 percent last month, the least since August.
Consumer inflation has not been lower than today's 1.8 percent rate since 1986, when oil prices collapsed.
The price of goods, which account for 43 percent of the index, edged one-tenth of 1 percent lower last month and was only six-tenths of 1 percent higher than in November 1996, the report showed.
Services, 57 percent of the index, advanced two-tenths of 1 percent in November and 2.9 percent over the year.
In the New York metropolitan area, prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent last month, bringing inflation over the 12 months down to 2.1 percent, modestly higher than the national average for urban consumers.
Inflation for the latest 12 months was 3.6 percent in San Francisco, 2.2 percent in Chicago, 1.5 percent in Los Angeles and 1.3 percent in Philadelphia, the report also showed.

HEADLINE: Technology Stocks Recover From Selloff

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday for a second consecutive session as some technology shares recovered from a recent slide.
Calmer Asian markets and consumer price data showing that inflation remains tame also bolstered stocks. And the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee left interest rates unchanged at its meeting yesterday. 
 "Many stocks were down the last few days, and investors who have a time horizon of more than a week saw an opportunity," said Philip Schettewi, who oversees $4 billion as chief of the Washington office of Loomis, Sayles & Company. "It's another case of investors buying on the dips, which overall has been a good strategy."
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 53.72, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 7,976.31, led by I.B.M. I.B.M. rose 2 7/8, to 103 3/4.
The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, rose 16.44 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,553.00, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased 4.65 points, or half of 1 percent, to 968.04.
On the Nasdaq market, Cisco Systems gained 2 5/8, to 80 1/8, and Microsoft rose 2 15/16, to 139 1/16.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, down 37 percent from its high this year, gained 1.1 percent. The Philadelphia Oil Service Sector rose 3.3 percent; it is off 22 percent from its high. Global Marine, down 27 percent from its high, rose 2 3/8, to 28 1/8.
"Oil service and technology stocks in particular were dirt cheap, and due for a bounce," said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management, which oversees $6.5 billion.
Among other individual issues Micron Technology rose 1 1/16, to 23 9/16, after reporting disappointing earnings on Monday. Prices for the type of memory chips it makes have fallen so low that they might have reached bottom, some investors say. Micron shares have declined almost 60 percent since August.
American depository receipts of Danka Business Systems P.L.C. fell 17 15/16, to 13 1/16. The British distributor of office equipment said it would take a $20.5 million charge and report lower-than-expected earnings because a plan to integrate business units is behind schedule.
Pepsico Inc. fell 5/8, to 35 7/16, after a Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company analyst, Andrew Conway, cut his earnings estimates for the beverage giant to $1.33 for 1998 from $1.36. He said he had made the change to reflect increased advertising and marketing expenses. Pepsico was also downgraded to "market perform" from "trading buy" by Skip Carpenter, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

Treasury Prices End Higher in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher in thin trading yesterday, getting a lift in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in its final policy meeting of the year.
While the Fed's decision was expected, it was still a bit of a psychological lift as it meant that rates were likely to remain unchanged until policy makers meet again in February. 
 Until the central bank made its announcement, the market had been little changed on light volume. Economic data released at the beginning of the session were mixed, with the economy showing little signs of slowing, but with inflation tame.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 102 21/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction fell to 5.96 percent, from 5.97 percent on Monday.
Most market participants did not expect that the Fed would change rates yesterday. After all, it had not adjusted interest rates since March 25, when it raised the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.
While the latest housing report showed new housing starts up eight-tenths of 1 percent, to an annual rate of 1.53 million last month, the November Consumer Price Index showed inflation tame. Most dealers and traders had reasoned that the economic turmoil in Asia and low inflation here would keep the Fed sidelined.
The index, both with and without food and energy, rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in November as car prices, airline fares, gasoline and the cost of entertainment all helped to keep inflation under control "and resulted in a performance that must be making the F.O.M.C. absolutely giddy, and deservedly so," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
"Despite strong economic growth, very tight labor markets and budding wage pressures, inflation has remained remarkably contained," Mr. Fine said. "Indeed even a pre-emptive Fed bent on avoiding inflationary tendencies did not want to lift rates and exacerbate international financial tensions, particularly when the prognosis for the period ahead calls for slower economic growth and a lessening of pressure on goods inflation brought about by the global financial turmoil."
Mr.Fine said bond yields remained under 6 percent as a direct result of the Fed's unchanged policy, the calm inflationary environment, and the fact that the United States was still the safest of havens for investors.

Asian Bloc's Anniversary Celebration Becomes a Plea for Outside Help

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Meeting in celebration of their 30th anniversary as a regional bloc, Southeast Asian leaders have swallowed their pride and pleaded for further economic help from abroad.
The economic formula that had led to a decade of extraordinary growth was seen as the root of their problems as currencies plummeted unchecked and investors fled. 
 "Forget politics," said Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's trade minister, as he urged the West today to provide further rescue packages to the region. "It is pure survival of the global economy."
The meeting of heads of governments that ended here today marked the anniversary of the founding in 1967 of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a political and economic grouping that now includes nine members.
Instead of unalloyed celebration, though, Asean, as the group is known, was preoccupied with a financial crisis that so far shows few signs of abating despite billions of dollars in bailout packages.
The leaders acknowledged that they were unable to cope with these troubles on their own, declaring in a statement that it was "urgent that global efforts be undertaken, including the central role of the I.M.F., to arrest the currency slide and restore stability to the currency markets."
They called for "greater national, regional and international efforts, including by the major economies such as the European Union, Japan and the United States and international financial institutions, to overcome this situation as soon as possible."
But as they convened, the Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringgit and the the Indonesian rupiah were among currencies that plunged to new lows, reflecting a continuing erosion of investor confidence in the region.
The International Monetary Fund has challenged the economic methods that fueled the region's growth, and, as a prerequisite for assistance, demanded greater accountability in financial institutions, more responsible lending and investment practices, and a move away from the back-room deals that had brought great wealth to politicians and favored businessmen.
Indeed, just as some of the region's leaders used economic success as a justification for autocratic rule, economic failure is pushing them now toward more openness in the management of their economies -- and potentially of their political systems.
All of this engendered an unusually reflective atmosphere at the meeting here.
Two events early in July signaled the difficulties the association is now facing: a coup in Cambodia and the effective devaluation of the Thai currency, the baht, which was the trigger for the economic crises affecting much of Asia.
Problems stemming from these events have forced Asean to revisit some of its guiding principles and to address unresolved political questions.
Facing a common economic crisis, sharpened questions on human rights abuses and an environmental disaster producing a choking haze from forest fires, members pondered whether they could indeed maintain their credo of noninterference in one another's affairs.
And with the recent or anticipated inclusion of new, economically weak members -- Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar -- could the group meet its regional targets for expanded free trade, or would it separate into haves and have-nots?
The more successful members of Asean -- countries that just a few months ago were seen as part of an "Asian miracle" -- are Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines.
This year's anniversary was to have fulfilled the dream of Asean's founders by including all 10 Southeast Asian countries as members. But the coup in Cambodia -- in which one of the nation's co-Prime Ministers, Hun Sen, forced out the other, Prince Norodom Ranariddh -- made Cambodian entry impossible. A land on the verge of civil war was considered too great a liability.
Yet, that turmoil gave Asean nations an impetus to exercise political influence in a way they had not before, pressing Mr. Hun Sen toward a more stable Cambodian government and promised democratic elections.
This only heightened questions about Myanmar, formerly Burma -- which Asean admitted at the end of May, along with Laos -- even as it excluded Cambodia.
In accepting Myanmar, Asean members largely turned a blind eye toward the country's political repression and human rights abuse.
Myanmar's admission was propelled by two desires: to assert the regional group's independence in the face of Western pressure against the move, and to embrace a nation that is being vigorously courted by China.
Regional solidarity in the face of China's growing economic and political influence is emerging as a unifying theme, replacing the anti-Communism that motivated Asean's founders and energized its policies in the 1970's and 80's.
Still, the meeting here included the leaders of China, Japan and South Korea, and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, was gracious. "Friendly relations and cooperation between China and Asean is not only in the interests of our two sides, but also benefits the Asia-Pacific region," he said.
China promised not to devalue its currency, the yuan, and to encourage its enterprises to invest in Asean countries. Japan and South Korea also expressed good will and promised job-training programs and market access, but noted that they must deal with economic crises of their own.
Asean's policy of noninterference along with a political style stressing consensus rather than confrontation have been keys to its success as a grouping of nations with sharp political, economic and religious differences. But the problems the region has faced this year have pushed the bloc toward a more active and aggressive style.
"The new Asean way is what they call constructive engagement, which is just a euphemism for intervention," said Yusuf Wanandi, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Indonesia.
"On their 30th anniversary they have to deal with the issues of Cambodia, the haze and the currency," he said. "So they have to cooperate much more closely on things like their macro-economic policies and on the environment. Their problems have gotten serious. They cannot stay quiet forever."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Urges Education Aid for Minorities

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton today made a passionate and detailed defense of affirmative action, arguing that not merit but differences in academic preparation and business contacts produce racial disparities in the United States.
In an extraordinary 94-minute news conference, Mr. Clinton repeatedly suggested that universities should begin offering minorities "a hand up" well before college, to gird them for the rigors of higher education. He maintained that, while Americans might be misled by charged words like "racial preferences" in the debate over affirmative action, almost all shared his views on the need for some remedy. 
 "If we get down to slogans, you have no better than a 50-50 chance of seeing any kind of affirmative effort prevail," the President said. "If you get down to brass tacks, I think people in both parties of good faith, what they want is a society where everybody who needs it gets a hand up, everybody's got a fair chance, but where unfair criteria don't deprive the deserving," to the benefit of the undeserving.
During the news conference, which ranged from the political prospects of Vice President Al Gore to the environmental problems of Los Angeles to the name of the Clintons' new dog (Buddy), the President pointedly passed up an opportunity to express confidence in Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Freeh dissented from Attorney General Janet Reno's decision earlier this month not to seek an independent counsel to look into aspects of Democratic fund-raising in last year's Presidential campaign.
Mr. Clinton, who sought today to dispel criticisms from former aides and others that he is adrift, moved from formal to prickly to chatty as he repeatedly ignored aides' entreaties to stop. He solicited 31 questions in all before calling a halt with a promise to sum up his agenda in just one sentence. Instead, he reeled off several paragraphs, and 14 sentences in all.
Asked if Mr. Gore was the victim of a campaign by Democratic rivals to dim his Presidential prospects, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Gore "needs no defense from me" but then went on to provide one, asserting, "He's had the most full partnership with the President of any Vice President in history."
The comment illustrated his strong support for Mr. Gore's Presidential bid, which Mr. Clinton has made clear unusually early for a sitting President. But it also showed how the roles of the two men have changed, since Mr. Gore was once seen as Mr. Clinton's ablest defender.
Mr. Clinton was most animated today on the subjects of race and the effectiveness of the panel he has appointed to address the subject. He got into a testy exchange with a reporter who said that "reports from the front lines of your race initiative suggest that the initiative is in chaos," and that it amounted to "a little more than 'Presidential Oprah.' "
"That may be your editorial comment, that's not my reports," Mr. Clinton shot back. He then challenged the reporter to name one source for his reports. "Just one," he said, almost taunting. "Give me a name."
"I don't want them to get fired by you, sir," replied the reporter, John Donvan of ABC News.
Mr. Clinton said the initiative was "on track," citing new Administration policies on ending housing discrimination. He contended that "hundreds and hundreds" of people had accessed a new White House web site soliciting details on community practices for easing racial differences.
He said of the initiative: "I think it is working and I think it is taking shape, and I believe it has got clear direction, and I think you will see better results as we go forward."
The panel is to meet on Wednesday in Fairfax, Va., with teachers and education experts, including William J. Bennett, who was Secretary of Education under President Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Clinton said he might need the panel to work beyond June, his previous deadline for what he originally envisioned as a one-year national "conversation" on race.
He dwelt today on the Army's success with affirmative action, which he also noted at a town hall meeting on race two weeks ago.
The Army, Mr. Clinton said, does not use quotas or promote unqualified people. "But," he continued, "there is an intensive effort to qualify people so that in each promotion pool, the pool of applicants for the next rank roughly reflects the racial composition of the people in the next lowest rank."
The President said the Army's experience might hold a lesson for universities, who could try "in a more systemic way" to find students who, because of their schooling, might score poorly on standardized tests "but whose probability of success in college is very, very high."
He later returned to that theme, rejecting the idea that merit governs college admissions.
"The whole premise on which affirmative action is being attacked," Mr. Clinton said, "is that there really is a totally objective, realistic way you can predict success in college." In fact, he said, schools' grading systems vary, and Scholastic Assessment Aptitude Tests are "not a perfect predictor of capacity to learn and capacity to perform."
He added, "I honestly believe that if every kid in this country had the right kind of preparation and a hand up where needed enough in advance, and the right sort of supports, and you had a realistic set of criteria for letting people into college, that there would not be much racial disparity in who got into which institutions."
In the same vein, the President argued that success in business stemmed in large measure from "the whole fabric of contacts people have and what they know and what experiences they've had." That is why, he said, he has supported economic affirmative action programs.
Asked about campaign finance charges, Mr. Clinton called for tighter campaign finance laws. And, as his aides have in the past, he accused Republican members of Congress of investigating his campaign in the hope of bankrupting the Democratic Party.
"I think the Democratic Party's financial problems are due almost entirely to the legal bills it incurred with a lot of very vigorous help from Republican Congressional committees," he said. "So it's obviously part of a strategy, and it's worked to some extent."
In response to other questions today, the President repeated previous statements that he would not rule out fundamental changes in the tax code, proposed by Republicans. But he added that any such changes would have to be "fiscally responsible" and "fair to all Americans." Further, he said, the changes would have to benefit the economy and simplify the tax code.
Insisting on fiscal discipline in the face of tax-cut proposals, he said, "There are a lot of tax cuts that might be desirable, but how would you pay for them?"
He also tried to minimize differences between him and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader who is viewed as a rival to Mr. Gore. Mr. Clinton said that Democratic division over free trade would not "split this party in 1998," because ultimately all Democrats believe that "we should trade more, and we should do more to help people around the world with environmental and labor problems, and to help people here at home that are being left behind."
Asked about criticism that he was doing too little to help the District of Columbia, the President said he "can't do everything that everybody in the city wants me to do as soon as they want me to do it." While he planned to do more, he added, the District has to do more itself to improve schools and fight crime. "In the end, a city is formed and made by the people who live in it and shape its life day in and day out," he said.

HEADLINE: Doubling of Cigarette Tax Grows Near in New Jersey

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
A 40-cent increase in New Jersey's cigarette tax appeared all but inevitable today as a powerful legislative committee overwhelmingly approved the plan and lawmakers prepared for a general vote on Thursday.
Although Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and legislative leaders have pushed for a cigarette tax increase several times in recent years, they have never found enough support for the proposal until now. The additional tax revenues would help cover the cost of hospital treatment for uninsured patients, replacing a financing system that expires on Dec. 31. 
 While most of the extra revenues -- 30 cents per pack of cigarettes -- would help pay for charity care, the remaining 10 cents per pack would go toward school construction projects. Lawmakers predicted that the tax revenues would provide $50 million a year for such projects, which are sorely needed in urban areas.
"There has been strong bipartisan support for this plan all the way through," said State Senator Peter A. Inverso, a Republican on the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, which approved the bill this evening. "That in itself is a very good sign."
The tax increase, to 80 cents per pack from 40 cents, would make cigarettes more expensive in New Jersey than in any neighboring state. A pack of cigarettes would cost $2.75 on average after the tax is passed. But while lobbyists for the tobacco industry warned that the high price would only prompt smokers to buy their cigarettes in states like New York and Delaware, anti-smoking advocates insisted it would cut the number of smokers while increasing cigarette tax revenues.
"This is the single most effective intervention we can make to reduce smoking, especially among teen-agers," said Larry Downs, the program director of NJ Breathes, an anti-smoking group financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "Every other state that has increased its tax has seen less consumption and more revenue."
After New Jersey raised its cigarette tax by 13 cents in 1991, 90 million fewer packs of cigarettes were sold in 1992, Mr. Downs said. Nonetheless, tax revenues increased by $60 million that year, he said.
Lawmakers have predicted that the tax increase will bring an additional $155 million in annual revenues, all of which help hospitals treat tens of thousands of uninsured people. Additional money would come from the state's unemployment fund and the general budget. Hospitals would receive $320 million annually for charity care, and urban hospitals would get another $101.5 million to treat hundreds of patients with AIDS and tuberculosis.
The new plan would also provide $68 million for two separate health insurance programs, including one for uninsured children and another for people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but whose employers offer no health coverage.
Even as they showed support for the tax increase, several lawmakers said they feared it would not guarantee a steady source of revenue because the number of smokers in New Jersey is dropping. State Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., a Democrat on the budget committee, predicted that the state would have to find a new source of revenue by 2002.
"I don't see this as a long-term solution," said Mr. Kenny, who supported the tax increase. "We just have to hope we'll be able to make up the difference by dipping more into the general fund."
New Jersey would be the 10th state to pass a cigarette tax increase in 1997, and the increase would be among the steepest. New Jersey's 80-cent tax would be the third-highest in the nation, after Alaska's $1 tax and Washington State's 82.5-cent tax. In comparison, New York has a 56-cent tax on cigarettes, Connecticut has 50 cents and Pennsylvania's tax is 31 cents.
Walker Merryman, the vice president of the Tobacco Institute in Washington, said the sharp increase could put small retailers out of business. "The people who will be hurt the most are convenience store operators on the Pennsylvania and Delaware borders," he said.
Anti-tax groups also criticized the tax increase, which would be the first in New Jersey since Gov. Jim Florio raised taxes by $2.8 billion in 1990. They said it would hurt poor people in particular, because they are more likely to smoke than affluent people. They also said it would force smokers to buy cigarettes illegally, from smugglers.
"This is going to turn the smokers of New Jersey into criminals," said John Sheridan, director of New Jersey Citizens for Tax Reform. "Are we now going to tax people as a means of controlling their behavior?"
But legislative leaders in both parties said they were comfortable with a tax increase because the money would go toward two worthy causes. Even Senator Richard J. Codey, the leader of the Democratic minority, promised "a significant number of votes" from his party.
"I think that on the merits, it's fair," Mr. Codey said. "Hopefully a 40-cent increase in the cost of cigarettes will discourage some people from smoking."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE;
Clinton's Remarks on Asian and U.S. Economies, Trouble Spots and Race

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's press conference at the State Department today, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company. 

On Aid to Other Countries
Q. Three weeks ago, in Vancouver, you said that the economic chaos in Asia was just a glitch in the road. But the currency turmoil continues, and South Korea says that it needs a faster I.M.F. bailout. What -- how serious is this crisis for Americans? And will you go along with the additional funds that the I.M.F. says it needs?
A. Well, first of all, the American economy is strong, and the new numbers on low inflation, coupled with the very high rate of business investments, show that we have a significant capacity to continue to grow from within.
Now having said that, as I have repeatedly pointed out to our people, a significant part of our growth comes from our ability to sell to others around the world, including in Asia. And so it is very much in our interest to do what we can to support the Asian economies. . . .
 
On the Middle East
Q. How long are you willing to tolerate Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the United States and of the United Nations?
A. Saddam Hussein has been in defiance of the United Nations since the end of the Gulf war. That's why we have a system of sanctions on him. And I am willing to maintain the sanctions as long as he does not comply with the resolutions.
If you're asking me, are there other options that I might consider taking under certain circumstances, I wouldn't rule out anything. I never have, and I won't.
But I think it's important that you remember, since the end of the Gulf war, the world community has known that he was interested in not only rebuilding his conventional military authority, but that he was interested in weapons of mass destruction, and a set of sanctions was imposed on him.
There are those that would like to lift the sanctions. I am not among them. I am not in favor of lifting sanctions until he complies. . . .
Q. As you pointed out, it seems like maybe about a half-hour or 45 minutes ago -- every time Saddam Hussein seems to be close to winning, perhaps getting the U.N. sanctions eased, he does something that might be considered less than rational. As the commander-in-chief who has to weigh options that will inevitably affect the lives of young Americans, how do you assess your opponent? How do you assess Saddam Hussein? Is he less than rational? And not to put too fine a point on it, are you persuaded that he's not simply crazy?
A. Well, if he is, he's clever crazy, on occasion, and then sometimes he does something that seems maddeningly stupid. In this case, I think he has made a calculated decision here that other countries wanted to do business with him; that he -- that he owed money to other countries from before the Gulf war that he couldn't pay and never would be able to pay unless he could do more business; that the war is fading into memory, you know, it's not eminent now; and that the burden of maintaining the sanctions had wearied many of those with responsibility for doing so; and that there might be a way to split the alliance here.
I also think he knew that the suffering of the Iraqi people is something which has touched the hearts of the whole world, and he thought it was a card he could play. . . .
Q. A few weeks ago, the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, was in the United States, and you and he were in Los Angeles at exactly the same time; in fact, your planes were both on the tarmac at LAX as you were getting ready to leave, but you refused to meet with him. He later said in an interview that you, in effect, were not only snubbing him, but you were humiliating or embarrassing the state of Israel, the people of Israel. . . .
A. First of all, let's put the record straight here. Mr. Netanyahu has been in office only a year and a half, and we have had five meetings. I don't believe I have ever met with any other world leader five times within an 18-month period. So there can be no serious suggestion that the United States is not interested in the peace process or respectful of the people and Government of Israel. We have had five meetings. Secondly, I expect that we will have a meeting early next year, a sixth meeting, to discuss where we are and where we're going.
Q. A question about Iran, you said this week you were looking forward to an honest dialogue with Iran. Can you tell us how and when that dialogue might begin? And also, given that the United States has not been able to enlist a single other country to help us in our effort to isolate Iran economically, to join in the embargo, do you still think that policy is effective, or are you willing to rethink it?
A. Well, let me answer the questions in order, but in reverse order. On our embargo, I think it is the right thing to do. And it will have varying degrees of effectiveness, depending upon how much other people are willing to work with us.
But I think that the voters in Iran, when they made the selection of the current president, seemed to be sending a signal that they wanted a more open society. And I was quite encouraged by his remarks. But -- so that I'm not sure you can say that our policy has been in error. I certainly think it is right, whether it is supported or not. . . .
I have always said, from the beginning, that I thought it was tragic that the United States was separated from the people of Iran. It's a country with a great history that at various times has been quite close to the United States. We have had the privilege of educating a number of people from Iran over several decades, indeed, some people in the present Government were able to get some of their education in the United States. And Americans have been greatly enriched by Iranian, by Persian culture, from the beginning of our country.
We have three issues that we think have to be discussed in the context of any comprehensive discussion. The first relates to Iranian support of terrorist activities, with which we strongly disagree. The second relates to Iranian opposition to the peace process in the Middle East, with which we disagree. And the third relates to policies involving the development of weapons of mass destruction. . . .
In terms of terrorism, I think the United States must maintain an uncompromising stand there. We would not expect any Islamic state in effect to say it had no opinions on issues involving what it would take to have a just and lasting peace settlement in the Middle East. We would never ask any country to give up its opinions on that. But we would ask every country to give up the support, the training, the arming, the financing of terrorism.
 
On Bosnia
Q. Will you care to share with us how will you characterize responsibilities of Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo in Bosnia, among Bosnians and Serbs and Croats, and responsibilities of your own and the international community?
A. I think that all of us should support the Dayton accords, the Dayton process, and should do nothing to undermine it and do whatever we can to support it.
Now, when the Croats, for example, supported the turning over of some Bosnian Croats who were indicted for war crimes recently, I thought that was a very positive thing. Now, they'll all have difficult moments when it comes to relocation of people into areas where they'll be the minority, and there are a lot of difficulties ahead.
But Belgrade, Sarajevo and, of course, Zagreb, all of them have the responsibility to support Dayton. They said they'd support it. They signed off on it, and that's what they ought to do.
 
On Race Relations
Q. Reports from the front lines of your race initiative suggest that the initiative is in chaos, it is confused, the Akron Town Meeting was a little more than "Presidential Oprah." Some people involved are beginning to ----
A. That may be your editorial comment, that's not my reports. I've received scores of letters, including letters from ordinary people who said that they loved it and they thought it was important. So ----
Q. Well, there ----
A. If that's your opinion, state your opinion. But ---- but ----
Q. It's an opinion, sir, that I'm hearing from others who are beginning to question whether simply ----
A. Who are they? Name one. Just one. Give me a name. I think all this "other" stuff -- you know, it's confusing to the American people when they hear all these anonymous sources ----
Keep in mind, this is the first time -- as I said in my opening statement, this is the first time ever that our country has tried to deal with its racial divergence in the absence of a crisis. We don't have a civil war, we don't have the aftermath of civil war, we don't have big fights over Jim Crow, we don't have riots in the streets. We have a country that is emerging as an ever-more divergent, diverse democracy. . . .
Q. As the national dialogue on race gains momentum, the one-year anniversary seems to near, and how are you going to pull apart the issue of race reconciliation and affirmative action that seems to be cross-tied? And will you extend the race initiative beyond this year to the end of your term?
A. Well, in some senses, this whole initiative has been a part of my administration from the beginning, because it permeates so much else of what we tried to do and what we're trying to do. With regard to affirmative action, I think that's an ongoing process.
My reading of the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the Court of Appeals ruling that the California vote abolishing affirmative action was in fact not unconstitutional, that it was permissible for the voters to vote in the way that they did under the Constitution, my reading of the Supreme Court's decision there is that they were saying that we're going to allow this matter to be resolved in the political process; that is that affirmative acts of discrimination are illegal. What should be done to root out the vestiges of discrimination are to create a society in which people have more or less the same chance to succeed without regard to their racial backgrounds, must be resolved in the political arena. . . .
Q. The polls show that people support affirmative action, but not when it's known as racial preference. How do you get around this clash of language? And what do you think about the term racial preference?
A. I agree -- I think people support affirmative action when you describe it. And then, if you call it racial preference they don't support it because it -- the way -- the words itself seem to inevitably mean that someone will get something, because of his or her race, for which he or she is not really qualified.
Now, the problem, if you back off from it, is that we Americans believe in -- we believe in three things. We believe that the best qualified people ought to get what they're best qualified for. We believe everybody ought to have a chance. And we believe people that have had a hard time ought to have a hand up. If you took a survey, I believe over 80 percent of the people would say that: we believe that merit should prevail over pull, if you will, or privilege, we believe that everyone should have a chance, and we believe that people who have had a hard time ought to have a hand up. . . .
Q. You touched on college admissions, and very early this year, you said you were quite concerned that some American universities, public universities in Texas and California in particular, were going to become resegregated. And you vowed to come up with some sort of plan to counter that. Have you come up with a plan? . . .
A. What I said was that I wanted to look at what the alternatives were. I think that, you know, Texas has now adopted an alternative which I think will work apparently quite well for them for undergraduate schools, which is simply to say that the top 10 percent of every high school graduating class in Texas is eligible for admission to any public institution of higher education in Texas. But I think if you look at it, while I think it is an acceptable alternative, the critics will argue it's simply affirmative action in another form. But at least that's -- but it's a way of saying, "Look, high schools are different, but the ability of children is not unevenly distributed. So we're going to -- we're going to give them a chance." . . .
The other thing we're looking at is trying to support more college efforts and actually identifying young people in schools with the promise of going to college who have a difficult situation, and trying to work with them over a period of a few years to make sure that when they come to take the college exams, that they are fully prepared to do so and much more likely to succeed.
 
On Taxes and the Economy
Q. Speaking of what will happen in 1998, some lawmakers are talking about giving Americans a tax cut next year. But there is a separate issue of fundamental tax reform; that is changing the tax code to a flat tax or a national sales tax or a greatly simplified progressive tax. Do you believe that the time has come to seriously consider fundamental tax reform?
A. You mentioned two things, so let me try to respond to both of them. First of all, on the whole tax-cut front, there has been some talk about that by some lawmakers who say that now we have a surplus, and therefore, we should spend it in part, at least, with a tax cut. And by that, they mean one of two things. They mean we have a projected surplus at the end of this budget period, or they mean that the deficit is lower now than it was projected to be last August, when I signed the balanced budget bill.
But it's important that the American people understand we don't have a surplus yet; we have a deficit. It's over 90 percent smaller than it was when I took office. It was at 290 billion and now it's at 23 billion. That is not a surplus. This economy is the strongest it's been in a generation because of the discipline that we've been able to bring to the task of bringing the deficit down and getting our house in order. We should not lightly abandon that discipline . . . .
 
On Vice President Al Gore
Q. He apparently was your -- is your heir apparent, and he's been very loyal to you. But he seems to the target of a nationally well-organized campaign, on the part of the Democrats and Republicans, to knock him out and fix it so that he will be so scandalized that he can't even run for President after you're gone. Now, what do you think about the way these people are acting, especially the Democrats?
A. As for the Vice President himself, he needs no defense from me. I have simply said, and I will say again, what everyone knows. He's had the most full partnership with the President of any Vice President in history, and he has performed superbly; whether it was on the environment or on energy initiatives, or on helping us downsize the Government by 300,000 and increase the Government's output, or on the foreign-policy issues like Russia and South Africa. He has done a superb job. . . .
 
On the F.B.I. Director
Q. The attorney general has rendered her judgment, and the F.B.I. has dissented from that judgment as to the appointment of a special counsel. On several occasions your spokesman has declined to express full confidence in the F.B.I. Director. Have you lost confidence in Director Freeh? Is it because of his dissent? And is that fair, sir?
A. First of all, his decision to dissent in that case has no effect on whatever opinion I have of him. I think he should be -- I think that the attorney general runs the Justice Department the way I try to run the White House, which is I want to hear what people's opinions are.
But on this confidence business, I think there's been too much back and forth on that, and I don't want to get into it. . . .
 
On 1998 and Beyond
A. When I came here, I was trying to just prove America could work again. I just wanted the country to work again. I wanted to get the economy going, I wanted to deal with social problems like crime and welfare, and I wanted to pull the country together. I want to see us spend the next three years fleshing out that agenda.
But now is a time that we should be looking at the long-term problems of the country, the long-term challenges. That's why this environmental issue of climate change is so important. Every environmental challenge we have met in the last 30 years we have proved we could grow the economy and preserve the environment. We've got to deal with it here.
That's why the education issues and setting up excellence and lifetime learning are so important, because we will not be able to protect all Americans from the global changes that are taking place unless we do that. That's why it's important to deal with the entitlements challenge, because we have to honor the good that has been done by Social Security and Medicare for retirees, and let more people do more for their own retirement as well, and do it in a way that doesn't bankrupt their children when we baby boomers retire. . . .

HEADLINE: Study Shows New York Has Greatest Income Gap

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 16

 BODY:
After years of Wall Street setting records while manufacturing jobs slipped away, the income gaps between the rich and the poor, and between the rich and the middle class, are now larger in New York than in any other state, according to a report released today.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group based in Washington, also found that the income gap between the wealthiest 20 percent of families and the poorest 20 percent grew over the last decade in 37 states that are home to 87 percent of the nation's population. The nation's surging economy, in other words, has produced vast benefits for the nation's wealthiest people, while doing little to improve the incomes of poor and lower middle-income people, the report said. 
 Similar studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the Economic Policy Institute and others have also found that the gap between the rich and the rest of the population has grown nationally since the 1970's, but those studies have not offered state-by-state analyses. Today's report, based on United States Census Bureau data for families with children, was the first such report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in five years.
Even states that are not as tied to Wall Street, like Arizona, Ohio, West Virginia and California, saw growing gaps in income between the rich and the poor, something the report said was due not only to the stock market boom but to wage stagnation for lower-paid workers, which was tied to such factors as the decline in domestic manufacturing jobs and in unionization.
"The growth of the service economy and the decline in manufacturing has meant lower wages for people at the bottom end and middle of the scale," Elizabeth McNichol, one of the authors of the study, said in an interview. "It used to be that when the economy grew, everybody gained, but in the last generation that hasn't been true."
Nowhere is the growing gap as evident as in New York, where Park Avenue swells can see public housing projects from their apartment windows.
Economists say that New York State has magnified several national trends: the soaring financial markets and the success of some professions boosting high-end incomes, while the poor are harmed by the decline in low-skilled jobs like manufacturing and construction, and competition with immigrants for low-level jobs.
From 1994 to 1996, the report said, the top 20 percent of families in New York State earned an average of $132,390 a year, not counting capital gains, while the bottom 20 percent averaged $6,787. The ratio between the two figures, 19.5 to 1, was by far the largest for any state, well above the national average of 12.7 to 1, and below only the District of Columbia. Connecticut had the fifth-highest disparity, at 14.2 to 1, and New Jersey ranked 29th, at 10.1 to 1.
In New York, the 20 percent of families earning the highest incomes earned 3.4 times as much as the middle 20 percent, also a higher ratio than any other state and above the national average of 2.9 times, but lower than the District of Columbia. Connecticut ranked 12th among the states, at 2.8, and New Jersey 36th, at 2.5.
New York was the only state in which 20 percent of families recorded more than 50 percent of all the income earned in the state. And the gap between those wealthy families and everyone else grew faster in New York over the last decade than in any other state except Arizona.
The study's authors argue that, in fact, the disparities are larger than their numbers indicate, in part because the census data leave out income from capital gains, which is earned primarily by those who are fairly well off. Also, the Census Bureau does not record any salaries higher than $100,000 per job. For example, someone with a $500,000 salary would only be counted as earning $100,000.
From 1985 to 1987, the report said, New York had the third-largest income disparity between the top fifth of the population and the bottom fifth, and the seventh-largest gap between top earners and those in the middle.
Gov. George E. Pataki's office declined to respond directly to the report's findings. But Stephen Kagann, the chief economist to the Governor, argued that the administration is addressing exactly the problems the study highlights.
"We're concerned that people at all income levels have good jobs," he said, "and the Governor's policies are doing just that. We've added 235,000 private-sector jobs in three years."
The reasons the rich are getting richer -- and faster in New York than elsewhere -- are no mystery, economists said.
"The finance industry is by far the highest-salary industry, one that has seen huge increases in salaries and bonuses, and it's based here," said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University. "We also have really large concentrations of high-salary professions, like lawyers and doctors and computer people, that have also done very well in recent years."
From the mid-1980's to the mid-90's, the report says, the incomes of the bottom fifth of families nationwide fell 3 percent when adjusted for inflation, to an average of $9,254. But in New York, those incomes fell 20 percent, to $6,787. Experts say the reasons for the difference are complex, but that the decline of manufacturing is clearly an important factor.
Manufacturing in the United States has been battered by low-wage competition from overseas, and at the same time, New York has lost factories to other, lower-wage states. According to the State Department of Labor, there are 925,000 manufacturing jobs in New York, down from almost 1.5 million in 1978.
"The large number of immigrants in New York City also has something to do with the condition of the poor there," said Howard A. Chernick, an economics professor at Hunter College. "They mean much more competition for the low-skilled jobs that are left, and that drives down wages."
Economists also noted that the construction industry -- which, like manufacturing, is a crucial source of jobs for lower-skilled workers -- was booming in the 1980's in New York, but not in the first half of the 90's. They argue that in New York State, with its combination of old, highly concentrated cities and a stagnant population, construction may never again serve as the rich source of jobs for the working-class bulwark that it once did and that it still does in the South and West.
"The era of mass construction is over in New York," said Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a group that studies New York State policies.
Mr. Mauro also argued that the end of free education at the state's public colleges could be contributing to the plight of the poor. And Mr. Wolff said it might, in part, be the long-time stagnation in welfare benefits in New York, which has one of the nation's highest concentrations of welfare recipients.

HEADLINE: Blacks Recruited by 'Rights' Drive to End Preferences

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 16

 BODY:
As migrant labor goes, the signature-gathering campaign against affirmative action in Washington state seemed to offer just what Arthur Tillis of Chicago said he was looking for: a chance to earn some Christmas money and see a different part of the country.
But Mr. Tillis, who said he was homeless, had no sooner arrived in Seattle last week than he realized that being a trench worker in modern democracy was not at all what he expected. "I was getting cursed at by people and having a lot of trouble getting signatures," he said in an interview. "Then I finally read the thing real carefully and I said: Wait a minute. This is against affirmative action. It's a not a civil rights thing like it says." 
 As one of a five blacks transported by bus to Washington state by the supporters of a ballot issue that would end most affirmative action policies here, Mr. Tillis said he had never been told the true nature of the campaign. But he was told he could earn up to $600 a week, at 90 cents a signature. All five of the black signature gatherers interviewed told a similar story.
Once they arrived in Washington state, some of the petitioners went into debt, and say they were forced to gather signatures just to get enough money to get out of town. "You want to know what this whole thing really cost me?" said Pro Mayes, an unemployed father of two from Rancho Tehama, Calif. "My pride. I was duped. And now I got nothing to bring home to my kids."
The leaders of the campaign, Washington Initiative 200, say there was no attempt to recruit blacks as a strategic way to counter the perception that the initiative would be a setback for many minorities. Nor were petitioners misled, they say. It was simply a money-making proposition in a tight labor market, which forced the campaign to recruit far away from the state, they say.
"The only way they could be misled is if they can't read," said Sherry Bockwinkel, the owner of the firm that pays and recruits signature-gatherers, on behalf of the campaign. "Petitioners are motivated by money. They tend to be lazy. If they say they were misled, they are lying."
But part of the problem, the black petitioners say, is the language of the ballot question itself. It is called the Washington State Civil Rights Act. The proposed ballot title, at the top of the petition, says nothing about dismantling affirmative action. It says, in its entirety: "Shall government entities be prohibited from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to individuals or groups based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin?"
When Tyrone Wells, an 18-year-old high school dropout from Toledo, Ohio, read the title, he says he thought it was a pro-civil rights ballot measure. "So I went out there on a bus and started trying to gather signatures, and people were cursing me," he said. "It is confusing."
Mr. Wells returned home by bus a few days ago, in debt and discouraged. "They wanted some black faces," he said. "We were used."
If supporters of the initiative can gather 180,000 signatures by Jan. 2, Washington could follow California as one of the first states in the nation to outlaw racial preferences in hiring, contracts and education. The initiative would require the State Legislature, which is Republican-controlled, either to pass the measure, or pass it on to voters for their consideration. The Governor would have no veto power.
On one level, the campaign has been a debate over a colorblind society, featuring radio advertisements by Steve Forbes, the publisher and a Republican contender for the Presidency last year, and rallies at which William J. Bennett, a leading conservative philosopher, played host.
But in the malls and on the streets where petitioners are frantically trying to gather the necessary signatures, the debate is more shrill and divisive. A vigorous campaign to dissuade people from signing the petitions has led to numerous verbal clashes.
Opponents of the measure say that by recruiting poor blacks, the Initiative 200 campaign is essentially using affirmative action to try to end affirmative action. "It's not accidental that the people who were brought here are African-American," said Kathleen Russell, the campaign manager for No! Initiative 200. "They're playing the race card. And, they're preying on people who are hard up, who are unemployed or homeless."
John Carlson, a talk-radio host who is the campaign manager for Initiative 200, said race was not a factor in the petition drive. "You want people who are known as 'horses,' people who can get the signatures, and get them fast," he said. "You don't want people with little or no experience of any race."
The ballot measure, he said, deliberately borrows language from the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the landmark antidiscrimination measure of the last four decades. It is not misleading, he said. "This initiative will restore the moral principle of protecting all Americans from discrimination," Mr. Carlson said. He said he was confident the campaign would get the necessary signatures in the remaining two weeks of the campaign.
Ms. Bockwinkel, who runs the signature-gathering firm, said a number of recruiters who were on a retainer to her found the black petitioners in the Midwest and California. They were offered bus fare to Seattle and motel expenses if they could produce a certain number of signatures.
She said she did not know if they were told the exact nature of the campaign, but she scoffed at the idea that they were ignorant. "I handed them material about the initiative and told them to read it," she said.
The people who traveled 2,000 miles from the Midwest or 800 miles from California say they were motivated by what sounded like a good deal. "The recruiter came to my house in California, he bought my family a turkey for Thanksgiving," Mr. Mayes said. "It thought this man is my friend."
But once in Washington state, he says, he not only had difficulty getting signatures, but he fell into debt and had to borrow several hundred dollars from the campaign.
He left Seattle today on a bus, thoroughly discouraged by the experience.
"Black people were mad, saying stuff like 'You ought to be ashamed,' " Mr. Mayes said. "White people in suits, they were taking it and signing it. But I'm just out there, in the end, trying to get signatures to get out of debt so I can get out of town."
A woman from Milwaukee, Beverly Mosley, a disabled veteran, said she had been lured by the money. "I got all the way to Seattle and they still wouldn't tell me what the initiative was all about," she said.
"Then I'm out there with a clipboard, and a couple of people came up to me and said, 'Do you know what you're doing?' I said yes. Getting signatures to keep affirmative action from being abolished. After reading it real carefully, then, let me tell you: I decided I would never sign something like this myself."

Revived Technology Shares Help Stocks Gain for 2d Day
Stocks rose yesterday for the second straight day, strengthened by a rebound in weakened technology shares, calmer Asian markets and economic data that showed tame inflation and vigorous growth. The Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged also underpinned the market.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 53.72 points, to 7,976.31, led by a 2.7 percent gain in I.B.M. shares. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, gained 16.44 points, or 1.1 percent, its first increase since Dec. 8. Page D10. 

Treasury prices rose slightly, sending the benchmark 30-year issue's yield down to 5.96 percent from 5.97 percent. D8.
 
Scrutiny of Microsoft Grows
A Federal judge's decision last week that Microsoft had violated a 1995 antitrust agreement is just one of several government problems confronting the software giant. Attorneys general from some of the nation's most populous states met in secret last week to assess a strategy for possible antitrust action against the company. Officials in Europe and Asia are conducting their own inquiries. A1.
 
Doubts About Japan Persist

HEADLINE: Bruno Proposes Cuts in Taxes to Spend State's Budget Surplus

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 16

 BODY:
In the opening bid of what will probably be a lively election-year fight over spending the state's 1998 budget surplus, the Republican Senate majority leader proposed a package of tax cuts today that would be worth $980 million a year by 2001.
At the heart of the Republican plan is a proposal to speed up delivery of a $2.2 billion property tax cut for homeowners that was enacted in the state's 1997-98 budget. That tax cut was to be phased in over five years, with only the elderly receiving a reduction in 1998. The Senate plan calls for many other homeowners also to begin receiving tax cuts next year. 
 The Senate plan would also reduce the corporate tax rate to 6.85 percent from 9 percent, cut taxes for small businesses and for financial service companies that make capital investments, provide tax credits to subsidize child care and reduce motor vehicle registration fees by 25 percent. The plan calls for reducing taxes by $480 million in 1998-99.
The majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County, said the tax cuts would be a way of improving the state's business climate while also returning to taxpayers some of the state's budget surplus, which is expected to be as large as $2 billion when the fiscal year ends on March 31.
"When we see states like Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia eating our lunch, eating our dinner and looking at our breakfast, we have to be competitive," Mr. Bruno said.
In a year when all 211 members of the Legislature and the Governor are up for re-election, and when tax reform is likely to be a hot issue in Washington, many legislators expect Mr. Bruno's plan to be just the first of a deluge of tax cut proposals to hit the Legislature in the coming months.
Mr. Bruno said he expected Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican, to support his proposal to speed up the property tax reduction. Aides to Mr. Pataki said that he might support Mr. Bruno's plan, but also hinted that the Governor would put forward his own tax-cut package.
"The Governor has been the leader in tax cuts among governors in the nation," said Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary. "It's safe to say he'll try to build on that record."
Any tax cut plan would have to be approved by the Democratic-controlled Assembly, where support is expected to be strong for using the surplus funds for education and other spending programs.
Still, Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said the Democrats were considering proposing their own tax cut plan. "The litmus test we are applying to every aspect of the budget is: how does it affect middle-class, working families?" she said.
The state has cut taxes for the last four years, and some budget watchdog groups have raised concerns that new multiyear tax reductions could strain the state's ability to deliver services, particularly if the economy slows.
Today, the Citizen's Budget Commission, a nonprofit group financed by businesses, released a report showing that the state will face a $1.1 billion budget shortfall for the 1998-99 fiscal year. The report predicts that moderate economic growth next year will be outpaced by new spending on multiyear tax cuts and education programs enacted in previous budgets.
Business groups hailed Mr. Bruno's tax cut plan, saying it would encourage many companies to expand. "The tax credit extension is a jobs bill," said Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership, referring to Mr. Bruno's proposal to provide tax credits to service industries that make capital investments in the state.
But Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group financed by labor unions, said the Republican plan would do little to create new jobs and, in many cases, would simply reward targeted industries for doing things they would have done anyway.

HEADLINE: Microsoft's Legal Problems Grow As States Join in Antitrust Effort

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Last Thursday, as a Federal district judge was ruling that the Microsoft Corporation had violated a 1995 antitrust agreement with the Justice Department, attorneys general from some of the nation's most populous states were concluding a secret three-day meeting in Chicago to assess their own strategy for a possible antitrust action against Microsoft's marketing practices.
The meeting -- coupled with government investigations under way in Europe and Asia, a continuing private antitrust suit and the specter of hearings in the United States Senate -- suggest that the world's most powerful software company could soon find that it has become a Gulliver enmeshed in Lilliputian legal entanglements around the globe. 
 "Microsoft is going to find that it is looking at a shotgun with multiple barrels," said Gary Reback, a lawyer with the firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rasati in Palo Alto, Calif., which represents a number of Microsoft's competitors.
Nine states have subpoenaed information from Wilson, Sonsini, Mr. Reback said. Among the states that participated in the strategy session last week, he said, were Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and New York.
Microsoft officials did not return telephone calls this week requesting comment on investigations under way by state governments.
Flush with the states' success in mounting a coordinated attack on the tobacco industry for expenses incurred in dealing with smoking-related illnesses, a number of attorneys general are now collaborating on a multistate antitrust effort.
While by all accounts the strategies being discussed involve only civil actions, the attorneys general are remaining tight-lipped about which states are involved and which of Microsoft's business practices they want to remedy.
It is not known, for example, whether any potential action would seek monetary damages, changes in business practices or some other remedies. Nor is it known whether the states would be acting on behalf of themselves as high-volume consumers of Microsoft's software products or as guardians of their residents' consumer rights.
What is known is that California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Oregon have each opened independent investigations of Microsoft's business practices and that Texas is already suing the company over policies arising from an inquiry in that state. In a suit filed in November, the Texas Attorney General, Dan Morales, argued that his antitrust investigation was being impeded by provisions of Microsoft's licensing agreements that require client companies to inform Microsoft before providing information to state or Federal investigators.
That argument, however, parallels one that was rejected last week in the Federal Government's case against Microsoft. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court in Washington ruled that there was no evidence that the nondisclosure language in Microsoft's contracts had dissuaded makers of hardware or software from cooperating with investigators.
The states are still devising a coordinated legal strategy, several people familiar with last week's meeting said.
"New York is spearheading the effort," said Lloyd Constantine, the former chief of antitrust in the New York State Attorney General's office. "There is some discussion right now about whether New York or other states will seek to intervene in the Federal Government's pending action."
Last week's meeting in Chicago was convened by the Illinois State Attorney General's staff.
The collaborative state effort is being loosely coordinated by a multistate antitrust task force that frequently consults on a variety of business issues that cross individual state boundaries, he said.
Forty states have antitrust laws that essentially mirror the Federal Sherman Antitrust Act, he said. However, several of the largest states, including California and New York, have laws that differ from Federal laws in significant ways. For example, New York law does not have a provision covering the actions of a single company like Microsoft.
Microsoft's legal woes next year may extend overseas. Last Wednesday a representative from Ralph Nader's public interest group met in Brussels with legal authorities of the European Union, where the competition and antitrust division of the European Commission is considering opening an investigation of Microsoft's business practices.
"Right now they are monitoring complaints from specific companies," said James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, one of Mr. Nader's policy groups based in Washington.
Mr. Nader, an outspoken critic of the software giant, last month sponsored a conference in Washington, titled "Appraising Microsoft and Its Global Strategy," that brought together several hundred critics of Microsoft from around the country.
The issue of Microsoft's business practices in Europe may be important because of a historic precedent: In 1984, European governments issued a directive forcing International Business Machines to make early disclosures concerning the technical details of its mainframe operating system software. This allowed European computer makers to develop competitive products.
Legal experts drew parallels between I.B.M.'s domination of the mainframe industry in the 1980's and Microsoft's position in personal computer operating systems today.
Microsoft may also be facing legal challenges to its economic power in Asia. Lawyers for the Netscape Communications Corporation, Microsoft's competitor in the World Wide Web browser market, said this week that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan and the Government of South Korea had begun separate investigations into Microsoft's business practices.
Closer to home, Microsoft is being sued in an antitrust action by Caldera, a maker of Internet software based in Provo, Utah. And in a November hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, its chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he had not made any secret of the fact that he had serious concerns about Microsoft's efforts to exercise what he termed "monopoly power."
A spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee said today that further hearings were planned next year, but that dates had not yet been set.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
CLINTON CAUTIONS IRAQIS ON OPTIONS IN HUNT FOR ARMS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Ruling out nothing, President Clinton warned Saddam Hussein today that he would consider other options for United States actions if the Iraqi president continued to obstruct United Nations inspectors, who have been barred from so-called presidential sites in Iraq.
Richard Butler, the chief inspector, left Baghdad earlier in the day and said on arrival in Bahrain that he could see no way out of the impasse created by Iraq's intransigence and the Security Council's determination to rid the country of all weapons of mass destruction.
"I feel that we have to be very firm," Mr. Clinton said, and referring to Mr. Hussein, said, "it is clear to me that he has still not come to terms with his international obligations." 
 Substantial United States military forces remain in the Persian Gulf area. But Russia, France and China would almost certainly block any attempt to win the United Nations authorization for their use, and acting alone would expose the United States to a diplomatic backlash in Europe, in China and in the Arab world.
"If you're asking me, are there other options that I might consider taking under certain circumstances, I wouldn't rule out anything. I never have, and I won't," the President said at a 94-minute, end-of-year news conference. Excerpts, page A24.
The President also said the United States and other wealthy nations like Japan might have to do more to stem the mounting Asian financial crisis. Though he shied away from specifics, he indicated that he had been impressed by steps to promote national unity taken by the South Korean Government, which is seeking more aid.
As he has done in the past, Mr. Clinton insisted that the International Monetary Fund must continue to take the lead in all bailout efforts.
"Do I think we may need to do more?" the President asked. "I think that we may need to do more, within the framework that has been established. But that needs to be a judgment made on a case-by-case basis. The important thing is that the United States must be in a position to do more to fulfill its responsibilities."
He implored Congress to approve additional funding for the monetary fund to handle emergencies like the one in Asia, which Congress failed to do before adjourning last month. That left Mr. Clinton in the awkward position of urging the fund to lead at the same time that the United States was unable to contribute to a new program, financed by more than 20 countries and intended to make that possible.
At one point during the news conference, which was marked by several testy exchanges with reporters, Mr. Clinton was asked whether he thought that Saddam Hussein was crazy. He replied: "Well, if he is, he's clever crazy, on occasion, and then sometimes he does something that seems maddeningly stupid."
During the current crisis, the President said, he thought the Iraqi leader had concluded, incorrectly in Mr. Clinton's view, that he had an opportunity to split the alliance. "He badly miscalculated," Mr. Clinton said.
The President insisted, contrary to the view of some, that "the world community is much less likely" now than before the crisis to ease sanctions on Iraq. But Iraq, France and the Arab nations have made it clear, privately and in some cases publicly, that they would like to make the sanctions less severe, little by little. Of the main allies in the Persian Gulf war, only the United States and Britain are determined to keep full sanctions in force.
"There are those that would like to lift the sanctions," the President said. "I am not among them. I am not in favor of lifting sanctions until he complies. Furthermore, if there is further obstruction from the mission, the United Nations mission, in doing its job, we have to consider other options."
Mr. Butler is to make a full report to the Security Council on Thursday, and Mr. Clinton said the United States would wait for that, then "see where we are and where we go." He said he was following the matter closely, and said again that "the United States must be steadfast."
Iraq needs to get the approval of the Security Council, certifying that it has no weapons of mass destruction, before sanctions can be lifted, at least as things now stand.
In a statement issued after a top-level Government meeting this morning in Baghdad, Iraq urged the United Nations to consider what it termed its "national security concerns" in weighing Mr. Butler's report. Mr. Butler, who was told on Monday that Iraq would never admit inspectors to the "Presidential sites," said he doubted that the Security Council would find much merit in that argument.
It is up to the Security Council, which has 15 members, to decide how the United Nations will react. It appears no more likely now than it did last month, when a conflict over the composition of inspection teams flared briefly into crisis, that the Council will approve any measure that might lead to the use of military force.
In fact, most members seem at least as concerned about the suffering of the Iraqi people, especially babies, after seven years of economic sanctions, as they do about the dismantling of weapons stockpiles.
The Iraqi statement today said the nation badly needed food and medicine, part of a campaign it has been waging on the subject for months. Under international pressure, the United States and Britain committed themselves this month to considering an increase in the amount of oil Baghdad is permitted to sell to buy food and medicine. But the present oil-for-food deal is already running behind schedule.
Mr. Clinton's news conference took place in the Dean Acheson auditorium at the State Department, where John F. Kennedy held many similar sessions.
Without breaking any new ground, he touched on a number of foreign-policy topics in addition to domestic matters, including Bosnia (he said he would announce his position on keeping troops there later this week); NATO expansion (he hailed today's ceremonial signing of protocols in Europe), and the Middle East (he denied he had intended to snub Israel by refusing to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the Israeli's recent visit).
On the Asian financial crisis, the President emphasized the strength of the American economy, but then added: "A significant part of our growth comes from our ability to sell to others around the world, including in Asia. And so it is very much in our interest to do what we can to support the Asian economies."
In an interview before Mr. Clinton spoke, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the national security of the United States could become caught up in the currency crisis. In particular, he said, instability in South Korea could upset delicate negotiations with North Korea over a peace treaty that would formally end the Korean War.
