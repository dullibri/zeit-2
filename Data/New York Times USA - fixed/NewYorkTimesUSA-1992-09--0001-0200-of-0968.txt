HEADLINE: Mystery Man Pushing the Pawns

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SVETI STEVAN, Yugoslavia, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Yugoslav economy, never the world's strongest, has collapsed during the civil war of recent months. But one pugnacious businessman has continued to wheel and deal at a furious pace, culminating with his bold financing of the scheduled comeback of the United States chess genius Bobby Fischer against his old rival Boris Spassky in this Adriatic resort not far from the fighting.
In the remnants of Yugoslavia, now a cash-only economy where anything goes, Jezdimir Vasiljevic is known as the "mystery man." He appears to enjoy the title. "I like to be mysterious," he said, pulling hard on a cigarette and mopping the sweat from his brow, "because I like to keep people guessing." Asked about his net worth, all he will say is "millions," adding coyly that his group's sales now amount to about $3 billion a year.
 
'A Believer in Money'
 Officially, Mr. Vasiljevic is the owner of a recently established private bank-cum-trading company called Jugoskandic, whose interests include the horse racing track in Belgrade and a large shipping company. Unofficially, he has his hand in just about everything. 
 A stocky 43-year-old man with a gold watch, crocodile-skin shoes and shrewd, somewhat furtive blue eyes, this restless entrepreneur may perhaps be seen as a particularly lurid example of the businessman thriving in the chaos of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. In Yugoslavia, war has compounded the disorder into outright economic chaos, but quick-witted audacity and confidence in one's ability to set the rules remain effective attributes.
He has offered prize money of $5 million -- unprecedented for a chess match -- to lure Mr. Fischer out of 20 years of seclusion to the sun-drenched borders of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Of this, the winner will take $3.35 million and the loser $1.65 million.
"Just imagine," Mr. Vasiljevic (pronunced vass-ill-YEA-vich) said in an interview. "The financial difference between winning and losing is $1.7 million. Never will chess have been played with such intensity and purity."
An aide, Janosz Kubat, who is the director of the chess match, refined this thought for his boss. "Mr. Vasiljevic is a great believer in money," he explained. "He really believes you can get anything done and persuade people to do anything, with money."
If that maxim may hold some truth anywhere, it is now particularly true in Yugoslavia, a rump state half the size it was two years ago where economic activity has degenerated into a free-for-all.
Shaken by annual inflation of more than 10,000 percent, deprived by international sanctions of such essential products as gasoline and its industry in ruins, the country now operates largely on a mixture of smuggling and black market operations. Credit cards, checks and other financial instruments of the West are a thing of the past as the country has lurched toward a Lebanese approach to life in which the prevailing view is "sauve qui peut," or "escape if you can."
 
Black Markets, Gun Running
 Just what role Mr. Vasiljevic has played in the midst of all this is a matter of dispute, though most people agree that it has been considerable. News reports here have linked him to activities including the hiring of mercenaries for the Serbian army, arms purchases in Israel, sanction-breaking imports of crude oil and effective domination of the frenetic black market in dollars now operating on the streets of Belgrade. Some accounts have suggested he is a financial front man for the hard-line Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr. Vasiljevic denied that he had played any role in financing the war and said he had never met Mr. Milosevic, much less been a front man for him. He also dismissed reports of his buying arms on a trip to Israel last October, adding, "All I have tried to do is provide medicine and clothes for those who are suffering, and most recently, I've presented $500,000 to the Red Cross for victims of the war whatever their ethnic group."
A friend and prominent member of the Serbian Jewish community, Klara Mandic, hinted that Mr. Vasiljevic had made the arms-buying trip to Israel. "I just cannot say anything about this for obvious reasons," she said. As for the black market in dollars, Mr. Vasiljevic acknowledged that he was indeed active in this.
"Buying money on the street, is that what you call the black market?" he asked. "Sure I'm doing that, but so is the Government." The beleaguered Government has, in fact, said it will arrest anyone who trades on the street in dollars, where the black market rate has soared to 400 dinars, compared with an official rate of 200 dinars.
"Black market dollars are all making their way to Mr. Vasiljevic and his Jugoskandic bank," said Momir Pavlicevic, a director of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce. "I personally believe the bank is engaged in dangerous speculation and deals related to the armed conflict. It is offering hard currency interest rates of 10 percent, which are incredible. I would not be surprised if a collapse happens."
Every day, long lines may be seen outside Jugoskandic's branches in Belgrade. Mr. Vasiljevic said he was able to offer the high interest rates because he was satisfied with smaller profits than other banks. "Look at those big buildings the banks have in the United States," he said, "all built with customers' money. I prefer to give more to the customer."
 
A Rags-to-Riches Mystery
 He started with very little himself. Born in a small village 50 miles from Belgrade, he made his way to Austria in 1967 when he was 18 years old, living in an immigrants' camp and working as a laborer cleaning buildings. After this, the two decades until his return to Yugoslavia are sketchy.
All Mr. Vasiljevic will say is that he lived in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada and the United States. "God knows the sectors I worked in, everything that makes money, almost," he declared.
Pressed for a little more detail, the mystery man revealed that he had worked as a broker in the precious stones and precious metals businesses. Where? All he would say is that he spent some time at diamond exchanges in Belgium.
In any event, by the time he returned to Yugoslavia in 1987, he was rich enough to start Jugoskandic, whose main activity, he said, was import-export trading. As specific as ever, he said this trading activity included about 1,500 different items. "But the sanctions are obviously causing a few problems and they are deeply unfair," he added.
 
Promoting a Brash Plan
 Obviously a fierce nationalist, Mr. Vasiljevic has described the chess match, scheduled to begin on Wednesday, as "open war against the embargo." Mr. Fischer has been warned by the United States Government that he could face a heavy fine or imprisonment for engaging in what is regarded as a business activity in Yugoslavia.
In theory, the chess match is supposed to bring Mr. Vasiljevic a profit through planned book and movie ventures tied to the games. It is also supposed to give a decisive lift to Mr. Vasiljevic's most ambitious project to date.
The chess series -- falsely billed as a world championship -- is to be played on the coast of Montenegro, the smallest republic in the old Communist state, on a stretch of land that the businessman recently acquired from the Montenegrin Government for a consideration of $500 million over five years. Mr. Vasiljevic wants to turn the 150 acre-site, which has four hotels and a casino, into a privately held state.
Here is the plan. Businesses registering in Sveti Stevan -- and the idea is to lure banks, trading companies and shipping concerns, among others -- would pay an annual income tax of just 2 percent. (Mr. Vasiljevic has already registered his own companies here, so he knows personally that this is advantageous.) Meanwhile, film and music festivals, conventions and other activities would bolster the standing of this projected mini-Cayman Island -- and raise Mr. Vasiljevic's income as well.
"The happenings at Sveti Stevan will dim the glory of the Cannes Film Festival, of the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize," Jugoskandic says in a brochure displaying Mr. Vasiljevic's brash style.
All this seems like a lot to hope for in a war-ravaged country, particularly when much has been banked on Bobby Fischer, a man at least as mysterious as Mr. Vasiljevic. But the entrepreneur, while smoking continuously and tapping his crocodile-skin-sheathed feet, insisted that he was not worried.
"Mr. Fischer is not eccentric," he said. "He just wants everything to be perfect. That is what makes him the champion of the world."

One Channel Says Crime Doesn't Pay

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
"There are eight million stories in the Naked City," a stern-voiced announcer said in narrating that police drama set in New York. The producers of a 24-hour local news cable television channel that begins operations a week from today are painstakingly planning to insure that potential viewers and advertisers will not tune in to eight million stories about crime.
New York 1 News, as Time Warner Cable calls its service, will compete against local newscasts on broadcast television stations that are infused with enough sensationalism to fill a newsstand's worth of tabloids. Cable television often presents counterprogramming for somewhat younger, more affluent audiences, and New York 1 News will present alternative fare for those seeking information beyond what local newscasters delight in describing as "senseless slayings" -- no doubt to distinguish them from the sensible ones.
 
Not the Murder Network
 "It is not the New York City Murder Channel," Paul Sagan, vice president of news and programming at New York 1 News, asserted during an interview last week at the channel's office at 460 West 42d Street, near 10th Avenue. The office was bustling with start-up activities, from news anchors rehearsing to sets being built. 
 Ellen Mullins, the channel's marketing director, said, "We're going to stress the credibility of the product versus tabloid shows."
New York 1 News can do that, Mr. Sagan, a former news director at WCBS-TV, said, because unlike broadcast television "we don't have to be all things to all people."
"How do you make a broad-interest product to interest people at preset times?" he asked rhetorically, referring to his broadcast news rivals. "You turn out just 'gee whiz' stories."
By contrast, when New York 1 News signs on next Tuesday at 1 P.M., Eastern time, it will be available only to the 850,000 subscribers to Time Warner's six New York cable systems.
Or, as Phyllis Kessler, general sales manager, put it, advertisers should be delighted that unlike other media available to anyone, "this is the only medium you can buy that's prescreened for credit."
The less bloodthirsty approach seeks to address "some advertiser concern, or potential objection," that ad sales executives have faced since they began selling commercial time two months ago, said Larry J. Fischer, president of Time Warner City Cable Advertising, which is handling sales for New York 1 News.
Yet in meeting those concerns, the channel risks veering too far in the other direction, toward what Ms. Kessler described as spending "a lot of time celebrating New York." If one thing sends inveterate watchers of New York newscasts reaching for their channel-changers faster than incessantly gory reports, it is squishy-soft "good news" features.
So the introductory advertising campaign, by Dale Pon Advertising Inc. in New York, disobeys Johnny Mercer's advice by not eliminating the negative while accentuating the positive.
Posters on buses and telephone kiosks, in a fluorescent lime green chosen to match "an eye-opener" of a suit of Ms. Kessler's, carry the theme " 'Cause there's only 1 New York." Television commercials present fast-paced shots of local faces and places from Broadway to the Bronx Zoo.
" 'I love New York' is from a different era than we live in now," Dale Pon, the agency's president, said in a telephone interview, referring to the tourism campaign that became an anthemic salute to the city.
"This is a very difficult place to live and work, but nevertheless worthwhile," he added. "That's the thrust of our campaign."
Despite any perceived need for an around-the-clock information service focusing on New York's five boroughs, New York 1 News is arriving at a dreadful time for the local economy and, by extension, local advertising. Ad revenues will have to be wrested from other media, since most marketers are not raising ad budgets.
And not one of the four similar services around the country, including Channel 12 for Long Island, is yet profitable.
Still, the Time Warner executives are optimistic.
"For a product that's not even on the air, we have contracts well into the seven figures already," Ms. Kessler said. Among the several dozen advertisers signed, she added, are the New York Chevrolet-Geo and Buick dealer associations, New York Telephone, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the U.S. Healthcare and H.I.P. health plans, and Off Track Betting.
Rates for a single 30-second spot range from $200 to $750, compared with as much as $11,000 for one on "Eyewitness News," WABC-TV's "Naked City" of newscasts and New York's top-rated local broadcast news program.
The New York 1 News sales efforts have concentrated on offering advertisers sponsorships, at 13-week minimums, of regular program segments on subjects like weather and travel, at an average cost, Mr. Fischer said, of around $3,000 a week.
One national advertiser, Anheuser-Busch Inc., has become sole sponsor of an hour-long daily sports report at midnight, earning for its product a place in the show's title, "Budweiser Sports on 1."
Mr. Sagan said, however, that no news program would have a sponsor's name attached, denying New York 1 News a contemporary version of a practice prevalent in the early days of broadcast television. For instance, before NBC teamed Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, it presented the "Camel News Caravan," with television's first anchor, John Cameron Swayze, "hopscotching the globe for headlines."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Some Silver Linings for the Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
There could be some good news for the American bond market in the serious troubles that are facing the bond markets in Europe.
It is possible that the outcome of a French referendum on European currency unity could mean lower interest rates there. And that would help stem the decline of the dollar, whose recent fall to record lows against the German mark has, at least temporarily, stalled the bond rally here. 
 This is the view of John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York. He believes that if the French reject the Maastricht Treaty, there are three possible outcomes and two of them help support the dollar.
The third alternative, however, would weaken the dollar and probably slow growth in Europe even more, which would also hurt the American economic outlook.
On Sept. 20, the French vote whether to approve the treaty, which outlines the steps to a single currency and a European central bank by the end of the century.
 
Would Raise Inflation Fears
 If the referendum is defeated or, Mr. Lipsky said, if investors and speculators decide ahead of time that it is likely to be defeated, there could be turmoil in the European bond markets because the outlook for an economically joined Europe with declining inflation will be thrown into doubt. The British pound, the Italian lira and the French franc could fall.
Mr. Lipsky argues that the following actions could be taken to try to limit the damage should the French reject the treaty:
*Interest rates could be raised to prop up the currencies in countries like Britain, France and Italy.
*As an alternative to raising interest rates, currencies within the European Monetary System, which tied Europe's major currencies in fixed trading ranges, could be revaluated or realigned.
*The central bank of Germany, the Bundesbank, could indicate that interest rates there would not be increased. The Bundesbank would send this signal by easing short-term market interest rates. The bank would do this if it decided it wanted to avoid the potential damage from either a currency realignment or interest rate hikes in other countries.
 
Good Move for Dollar
 Such action by the Bundesbank would help the dollar, which has been pulled lower by the very high interest rates in Europe, by indicating that the attractive European rates would not go any higher. And a realignment, Mr. Lipsky said, would open the way to lower interest rates because the weaker currencies would be set in lower trading ranges versus the mark.
The one problem here is that Mr. Lipsky and others still believe the most likely option is raising interest rates to defend the weaker currencies.
"That has to be seen as the most likely outcome," Mr. Lipsky said. Just last week European finance ministers said they opposed any realignment. One reason is that such a move could derail the movement to a single currency. And the credibility of the Bundesbank as an inflation fighter could be damaged if it signaled that it would tolerate lower interest rates.
 
Treasury Market
 The bond market was little changed yesterday in slow trading ahead of the Labor Day weekend. The market is still constrained by a weak dollar while supported by a string of economic data that show slow economic growth and declining inflation.
In late trading in the secondary market, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered at 98 4/32, up 5/32, to yield 7.40 percent, down from 7.41 percent on Friday.
In the weekly auction of three-and six-month bills, the average discount rate rose for the third consecutive week.
The focus of traders this week is on Friday, when the Labor Department releases the employment report for August. The data are expected to be a little confusing because they will include new jobs created through a special Government supplemental jobs program. That data also distorted the job increase of 198,000 reported for July.
 
Expect Little Change
 The unemployment rate and the associated data will be the first clear indicator of the how the economy performed in August, and traders are looking for information to confirm that the economic recovery has not picked up steam.
"Most people are expecting data that is not threatening" to the current view of the economy, said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chemical Securities in New York.
Mr. Fine said he expected nonfarm payroll jobs to increase about 75,000 after the jobs from the Government program are subtracted. These jobs could add 100,00 to 125,000 to the total.
'Seventy-five thousand is barely growing," he said. It is just marginally faster than a snail's pace."
Following are the results of the weekly auction of three- and six- month Treasury bills:

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
They had made this pilgrimage once before, grandmother and 11-year-old granddaughter, heading off together to a political rally to get a glimpse at living history, at Geraldine A. Ferraro, the first woman to be nominated by a major party for the Vice Presidency.
That was in 1984. Since then, Wendy Fresn has grown old enough to vote. Her grandmother, Florence R. Corron, broke down political barriers herself, becoming, as she puts it, the "first and only" woman to be elected a Town Supervisor in Clinton County. She's still serving strong at age 70. 
 And last week, the two were lined up again in Plattsburgh, N.Y., to see Ms. Ferraro, now a candidate for the United States Senate, undeterred by Ms. Corron's credentials as a Republican officeholder. "I was so upset when she lost," said Ms. Fresn, fumbling for words to describe her girlhood grief at the rout of the Democratic ticket of 1984. "Now that I'm old enough, I'm able to control what happens because I'm voting."
More than eight years have passed since Ms. Ferraro, a three-term Congresswoman from Queens, walked onto a convention stage in San Francisco to a roar of raw emotion, as the delegates below cheered, danced and cried.
 
Stars and Suffragettes
 Now, a grayer, more battle-hardened Ms. Ferraro is in a four-way Democratic primary race for a Senate seat from New York that has moved into high intensity in its final weeks. But as Ms. Ferraro crisscrosses the state, it often feels as if the race of 1984 has come out of suspended animation.
Her opponents complain that she has become the front-runner in the Senate race based on a skin-deep "star quality" gained in the Vice-Presidential race. The women who flock to Ms. Ferraro's campaign events say there is more than just her notoriety: They talk passionately about how much it meant to them to see a woman run for Vice President and how much they want her to have a second chance.
In the introductions along the campaign trail, Ms. Ferraro's name is once again paired with the suffragette Susan B. Anthony. The screams and cheers that greet her have a slightly soprano pitch, a woman's tone. And in a campaign year when Marilyn Quayle, the wife of the Vice President, is using phrases like "essential natures" to imply that a woman's place is back in the home, Ms. Ferraro knows how to hit the countertones that she perfected eight years ago.
"Equality," she mused at a recent breakfast fund-raiser in Manhattan. "I guess that means with men," she said, her voice dropping low, husky and sarcastic. "Isn't that sweet?"
The darker more troubling side of the Vice-Presidential campaign has returned as well. The news organizations and Ms. Ferraro's opponents have raised questions once more about her husband's business dealings and about whether the candidate and her family have had uncomfortably close associations with organized-crime figures.
Eight years ago the drumbeat of charges derailed her campaign. This time Ms. Ferraro is fighting back by attempting to turn the campaign attacks into a feminist issue that will rally female voters to her side on Sept. 15. She has portrayed herself as a Joan of Arc, an Anita F. Hill, a woman martyred for daring to take on the male establishment. It makes no matter that the candidate most aggressively leveling the charges against her is also a woman, the New York City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman. The State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, and the Rev. Al Sharpton are the other candidates for the right to oppose Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato on Nov. 3.
"This race is not about Gerry Ferraro, the shady supporting player from America's most-wanted list whose bio is created by innuendoes glued together over the past 70 years," Ms. Ferraro said at the fund-raiser, held last Wednesday in Manhattan to celebrate her 57th birthday.
In a touch of the true confession politics that characterized the Democratic National Convention, she implied that she had exhibited the most durable family values by standing loyally with her husband, John A. Zaccaro, and with her son, John Jr., who was convicted of selling cocaine.
She called herself "a mother and wife who understands that life is not always perfect, but where family is, family puts its arms around each other and is there. When there's troubles you go through them."
Upstate in Malone an interviewer on a cable station almost apologetically backed into several questions about the allegations against Ms. Ferraro's family, never actually asking her to address them.
 
Calling for Issues
 Ms. Ferraro, who has compared the charges to "McCarthyism," dismissed The Village Voice -- where the allegations resurfaced late last month -- as a "left-wing weekly." Then she asked that viewers to join her against negative campaign tactics. "It's gutter politics," she said, staring intently at the woman asking questions. "It's really awful."
She added, "I would hope the voters would demand -- not only in this race, I'm talking about the Clinton-Bush matchup -- demand where people stand on the issues."
Wednesday evening, two lone protesters screamed "Violent pornographers, Gerry!" and waved pictures of nude, bound women, as Ms. Ferraro ignored them and raised her voice to address women gathered outside a restaurant for a fund-raiser for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women.
One of the demonstrators, Page Mellish, said the pictures were distributed by Star Distributors Inc., a pornographer linked to organized crime that was a tenant in a building in which Ms. Ferraro's husband owns a 50 percent interest and is managed by a family company that lists Ms. Ferraro as an officer. Television commercials run by Ms. Holtzman have accused Ms. Ferraro of taking $300,000 in rent from the pornographer.
But other women who still line up for Ms. Ferraro's autograph and use phrases like idol and heroine to describe her seem willing to accept her premise that she is being victimized. "She's paying the price," said Nancy DuFrain, a Clinton County legislator, arguing that the scrutiny of Ms. Ferraro's husband and her family was a double-standard applied to a female politician. "Does Bobby Abrams have a wife?" she demanded. "I don't know. And what does her uncle do?" She made sure to have her picture taken with Ms. Ferraro.
For Chris Hobsen Whalen, 33, who was waiting for Ms. Ferraro to appear at a luncheon for business and professional women, the drug conviction of the candidate's son made the Senate contender even more appealing. "Just to overcome it personally in her private life is a plus," she said. "That helps her understand what real people go through."
Ms. Ferraro's staff members say they have seen no slippage in the polls despite the resurrection of allegations about family businesses. And the candidate says she is not surprised. Ms. Ferraro said she had done extensive polling before entering the Senate race in 1991 to see whether she could withstand such a barrage. "I was not going to get into a race that wasn't winnable," she said. "I wasn't going to kid myself."
 
Shifting Spending Priorities
 For the most part, as she campaigned across the North Country last week, Ms. Ferraro was able to ignore the allegations that are being blared in television commercials downstate, where 70 percent of the primary electorate is.
She campaigned instead by lashing into the Republican administration for the stalled national economy. She called for cuts in military spending, for more money for education, and for a Federal jobs program rebuilding the nation's aging infrastructure. "The system is not working," she said to one luncheon crowd. "I know it. You know it. George Bush knows it. And Dan Quayle may not know it, but Marilyn will tell him."
But with at least 55 percent of the typical New York primary electorate made up of women -- and the number expected to go still higher this month, drawn out by the candidacies of Ms. Ferraro and Ms. Holtzman -- Ms. Ferraro always comes home to women's issues, particularly abortion rights.
When she ran for Vice President, Ms. Ferraro gave a mixed message on abortion. She said that as a Catholic she personally would not have an abortion. But she also added that if she were raped and became pregnant she was not certain she could be "so self-righteous." She insisted that each woman should have the right to make her own choice on the issue.
Now she simply speaks out forthrightly about a woman's right to choose, dispensing with the former caveats. "In 1984 people didn't know me and I had to explain myself," she said recently, when asked why she no longer brings up her own scruples when discussing the volatile issue. "I'm 57 now," she added. "I can no longer say, 'If I were ever to become pregnant,' so it's academic."

HEADLINE: Dominican Immigration Alters Hispanic New York

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Jackie Saltares remembers a time not that long ago when the Puerto Ricans were the undisputed kings of Hispanic New York and Spanish Harlem was the spiritual and physical center of their realm.
El Barrio, the neighborhood, was home to thousands of Puerto Ricans who settled into cramped walk-up apartments on the narrow side streets and who bustled along the wide shopping avenues, eager if weary travelers on the road to the American Dream. 
 Now, an increasing number of immigrants from the Dominican Republic have come to El Barrio, snapping up apartments and businesses that were once the domain of Ms. Saltares's countrymen. When she walks down her block on East 115th Street, the three bodegas and two beauty parlors owned by Dominicans loom as reminders of just how aggressively the new arrivals are staking their claim.
 
'There's Another Dominican'
 "Every time you turn around, there's another Dominican," she said. "It's like our neighborhood doesn't belong to us anymore."
That neighborhood is not just El Barrio. It is the entire territory of Hispanic New York -- its politics, its economy, its society. And Ms. Salteres's unease underlines a debate, sometimes friendly, sometimes not, in that territory that echoes from El Barrio to the Bronx, Brooklyn and beyond as Puerto Ricans try to adjust to a changing world.
Members of both groups acknowledge that this rivalry could hinder their intertwined aspirations for power and influence in an increasingly Hispanic city: according to city and census records, Hispanic New Yorkers grew from 16.3 percent of the population in 1970 to 19.9 percent in 1980 to 24.4 percent in 1990. The rivalry manifests itself in grumblings, tensions and slights ranging from silly stereotypes to accusations of exclusion and nationalistic "me first" myopia. In many ways it is a late 20th-century reprise of the jousting played out generations ago by other struggling immigrants, the Irish and the Italians, the Germans and the Jews.
In part, it is a matter of demographics. In one generation, a big change in immigration has wrought a major shift in the city's Hispanic population. The Mexican Consulate, for instance, estimates that since the mid-1980's, the number of Mexicans living in the New York metropolitan region has grown from 60,000 to more than 200,000.
New York has ever-increasing numbers of Central and South Americans and especially Dominicans. While 20 years ago Hispanic New Yorkers were almost always Puerto Rican, the 1990 Census estimated that the city's 896,763 Puerto Ricans now account for about half its Hispanic population, probably less when illegal immigrants are taken into account.
Dominicans, their migration spurred by political upheaval in the mid-60's and by economic hardship in later years, have become the city's second-largest Hispanic group, numbering 332,713, with thousands more illegal and uncounted.
And while both groups still live on the struggling side of success, the Dominicans have made substantial economic progress in a single entrepreneurial generation, buying up bodegas, restaurants and livery-cab fleets around the city.
 
Is Political Agenda Too Puerto Rican?
 As Dominicans come into their own, some feel they are being held back in politics and community organizations where their concerns are given lip service while the leadership pursues a narrowly Puerto Rican agenda.
Dr. Rafael Lantigua, an internist active in Dominican political and community affairs, said that when a Hispanic Congressional seat was proposed for the West Bronx and Washington Heights, some Puerto Rican politicians suggested one of their own as a possible candidate without consulting with the Dominican community. He said that when Dominican political types questioned the move, they were told to be patient.
"We all sit at the table when it comes time to draw lines," said Guillermo Linares, the first Dominican elected to the City Council. "When the time comes to determine who represents all of us, we no longer find ourselves at the table."
One high-ranking city official who is Dominican was more blunt, when he said that the Puerto Rican politicians wanted them to ask for permission rather than consult.
"We're never going to do that," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "For that we'd go back to the island."
Some Dominicans insist with some smugness that they will outpace a Puerto Rican community that they feel has never realized the advantages of their dual benefits of being the city's longest-established Hispanic group and one that is born with United States citizenship.
Considering themselves the pioneers among the city's Hispanic groups and the leaders in struggles for bilingual education, voting rights and fair financing for social-service groups, some Puerto Ricans worry that the newcomers are riding on their coattails. And they are quick to add that they remain the main political bloc, accounting for some 80 percent of the city's registered Hispanic voters.
"Other groups may be forgetting that we busted our backs to make New York a bilingual town," said Representative Jose E. Serrano, who is Puerto Rican. "In typical Puerto Rican fashion we will share those gains with all our Latino brothers. But now that the fruits are coming in, the people have to admit publicly how this happened. We can't run the risk of someone rewriting history and making it look like New York City became a bilingual town in 1985."
Despite the misgivings in the city, many from both groups see their futures bound together by a common language and concerns, and there are members of both groups working together for their communities. They anticipate reaping the benefits of their political and civic cooperation. The existing tensions are the growing pains of an evolving relationship.
"You find like in any good marriage, there's a lot of conflict," said Palmira Rios, an assistant professor of urban planning at the New School for Social Research, "But somehow you continue living together."
Even though Jackie Saltares had qualms about the growing Dominican presence in her neighborhood, she knew that the two groups had more in common than not. It's a weird feeling, she said, made all the more odd by the fact that one of her closest friends is a Dominican woman who dispelled her teen-age notions that Dominican women were rubes or husband-hunting hussies.
"I know there's this ongoing feud between Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, but I never really understood it," she said, adding that the two groups shared too many ethnic, cultural and historic bonds to allow themselves to be bogged down in bickering. "This doesn't make sense to hate yourself."
 
Act of Kindness Amid the Brickbats
 Jose Luis Reyes, a 28-year-old Dominican immigrant who works as a clerk at a Washington Heights variety store, chuckled at the brickbats tossed between his compatriots and Puerto Ricans.
"Some Puerto Ricans say Dominicans come here to get welfare," he said, standing on the sidewalk, a hectic array of shoes, T-shirts and soccer balls behind him. "The Dominicans say that Puerto Ricans live off the government."
His more nationalistic friends sometimes taunt Puerto Ricans by reminding them that their island is a United States possession. "They say that Puerto Ricans don't have a real flag," he said.
Mr. Reyes doesn't buy into that talk; he once worked for a Puerto Rican store owner who took him under his wing, giving him a chance to earn a decent wage and inviting him to his house to unwind after work.
Nonetheless, he wondered why Puerto Ricans have not made more strides, especially in the business world, given the head start they have on other Hispanic immigrants in both time and citizenship.
Marlene Cintron, a Puerto Rican who is the director of the Office of Latino Affairs for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said her recent marriage to a Dominican sparked some mean-spirited offhand remarks about his citizenship at a fund-raising reception, where she was seated at a corporate table with several influential New Yorkers.
"A white woman who is married to a Puerto Rican came over to comment on my marriage," Ms. Cintron recalled. "She finished her statement and said, 'We were wondering if your husband needed papers.' At which time the rest of the table proceeded to laugh. I left very hurt."
Personal slights notwithstanding, in her circle, where she is in contact with the political leaders and community advocates for the city's various Hispanic groups, Ms. Cintron sees no major strife between Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. "Those who understand real empowerment understand that we need to do it together," she said.
In many measures -- income, education, poverty rate -- the two groups are seemingly indistinguishable, said Professor Rios of the New School. "The idea that one community is so much better or worse doesn't really hold," she said.
Dominicans own most of the city's bodegas in large part because of a generational shift, buying them from Puerto Rican owners who decided to retire or whose college-educated children sought broader opportunities in the mainstream labor force. Ms. Rios noted that while social indicators for the city's Puerto Rican population paint a bleak picture, they overlook the fact that an increasing number of Puerto Rican professionals have moved away from the city.
Still, Dominicans who work for community-based groups say that nonprofit groups founded by Puerto Ricans will gladly serve Dominican clients while refusing to allow Dominicans into leadership and decision-making posts.
Several community advocates noted that during the recent disturbances in Washington Heights, most of the city's Hispanic elected officials, nearly all of them Puerto Rican, made little effort to reach out to the Dominican community.
"I think a lot of Puerto Ricans were confusing their agenda as the only one on the table," said Moises Perez, the executive director of Alianza Dominicana, a social service agency in Washington Heights. "Now, they have to share space at the table."
 
Squabbling Fiercest When Pie Is Small
 Mr. Perez said that the rivalry boils down to squabbling over limited financing.
"Some people in the Puerto Rican community are taking the low road and see it as Dominicans and other Latinos taking over what they built," he said. "But others who are more visionary understand that we have to look at the pie as having to be bigger than it has been. We have to fight for a bigger pie."
In practical terms, Puerto Ricans still constitute some 80 percent of the city's registered Hispanic voters, making them crucial to the victory of any candidate wooing that vote. One senior Puerto Rican elected official said that the Dominican community did not have the votes to elect one of their own to Congress, and that those victories they have had were propelled by Puerto Rican votes.
"We gave them a Council seat and we may give them an Assembly seat," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We got to fight it for them each time. They have got to wait some time. It's not their time. It's hard politics."
A growing segment of younger Hispanic residents, raised in the city and sharing a common outlook as New Yorkers, have been building coalitions that would reap benefits for all. Many see the squabbles as infighting among political elites that in the long run will do little to lift either community.
As executive director of Alianza Dominicana, Mr. Perez said he was heartened by those efforts. Nonetheless, he made clear that the work was long and time was short.
"We either share it or we compete," he said. "And if we compete, get ready to run."

HEADLINE: Boeing Names a President Who Is Seen as Future Chief

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Boeing Company yesterday named Philip M. Condit president and a member of the board. Although Frank Shrontz, Boeing's 60-year-old chairman and chief executive, said he had every intention of keeping his position until he reached the company's customary retirement age of 65, Mr. Condit's promotion was widely viewed as the naming of an heir apparent.
Mr. Condit, who is 51, has most recently been an executive vice president and general manager of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group's 777 division, where he had primary responsibility for developing the company's newest commercial jet. 
 "The world has changed and we have to change with it to remain viable, and I can use some help in doing that," Mr. Shrontz said at a news conference yesterday in Seattle, where Boeing has its headquarters. He said development of the 777 was far enough along that Mr. Condit's move would not jeopardize the program. "It is an appropriate time to bring somebody over here to give me some assistance in long-term direction," he said.
Mr. Condit's promotion had little effect on Boeing's stock, which has been depressed lately, and closed yesterday with a loss of 12.5 cents, at $37.25, in a down market on the New York Stock Exchange. But analysts said he would prove a popular choice to head Boeing, which is the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer.
"He's a guy that's just charged with energy," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. "If you look across the ranks of all the people there," Mr. Rubel said, "he in lots of ways personifies all the good things Boeing stands for -- engineering excellence, hard-nosed attention to performance, and willingness to listen. He's the right choice for the company for the 90's."
Boeing is under increasing pressure as the recession takes its toll on airlines, reducing their orders for new airplanes. Although still the dominant commercial aircraft supplier, with a 55 percent market share, Boeing faces ever stronger competition from the Airbus Industrie consortium in Europe, which last month broke Boeing's long hold on United Airlines as a customer, winning an order for as many as 100 new medium-range jetliners.
In this environment, Mr. Condit said it was more important than ever for Boeing to focus on its customers, and he cited his experience working with airlines to develop the 777.
"It is one of the things Boeing has always done well, but it is also something that if you don't pay attention aggressively, it can get away from you," Mr. Condit said in a telephone interview. On the 777, "we went out and very consciously said we want airline people here," he said. "We actually had them into the design review, and we've never done that before," he added. "So, they were a part of the process."
Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with UBS Phillips & Drew, said that Mr. Condit's management of the 777 project demonstrated an ability to work both with customers and with suppliers, who now play more of a partner role on new aircraft.
"That requires a greater willingness to communicate and interface with people who are not working for the same entity," he said, adding that Mr. Condit "has a demonstrated track record at working with people outside and working well with them."
Mr. Condit will be succeeded by Alan R. Mulally, vice president-engineering of the 777 project since 1989.
Unlike Mr. Shrontz, whose background is in accounting, Mr. Condit is an engineer. He came to Boeing in 1965 as an aerodynamics engineer on the original supersonic transport program. He spent three years on the 747 program, and moved up through a series of positions in engineering management, production, sales and marketing. He became executive vice president of the commercial airplane group in April 1985.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Boston Bank Will Acquire Savings Unit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The carving up of the Connecticut banking market by larger banks moved ahead yesterday as the Bank of Boston agreed to acquire the Society for Savings, Hartford, in a stock deal worth about $200 million.
The merger is a signal that both Society, a savings bank with $2.8 billion of assets, and the Bank of Boston, with $32 billion in assets, have weathered the downturn of the region's economy and real estate market, and are now healthy enough to consider long-range prospects, not just solving immediate problems. 
 With the addition of Society, Bank of Boston's Connecticut subsidiary will become the fourth-largest bank in the state, moving up from eighth.
 
$470 Million Raised
 In expectation of acquisitions in a region where there are many weak banks, the Bank of Boston earlier this year raised $470 million through sales of common and preferred stock.
The current deal calls for each share of Society stock to be exchanged for eight-tenths of a share of Bank of Boston stock. Society's shares rose $2.625 yesterday, to $15.125, in over-the-counter trading, and Bank of Boston stock fell $1.25, to $20.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Society, which lost a total of $116.9 million in 1990 and 1991, has earned $3.5 million so far this year and is expected to earn more in coming quarters because its problems with bad loans are waning.
But the industry still faces problems in Connecticut. Nine other savings banks in the state with assets totaling $5.9 billion have 10 percent or more of their assets in badly delinquent loans or repossessed real estate -- a level considered perilously high.
Several commercial banks are also troubled by bad loans, the largest being the Union Trust Company of Stamford, with $3.3 billion in assets. Its parent company, Northeast Bancorp, is considering whether to find a partner, analysts said.
Although Society had considered other offers to buy parts of its business, and on May 29 said it had decided to remain independent, the latest offer apparently was too good to refuse.

The dollar declined yesterday in uneventful trading on world currency markets.
Dealers said trading was light, as holidays closed markets and financial institutions in London and Hong Kong. 
 The dollar was hindered by a worse-than-expected report on single-family home sales in the United States during July. The Government said seasonally adjusted sales of new homes fell 2.6 percent from the previous month despite the lowest mortgage rates in 19 years.
Among European currencies, the German mark continued to benefit from high interest rates. The Swiss franc drew strength as investors "moved to quality" amid uncertainties surrounding Europe's plan for political and economic union, said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.42 yen, down 0.18 yen from Friday's close. During the European trading day, the dollar was quoted at 123.28 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 123.05 yen, unchanged from Friday.
The British pound was quoted at $1.9810 in Europe, down from $1.9815 late Friday in London. In New York it cost $1.9880 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.9825.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.4030 German marks, down from 1.4090; 1.2495 Swiss francs, down from 1.2610; 4.7825 French francs, down from 4.8000; 1,071.25 Italian lire, down from 1,077.50, and 1.1950 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1966.
Gold prices rose in limited trading. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $342.70 an ounce, up $2.80 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold was up $2.45 an ounce, to a late price of $342.20.
On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $3.730 an ounce, up from $3.674 on Friday.

Managed Care: Is It Effective?

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
TRYING to slow the rise in health-care costs, American employers spent some $13 billion last year for managed-care services. But national spending on health continued to grow at double-digit rates, leading some experts to question the effectiveness of managed care.
Managed care typically includes a review of each case before agreeing to pay for treatment. The payers often also encourage patients to use networks of hospitals and doctors to meet cost- and quality-related standards of care, often at discounts. 
 Many health-care proposals in Congress and state legislatures rely heavily on managed care for cost control. But the Congressional Budget Office discouraged hopes for savings in a recent report to the House and Senate tax-writing panels.
"The growth of managed care does not appear to have affected systemwide costs," the Budget Office said in a staff memorandum to Congress. "Based on existing knowledge, it cannot be assumed that further growth of managed care would reduce either the level or the rate of increase of systemwide health-care spending," although it added that "reliable evidence on the effectiveness of managed care is relatively sparse." National spending on personal health care grew by 10.7 percent, to $282 billion, last year.
Some companies report that managed care has helped slow the rise in their health costs. But hospitals and doctors often order more tests and procedures and raise fees to patients not under managed care.
The largest savings have shown up at health maintenance organizations in which doctors work on salary or in a group practice, the Budget Office added. It suggested that overall spending might be reduced by 10 percent in the unlikely event that everyone with health insurance joined this type of H.M.O. About 39 million people are enrolled in H.M.O.'s, of which 15 million are in staff and group models. Fifty million more are eligible to use discount networks.
Gary Yeaw, group insurance director at Allied- Signal Inc., which spent $400 million in 1991 on employee and retiree heatlh care, said staff model H.M.O.'s had yielded much better results than more loosely organized medical networks. He said health costs for 48,000 Allied-Signal employees in all types of H.M.O.'s had increased 10 percent to 11 percent annually since the company made a strong commitment to managed care six years ago, compared with increases of 20 percent a year for 22,000 employees under traditional coverage.
"We feel managed care is working, but clearly more needs to be done," Mr. Yeaw said.
Several managed-care advocates said it was too early to judge the concept. Alain Enthoven, professor of management at Stanford University's business school, said H.M.O.'s would have to compete more vigorously on prices. Doctors and hospitals are not chosen on the basis of cost, partly because the burden is shared through tax deductions, and most employers are not hard bargainers.
Joseph W. Duva, a partner and managed-care expert with Ernst & Young, added that most employees could still choose a doctor and hospital regardless of price.
Patricia Wilson, a principal with the A. Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm, argues that employers need to buy health services like other commodities. "You have to get your hands dirty," she said, and deal with doctors and hospitals on prices and specifications. But she added, "Many employers do not have the resolve to do it."
Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, chairman of Interstudy, a nonprofit managed-care research organization, said that employers, patients and doctors also needed to know more about the likely results from a given test or treatment to make informed choices. "There's more to managing care than a straight bottom line on costs," he said.
Harold S. Luft, a professor of health economics at the University of California, San Francisco, said that even when H.M.O.'s produced savings, employers and unions often took the savings in added benefits like prescription drugs and eyeglasses, instead of pushing them to cut premiums. He added that H.M.O.'s were too small in most regions to resist community pressures to pay for the use of expensive new medical equipment.
Dr. David M. Eddy, a professor of health policy and management at Duke University, said that "even if managed care is the answer, I doubt that it is the only answer." He added, "If we are going to control costs, we need a system in which the decision makers feel pressure to provide high quality care and control costs.
Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health-care analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated the cost of managed care was about $13 billion in 1991 for about 90 million people in H.M.O.'s and other networks, plus 40 million in traditional health plans that second-guess physicians.
And Bill Custer, research director of the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, said it might be five years or more before "a nice national study is available."

HEADLINE: White House's View of Dollar

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The White House said today that the United States was not trying to depress the value of the dollar as a means of spurring American exports.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the dollar's decline "largely reflects the fact that U.S. interest rates are 6.5 percentage points lower than German interest rates." 
 He added that the United States "does not believe that a lower dollar is necessary for its export competitiveness."
Mr. Fitzwater said he did not think there was any connection between the fall of the dollar and President Bush's proposal for across-the-board tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Restaurant Issues Hold Their Own

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin

 BODY:
CONSUMERS may have less money to spend, but dining out is decidedly not out.
According to the National Restaurant Association, the average family spends 43 cents of every food dollar at restaurants. That number, which includes everything from takeout pizza to meals on airliners, has never been higher. This year, the group estimates that food service sales will reach $262 billion, up 5.6 percent from the $248 billion spent in 1991. 
 Such statistics have helped the stocks of most publicly traded restaurant companies hold their own fairly well this year, after a banner performance in 1991. For the year through last Friday, the 23 restaurant stocks tracked on a daily basis by Montgomery Securities have declined by 6 percent, compared with a 1 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 400 average.
In some respects, the drop should have been expected, because prices of those same stocks rose a hefty 59 percent in 1991, compared with a 27 percent increase in the S.& P. 400 average.
That the drop this year was only 6 percent is surprising, given that the industry has seen no growth in spending on an inflation-adjusted basis in nearly three years and is raising prices at the slowest pace in close to three decades.
Declining labor and food costs have helped lift profit margins at many restaurant companies, as have lower interest rates. But analysts say the main reason big chains have done more than survive during the recession is through expansion.
"The fact that food costs have been very favorable has helped a little bit," said Barry M. Stoufer, a partner at J. C. Bradford & Company in Nashville. "But the bulk of the earnings growth has been due to unit expansion."
To be sure, the lingering recession has brought changes in where people go to eat, but people continue to eat out.
"There is no evidence to support the notion that a recession will stop people from going to a low-cost restaurant," said Michael G. Mueller, a managing director at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "Unless there is a depression, people won't curtail that sort of spending."
Jostling for market share in this enormous business are a relative handful of public companies dominated by the McDonald's Corporation.
Joseph Doyle, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham who has McDonald's on his buy list, acknowledges that McDonald's domestic earnings growth has probably peaked and will be a "fairly modest" 6 to 7 percent in the near to medium term. But the real growth potential lies abroad, Mr. Doyle says.
"In normal times, McDonald's foreign business can grow at a 20 percent annual rate," he said. "But right now there are recessions abroad as well, which tells me that this year's foreign earnings might grow in the area of 13 to 14 percent."
McDonald's stock closed at $42.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, off 25 cents.
Other analysts are more cautious about McDonald's, a company they say is being squeezed by hamburger chains like Rally's Inc., whose restaurants mostly have only drive-up counters, and by companies developing niche markets by catering to aging baby boomers, like Brinker International and Applebee's International.
Chili's, a chain owned by Brinker, "is perceived now as offering better value than many fast-food chains," said Caroline Levy, the restaurant and food analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Ms. Levy, who called Brinker's management "one of the best" in the country, said she was also excited about the potential of Romano's Macaroni Grill, a Brinker division that next year will have 23 restaurants across the country.
"Macaroni Grill is one of the hottest new concept restaurants today," she said of the Italian food chain. Brinker stock closed at $36 yesterday, up 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Stoufer at J. C. Bradford keeps his focus on the smaller companies, and currently has two particular favorites, Morrison Inc. and Longhorn Steaks, two over-the-counter issues.
Known primarily as a cafeteria company, Morrison operates a casual dining division that contributes a little over 50 percent of the company's earnings, Mr. Stoufer said. Morrison stock closed at $24 a share yesterday, down 25 cents.
Longhorn, a casual dining steakhouse chain that went public in March, "is a classic growth stock," in Mr. Stoufer's opinion. "Their earnings should be growing at 30 percent to 35 percent a year." Longhorn, which went public at $16 a share, lost 50 cents yesterday, closing at $18.75.
Analysts noted that chains with higher-priced restaurants, like the Quantum Restaurant Group, TW Holdings and Chart House Enterprises, stand to benefit the most when the economy finally returns to robust health.

HEADLINE: Rebellion a Factor Keeping Egypt Out of U.S. Air Campaign in Iraq

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 31

 BODY:
When President Hosni Mubarak and his advisers considered the reasons for staying out of the American-led air campaign to protect Iraqi Shiites, it was a rebellion in southern Egypt, rather than southern Iraq, that was on their minds.
In recent months, Egyptian officials have grown worried about a sporadic and sometimes violent rebellion in the southern region, known as Upper Egypt for its Nile River topography compared to the lower-lying, northern Nile delta. 
 A small group of hard-line Islamic fundamentalists scattered in Upper Egyptian villages has battled the police and declared war on Mr. Mubarak and his Government.
Considering the strength of the fundamentalist opposition movement threatening Algeria's leadership, said one senior Government official here, it made no sense for Egypt to stoke anti-Western feeling by joining an American-led offensive to control the southern skies of an Arab country -- even if its leader is Saddam Hussein.
"It just adds fuel to charcoal" that "is still very hot," the official said, referring to the spread of Islamic fundamentalism. "The situation in parts of Egypt is very volatile."
The rebellion in southern Egypt is not considered an immediate or serious threat to Mr. Mubarak, but diplomats say it was one of several factors influencing Cairo's decision to keep its distance from the West in the current showdown with the Iraqi President.
 
Assertive Reconnaissance
 Saying it wanted to protect Shiite Muslims from Iraqi air attacks, a Western military coalition began enforcing an air shield over southern Iraq last week. United States and British planes have patrolled the skies in southern Iraq since Thursday without incident, although they have threatened to shoot down any Iraqi aircraft that ventures below the 32d parallel.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and some other gulf states have given logistical support to the Western pilots, but only Kuwait has publicly praised the air operation. A year and a half after Egypt and Syria joined American and European forces in ousting Iraqi troops from Kuwait, Arab governments are wary of being perceived as marching in lockstep with the West.
In southern Egypt, more than 50 people, including at least a dozen police officers, have been killed since March in battles among Muslim gunmen and security forces, and in clashes between Muslims and Coptic Christians. In the most serious incident, 14 people, including 13 Coptic Christians, were massacred by Muslim militants in May near Asyut, about 200 miles south of Cairo.
The fundamentalists say their goal is to purge Egyptian society of Western secular influences and turn the country into a Muslim state governed under strict interpretations of Islamic law.
Responding to the militants' violent campaign, the Government in Cairo adopted a law last month introducing the death penalty for members of terrorist groups.
At least six attacks on tourists or tourist sites in Upper Egypt have been reported this summer, including a firebomb attack on a French tour bus in July in which four passengers reportedly were slightly injured.
Arab governments say the political situation and mood in the region are different now from the situation two years ago, when Mr. Hussein's troops charged across Iraq's border into Kuwait. Then, Egypt, Syria and several gulf states rallied behind the Western-led military drive to defeat a leader viewed as the neighborhood bully.
The biggest concern now expressed by Arab governments is that the Western air operation will lead to a de facto partitioning of Iraq, creating a Kurdish zone in the north, a Sunni Muslim zone in the center and a Shiite Muslim zone in the south. Just as Turkey is wary of the Kurds, some Arab countries are concerned that the Iraqi Shiites and their fellow Shiites in neighboring Iran will gain a foothold on the Arabian peninsula.
Governments like Egypt's, whose foreign and economic policies are closely tied to those of the West, fear that the allied campaign on behalf of Iraqi Shiites will somehow embolden foes on the religious right and threaten their internal stability.
There is also concern that Iran and its allies will make gains in exporting their fundamentalist revolutions. Egypt has accused the Sudan, on its southern border, of sending weapons and infiltrators into Upper Egypt to foment revolution.
Rifaat Said, an Egyptian political leader who has organized a national campaign to unite Muslims and Christians, said Cairo should have gone further and condemned the allied air zone, saying it would only benefit Iran and the fundamentalists inside and outside Egypt.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
'Did Not!' and 'Did So!' Frame the Tax Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 31

 BODY:
As the choice between Bill Clinton and George Bush moves this week toward the traditional Labor Day opener of the general election race, it is clear that earlier fears were overstated.
The 1992 Presidential election will not degenerate entirely into a cheap, shallow, demagogic discussion on such issues as the parenting skills of Woody Allen and the party affiliation of God. While that sort of thing will remain a secondary subject of dialogue, the primary focus will be a debate on the economic future of America. 
 This, however, sounds a good deal loftier in the abstract than it is turning out in the concrete. So far, the great economic debate has gone along something like this:
Mr. Bush: You raised taxes and fees 128 times as Governor of Arkansas.
Mr. Clinton: Did not.
Mr. Bush: Did so.
Mr. Clinton: Did not, and anyway you raised taxes plenty yourself as President.
Mr. Bush: Did not, and if you were President, we'd have the biggest tax hike in history.
Mr. Clinton: Will not. It wouldn't be as big as the one you signed, the second-largest in history.
Mr. Bush: Tax and spend.
Mr. Clinton: Tax and spend.
Mr. Bush: Fearmonger.
Mr. Clinton: Fearmonger.
On its promissory side, the discussion is not much more elevated than it is on the accusatory. Mr. Bush, in his speech accepting his party's nomination, held out the glittering pledge of an across-the-board tax cut if re-elected, but was utterly vague as to how he would accomplish such a thing.
With an equal attention to detail, the Clinton campaign's first general election television commercials, unveiled Sunday, asserted that a Clinton Presidency would create eight million new jobs, in a presumably unintended echo of Mr. Bush's failed campaign pledge of four years ago to create 30 million new jobs.
There is no reason to think the level of dialogue will become greatly elevated over the course of the next two months; where it is at currently appears to satisfy the needs of both sides.
In the room at the Clinton campaign headquarters where James Carville, the chief strategist, spins and weaves, a sign on the wall reminds everyone: "The economy, stupid." The obvious point of the sign -- that for Mr. Clinton to win this race the subject must remain President Bush's handling of the economy -- tends to mask another point. The language of the sign consciously echoes a sign seen above the desks of office wits everywhere: "Keep it simple, stupid." A reasoned, nuanced debate on the nation's economic health is not likely to serve Mr. Clinton as well as a simple message: this country is in terrible economic shape and it is George Bush's fault.
Likewise for Mr. Bush, only more so. With polls showing consistently that most Americans have made up their minds on the subject (they do believe the economy is in rotten shape, and they do blame Mr. Bush), what he needs to do is change the subject to how much worse it would be if Mr. Clinton were President.
To this end, the Bush campaign has adopted, and plans to continue to adopt, a tactic of hitting Mr. Clinton almost daily with charges that he would, in one way or another, ruin the economy. Subtlety is not the point. The headlines of the Republican press releases read like supermarket tabloids: "True Confessions of a Tax-Addict," and "Clinton as Dukakis, The Trojan Horse Unveiled."
The Clinton campaign answers with "How About a No-Lie Zone?" and "George Bush and Taxes. No Help for the Middle Class."
The most illuminating episode in the debate to date has been the Bush campaign's charge that Mr. Clinton, as Governor, raised taxes and fees 128 times in Arkansas. The Republicans first floated this in a press release on July 29, and it was later voiced by Vice President Dan Quayle and the House Republican whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, and even by Mr. Bush himself, in his acceptance speech, when he asked people if they would trust him -- "a man who raised taxes one time and regretted it?" or Mr. Clinton, "who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed it every time."
While there is room to legitimately criticize Mr. Clinton's record in raising taxes as Governor of Arkansas, press reports cited the 128 figure as exceptionally distorted because it strongly suggested that the figure referred to 128 separate tax increases when in fact it included a number of separate provisions of the same tax increases and many routine fee increases. The Wall Street Journal, citing the Congressional Research Service, noted that these methods of accounting applied to the Federal Government under Ronald Reagan and George Bush would arrive at a figure of 327 tax increases and 250 tariff increases.
But Bush campaign officials show no concern over this, and promise to continue using the figure. "What does it really matter whether the number is 128 or 58 or whatever?" said one Bush official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "That's not important, is it? What's important is the big picture. Who do you trust to be President? Who has a history of raising taxes and who does not? The 128 figure is just an illustration of the real issue, that's all."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues: Job Training;
President Joins Debate On Retraining Workers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
In offering a comprehensive skills and education plan for workers, the Bush Administration has joined in a debate over an issue that has grown in importance during the Presidential campaign.
The Democratic nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton, several months ago outlined an apprenticeship and training proposal that is much more ambitious than the Bush plan. Still, the Administration's proposal would be a significant expansion of the Government's job training efforts. 
 In addition to tripling the money the Labor Department now spends on retraining workers, the Administration seeks to establish a school-to-work program involving 1 million young people. Parts of the plan were proposed in limited form in April, but Congress did not act on the proposal.
"This is a new national commitment to job training," the President said in announcing his plan at a technical school in Union, N.J., last week.
The Clinton forces responded to the President's plan by calling it imitative and unfinanced, and questioned the President's commitment.
"This is just another false promise from a man who says anything as a candidate but does nothing as a President," Gene Sperling, economic policy director for Governor Clinton, said on Friday.
But there was no disputing the need to retrain the nation's labor force, only the means by which it should be accomplished. Indeed, this is one of the relatively few subjects about which both camps have offered plans detailed enough to invite more than philosophical comparison.
One major difference is that Mr. Clinton would require companies with 50 or more employees to spend 1.5 percent of their payroll to train their workers. Those spending less than this proportion, which the Clinton campaign says is the current corporate average, would be required to pay the difference into a fund for training workers of smaller companies.
This mechanism would produce enough money to make the Clinton apprenticeship plan five times as big as the one proposed by President Bush, whose aides speak of a program in which vocational schools are closely monitored and apprentices trained for existing jobs.
 
Two Main Elements
 The Administration plan consists of two main elements, one for retraining adult workers, at a cost of $2 billion a year, and the other for training for young people costing $1 billion.
For adults, the centerpiece of the strategy is what the Administration calls skill grants -- vouchers of up to $3,000 a year for two years for workers to refine job skills or learn new ones at colleges or trade schools.
Workers would also be eligible for counseling and job-search assistance. In addition, workers who had lost their jobs, had exhausted their unemployment insurance and were in retraining programs would be eligible for Federal assistance until until they found a job.
The skills grants would be available to workers who have lost their jobs or have been notified that their jobs are being eliminated and to workers in industries who fear job losses in the future.
The Administration estimates that 400,000 of 1.2 million workers affected each year by plant closings and large layoffs would use the vouchers, with about 150,000 of them needing Federal assistance while they complete their training. An additional 165,000 workers threatened by obsolete skills and technological shifts are expected to use skill grants for continuing education and training.
The new program would replace two major Labor Department programs dealing with laid-off workers, Trade Adjustment Assistance and Economic Dislocation and Work Adjustment Assistance.
Of the $2 billion the Administration would provide a year, two-thirds would be distributed to the states. Of the remaining $670 million, half would be used to ease the effects of the recently signed North American Free Trade Agreement and half would be spent on workers hurt by layoffs and plant closings in the military industry and in industries affected by the Clean Air Act, among other businesses.
For young people, the Bush plan has four components: the Youth Training Corps, a National Youth Apprenticeship Program, an anti-drug program and a doubling of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps.
In the proposal for the Youth Training Corps for 16 to 21 year olds from poor families, 25 centers, able to accommodate 43,000 students, would be added to the 30 existing Job Corps centers. Students would learn basic skills by working on conservation and environmental projects, some at unused military bases.
Steve Hofman, an aide to Labor Secretary Lynn Martin, conceded that the Clinton plan was more ambitious but criticized it as "a centralized program" that would not be as responsive to local needs as the Bush plan.
"We are striving to tap into local labor markets and conditions that are different from community to community," he said.

HEADLINE: Budget Fight Goes On in California

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 31

 BODY:
With only hours to go before the Legislature was due to adjourn for the year, the two-month-long budget crisis in California reached a flashpoint this afternoon when Gov. Pete Wilson threatened to veto the budget bill because he could not accept an education spending plan approved earlier in the day by the state Assembly.
The new impasse, more of a dispute over future financing for public education rather than a clash over this year's spending, could wreck the budget package, major components of which passed the Legislature over the weekend. 
 A solution to the crisis had seemed almost in hand over the weekend when the Senate passed a budget plan acceptable to the Governor. The Assembly, too, approved an overall spending plan, but the Democratic majority in that house refused to go along with the education spending plan.
In an attempt to outmaneuver the Republican Governor, the Assembly's Democratic leadership negotiated this afternoon with conservative Assembly Republicans, who dislike the Governor, to try to get their support for the education plan passed today. The Democrats hoped to secure enough bipartisan support to send the plan to the Senate before midnight.
 
What Happens Next?
 It was not clear what would happen, should agreement not be reached by midnight. The Governor and the Legislature each has the power to call a special session.
The latest confrontation came as the state Capitol boiled with fury during the 63d day in which the most populous state has gone without a budget, the worst such crisis since the Great Depression. As of today, the state has paid its employees and creditors with $3.2 billion in i.o.u.'s and has stopped paying for the health care for the poor. As the Governor spoke to reporters, disabled people in wheelchairs staged a noisy demonstration outside his office, chanting "sign or resign."
Mr. Wilson said he was prepared to sign the budget, but not with the school plan pushed by the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr., which the Governor said could "lead to a seriously unbalanced budget."
On Saturday, the Senate passed a complete budget, both the overall financial blueprint and the dozen additional bills that are essential to put the budget into effect. The Senate package did not call for new taxation and was acceptable to the Governor.
 
Problems in the Assembly
 Later that day, the 80-member Assembly passed the overall blueprint but waited until Sunday night to take up the additional "trailer" bills. It passed three of them, which mainly cut $1.3 billion for local governments, and came back today to deal with the remainder, including spending on education.
There is no disagreement on the overall amount by which the budget has to be reduced. With revenues having fallen this year for the first time since before World War II, both sides have agreed to cut spending by 3 percent, from an estimated $55.1 billion last year to $53.5 billion this fiscal year. The Democrats two months ago gave up on the notion of raising taxes as politically infeasible in a recession that has hit California harder than most states.
About the only item that does not get cut is spending for public schools, kindergarten through community colleges. The budget allows state support to local school districts to grow somewhat to accommodate increases in enrollment and to keep spending per pupil at last year's level.
But a constitutional amendment passed by voters in 1988, called Proposition 98, requires that 40 percent of state revenues go to schools except when revenues falter. The dispute now is what to do about Proposition 98.
The Legislature has accepted Governor Wilson's plan to keep school spending steady with a series of bookkeeping acrobatics. This is how it works: The state "recaptures" $1.1 billion it paid to schools last year on the ground that, because of the drop in state revenue, the schools were overpaid. That money is made up this year by "lending" the schools $959 million from their Proposition 98 entitlement from future years, to be "repaid" over the next two budget years.
This brought howls from teachers unions and school administrators, who argued that it permanently reduced their financing by cutting the base on which future support is calculated.
To guard against an almost inevitable lawsuit from school districts challenging this plan, the Governor insisted on inserting a "poison pill" into the bill. This would allow him to suspend Proposition 98, and cut school financing, in the case of a successful lawsuit. The Senate accepted this approach.
But the Assembly, responding to the pressure from educators, who are powerful political forces in California, drew up a different kind of poison pill. In the case of a successful lawsuit, it would withhold the $959 million in "loans." Speaker Brown argued that this was a more effective tactic "because no school would run that risk" and file suit. He urged Governor Wilson to come "to the table of reality."
Governor Wilson denounced the Brown plan as a budget buster. If a lawsuit were successful, he said, spending would rise by about $2 billion: the lost $1.1 billion "recapture" plus the lost $959 million "loan." "There will not be a balanced budget if there are gaping holes in it," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Buy Uranium Taken From Bombs Scrapped by Russia

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The United States announced yesterday that it had agreed in principle to buy billions of dollars' worth of bomb-grade uranium from scrapped Soviet nuclear arms in an attempt to bolster the shaky Russian economy and to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents or theft.
The agreement, which would require the formal approval of both Governments, calls for highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear arms to be diluted for sale as commercial reactor fuel. It would be the first such agreement, and, if approved, would be a major step to reducing the dangers that made the cold war so unnerving. 
 "It's a big deal," said Barry Daniel, director of public affairs for the Energy Department, which will buy the uranium. "This provides a way to move the highly enriched uranium from nuclear weapons dismantled in Russia into this country and to keep it out of the wrong hands. It also provides capital to Russia, and part of the proceeds go to increasing the safety of nuclear reactors over there. It's a win-win situation."
The agreement was announced late yesterday by the White House after months of secretive negotiations. In a statement, President Bush said it "illustrates how foreign policy accomplishments can promote our domestic economic well-being while making the world a safer place to live."
The agreement calls for the United States to buy at least 80 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, with no less than 10 metric tons being bought in each of the first five years and no less than 30 metric tons thereafter. Private experts said that at prevailing market prices, that might amount to $5 billion or more over the period of the agreement.
Experts generally praised the agreement. "It's very significant," said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private Washington group. "It doesn't prevent them from making new material. But what it does do, which is very good, is to remove a lot of excess weapons material from storage facilities that would otherwise be available for theft or sale to third parties."
 
Natural Ore Enriched
 Natural uranium ore is made up of a mixture of isotopes, or forms of the same element with different atomic weights. Less than 1 percent of it is uranium 235, the fissionable isotope used in bombs and reactors. Uranium for most American nuclear power reactors is enriched to a level of about 3 percent, while fuel for bombs has more than 90 percent. The agreement would basically reverse that enrichment process, diluting uranium 235 from bombs with natural uranium for use in commercial nuclear power plants.
Early this year, the Russians lined up several American companies that were eager to dilute highly enriched Russian uranium from warheads and to sell it as reactor fuel. And they repeatedly lobbied for the plan with Federal officials.
In July, Viktor N. Mikhailov, head of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry, discussed the potential sale in Washington with top officials of the Energy Department, which oversees the nation's production of nuclear arms and civilian reactor fuel.
Among the American companies eager to make agreements are Allied-Signal Inc., an aerospace and chemicals company based in Morristown, N.J., which signed a preliminary agreement with the Russians.
"We think it is a terrific agreement," said David G. Powell, senior vice president for public affairs of Allied Signal. "Basically this is the beginning of a very productive arrangement by which we would in essence beat swords into plowshares, taking weapons-grade uranium and making it into fuel for nuclear power plants for peaceful uses."
Allied Signal and Nuclear Fuel Services of Erwin, Tenn., signed an interim agreement with Russian officials in July to buy 11 tons of highly enriched uranium by mid-1993, with similar amounts each year thereafter. No price was disclosed.
A major question is whether Russian bomb-grade uranium can be sold without significantly driving down prices on world uranium markets.
 
Any Impact on Budget?
 Russia, starved for cash, has already sold large quantities of natural and mildly enriched uranium in Western markets, feeding a price decline that has driven some producers out of business and threatening the uranium-enrichment business of the Energy Department, the world's largest supplier of commercial reactor fuel. Mr. Daniel, the Energy Department spokesman, said American uranium purchases would have no impact on the overall Federal budget because of money recouped from resales and from large savings in the department's own enrichment program.
The White House said the purchases "would have no adverse impact on American consumers or jobs in the uranium mining or processing industries." It said the department would use the uranium to reduce electricity costs at its enrichment installations.
The cost of the purchases, Mr. Daniel said, will be "in the billions, but I can't put a specific number on it." He added that the purchases would probably occur over 10 to 20 years.
Dr. Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that the agreement "favored the mining industry over the consumer because the alternative would be to sell it on the open market, which would reduce the prices of uranium and electricity."
By having the Energy Department make the purchases, the Government apparently believes it can insure that the influx of new supplies will not throw market prices into a decline.

Global Issues Weigh on Town As Factory Heads to Mexico

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CORTLAND, N.Y., Aug. 26

 BODY:
When the red brick buildings on Main Street were new eight decades ago, and the autos were bulky, black and few, a local steel company brought hundreds of low-wage workers here to upstate New York from Italy and the Ukraine rather than pay more to local workers.
Today, the steel company has long since closed and a rainbow of sleeker vehicles cruises Main Street. But once again a big local employer, this time the Smith Corona Corporation, is looking for cheap foreign labor. 
 Rather than importing foreign workers, however, Smith Corona announced last month that it was moving its typewriter manufacturing operations to Mexico, most likely to Tijuana. Although it plans to keep its much smaller engineering, distribution and customer service divisions here, Smith Corona will lay off 875 of its 1,300 workers in the next 12 months.
 
'Starting All Over Again'
 Smith Corona workers were generally unwilling to discuss the pending layoffs. But one worker who did talk was Barbara E. Miller, who assembles the typewriter mechanism that flicks the correction ribbon into place. "At 50, I'm not really looking forward to starting all over again," she said recently, as she sat on a hay bale near the large gray barn that she rents with her husband. "I have five weeks of vacation; it's back to scratch."
Corporate decisions like the one by Smith Corona have become a centerpiece in the national debate over President Bush's recently announced free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.
The company's move highlights the continuing loss of high-wage manufacturing jobs to countries where labor costs are significantly lower.
The free trade agreement is "going to be responsible for a lot of these moves, and the least the American people can expect of their Government is some assistance," Ronald T. Walsh Jr., Cortland's Mayor, and a Democrat, said over bacon and eggs at the Community Restaurant on Main Street.
Free-market economists say that while towns like Cortland may be hurt by the trade pact, the nation will benefit over all as consumers save on everything from cantaloupes to T-shirts. Some factory relocations are good, economists contend, because they show that companies are doing business wherever they are most efficient, thereby increasing North America's overall economic output.
Most economists also contend that technological change is a larger factor than foreign trade in producing blue-collar layoffs. Smith Corona, whose typewriters have been a common graduation gift for several generations of Americans, employed 4,400 people in the mid-1970's. The company halved its work force in the late 1970's and early 1980's when it began building typewriters with fewer mechanical parts and more electronic equipment. The mechanical parts required considerable labor but the electronics can be stamped together cheaply.
Smith Corona's move followed a similar decision in October by the Zenith Electronics Corporation to send most of its remaining American television production to Mexico from Springfield, Mo. These moves were among the reasons for President Bush's announcement this month that, if re-elected, he would budget an extra $2 billion a year in Federal aid for workers who lose jobs because of foreign competition, environmental regulations or post-cold war shrinkage of the United States military.
Unemployment in Cortland County, at 8.3 percent in June, has been below the state average, in part because new industries, producing everything from garbage cans to packaging material, have flourished in this county of 49,000 people.
 
Staying With Typewriters
 As for Smith Corona, some analysts would attribute its problems to its own management, which continued making portable typewriters while the rest of the world moved on to portable computers.
"Their market analysts simply did not seem able to come to grips with the way things were moving," said Raymond G. Thorpe, a Republican and the Town Supervisor of Cortlandville, an area of dairy farms and cornfields that includes Smith Corona's factory and surrounds the much more populous city of Cortland. "They could have diversified into a lot of other areas to keep going, but they didn't do it."
G. Lee Thompson, the chairman and chief executive of Smith Corona, said the company had briefly participated in a joint venture in the personal computer market and found the market unprofitable. Personal computers with basic accessories cost at least $1,000 and are too complicated and expensive to compete with typewriters, which sell for less than $400.
Manual typewriters are no longer made in the United States, and only a few are imported each year from India, Brazil and elsewhere. Smith Corona also makes personal word processors, which basically consist of a computer printer, a computer screen and a keyboard but have very little computer processing power.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, contends that the United States is better off when companies move to Mexico and keep some operations in the United States -- as Smith Corona is doing -- rather than move halfway around the world to Southeast Asia.
Mr. Thompson and Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith's chairman and chief executive, said they had to seek lower labor costs abroad. Moving to Mexico would keep more jobs in the United States than would moving to Asia, they contended in separate telephone interviews, adding that the prospect of a free trade agreement had not affected their decision.
"I believe, short term, there are going to be some displacements," Mr. Thompson said. "I believe long term the United States, Canada and Mexico have to form an alliance."
More and more companies are setting up operations south of the border -- nearly 2,000 factories in northern Mexico employ 500,000 workers to make goods for the United States while paying little or no tariffs under a Federal program to help Mexico. The moves reflect the extent to which technology, managerial skills and investment money have become more mobile than workers, turning poor countries into increasingly attractive places to build factories.
John R. McGrath, Smith Corona's senior vice president for operations and engineering, said labor costs accounted for a quarter of the cost of making a typewriter, and that moving to Mexico would allow Smith Corona to cut labor costs by four-fifths. Although moving will cost $15 million, it will save that much money every year after that, he added.
Smith Corona, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange but is nearly half-owned by Hanson P.L.C. of Britain, pays manufacturing workers $11 an hour. Fringe benefits and factory supervisor compensation push the company's labor costs to $18 an hour. It estimates that labor in Mexico will cost less than $4 an hour.
 
Competition Overseas

 
 Smith Corona must reduce its costs to compete with low-priced typewriters imported from Japan and Southeast Asia, Mr. Thompson said. Labor costs in Asia are considerably lower than in the United States, though Japan's advantage may be partly a function of more efficient manufacturing processes. Mr. Thompson, however, blames the Bush Administration for not doing more to shield the company from unfairly cheap imports.
Over the last 12 years, the Commerce Department has repeatedly found Smith Corona's archrival, Brother Industries of Japan, guilty of selling its typewriters at unfairly low prices. But Brother has mostly avoided paying punitive Customs duties, by selling typewriters not subject to duties and by opening a typewriter assembly factory in Bartlett, Tenn.
Both Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential candidate, and President Bush have detailed plans for extra Federal spending on job training programs to help unskilled and semiskilled workers like those at Smith Corona. But these programs will not help Smith Corona's workers if the economy does not start growing more quickly.
The New York Department of Labor has "a lot of money ready to spend, but after 18 months of recession here in New York, what can we do?" said Roger A. Evans, a department economist. "The tougher issue is the job market."
Judy K. Davison, Cortland County's employment and training grant administrator, said her office had over the years met virtually all requests for help, although it has sometimes done so by asking local schools and colleges to accept students without collecting any tuition.
Aside from the job impact, city and county leaders played down the overall effect on the community. Smith Corona plans to keep the only large building it owns here while allowing leases on other buildings to expire, so local leaders do not expect an immediate drop in property tax revenues. Local leaders also say that a third of the company's workers commute from neighboring counties and that the company has not been a strong supporter of civic causes.
"They have been a modest citizen-donor type," Mr. Thorpe of Cortlandville said.
 
City Loses Aid
 When reductions in state revenue-sharing last year forced the City of Cortland to cut its budget for parks and youth programs by $143,000, to $492,000, the community responded by raising much of the money through voluntary donations. Cortland Asphalt Products resurfaced a 100-car parking lot in a park for a fraction of the usual price, saving the city $15,000. Smith Corona sponsored a swimming pool party for children that cost less than $300, said Francis N. Tokar, the city's parks and youth programs director.
David P. Verostko, the company's corporate vice president for human resources, said an annual fund-raising drive for the United Way was "the one major activity we do."
Smith Corona's severance pay policies are quite limited. The company, which earned $22.1 million on sales of $371.7 million during its fiscal year that ended on June 30, is offering half a week's pay for each year of service.
To receive the money, which Mr. Thompson describes as a "job continuance package," employees must stay with the company until they are actually laid off.

HEADLINE: George A. Roeper, 81, Educator in Michigan

 BODY:
George A. Roeper, an educator and founder of the Roeper City and Country School in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., died Aug. 24 in Oakland, Calif. He was 81 and lived in Oakland.
Mr. Roeper died of pneumonia, said Loiro Zinser, a spokesman for the school. 
 An authority on the education of gifted children, Mr. Roeper and his wife, Annemarie, founded the school in 1941, soon after they fled to the United States from their native Germany. The couple, who had met when Mr. Roeper was a student at a secondary school operated by Mrs. Roeper's parents, sought students of diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds. The school, which was begun as a lower school, began offering a high school program in the mid-1960's. Mr. Roeper retired as head of the lower school in 1979 and Mrs. Roeper as head of the high school in 1980.
Mr. Roeper was active with Amnesty International and was an early member of the Comparative Educational Society, which examines the education in other countries.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Thomas, of Amherst, Mass., and Peter, of Oakland; a daughter, Karen, of Oakland, and three grandchildren.

Lighthearted Elegance In Resort Collections

BYLINE: By BERNADINE MORRIS

 BODY:
At a time when many fashion designers admit that most women's attitudes toward fashion are as sluggish as the economy, the leaders have produced fresh, lively party clothes that may turn things around. The best of these styles have a lot of movement and swing -- there's nothing like a swirling panel or a rustling petticoat to stir up enthusiasm.
Every designer has his own approach. Geoffrey Beene alternates his sculptural dresses with multilayered full skirts so light they seem buoyed by air. Arnold Scaasi's entire collection is a flower garden of tropical as well as sedate English blooms. Bill Blass revives the comfortably loose caftan and brings it up to date by adding a pair of pants. Oscar de la Renta turns out the ball gowns his customers still demand, but makes them as easy to wear as play clothes. 
 The new party dresses are scheduled to begin appearing in the stores in November, after women presumably have bought their winter coats and other cold-weather gear and are looking forward to Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve as well as jaunts to warm climates like Florida and the Caribbean.
The clothes are part of recently shown collections labeled cruise and resort, which occupy designers between their fall and spring showings. The designers agree that the cruise and resort category of fashion is increasing in importance every year.
The rising significance of resort wear has little to do with whether more people are signing up for cruises in the sun or spending more time at Florida beaches; it has more to do with the growth of the Sun Belt, where the winters pass almost unnoticed, and the need for stores to offer fresh merchandise before bona fide spring styles start arriving.
 
Not Just for Resorts
 While women escaping the snows of, say, Chicago or Minneapolis offer a ready market, many stay-at-homes, too, are attracted to the cheerful, sometimes headstrong designs. Many can be worn to holiday parties. And many can be pushed to the side of the closet and brought out when summer arrives. Many women have found over the years that the best summer fashions appear in the resort collections.
The strongest common denominator of this year's resort and cruise wear is a sense of indomitable good cheer among the designers. They hope women looking at the styles will share their upbeat perspective.
"Women are not buying as much as they used to," Mr. Blass said. "Those who bought eight styles at a time, for instance, are now picking three or four. Some are staying away from the fashion stores, though they're spending money on their houses, horses and even travel.
"We're handling this by making clothes that are attractive and wearable -- no pieces made specially for the runway, everything comfortable. We hope that will cheer them and bring them back to the fold."
Geoffrey Beene's new clothes aren't all fluffy, but they are all dedicated to movement. Seams slither over the body, appearing in unpredictable places, hardly ever at the sides. Fabrics are light to begin with and cut to avoid bulk. Pants, for example, are designed without waistbands to avoid double thicknesses of material. Jersey is favored because of its stretchiness. A great inventor of new shapes, Mr. Beene is counting on his modern, architectural designs to attract women to his resort clothes.
Arnold Scaasi offers a kaleidoscope of colors in his realistic and abstract flower prints. Beads and sequins fill in the blooms and sunflowers; petunias and cabbage roses are all recognizable among the foliage. In a room full of his dresses, you can almost smell the scent.
His dress shapes are on the traditional side, but there is a new element this season: pants.
"They just look right to me," the designer said, speaking of his many party pants. "I hope women will love them."

HEADLINE: The Talk of Hollywood;
After Months of Political Attack, The 'Cultural Elite' Fires Back

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Aug. 31

 BODY:
It's war!
The entertainment industry, led by television, and Vice President Dan Quayle were in open conflict today in a noisy, angry and even funny clash that has sharply intensified the uneasy political mood in Hollywood.
Although there are, most certainly, some highly visible Republicans in town supporting the re-election of President Bush and Mr. Quayle, the dispute over "family values," the "cultural elite" and single motherhood has whipped up heavily Democratic Hollywood into an us-versus-them furor. "I've never seen a time where people have responded this viscerally and taken the attacks so much to heart," said Gary David Goldberg, the creator of "Brooklyn Bridge" and other series. 
 Last night, Hollywood's resentment at the attacks spilled over in the nationally televised 44th Annual Prime-Time Emmy Awards. The creator of "Murphy Brown," Diane English, laced into Mr. Quayle for criticizing what he described last spring as the show's glorification of single motherhood. Joining Ms. English in ridiculing Mr. Quayle during the three-and-a-half-hour awards presentation were the show's star, Candice Bergen, and an array of stand-up comedians and television stars. Critics said the show was otherwise so tedious that it made this year's soporific Academy Awards program seem riveting by comparison. Except for the Quayle-bashing.
"Boy, Quayle is just getting stomped here," said one of the show's hosts, the comedian Dennis Miller. He remarked at one point that Mr. Quayle "better learn how to spell potato because if the economy keeps going down the way it is, that's all we'll be eating."
Perhaps the most biting comment was made by Ms. English. "I would like to thank our sponsors for hanging in there when it was getting really dangerous," she said. "I would also like to thank in particular all the single parents out there who, either by choice or by necessity, are raising their kids alone. Don't let anybody tell you you're not a family."
And then Ms. English added, "As Murphy herself said, I couldn't possibly do a worse job raising my kid alone than the Reagans did with theirs."
The attacks angered Mr. Quayle and his staff. Speaking to a crowd of supporters this morning on the airport tarmac in Huntsville, Ala., Mr. Quayle glanced at notes on index cards and said: "Now did you all see the Emmys last night? Did you see that my favorite TV show got a lot of awards? Now, 'Murphy Brown,' listen closely, 'cause I'm only going to say it once. You owe me big time."
"But I do want to make a serious point," he went on. "Last night they said I attacked single mothers. That is a lie. Last night, they said that I believe single mothers and their children are not families. That is a lie. Winning an Emmy is not a license to lie. Hollywood doesn't like our values. Hollywood doesn't like our beliefs. Hollywood can go ahead and laugh at the American people. They can go ahead and lie about what I said. But I can tell you this: I'm going to continue to speak the truth. I'm going to continue to speak up for traditional values. And I'm not going to back down."
Mr. Quayle's spokesman, David Beckwith, was even more slashing. "Diane English is lying," he said. "She's distorting Quayle's remarks. If she's doing it because of her left-wing political beliefs, that would be one thing. But I think she's partially motivated by money and ratings, which is what seems to make Hollywood go." Ms. English did not respond to several telephone calls.
Hollywood, which takes itself and its politics very seriously, is fervently embracing the Democratic ticket of Gov. Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore. Generally, over the years, Democratic and liberal politicians have looked on Hollywood as a kind of necessary evil. Because so many people here have so much money, politicians with palms outstretched traipse almost weekly now into fancy homes and plead for money at wine-and-cheese parties. The drawback for politicians, who grit their teeth when they come here, is that they must generally endure what they view as silly questions and sillier lectures from Hollywood liberals.
This is not to say that Hollywood politics are strictly Democratic. Stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Selleck, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris are believed to Bush-Quayle supporters. But Republicans are a minority in the entertainment business. The number of movie stars and executives writing checks for the Democratic ticket make up the not-so-silent majority. And the Republican convention earlier this month, with its theme of "family values" and sporadic attacks on Hollywood, has appeared to deepen the sense of anger in Hollywood -- to a degree.
A major outdoor fund-raiser on Sept. 16, sponsored by the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, which supports liberal issues and politicians, was sold out even before the invitations were printed, and hundreds of people are being turned away. But Danny Goldberg, a senior vice president of Atlantic Records and the chairman of the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California, said, "With all respect to the committee, I think the main reason it was sold out is because Barbra Streisand is going to sing."
 
A Rock and a Gauntlet
 Several Hollywood power brokers said the attacks by Mr. Quayle were only one reason for the surge of interest and involvement in the campaign.
Today, for example, David Geffen, the millionaire businessman and record producer, had lunch with Mr. Clinton in Little Rock, Ark., and made plans to raise more money for the candidate. "Everyone feels this is a very crucial election not so much because the Republicans are attacking Hollywood, but because of the state of the economy, the cities, the homelessness, the poverty and the total lack of concern by this Administration," said Mr. Geffen, speaking from his private plane en route to New York.
Barry Diller, the former chairman of Fox Inc., and one of the central figures in town, said of the Quayle attacks: "It would take a dumbbell not to have this big a rock hit him and not think actively about politics this time around. It's not that this community acts with particular responsibility running through its pores. But to generically indict it is much more than questionable.
"The issue isn't cultural elitism. The issue, really, is what are the responsibilities of this community as it regards sex and violence. Those are valid issues deserving of an awful lot of thought. They deserve to be raised, but not this way, not this way at all."
Bob Burkett, the senior vice president for corporate affairs for Interscope, a movie and record production company, and an important Hollywood fund-raiser for the Democrats, said: "No question that gauntlet has been laid down to this community. We've decided to pick it up."
And Marge Tabankin, the executive director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, said: "The community feels targeted. It's created a chill and fear reminiscent of the 50's. Let's face it: We feel we're being used as whipping boys."

Antitrust Trial Resumes

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
An economist argued in Minneapolis that damage claims made by eight players in their antitrust suit against the league were not sensible, and he said the players were not damaged by the Plan B system. BRUCE OWEN, an economist hired by the owners, said the $4 million damage claim made by the players' economist, MICHAEL GLASSMAN, was incorrectly measured.
The trial resumed yesterday morning after a weeklong break while Judge DAVID DOTY attended to another case. The eight plaintiffs were free agents in 1990 but were protected by their teams under the league's Plan B system. 
 The plaintiffs argue that Plan B unfairly blocked them from negotiating with other teams. No protected players have changed teams under Plan B. Using Glassman's estimates, the eight players would have received an average salary $500,000 higher than their 1990 contracts in an open market.

HEADLINE: Guatemala Peace Moves Need Support

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Any human-rights movement, however tentative, between the Guatemalan Government and the guerrillas is good news ("Guatemalan Rivals in Rights Accord," news article, Aug. 9).
I traveled to Guatemala in a Witness for Peace delegation last month and met with a variety of human rights activists and campesinos. According to people I talked with, the military and Government are carrying out a bloody campaign of repression against indigenous people. For many campesinos, the civil defense patrols have come to be the symbol of repression, dominance and control by the Government over their lives. 
 The patrols may be voluntary on paper, but in reality, they are not. I talked with men who said that they had no choice but to participate in them. If they refused, they were labeled subversive and subjected, with their families and villages, to further Government terror or repression.
I witnessed a miracle, though. One small village in the highlands of Huehuetenango had succeeded 18 months earlier in reclaiming its rights under the Constitution and has been able to resist the army and stop participating in the patrol. This one example gave me much hope. However, it is a rare instance where the Government has honored the rights of campesinos regarding the patrols.
That is why the negotiations between the Government and the guerrillas are so important. The United States -- which is in part responsible for the existence of the patrols because our Central Intelligence Agency backed the coup in 1954 that led to the war -- can now help. I urge our Government to continue suspension of military aid to Guatemala, and to condition economic aid upon demonstrated progress in respect for human rights in Guatemala.
Such actions will send a strong message to the Guatemalan Government and thereby encourage human rights progress. We must support these negotiations in whatever way possible, so that the Guatemalan Government and the guerrillas can move forward and forge peace for their country.

HEADLINE: Family Values and the K.K.K.

BYLINE: By Diane McWhorter; Diane McWhorter is writing a book about race in Birmingham, Ala.

 BODY:
I entered a time warp recently while listening to a tape recording of a political rally in May 1963.
The 29-year-old celebrations of "family values" playing in my earphones were strangely similar to the sentiments expressed at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago. 
 There were tributes to God ("We need to go back to the old-time religion") and wives ("I wonder how the ladies can sit there across that breakfast table anymore and [not] ask your husband, Now what are you doing in this fight? Don't you love our children?") There was a good cop-bad cop format that paired bland civic pieties with apocalyptic denunciations of Communists, journalists and Democrats.
The 1963 spectacle was a Ku Klux Klan rally in Birmingham, Ala.
Family values was the centerpiece of the old Klan ideology. The knights of the Fiery Cross were America's ultimate "religious warriors." They insisted that their anti-black terrorist mandate came from G-O-D.
This year, race has not yet emerged as hot campaign demagogy, thanks to the Democrats' own unabashed courtship of the white vote.
The Republicans have thus been forced to spray their birdshot on everyone who is, you know, "different." And in its aversion to difference, the religious right-wing of the Republican Party has less in common with the Klan of the 1960's than with the Klan of the 1920's. The nationwide phenomenon then punished anyone not certified as "100 percent American." Even President Warren Harding joined up.
The Klan's favorite quarry was Catholics, who were presumed to be carrying out a plan to make America a Vatican colony by destroying the monogamous Protestant family. This, evidently, gave license to lurid anti-Catholic propaganda, as in one Georgia politician's assertion that the bishop of Savannah kept a pen of white sex slaves.
A Freudian dynamic was born again: The nighttime missions of the Klansmen were vicarious indulgences in vice, in the name of virtue. They shone flashlights into cars on lovers lanes and wreaked vigilante justice on, for example, a man who dug a tunnel under a public school restroom to spy on girls. Today's family-values voyeurs need look no further than the newsstand for the righteous thrill of catching a Presidential candidate in flagrante delicto.
Just as cheap titillation is an understudy for genuine passion, so can a political party's sophomoric mischief be a substitute for moral passion. Members of the Republican Party's youth arm hit on a sublime outlet for ideologically correct prurience when they trailed Nina Totenberg, a National Public Radio correspondent, around the convention floor, asking her if she had had an affair.
Patriotic high jinks have historically been a diversion from the more spirit-deadening requirements of America's real business. Employers encouraged the culture police of the 1920's because white antipathy for hyphenated Americans was excellent insurance against unionization.
Similarly, the Republicans of the 1980's were able to persuade non-immigrant working people to reject their natural allies, in a backlash that still goes by the label "Reagan Democrats." But in the 1990's bust economy, can the limp bait of family values seduce them anew into identifying with the privileged minority?
The Klan of the 1920's collapsed when one of its leaders -- the Indiana Grand Dragon -- was convicted of the rape and murder of a young woman. The Republican Party of 1992 won't need so grotesque a hypocrisy to show how corrupt the ideology of "family values" can be.

No Pressure? No Problem. New Tires Run Flat.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
For years, tire companies have sought to produce a passenger-car tire that would continue to run even after deflating. But the race among the world's giant tire producers recently grew more intense when both the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan announced the separate development of what they call run-flat tires.
Bridgestone's tires, which require special wheels, are currently available on some customized Chevrolet Corvette models. Goodyear, which apparently hurried to make its announcement after Bridgestone introduced its run-flat tire, says its version will work with regular rims. But Goodyear is not expected to have its tires on the market until late next year.
 
 
An Earlier Version
 The notion of such a product -- a tire that will carry a passenger car 50 to 200 miles or so after being deflated -- is not new. Continental A.G., the German tire company, tested one eight years ago on certain Mercedes-Benz models. But that product would also have required the auto makers to build a special wheel, a prospect the car companies dismissed as too costly. 
 Many industry analysts and experts are now questioning whether the new tires will be widely accepted. They contend that there is enough demand for run-flat tires, but that the expense of retooling cars with new wheels would serve as a deterrent. At the right price, however, consumers may be receptive, because the product would virtually eliminate the need to change a tire along a busy highway or at some other inconvenient place.
The typical passenger-car tire uses air pressure to support the car's weight. In a run-flat tire, the sidewalls are about 50 percent thicker to help support the weight when the tire deflates.
 
 
55 Miles an Hour
 Bridgestone says its run-flat tire, the Expedia, can take a car at least 50 miles at a speed of 55 miles an hour once the tire has deflated. Goodyear said its Eagle Extended Mobility Tire, to be introduced by 1994, would be capable of running 200 miles after it lost its air, at a speed of 55 miles an hour.
The Bridgestone tire, which was jointly developed by the research and development staffs in both Japan and in the United States, calls for a special rubber compound and a low-pressure support insert. The insert enables the tire to keep its strength to support the weight of the car when the air has seeped out of the tire. The tire is held in place by a special double-beaded rim.
"Without the special rim, the tire could come unseated while operating without air," said Richard W. Brennan, a product specialist with Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., the Nashville-based American unit of the Bridgestone Corporation. "That would make it more dangerous in turning corners. You would have a lot less vehicle control."
Bridgestone's run-flat tire also includes a low-pressure sensor mounted on the rim that sends a radio signal to the dashboard, where a light will alert the driver whenever a tire's air pressure drops to less than 25 pounds a square inch. The Goodyear tire also has an electronic sensor that can tell the driver when air has seeped out of the tire.
The distance a car can travel with a deflated tire depends on the speed, the number of corners a driver must turn and the outside temperature. "As rubber heats up, it deteriorates," Mr. Brennan said. "When the rubber is heated, there is a chemical reaction that can break down the strength of the rubber."
Typically, when a tire runs flat the rolling resistance causes friction that generates a large amount of heat, causing the rubber to break down and the tire to be ruined. With the run-flat tire, the rubber insert supports the load, although the tire will still appear flat. The new tires also use a special rubber compound that not only generates less heat, but also enables the tire to withstand greater heat.
For now, Bridgestone said, its tire is being offered only by distributors of the Calloway Corvette, a special high-performance version of the sports car. The cost of the package, including four tires, four wheels and the air-pressure-sensor system, is about $5,000. Bridgestone said the tires should be available for luxury touring cars like the Lexus and Mercedes within three years.
The Goodyear tire will differ from Bridgestone's chiefly in that it will not require a specially constructed wheel. Goodyear said its run-flat tire could be used on any standard wheel, making the system much less expensive, although it will not disclose the likely price.
Donald L. Knight, director of devlopment for original-equipment tires at Goodyear, said, "Our tire has been designed to maintain itself to the wheel at zero-inflation pressure." He said the wide design of the tire and the modified design of a mold ring -- used in the process of "curing" it when it was made -- prevented the tire from coming off the wheel when it was flat. Indeed, because of the construction of the tire and the stiffness of the sidewalls, it is never truly "flat," even when depleted of air.
 
Vague About the Details
 "It's a tighter, more secure fit," Mr. Knight said, declining to be more specific. "The exact details on how that happens is the part that's patented," he said.
Goodyear has been noticeably vague in outlining the details of its new tire, saying that it will be "available on an upcoming American performance car," but not providing a hint about which one. The company also declined to say when the tire would be available, although many analysts predicted it would be on some 1994-model sports cars.
Mr. Knight of Goodyear said that the technology could fit on lightweight vehicles that have tires with shorter sidewalls, as opposed to large family and luxury cars. "The smaller the distance between the wheel and the road, the more apt this type of tire could be used," he said. "The taller it is, the more difficult the design would be."
 
 
Unlikely to Spread Fast
 Harry W. Millis, an independent tire-company analyst in Cleveland, says the Goodyear tire has a good chance of being accepted by car makers because it requires no change in the design of the wheel. "If the technology is not too expensive, the Goodyear tire has a good chance," Mr. Millis said. But, he added, it is unlikely that the Goodyear run-flat tire "will move out of the sports car area any time soon."
Although he expects wider applications eventually, "the car makers don't move very quickly." He added, "I expect it will be five to 10 years before it finds wide usage."
Mr. Millis considers the prospects for the Bridgestone to be less bright. "Obviously, a $5,000 set of tires and wheels are not going to find a major market," he said. "It may be more difficult than they expect."

HEADLINE: Insurers' Florida Tab: $7.3 Billion

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The first formal survey of the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Florida has found that the insurance industry will pay out an estimated $7.3 billion in claims, making it by far the most expensive catastrophe ever for insurers in the United States.
The insured losses, calculated by an industry group that specializes in estimating the cost of catastrophes, are more than 70 percent higher than the losses caused by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. They do not include, however, a host of uninsured losses, ranging from the damage to electrical systems in Dade County to the costs of calling out the military. 
 Although paying out more than $7 billion is certain to cause a great deal of pain for dozens of companies, analysts said the $160 billion industry has more than adequate capital to meet the claims and that the losses reported today were in line with expectations earlier in the week. Andrew, they said, is unlikely to cause solvency problems for any leading property and casualty insurers.
 
'Awfully Big Number'
 "By anybody's count this is an awfully big number," said G. Alan Zimmermann, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "But the one thing this industry is very effective at is spreading risks. The system will be able to handle this."
Previous estimates of the damage caused by Andrew in Florida were made up largely of guesses by officials in charge of emergency services on the scene and have generally ranged from $15 billion to $30 billion. Today's announcement was a preliminary tally of only part of that damage conducted by teams who have surveyed the destruction in five Florida counties on the ground and from the air. The survey did not include the cost of damage to the area's infrastructure, the cost of relief and other government programs, the cost to uninsured businesses and homes, nor did it include the toll for agriculture or any losses in Louisiana.
According to Gary R. Kerney, the director of catastrophe services for the property claim service division of the American Insurance Services Group, the tightly compact storm brought its most severe damage in Dade County, where the total insured losses reached $6 billion. The total of damages in Broward, Palm Beach, Monroe and Collier Counties was $1.3 billion he said. Mr. Kerney added that approximately 685,000 claims were expected to be filed.
The organization made a similar estimate of $3.9 billion for the damages caused by Hurricane Hugo shortly after what was then the most expensive hurricane in American history hit South Carolina in 1989. That number was later revised to $4.2 billion, or $4.5 billion in 1992 dollars, in insured losses. Those insured damages are believed to be less than half of what was perhaps more than $10 billion in total destruction.
So far in Florida, however, the sheer size of the devastated area and the lack of street signs or working telephones for most policyholders have limited the ability of companies to process claims and estimate the size of their individual company losses. A spokesman for State Farm, the largest insurer in the area, with more than 20 percent of market share, said that if today's estimate held up its losses would pass $750 million. Its losses were more than $460 million in Hurricane Hugo.
Allstate, the second-largest carrier in the area, said it would announce its losses on Wednesday morning. "This is going to be high," said Wayne E. Hedien, the chairman and president of Allstate, in a telephone interview today. "But we have $8 billion in surplus and we can handle it."
Paul Schattenberg, a spokesman for U.S.A.A., a San Antonio-based insurer, said that his company estimated it would pay out $150 million in losses in Florida for Hurricane Andrew. The company paid out $107 million for Hurricane Hugo.
Hurricane Andrew is likely to raise a host of questions for individual companies as they tally up losses and calculate how much of the cost they can pass on to their own insurers -- reinsurance companies. Insurance companies and reinsurance companies have spun a spider's web of agreements to spread the costs of large catastrophes.
Among the unanswered questions today is how much of the cost will be borne by the Lloyd's of London insurance market, which has been severely shaken by several years of bad losses. Experts say that foreign reinsurers including Lloyd's and other European reinsurers may have to pay as much as 30 percent of the losses.
 
Some Tax Write-Offs
 Another mitigating effect for American insurers is that about one-third of losses can be recouped through tax write-offs. According to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, the top writers of homeowner and commercial insurance in Florida are State Farm, Allstate, Nationwide Insurance, Prudential, U.S.A.A., Chubb, Cigna, Continental, USF&G, Travelers, ITT Hartford Insurance, Fireman's Fund and Aetna.
A question that is likely to be debated for weeks to come is what the impact of the storm will be on property and casualty pricing particularly in commercial lines of insurance. Competition in many property casualty lines has forced prices to unprofitably low levels for years and the hopes of investors in recent days has been as it was immediately after Hurricane Hugo: that the losses will sap the industry's surplus capital sufficiently to force all companies in the industry to raise prices.
But many analysts and an economist, Orin Kramer, who specializes in insurance industry issues, said that the damage from Andrew alone appeared insufficient to turn prices upward. "This is a big hit," Mr. Kramer said, "but I think it might take as much as $40 billion to turn things around. I don't think this can do it alone."

HEADLINE: Stocks Up Despite Signs of Weak Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market closed marginally higher yesterday, even though several new reports gave unflattering assessments of the economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 8.91, to 3,266.26. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was a moderate 174.4 million shares, up from 160.23 million in the previous session. 
 Market analysts said they had found nothing remarkable in the new reports on construction activity, purchasing trends or leading economic indictators. "I think the market is still biding its time, waiting for some more conclusive economic data, or more conclusive election information," said Robert F. Dickey, a stock analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis.
The Commerce Department said construction activity fell by an unexpected six-tenths of 1 percent in July; economists had been looking for a five-tenths of 1 percent rise. The Government also said its chief economic forecasting tool, the index of leading economic indicators, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in July, which was expected.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of purchasing activity showed slower growth in the manufacturing sector in August.
Airlines staged the strongest advance of any industry group during the day, ahead of scheduled fare increases this weekend, but Mr. Dickey said the rise was technical.
"They've been pounded so badly," he said, referring to the devastating effects of the recession and recent fare wars. AMR was up 1 7/8 at 57 3/8; Delta Air Lines, up 2 3/8 at 52 3/8, and UAL, up 3 3/8 at 107 1/2.
Eugene Peroni, an analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said while the broader market was moving within a predictable range, a handful of stocks were advancing based on a favorable earnings outlook.
The most actively traded Big Board issue was RJR Nabisco, down 1/8 at 8 1/2. Diagnostek, a New Mexico-based mail-service pharmacy, closed unchanged at 16 1/2 in active trading after its largest competitor, New Jersey-based Medco Containment, agreed to buy Diagnostek for $436 million. Raychem gained 3 at 35, a day after the California technology company was awarded a large contract from Ameritech for fiber-optic installation in the Midwest.
Other active issues included Merck, down 3/8 at 48 1/4; and Telefonos de Mexico American depository receipts, up 1/8 at 45 1/4, and Global Marine, unchanged at 2 3/8.
Hurricane Andrew continued to be felt in the financial markets. American Reliance fell 2 5/8 at 17 5/8, a loss of 15 percent, a day after the New Jersey insurance company predicted large losses because of hurricane damage in southern Florida.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.99 at 229.02, while the American Stock Exchange's market value index was up 0.66 at 381.44.

HEADLINE: No Cookie-Cutter Answers in 'Mommy Wars';
Women Are Struggling With Their Choices About Having Jobs or Staying Home

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YORKTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
There are no maps to motherhood in 1992, so Anne Jaffe is struggling to find her way, trying to make peace with her choice to be a full-time mother rather than pursue a full-time career.
"I feel like I'm a disappointment for the women who have worked so hard to broaden opportunities for other women," said the 36-year-old Mrs. Jaffe, once a co-president of the student body at Stanford University and now a mother of two and a volunteer at the Yorktown Community Nursery School. 
 Mrs. Jaffe is on the front line of what some call "the mommy wars": conflicts that play themselves out in the minds of women, in the schools and community groups where they measure themselves against mothers who took different paths. The tensions are particularly evident in places where mothers have the economic luxury of choosing whether to stay home full time or work outside the home.
Recently the wars have spilled into the national political arena, with Marilyn Quayle championing the fact that she gave up her law career for the sake of her family, and Hillary Clinton defending her decision to combine the two.
"Each side has something to protect," said Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist who specializes in gender and family issues at New York University. "Sometimes I wonder if the war has just begun."
A survey published three years ago by Child Magazine quantified some of the tensions mothers feel. Nearly half the stay-home mothers surveyed, 49 percent, said employed mothers did not spend enough time with their children; one-fourth said employed mothers put their own needs before their children's. Among working mothers, 50 percent said they worked primarily for financial reasons but half said they would keep their jobs even if they could get their salary without working.
Even as skirmishes continue in the "mommy wars" -- a term that gained nationwide attention when it appeared in a Newsweek article in 1990 -- more mothers keep joining the work force and the older their children are, the more likely they are to have jobs outside the home. About 75 percent of those whose youngest child is under 18 work, as against 55 percent of those with children under age 3, according to a recent analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"What was a little brook has now become an ocean of women, and women with children, working," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional commissioner.
Barbara Reisman, executive director of Child Care Action Campaign, a national advocacy organization, said: "The fact that we still think about it as a mommy war says a lot about where we failed to come in terms of gender issues. Why is this about mothers? Where are the fathers?"
But it is about mothers at places like the Yorktown nursery school, a modest, red-shingled building here that houses one of the oldest parent cooperative nursery schools in the state. While at least one parent from every family is required to take part in everything that goes on at the school, from classroom work, to fund-raisers, to maintenance and renovations, the mothers are the ones who most often carry the load, even in families where both parents work outside the home.
There are no Murphy Browns here. The women are married, ranging in age from their 30's to their early 40's, from families that can afford to wrestle with the question of whether the mother needs to bring home a paycheck. Most are college educated and held jobs outside the home before their children were born.
The subject of mothers and work is rarely debated openly at the nursery school, which has an enrollment of 76. The talk that swirled around the noisy playroom on a recent morning concerned play dates, a child's ear infection that kept a mother up all night, and how women must stick together in a world controlled by men.
But in separate interviews with three of the women, the discussion was more candid, reflecting the struggles and the complexities of their lives: one as a full-time mother, one as a mother with her own business, one who straddles those two worlds by working part time.
 
Career Aspirations Instilled by Father
 Laurie Hander Leahy is the mother of 5-year-old Max and a caterer, a career she began dreaming about when she was 12. "My entire life is not about watching his first step," she said. "My life is about him but also working."
Economic freedom has always been one of her goals. When she and her husband, Richard, the owner of several appliance stores in Westchester County, decided to have a child, it was only after they agreed they could afford, first, a 24-hour baby nurse to feed and change diapers, and then a live-in nanny.
"I knew I would never stay home full time with a child," said Ms. Leahy, who is 37. "There are times I have regretted it. I've missed a lot. Sometimes I think, 'Wouldn't this be great to spend more time and be here?' But you can't have both."
Ten days after her son was born, she drove her red BMW convertible back to Food Fantasies Catering Company in Harrison, N.J., where being owner sometimes requires her to work more than 100 hours a week.
Ms. Leahy considers herself "a father's daughter," much like her friend, Mrs. Jaffe, and says that has a lot to do with her goals.
"My father treated us as he would have treated boys," said Ms. Leahy, the daughter of an accountant in West Orange, N.J., and a mother who raised three girls. "He encouraged the same education, the same aspirations for career. What he taught us was that working hard was a good thing and I interpreted working as working outside the home. I never thought about being a mom. In the back of my mind, I figured one day eventually, it would come with the territory of being female."
It is the little things, Ms. Leahy said, that bring out the differences between mothers who stay at home and mothers who are employed, things like how much they talk about domestic issues and children. For the last two years, she worked on the nursery school's financial committee and was the driving force behind a raffle that set records for the school, raising $3,000 each year.
"They had ridiculously low goals and I pushed them," she said. "They just weren't realistic in dealing with money because they're not making it."
 
Others' Confidence Feeds Self-Doubt
 Mrs. Jaffe, who was the head of the school's fund-raising committee at the time, acknowledged that there was some surprise about Ms. Leahy's approach, but she said it was not a cause of dissension.
"We all sort of looked at her like, 'Now that's a new thought,' " Mrs. Jaffe said. "It wasn't that we were unrealistic. The school just got in a pattern of selling tickets to friends and family. And she said, 'We can make it much bigger. You guys are treating this like peanuts.' People were excited."
The seemingly breezy confidence of employed mothers like Ms. Leahy is at times intimidating to Mrs. Jaffe, not, she says, because of anything the women say but because of her own doubts. In the "mommy wars," she said, her worst enemy is herself.
"I feel very awkward going to a party and meeting a woman with a high-powered career who also has children," said Mrs. Jaffe, who has seen a therapist about her feelings about motherhood. "If the working mom's children are behaving beautifully and my children are being very rude or bratty, I feel like there's an expectation out there; if you're going to spend full time with children, they should show better behavior, they should be exemplary. I find myself literally becoming livid at my children, not because their behavior was so outrageous but because I felt humiliated. I feel like somehow this is my job."
But what she perceives in Ms. Leahy, a sense of self worth derived from working, has not erased Ms. Leahy's doubts about how she succeeds as a mother.
Recalling a recent weekend in the Hamptons with her son, she said: "I saw him respond to me being there all day long. I think children react to the harried schedules that working moms have. It's a conflict when you're staking new territory. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't."
 
The Pull of Work, The Pull of Home
 Bobbi Ornstein has tried to reconcile the conflict by working part time. "I didn't want to be away from him so much," the 42-year-old physical therapist said of her 3-year-old son, Douglas. "He might adjust to it better than I would but it would be hard for me."
Mrs. Ornstein works, she said, because she and her husband, Robert, a psychoanalyst, can use the money. And she has little sympathy for women who are not driven to work full time by economic necessity.
"Since mothers haven't been working full time for that many years, we have yet to see the results of the upbringing of the children," she said. "We don't know what these children are going to be like but it's hard to imagine it's going to be terrific."
Mrs. Ornstein grew up in a middle-class family in the Mill Basin neighborhood of Brooklyn, where her father was a textile salesman and her mother stayed at home to raise her.
"Although I wasn't a strong feminist, I did believe I would work, but I would do it differently than my mother did," Mrs. Ornstein said. "She was a very dependent person and I never wanted to be in that position. I wanted to do everything to counter that."
Mrs. Ornstein considers herself a late bloomer in many ways. She started her career as a physical therapist after her first marriage ended when she was in her late-20's. She was married for the second time at age 36. She gave birth to Douglas at age 39.
It was not until she was pregnant that she realized how strongly she felt about devoting time to motherhood, even though she said she loved her work.
"I guess something happened from the time that I was pregnant and he was born that changed my thinking," she said. "I couldn't leave this baby full time. It was too important to me. I couldn't leave him with a stranger."
 
Show and Tell And Cookie Jars
 Mrs. Jaffe was a career women and, at the nursery school, it is the mothers who have full-time careers with whom Mrs. Jaffe most identifies herself, at least in her own head.
"I'm my father's daughter and I always pictured myself having a very interesting career," said Mrs. Jaffe, who describes her father as a hard-driving man who was a vice president of an international contracting company.
She used to be a political campaign consultant in California, and was starting a software consulting business -- the business cards were already printed -- when she decided to stay at home to raise her daughter, now 7, and her son, 5.
"I'd wake up in the morning and I'd look at my daughter and I'd look at the list of phone calls I was supposed to make and they didn't seem that important."
Now her life is more like that of her mother, a homemaker who raised 12 children.
"A lot of women take stock of what their man is about, whether he has a lot of drive, and we fill the vacuum left," said Mrs. Jaffe, whose husband is a research manager for International Business Machines. "I know some whose husbands have very little drive and initiative so the women develop really good careers. My husband has a lot of drive and I fill in the space where he isn't. The hidden thing is that even those of us who are feminists tend to respond to the needs of others."
Mrs. Jaffe said she tends to gravitate these days to women who also stay at home, "only because I still feel a little inadequate with women who have a career, especially when I hear about their jobs."
"It's like show-and-tell time," she said, "and I don't have anything to show and tell."
At the nursery school, Mrs. Jaffe and the other mothers agree that the "show and tell" of real life is much more ambiguous than the lines being drawn in the Presidential campaign, that the choices facing mothers are complex ones, and that even the question of cookies can produce second-guessing about their lives.
Mrs. Jaffe says that for her one of the rewards of motherhood is the look on her children's faces when she is baking, particularly if the cookies are oatmeal and chocolate chip.
But that doesn't stop her from empathizing with mothers who pick up cookies at the grocery on their way home from work.
"Everybody is doing their best and everybody wants to know their best is right, too," she said.

"I feel like I'm a disappointment for the women who have worked so hard to broaden opportunities for other women," she said. But Mrs. Jaffe also said that for her one of the rewards of motherhood is just seeing the look on her children's faces when she is baking. (Susan Harris for The New York Times) (pg.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds And C.D.'s Dip in Yield

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit slipped another notch in the week that ends today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a Florida-based interest rate publication.
The publication said banks were setting rates in a narrow range and waiting for the Government to make another economic assessment. "Thus far the indicators have all been mediocre at best, but the next employment report could shed more light," The Monitor said. 
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, rates were up slightly for the second consecutive week. Interest rate watchers consider the auction a reliable barometer of how banks could eventually set rates for depositors in the weeks ahead.
The average rate at auction for a three-month bill this week rose 3 basis points, to 3.17 percent, while the rate for a six-month bill rose 2 basis points, to 3.26 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Money Market Yield: 2.98%
 Robert J. Hutchinson, managing director of retail consumer marketing for Chemical Bank, said he saw no increase in rates over the short run, but noted that analysts and economists expected rates to move up in the next year or so. "But if they do, it still won't be the type of increase that will make depositors happy," he said.
While he acknowledgedthat some depositors had left banks to seek higher rates elsewhere, Mr. Hutchinson said, "There are still a substantial number of bank depositors who remain because of the security and safety afforded in short-term liquid bank accounts."
The combined average yields at New York area banks in the latest week posted small declines, with a money market account down 2 basis points, to 2.98 percent, and the yield on three- and six-month certificates slipping a basis point, to 3.03 percent and 3.23 percent, respectively.
At commercial banks the yield on a money market account was off 2 basis points, to 2.82 percent, while a three-month certificate was unchanged at 2.91 percent and a six-month certificate was off one basis point, to 3.06 percent.
Depositors at savings banks saw yields on money market accounts fall 2 basis points, to 3.14 percent, and a three-month certificate slip a basis point, to 3.17 percent. The yield on a six-month C.D. was 2 basis points lower at 3.39 percent.
 
Largest Changes
 The largest adjustments of yields in the New York area were at First Nationwide, which dropped its money market yield by 15 basis points, to 3 percent, at Anchor Savings where the three-month C.D. fell 10 basis points, to 3.15 percent, and at Home Savings of America, where a six-month C.D. was also down by 10 basis points, to 3.25 percent.
Outside the New York market, the yields at 20 large banks were down a basis point, with an average bank money market account at 2.89 percent and a six-month C.D. at 3.11 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Sept. 2, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on th method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar at Low Against Mark As Officials Do Not Intervene

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
The dollar sank to another low against the German mark yesterday, stung by another round of negative economic news and left undefended by central banks, which chose not to intervene in world currency markets. The dollar also approached an all-time low against the Japanese yen.
In late trading, the dollar dropped to 1.3903 marks, down from 1.4030 on Monday, and falling through the 1.40 level for the first time since Germany's modern currency was established after World War II. It was the fourth time in 10 days that the dollar set a successive low against the mark. 
 Traders and analysts described yesterday's fall as a gradual and orderly extension of the long decline that the dollar began in April, as the yawning discrepancy between interest rates in the United States and Germany fed a growing stream of international funds from dollars into marks. An investment in three-month bonds in Germany now earns 9.75 percent, while a similar investment in the United States nets only 3.14 percent.
"It's a gradual chipping away by interbank traders who don't have much incentive to buy dollars," said David Gilmore, senior foreign exchange analyst at MCM Currency Watch. "I don't think anybody sees the dollar going into free fall."
After the index of leading economic indicators showed only anemic growth in July, the dollar fell to 122.84 yen, close to the yen's all-time low of 121.05 yen set in November 1988, and down from 123.05 yen on Monday. The British pound also gained ground against the dollar, moving to 2.0020, up from $1.9880.
Mr. Gilmore and other analysts said the calm, if pessimistic, nature of yesterday's currency markets reflected a decision not to intervene by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, which tried repeatedly to prop up the dollar last month.
"The central banks have retreated on intervention because it won't work at this point," Mr. Gilmore said. "They're going to let the market find a bottom on its own."
Efforts by the Fed to actively buy dollars, he said, would increase the market's volatility as traders try to anticipate sudden increases or drops, which then become steeper with the increased activity. Without any sign of intervention yesterday, traders watched the dollar drift downward slowly, bottoming at 1.3895 and rebounding to 1.3903 by 4:30 P.M.
Robert White, senior vice president of Interstate Bank, said market fundamentals like the interest-rate differential, a weak American economy, and political uncertainty in an election year all pointed toward an ever-lower dollar.
"The only favorable point for the dollar is intervention," Mr. White said. "And that isn't coming right now."
Mr. White noted that the dollar's fall has not markedly affected the stock and bond markets, which are of more concern to Washington than is the dollar.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Buy Russian Bomb Uranium

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The United States announced on Monday that it had agreed in principle to buy billions of dollars' worth of bomb-grade uranium from scrapped Soviet nuclear arms in an attempt to bolster the shaky Russian economy and to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents and theft.
The agreement, which would require the formal approval of both Governments, calls for highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear arms to be diluted for sale as commercial reactor fuel. It would be the first such agreement, and, if approved, would be a big step to reducing the dangers that made the cold war so unnerving. 
 "It's a big deal," said Barry Daniel, director of public affairs for the Energy Department, which will buy the uranium. "This provides a way to move the highly enriched uranium from nuclear weapons dismantled in Russia into this country and to keep it out of the wrong hands. It also provides capital to Russia, and part of the proceeds go to increasing the safety of nuclear reactors over there. It's a win-win situation."
The agreement was announced by the White House after months of secretive negotiations. In a statement, President Bush said it "illustrates how foreign policy accomplishments can promote our domestic economic well-being while making the world a safer place to live."
The agreement calls for the United States to buy at least 80 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, with no less than 10 metric tons being bought in each of the first five years and no less than 30 metric tons thereafter. Private experts said that at prevailing market prices, that might amount to $5 billion or more over the period of the agreement. The experts generally praised the agreement.
"It's very significant," said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private Washington group. "It doesn't prevent them from making new material. But what it does do, which is very good, is to remove a lot of excess weapons material from storage facilities that would otherwise be available for theft or sale to third parties."
 
Natural Ore, Enriched
 Natural uranium ore is made up of a mix of isotopes, or forms of the same element with different atomic weights. Less than 1 percent of it is uranium 235, the fissionable isotope used in bombs and reactors. Uranium for most American nuclear power reactors is enriched to a level of about 3 percent uranium 235, while fuel for bombs in enriched by more than 90 percent.
The agreement would basically reverse that enrichment process, diluting uranium 235 from bombs with natural uranium for use in commercial nuclear power plants.
Early this year, the Russians lined up several American companies that were eager to dilute highly enriched Russian uranium from warheads and to sell it as reactor fuel. And they repeatedly lobbied for the plan with Federal officials.
In July, Viktor N. Mikhailov, head of Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, discussed the potential sale of Russian uranium in Washington with top officials of the Energy Department, which oversees the nation's production of nuclear arms and civilian reactor fuel.
Among the American companies eager to make agreements are Allied-Signal Inc., an aerospace and chemicals company based in Morristown, N.J., which signed a preliminary agreement with the Russians.
"We think it is a terrific agreement," said David G. Powell, senior vice president for public affairs of Allied-Signal. "Basically this is the beginning of a very productive arrangement by which we would in essence beat swords into plowshares."
 
Interim Pact in July
 Allied-Signal and Nuclear Fuel Services of Erwin, Tenn., signed an interim agreement with Russian officials in July to buy 11 tons of highly enriched uranium by mid-1993, with similar amounts each year thereafter. No price was disclosed at the time.
A big question is whether Russian bomb-grade uranium can be sold without significantly driving down prices on world uranium markets.
Already, the cash-starved Russians have sold large amounts of natural and mildly enriched uranium in Western markets, feeding a price decline that has driven some uranium producers out of business and threatened the uranium enrichment business of the Energy Department, the world's largest supplier of commercial reactor fuel.
 
No Budget Impact Seen
 Mr. Daniel, the Energy Department spokesman, said American uranium purchases would have no impact on the overall Federal budget because of money recouped from resales and from large savings in the department's own enrichment program.
The White House said the purchases "would have no adverse impact on American consumers or jobs in the uranium mining or processing industries." It said the Energy Department would use the uranium to reduce the electricity costs at its enrichment installations.
The cost of the purchases, Mr. Daniel said, will be "in the billions, but I can't put a specific number on it." He added that the purchases would probably occur over 10 to 20 years.
By having the Energy Department make the purchases, the Government apparently wants to insure that the sudden influx of new material does not throw prices on the world uranium market into decline.
Dr. Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the agreement "favored the mining industry over the consumer, because the alternative would be to sell it on the open market, which would reduce the prices of uranium and electricity."

HEADLINE: Fixing Corporate America's Short-Term Mind-Set

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Business school professors tend to be an anonymous breed, and their research is often denigrated as a blend of big words and small ideas. Yet Michael E. Porter of the Harvard Business School stands out as a genuine star. When he speaks, people in business, finance and government listen -- frequently paying handsomely to do so. He commands up to $25,000 a lecture.
Mr. Porter's three major books on economic and corporate competitiveness are footnote-filled doorstop tomes, but roughly a half a million copies have been sold. His instructional videos sell like hotcakes. Besides business clients, he has increasingly worked as a brain for hire, with clients including New Zealand, Canada and the Basque region of Spain. He did a pro bono study of the Massachusetts economy last year that helped shape the thinking beind the cost-cutting and business development programs of the state's Republican Governor, William F. Weld. 
 The 45-year-old professor's current subject of choice is why the American financial system puts the nation's companies at a competitive disadvantage, and what can be done to correct the problem. And over breakfast at the Charles Hotel here, Mr. Porter held forth at length on that topic with an energetic earnestness one might expect from a man whose Who's Who entry includes a 95-word italicized "mission" statement ("My work has sought to make a positive impact . . .).
 
2-Year Study of Issue
 Mr. Porter has just finished as research director for a two-year study of the issue jointly commissioned by the Harvard Business School and the Council on Competitiveness, a private group of executives, academics and union officials. Twenty-five heavyweight scholars, from Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist of the World Bank, to Alfred D. Chandler Jr., the Pulitzer prize-winning business historian, were signed up to do original research. A summary was published in late June, and Mr. Porter testified before the Senate Banking Committee. He has written a Harvard Business Review article entitled "Capital Disadvantage: America's Failing Capital Investment System" and a book is planned for next year.
In 1990, the assignment from the council -- headed by John Young, president of the Hewlett-Packard Company, and George Fisher, chairman of Motorola Inc. -- was to explain the short-term perspective of American industry. The complaint of America's corporate myopia has simmered for two decades, with plenty of anecdotal evidence and no shortage of purported explanations ranging from corporate America's emphasis on quarterly earnings performance to a national culture of instant gratification.
But before long, the direction of the study shifted somewhat. "We started out to look at time horizons, but it quickly became apparent that that was the wrong question," Mr. Porter explained. "The much broader problem is the American system of allocating investment capital, and it's a system that is threatening the competitiveness of American companies and the long-term growth of the American economy."
The study has marshaled some fairly compelling evidence to support the contention that American managers do make fewer long-term investments than their peers in Japan or Europe. For example, one research paper was a survey of roughly 300 large companies worldwide that found that American companies considered 21 percent of their investment projects long term, meaning no profits were expected during the first five years of the project. By contrast, the Japanese companies said 47 percent of their investments were long term, and the Europeans said 61 percent were.
 
Americans Outpaced
 American corporate profitability is higher than in Germany or Japan. But, as the study documents, there seems to be little direct connection between higher corporate profits and long-term returns to shareholders. Japanese shareholders have achieved higher returns (primarily in long-term capital gains) than holders of American shares for the last two decades, and German shareholders have outpaced Americans for more than a decade.
The explanation, Mr. Porter suggests, is that by demanding high near-term profits the American system is counterproductive, sapping growth by lowering American investment to rates far below Japan and Germany. And the additional investment in Japan and Germany has paid off for everyone in the long term -- shareholders, workers, companies and the economy.
Mr. Porter calls the American capital system "fluid," with the ownership of companies increasingly fragmented and transient. Institutional shareholders like pension funds and mutual funds have increased their share of corporate equity from 8 percent in 1950 to nearly 60 percent in 1990.
However, because of laws and regulations that prod the funds to be prudent and spread their investment risks, the big institutions each typically hold small stakes of a percent or so in hundreds or even thousands of different companies. And they trade with increasing frequency; the average holding period of stocks has declined from more than 7 years in 1960 to 1.9 years today.
 
Dedicated Investment Systems
 Japan and Germany, according to Mr. Porter, have dedicated capital systems. In these highly competitive nations, banks, related companies and friendly institutions own the controlling stakes in major companies, and hold those stakes for years. Granted, share prices in these countries can be volatile, as the long slide in the Japanese market demonstrates. But the long-term stakeholders are not traders, so corporate managers are not so eager to please the stock market.
"In Japan and Germany, the traded capital market is decoupled from management behavior," Mr. Porter said.
The Porter solution is to make the American system more like the dedicated setups abroad. Even in America, he says, there are models that point the way. Permanent family ownership in companies mimics the patient capital of a dedicated system, with the benefits evident in success stories like Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Cargill and Hallmark. And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is cited as Mr. Porter's ideal institutional investor, taking big stakes in companies and betting for the long haul.
Mr. Porter would prod the rest of corporate America in that direction with regulatory and tax changes. Among other things, he would allow banks and other companies to hold large stakes in corporations, sit on the boards and even share insider information, as long as the recipients sign agreements not to trade on that information for a year or so. He would shift the capital gains tax so that the rate declines over time as an investor holds onto shares.
 
Favoring Long Term
 "These steps would go a long way to change the fundamental goals in the American system," Mr. Porter said. "They would give management a set of signals that are more aligned with the long-term health of companies instead of the current stock price."
Mr. Porter's notion of encouraging institutional investors to behave more like owners meshes with the recent trend of big investors to become more vocal on issues like executive pay. And the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed in June to allow big investors to talk to each other about a company whose shares they hold without having to report the communication.
Yet Mr. Porter is calling for a big change, not piecemeal evolution. To skeptics, his vision of American companies being controlled by groups of big institutional investors, each holding 5 or 10 percent stakes, looks like a 21st-century version of a smoke-filled railroad cars of the robber baron days.
Legislative efforts to allow such big holdings, they say, would face stiff political resistance. "It just goes right against the grain of the fear of concentrated power in America," said Robert Glauber, a former under secretary of the Treasury who is now a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
 
Investors Seem Reluctant
 Mr. Porter replies that with the American economy challenged in an era of global competition, times have changed and attitudes are shifting as well. "This is not the closed world of the 20's and 30's anymore," he said.
Key players in the Porter vision would be institutional investors, but they sound reluctant to go as far as Mr. Porter would like. The California Public Employees Retirement System has about one-third of its assets of $67 billion in equities. It has invested in roughly 1,000 companies, typically holding 2 percent or less in each company. The pension fund is studying whether it should take larger holdings in fewer companies.
"The problem is that when you place bigger bets on fewer companies, you increase your risk," said DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer. "I don't think we can all be Warren Buffetts."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Squeeze Hurts A Health Niche

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
PROFITING from pressures to get patients out of expensive hospital beds quickly, companies that provide intravenous nutrition and drugs in the home have been on a roll. Sales of these so-called home-infusion companies tripled in three years to $3.2 billion in 1991 and may reach $4 billion this year, analysts said.
But when health-care stocks began slipping early this year, some high-flying home-infusion stocks were hit even harder. Many investors who thought the economy would pick up this year switched from health care to cyclical stocks like autos and chemicals. 
 Companies like Baxter International's Caremark division, Critical Care America and T<2> Medical Inc. can provide hundreds of intravenous therapies, notably to treat cancer and AIDS patients. About 100 new home therapies are approved each year. The pace should quicken as more products of biotechnology move out of the laboratories.
Baxter, a diversified hospital supply company, plans to spin off Caremark later this year as a separate entity that will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Caremark, with about $775 million in 1991 home-infusion and related sales, dominates a market served by 10 medium-sized companies and dozens of small mom-and-doc partnerships. Baxter, which has been selling at 18 times 1991 earnings, hopes to push Caremark into the home-infusion league, where Critical Care America shares soared to 30 times earnings.
Critical Care, which has about 8 percent of the infusion market, plunged to $33.875 from a high of $63.75 in January. It closed yesterday at $35.625, off 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, based in Westboro, Mass., took extra lumps when Massachusetts Blue Cross and Blue Shield chose lower-bidding competitors (including Caremark) to serve patients with traditional insurance. Critical Care shares dipped again on the news that it planned to merge with Medical Care International, a chain of surgery centers, although many analysts praised the deal.
The home-infusion companies have already had to make price concessions to stay on the preferred list of large health maintenance organizations and other managed-care networks, just as hospitals and doctors do. But Critical Care and three other infusion companies spurned by Massachusetts Blue Cross are suing to block the practice for traditional insurance. Massachusetts tightly regulates such matters, and the outcome of the lawsuit is uncertain. The companies got the Legislature to take their side, but Gov. William F. Weld vetoed the bill in July.
T<2> Medical, based in Alpharetta, Ga., and largely owned by physicians, is one of the larger infusion companies, with about 5 percent of the market. T<2> shares dropped sharply to $17.75 from a 12-month high of $67.75 after state and Federal authorities announced they were cracking down on doctors who refer patients to their own companies. T<2> shares declined 37.5 cents yesterday, to $25, on the Big Board.
Todd Richter, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said the growing squeeze on home-infusion prices had not yet affected profits, but "people fear that this trend will hurt the earnings growth that has been expected." For the longer term, he likes Healthinfusion, based in Miami, which closed at $11.75 yesterday, up 62.5 cents, about 19 times earnings, in over-the-counter trading.
Karen Reilly at Fred Alger Management, which is holding Critical Care shares but sold some in the first quarter, said pricing pressures would eventually hurt the company's profits. But she likes the stock because, she said, "They seem to stay on the leading edge with new products and technologies."
Kenneth S. Abramowitz at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company said cost containment was an "evolutionary negative" for most health-care companies. "What matters" he added, "is whether it has enough exciting new products to offset that negative. Critical Care and Baxter do."
Randall S. Huyser at Furman Selz noted that managed health care already accounts for 20 percent of Critical Care's sales, and he estimated that this would grow by several percentage points a year. Looking at the bright side, he said that managed-care payers provide steady business, reducing marketing and billing costs.
Among infusion companies, Mr. Huyser likes Critical Care as well as several companies that trade over the counter: Total Pharmaceutical Services, a smaller, Los Angeles-based company, which has been growing through acquisitions ($19 yesterday, up 50 cents); Curaflex Health Services in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., which went public in March at $13 ($10.25 yesterday, up 25 cents), and the Homedco Group, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., which also supplies oxygen for mainly elderly home-care patients ($25.25, unchanged).
Dorothy E. Ryan at Robertson Stephens also likes Homedco and two infusion companies that provide a package of related services: Tokos Medical Corporation, based in Santa Ana, Calif., which specializes in high-risk pregnancies ($23.125, up 87.5 cents), and U.S. Homecare, based in Hartsdale, N.Y., which offers services for children and AIDS and cancer patients ($10, up 50 cents).

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
PRESIDENT PLEDGES MONEY TO REBUILD IN SOUTH FLORIDA

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Sept. 1

 BODY:
President Bush came here today and promised to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, an economic mainstay of South Florida that was virtually destroyed last week by Hurricane Andrew. In a three-hour visit this morning, he also said the Federal Government would pay almost all the costs of rebuilding public property and services in Florida.
Ordinarily the Federal Government would pay 75 percent of such costs and the affected state would pay 25 percent. Washington, however, has paid the entire cleanup bill for at least one other recent disaster, Hurricane Hugo in 1989.
 
No Estimate on Cost
 In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will issue grants of up to $11,500 to families who can prove they lack insurance for their homes or belongings or who are not being helped adequately by other emergency services. 
 Officials said they could not gauge how much the additional Federal aid would cost. "That's a figure we're not going to know for quite some time," said a spokesman for the emergency management agency, Phillip S. Cogan. But the costs of reconstructing southern Dade County threaten to dwarf the amount spent after Hurricane Hugo. Today the private insurance industry, in its first formal estimate of the storm damage, said it would have to pay out $7.3 billion in claims, compared with $4.2 billion in private claims paid after Hurricane Hugo. [Page D1.]
 
'Proud of the Spirit'
 Tonight, having returned to Washington, the President gave a brief televised speech from the Oval Office in which he described the relief effort as "unprecedented in size and impact." He urged Americans to keep donating materials like diapers, baby formula, lumber and plastic sheeting for roofs, and said more volunteers were needed for makeshift medical clinics or cleanup duty in Florida.
On his trip to Homestead, the President said: "We met doctors and firefighters spending sleepless vacations lending a helping hand. Through the eloquence of their action, I've been reminded that America will always be a nation of neighbors."
Mr. Bush, who also visited storm victims in Louisiana, was accompanied on his trip by his wife, Barbara, and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. The President praised the civilian volunteers who have borne the brunt of the reconstruction effort in south Dade County.
"I'm so proud of the spirit of the people down here," Mr. Bush said during his Florida visit, which included stops at a military field kitchen, a newly built tent settlement meant to house thousands who were left homeless, a public school now functioning as a shelter, and Homestead City Hall.
With Gov. Lawton Chiles and the bulk of the state's Congressional delegation on hand, Mr. Bush landed at the remains of Homestead Air Force Base as a half-dozen airplanes were spraying nearby neighborhoods with insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that have flourished since the storm.
The President and his entourage drove by a wrecked air control tower, a pair of ruined hangars and the rubble of military housing.
Mr. Bush's decision to rebuild the air base was greeted with applause and cheers by local residents. The base, which employs about 4,000 civilians and 4,400 military personnel, means more than $405 million a year for the local economy, according to Pentagon estimates.
But Mr. Bush's decision, which comes as military bases around the country are being closed to save money, is likely to arouse criticism elsewhere. Even some members of Florida's Congressional delegation have said they would prefer to see Homestead's functions transferred to the nine other Air Force bases in Florida.
Mr. Bush gave no estimate of how much it would cost to rebuild the base. But Gen. Merrill McPeak, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said last week that "it would take hundreds of millions of dollars to put that base back into the shape it was.
 
How It Would Work
 President Bush is likely to finance the cleanup efforts by declaring a national emergency, which allows Congress to appropriate money outside normal budgetary restrictions. It is also possible that he will use money already in the Pentagon budget, since the military has a large role in the cleanup.
Mr. Chiles, who has clashed with Federal officials over the Government's response to the hurricane, said he was glad to see Mr. Bush back for a more thorough look at the disaster area. Last week Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, dismissed the President's first trip, which focused on a shopping mall in an affluent suburb closer to Miami, by remarking, "He went to South Miami and looked at a downed tree."
Today Mr. Chiles said he thought that "anytime you get on the ground, it's useful." The Governor said that Florida needed "a world of help" and that it was only fair that the state "not be required to put up 25 percent or 10 percent" of the reconstruction costs.
With Mr. Bush's announcement today, the Federal Government will shoulder the entire cost of projects like debris removal, sewers, public safety and the reconstruction of schools, museums and other public buildings.
 
'Angry, Frustrated'
 Although the pace of Federal relief efforts has quickened since late last week, criticism has persisted, especially from Democrats. "People are angry, frustrated and shocked" by the slowness of the Government response to the hurricane, said Representative Dante Fascell, a Democrat whose district includes Homestead. "Certainly, if the Federal Government had responded on Day One, instead of Day Four or whatever it was, that would have made a tremendous difference," he said. Mr. Fascell is not running for re-election.
But Mr. Bush seems to have muted other critics with the sheer force of the military relief effort. "Last Thursday, I asked where the hell was the cavalry," said Kate Hale, the Dade County emergency services director, whose angry, televised cry for help is seen by many as having spurred the Bush Administration. "Today, there's no doubt where they are: They're here."
Her enthusiasm was milder when she was asked about President's Bush's visit to Homestead this morning and whether she felt political motives lay behind it. "What can I say?" she responded. "The guy came down, and he had good news. As long as he has good news, God bless him."
Later in the day, Mr. Bush flew to Louisiana and visited a recreation center in Jeanerette, where relief supplies donated by individuals and charities are being distributed by volunteers. "This is the very best about America, pitching in to help someone else," Mr. Bush said.
 
Into the Sugar Belt
 That was a theme he restated in tonight's Oval Office speech. Repeatedly, he commended Americans for their voluntarism, and specifically endorsed the relief efforts of the American Red Cross and a new private campaign called We Will Rebuild, headed by Alvah Chapman, the retired chairman of the newspaper chain Knight-Ridder Inc. who is a Miami civic leader.
The message of private charity and public-spiritedness seemed to fall on sympathetic ears in Jeanerette, a small town in the heart of the south-central Louisiana sugar belt, where the damage and human need has generally been manageable by local government and private relief agencies.
Mr. Bush and his party then went inside the recreation center to look at the heaps of food and other supplies that have been donated from all over the country.
Appearing on the front porch where food packages were being distributed, Mr. Bush was greeted by a few cheers. He then handed a bag of food to Elliot Allen, 13 years old. Asked what the President had said, the boy said, "He told me not to eat it all at once."
Mr. Bush gave a bit of good news to sugar cane growers, whose losses from the storm are estimated at $200 million, pledging to hold sugar imports to current levels.
"While there is damage to the sugar crop, we are not going to raise the sugar import quota," Mr. Bush said. The quota is designed to supplement the American sugar crop with enough sugar from 40 foreign countries to keep a stable price.
Mr. Bush headed back to Washington from Louisiana late this afternoon.
The President's tour of Homestead disrupted relief efforts for most of the morning. Citing security requirements, the police blocked streets all along Mr. Bush's route, preventing trucks and other vehicles from ferrying supplies to relief sites, and forcing many volunteers to sit idly in the sweltering heat.
Mr. Bush's first stop was a military field kitchen outside Campbell Drive Middle School, where several hundred people were being served a breakfast of grilled tuna, hash brown potatoes, pears, apple sauce and juice. Since late last week, the kitchen has been feeding those residents of Homestead who have no homes or food. Troops were put to work cleaning up the site an hour before the President's arrival.
"We love you, but we need your help now," Antonia Vazquez de Pereira called out as Mr. Bush inspected the kitchen in the company of Col. Al Sullivan, commander of a military task force that arrived here Friday. Amid Spanish-accented chants of "Bar-bar-a, Bar-bar-a," Mrs. Pereira and another Hispanic woman made their way through the crowd to Barbara Bush and embraced her, crying quietly.
"I lost my house totally, and I don't have any help," Mrs. Pereira, a native of Peru, said when asked what had made her approach the Mr. and Mrs. Bush. "We are citizens and we need it. We don't need promises, we need houses, food, medicine, now. And for the adults, we need work. Most of us are immigrants, and we have worked very, very hard for this country."
 
Skeptical Viewer
 Also watching from the fringes of the crowd with a great deal more restraint and skepticism was Venus Sookram, who grows Indian vegetables and fruits just outside town on a 20-acre farm that was severely damaged by the storm. He said he had been to see the Federal disaster authorities on Monday, looking for financial assistance, but was discouraged by what he described as an inflexible bureaucratic response.
"I think it's a good idea, his being here, but let's see what he is going to do," Mr. Sookram said.
Mr. Bush seemed particularly interested in the small radios the Army has been distributing, with batteries, to Homestead residents in order to improve communications to areas without power. The President approached 5-year-old Tremaine Franklin and told the boy to "be sure you get your mom and dad to listen, because it tells all the things people are trying to do to help."
"What we are trying to do is saturate the communities around here with transistor radios," Colonel Sullivan explained. "That way, they can tune in and find out where aid is available."
 
Visit to the Tents
 Mr. Bush also stopped at the first of the tent settlements that had been built by the military. Although no Homestead residents have yet been moved into the tents, the President seemed impressed by the speed with which the military has acted.
"They've done a great job setting it up," Mr. Bush said to his military escort, Col. Humberto Rodriguez. Homestead's City Manager, Alex Muxo, was also at the President's side and gently pointed out that there are some major flaws in the system that have made Homestead residents reluctant to move into the tents.
"I think what we're going to have to do is actually go out to the neighborhoods," he told Mr. Bush. "We're already bringing some mental health people in to assure them they will be safe here, because what we're finding at the shelters is that people will go eat lunch and dinner, but they don't want to stay there. They want to secure the personal belongings they have."
Mr. Muxo then told the President that to provide some level of comfort, the tent settlements would have day-care facilities and would show movies. "Oh, for heaven's sake," a pleased Mr. Bush replied. "These guys certainly have it set up nice."
By the time Mr. Bush arrived at Homestead City Hall for a final briefing, local officials said they had made it clear that the situation was far graver than the President had indicated last week. "I think he's seen it," Mr. Muxo said.

The spreading strike at the General Motors Corporation, which now involves more than 30,000 workers at seven plants, is the first concerted reaction by G.M. workers to the company's campaign to cut costs and reduce its work force by 74,000 people by 1995. The strike is threatening to affect nearly twice as many plants and workers by the end of this week. 
 The cost-cutting effort by the company, which involves shrinking its North American operations and scrutinizing just about every significant purchase from roller bearings to disk brakes, is being led by a new management team that includes John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s 54-year-old president, and J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a 51-year-old Spanish engineer who arrived here four months ago and has shaken motordom to its entrenched roots.
Mr. Lopez, who was in charge of purchasing for G.M. Europe when the overseas operation was restructured by Mr. Smith, resulting in impressive gains in profits and productivity, has created something of a firestorm in the auto industry. Nicknamed the "Grand Inquisitor" by European auto executives, Mr. Lopez was appointed vice president for worldwide purchasing in Detroit in April.
 
Demands for Productivity
 He promptly shook up the clubby world of G.M. suppliers -- including the company's vast parts-making divisions that supply 70 percent of the components in G.M.'s vehicles. He declared that all contracts would be put up for bid and that 50 percent improvements in productivity were expected in three years.
The clear message to the auto workers' union is that the price cuts Mr. Lopez wants from G.M.'s parts operations could lead to plant shutdowns, divestitures and fewer union jobs. Although Mr. Lopez is not personally responsible for all of that, he has become a symbol of a changing G.M. that says it wants to be leaner and more competitive.
"This is all about whether management has the ability to improve the competitiveness of our company," one G.M. middle manager said.
But in Lordstown, Ohio, where G.M. has a complex of plants that make everything from fenders to the subcompact Chevrolet Cavalier, becoming more competitive has meant a loss of jobs. And job security, which has been a leading issue between the company and the union for years, is the U.A.W.'s battle cry as it heads into contract negotiations next year with G.M.
In many respects, the current strike is a dress rehearsal for the 1993 labor talks. And there is already talk here that this dispute holds the potential to be a protracted showdown reminiscent of the union's bitter -- and unsuccessful -- strike against Caterpillar Inc. this year.
The current strike exploded from a local dispute into a national showdown partly because G.M.'s top management was focused on its corporate restructuring, the recent issuance of new stock and broad strategic planning to shore up profits.
The current strike started in Lordstown last week when the U.A.W. protested the elimination of 240 tool-and-die-making jobs because the work was being shifted to an outside supplier. The union was dusting off an age-old strike strategy by walking out of a plant that makes body parts for a number of G.M.'s best-selling models, including full-sized vans and the Saturn subcompacts.
In the past, G.M. often bowed to pressure when organized labor staged a strike at a small plant that is intended to cause larger problems, steadily affecting more and more operations.
But this time, G.M.'s top management is clearly on notice from directors that it must stabilize the auto maker's finances in North America, where it lost $7 billion last year.
Although the union helped G.M. start the innovative Saturn car-making venture, the strike proves the union is also willing to damage Saturn's sales to dramatize its distaste for strategies that take away jobs.
 
 
Memories of Caterpillar
 Stephen Yokich, head of the union's G.M. department, wants to be the next U.A.W. president; he and other officers must prove that the union can deal more effectively with job losses than it did during the strike at Caterpillar.
"Mr. Lopez has met with Steve Yokich and said their talks were excellent," a G.M. spokeswoman, Antonette Simonetti, said today, referring to talks before the strike began. "He said he admires union workers and they should work together to make operations competitive.
"But he said there is only one class of G.M. supplier, not internal and external. He's said to workers, 'Let's work together.' "
Because G.M. makes a higher proportion of its parts itself, with costly union labor, many G.M. parts -- and, therefore, G.M. vehicles -- are at a serious cost disadvantage to the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and Japanese auto makers that buy parts overseas or from nonunion shops.
 
 
'A Lot of Pressure'
 "We had Lopez into our plant," said Jack Withrow, the president of the Lectron Corporation, a G.M. supplier in Rochester Hills, Mich. "There's a lot of pressure on price -- all our supply contracts are being rebid. He wants double-digit decreases, not the 2 or 3 percent G.M. had been asking for."
John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York, said: "G.M. has been evading these issues since World War II. The longer you wait, the tougher it gets."
But Mr. Casesa says he thinks the G.M. strike will not explode into a confrontation like the one between Caterpillar and the auto workers. Rather, it will be a "sneak preview," he said, of next year's bargaining for a new contract to replace the current one, which expires in the fall of 1993.
Mr. Lopez received his assignment from Jack Smith, G.M.'s new president. Mr. Smith was installed only last April by board members who are not part of management who had grown impatient with the company's progress under Robert C. Stempel, the chairman. During negotiations with the union in 1990, Mr. Stempel spoke of his determination to "grow the business," which union bargainers understood as a commitment to keep work and jobs inside the company.
 
 
Turnaround in Europe
 Mr. Smith and Mr. Lopez helped lead the turnaround of G.M.'s European operations in the 1980's. Auto industry analysts credited them with consolidating what had been a divided, expensive operation into a highly profitable business with well-managed marketing, distribution and cost-control operations. Mr. Smith went on to head all of G.M.'s international operations until the board dismissed his predecessor as president, Lloyd E. Reuss, and gave Mr. Smith a mandate to rescue G.M.'s North American automotive operations.
"G.M. is in a tough economic position," said Harry Katz, professor of labor relations at Cornell University. "Management is making its moves, and the union is looking for bargaining leverage."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
After Andrew, Another Unannounced Visitor: George Bush

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Sept. 1

 BODY:
When Ramon Rodriguez and Adela Antonini whistled at George Bush from the doorway of their windowless apartment, they never expected that the President would just drop by, unannounced.
And while they were honored, seeing that the President did not visit any other hurricane-damaged homes during his trip here, they were really hoping to see someone more important. 
 "It would have been better if the manager of the building came," Ms. Antonini said. "No offense to Bush, but we don't need our morale boosted. We need our ceiling plugged."
For the most part, the hot, tired and mosquito-bitten hurricane victims here only knew that the President had come to town because their streets were blocked for most of the morning.
 
A Language Barrier
 And many of those who encountered him at the emergency shelters he toured did not understand a word he said. They speak Spanish and Haitian Creole, not English.
Still, some Homestead residents were thrilled that the President had come to see the damage for himself. "How could he have a cold heart after he sees that our babies are thirsty and sick?" Mauricio Reyes, a farm worker, said.
And others, while skeptical that Mr. Bush's motives were political, said they would take whatever attention they could get. "The man was here, the man will be on TV, and the world will keep thinking about us," said Tawana Sheets, 22 years old, who lost her home and her job at a plant nursery in the last week.
A block away from one emergency shelter, Janine Powell, 54, rested on a toilet in front of the rubble that used to be her home. (It was the only thing resembling a piece of furniture she could salvage.)
"I think the President should come sit where I'm sitting and see the devastation from our perspective," she said. "But seriously, he needs to know how desperately we need him. And if he doesn't come through, well -- Homestead for Clinton, I say."
Some storm victims, delayed in their salvaging and scavenging efforts by the roadblocks for the President, vented their frustrations in sarcasm and hostility.
A temporary receptionist at the Homestead City Hall, Shawanna Williams, 18, was yelling at the police officers guarding Mr. Bush's meeting with local officials.
"I just want to know what he's going to do," said Ms. Williams, who is living with her two babies and 10 other relatives in a Florida City house without a roof. "If something like this happened up there where he's at, bet you his stuff would get fixed up right quick."
Patsy Nieto, 27, cradled her 4-month-old baby, waiting to complete her drive north to pick up a tent that would replace her demolished home in Leisure City.
"I don't think President Bush ever cared about us low-income people to begin with, so why start now?" Mrs. Nieto said.
Few Homestead residents knew that the President had announced that he would rebuild the Homestead Air Force base, a linchpin of the local economy.
 
From Diatribe to Blessings
 When Elisa Gonzalez learned of his announcement, she stopped in the middle of an anti-Bush diatribe.
"Well, God bless, he's doing the right thing," said Mrs. Gonzalez, who sells subscriptions for a cable television company. "All we want is for our beautiful, proud community to get a second chance."
And Homestead's Police Chief, Curt Ivy, who described his first view of the post-hurricane landscape as "something out of some acid rock album cover," said the town would "get more positive" toward the President once the news circulated.
At one shelter, the Homestead Middle School, Gloria Sanchez, 28, and her children rested on the foam mattress that has been their home since Hurricane Andrew destroyed the Everglades Labor Camp in Florida City, a trailer park for migrant workers. Mrs. Sanchez, who is Mexican, did not bother to venture into the courtyard where Mr. Bush addressed reporters.
"He is not really our President," she said. "And especially now. Because if there is no chance for work here, then we will just return to Matamoros."
Fabien Baptiste, a Haitian refugee who nursed her 2-month-old daughter at the shelter, only wanted to know if Mr. Bush was going to transfer them to the tent city.
"I stayed in his army's tents in Guantanamo, on my way here," she said.
As Mr. Bush drove away from the Homestead City Hall, he addressed the small crowd through a loudspeaker.
"Good luck to you all," the President said.
And Beth Brago, a Dade County teacher who lives in a severely damaged house in the Redlands, snickered a response.
"We need more than luck, sweetheart," she called after the motorcade. "Luck never put food on the table for my children."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Congressional Race;
Dueling Incumbents Revisit House Bank Scandal

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WATERLOO, Iowa, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The House bank scandal is being replayed in a fierce Congressional contest here between two incumbents who clashed in the partisan war that the scandal unleashed in Washington.
On one side is Representative Jim Nussle, a 32-year-old conservative Republican freshman who is best known for putting a paper grocery bag over his head on the House floor to dramatize his outrage over Congressional perquisites and overdrawn checking accounts. 
 Reapportionment, which reduced Iowa's allotment of House seats to five from six, has forced Mr. Nussle into a tight race with Representative Dave Nagle, a 49-year-old liberal Democrat who prides himself on his close ties to the House Democratic leadership. Mr. Nagle, who has served three terms, also attracted attention during the House bank affair by asking the House to resist a Justice Department subpoena of the House bank records of all members. He said the action infringed on the separation of powers between Congress and the Administration.
 
Political Fault Line
 Mr. Nagle argued in a speech that the lawmakers were obliged to protect the Constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. He concluded by saying that when Congress was pushed by misguided constituents, "public opinion be damned."
The wide fault line between the Republican and Democrat will clearly test how Iowa voters view the Congress -- as part of the problem or part of the solution for the nation's economic malaise. While Mr. Nussle tells voters, "I'm running on the platform that we have to start saying no" to reduce the $4 trillion national debt, Mr. Nagle offers a vision of corn price supports, highway expansion and dam and bridge repair projects to stimulate Iowa's stagnant economy.
Almost everywhere Mr. Nussle goes he receives comments about his paper bag, which is seen by some as a sophomoric stunt but by others as an effective tactic to help close the House bank and expose members who abused their checking privileges.
At a coffee shop on the outskirts of the town of New Hampton, Mr. Nussle was greeted Thursday by Ray McDermott, 78, a motel owner who placed a grocery bag next to Mr. Nussle's plate of eggs. "Here's your working suit," Mr. McDermott said, pointing to the bag. "You say the Democrats have ruined the country by running Congress for 38 years, but the first 26 were pretty good. You should be ashamed of your party."
Mr. Nussle patiently talked with the man and appeared to impress several passersby with his cool.
The next day the Republican lawmaker visited a vocational school in Mason City, where students greeted him by passing small paper bags around the room.
"One person can put a bag on his head and make a difference," Mr. Nussle told them, and repeated his "Lead or Leave" pledge that he will retire from the Congress in 1996 unless the annual budget deficit is cut in half.
Mr. Nagle said in an interview that if the race was decided on the issue of Congressional reform, he would lose, even though he overdrew his House bank account a mere four times over 39 months. "I will win," he said, "if the economy is the main issue."
Calling the race "a choice between anger and hope," Mr. Nagle spoke Saturday morning at a ceremony opening a new low-income housing project, a women's rights rally and a machinists union hall, where he quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and spoke of a need for an activist Government.
Bud Sanders, 51, a union steward, liked what he heard. "We look for people who understand our needs," he said. "Nussle doesn't. He might as well walk around with a sack on his head."
In the afternoon, Mr. Nagle was at a chemical company family picnic, where he reminded 200 employees and their families of how he had successfully lobbied the Czechslovak Government to drop an application for an import fee waiver on a chemical also made by the Iowa plant.
"It's about time the Government did something right," said Keith Oldham, 61, as he slapped Mr. Nagle on the back. A retired fire chief, Mr. Oldham said his wife, a receptionist with the chemical company, probably would have lost her job had it not been for the Congressman's efforts. "I like Nussle for making his point the way he did," he said, "but I suppose I'm going to have to vote for Nagle because he helped my family."

HEADLINE: Cold Spring Journal;
The Vision That Wasn't. Or Was It?

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLD SPRING, Ky., Sept. 1

 BODY:
The first clue to why this town of 2,800 people was braced for anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 visitors Monday night came about nine miles south of Cincinnati, where a sign outside of Leisure Time Sports advertised "Lady of Light T-shirts."
Farther along Route 27, the highway that pretty much defines Cold Spring, every lawn, driveway and business parking lot was blocked off with yellow plastic police tape. And across from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, a small contingent of military police from the National Guard was standing watch. 
 The excitement began building two months ago, when the pastor of the church, the Rev. Leroy Smith, told a small prayer group that at midnight on Aug. 31 he expected either an appearance or a message from the Virgin Mary. The prediction came, he said, from a "visionary" in Batavia, Ohio, whose identity he would not disclose.
By mid-July the predicted event was fodder for headlines, newscasts and talk shows, and both church and town officials were rattled by the prospect of what somebody called "a Woodstock for Catholics."
In the end the crowd probably numbered fewer than 8,000 people, and whether the Blessed Virgin was among them seemed to be a matter of a special kind of faith. But the quest for the miraculous at St. Joseph's Church here is far from unique. Indeed, it would not even have occurred except for a growing movement built around a swelling flow of reported apparitions and messages from Mary.
A day that started with a Mass before a thousand people on the parish parking lot ended with a hush at midnight. Inside the church, to which only 1,500 parishioners -- and no cameras or tape recorders -- were admitted, Father Smith paused in saying the rosary. Now the thousands gathered in the parking lot heard him say over loudspeakers, "Let us take a moment to welcome Our Lady into our midst."
The intensity of the moment was broken only by the winking of flashbulbs. A small clump of people pointed at a pine tree.
"It was like a silhouette figure and Mary had her arms out, and first we saw it above the tree and then it rose above the church," Shirley Richardson, a 22-year-old hair stylist who had grown up in the parish, said later.
Joel Schirmer, an 18-year-old from the Cold Spring area, had nothing similar to report but "was not disappointed," he said, adding, "To tell the truth, I didn't expect to see anything."
A priest who was inside the church, the Rev. Edward Carter, who teaches theology at Xavier University in Cincinnati, said, "I saw nothing out of the ordinary." Nonetheless, he described "a profound experience of peace and serenity" in the congregation, and likened it to the mood reported by visitors to famous sites honoring visions of Mary.
He referred, in particular, to Medjugorje, the Croatian village where six young people have been claiming to experience virtually daily appearances of Mary for more than a decade.
The millions of pilgrims from the United States to Medjugorje are a chief root of the current enthusiasm. Father Smith has been to Medjugorje nine times. So had about a quarter of those at the morning Mass.
Many of the hundreds who endured a day of blazing sunshine on lawn chairs and blankets in the church's huge parking lot were ready to be satisfied with serenity rather than a vision. They prayed and sang hymns and put petitions for help from God in a big cardboard box by a stone grotto with a statue of Mary in it.
Some displayed rosary beads with links that had turned a gold color. Sometimes, they said, this had happened instantaneously at Medjugorje; in other cases, the color changed over time.
Knots of people hunched over Polaroid photographs of the sun that showed rectangular glows of light -- the door to Heaven, some said -- and shadows in which the figures of Jesus, Mary or angels were discerned.
But many who peered at the rosary beads or photographs were quick to say that such marvels, including the possibility of a midnight apparition, were not important in themselves, but only as ways of drawing people to prayer and faith in Jesus.
"If it changes the person interiorly, it is a valid experience," said Marianne Tomlinson. "But they have to be truly seeking the truth and not the spectacle."
Ms. Tomlinson, a 36-year-old Cincinnatian who had gone to Catholic schools, said that last February she was "ready to join a hopping Protestant church" where she could "praise God openly," as she had done in a Catholic charismatic group until it disbanded.
A priest had helped her to become interested in Marian devotions, she said, and she "now prays two hours a day" and understands the Mass as she never had before.
At Leisure Time Sports, a half-mile closer to Cincinnati along Route 27, Gary Chism was busy silk-screening T-shirts with the inscription "Lady of Light" above a design of Mary's head and diagonal rays.
"I'm not Catholic, so for me to design a shirt like this was kind of out of the ordinary," said Mr. Chism, who was reared as a Baptist. "The world's in such bad shape, with the economy, drugs, violence. This is a ray of hope for people who need something good."
His wife, Bobbi, had some observations on the purchasers. "Some of them come across as really sincere," she said, "and some come across as fruitcakes."
Bishop William A. Hughes, whose diocese of Covington, Ky., includes Cold Spring, had told Catholics to be cautious about giving credence to predictions of extraordinary visions or messages, and he said he was pained at so much curiosity about them.
Father Smith himself warned that "we should not be looking for the spectacular." But during the Mass he quoted more messages from Mary "sent" to him by the visionary. At the nighttime service he announced more messages from Mary and Jesus that he said had been received Thursday by people in Arizona.
Bishop Hughes released a statement late today, saying, "After visiting with Father Smith today, I am convinced that nothing of a miraculous nature occurred in St. Joseph Church last evening." He praised the crowd for its reverence and respect, and apologized to the citizens of Cold Spring "who may have been inconvenienced."
At Leisure Time Sports, Mr. Chism reported that Lady of Light T-shirts were "more popular today than yesterday." He was still trying to fill orders for the shirts.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA HURDLE IS SCHOOL SPENDING

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept. 1

 BODY:
Negotiators for the State Legislature entered intense talks with Gov. Pete Wilson's staff today to resolve a dispute over future state support for public schools, the last remaining hurdle to ending California's two-month budget crisis.
People on both sides familiar with the negotiations said they were trying to find some face-saving concessions to offer Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. and the fractious Democratic-controlled Assembly as inducement to vote for the main elements of the Republican Governor's plan. 
 The dispute revolves not around this year's actual appropriations but around the Governor's efforts to make his school-spending plans immune to challenge in the courts.
The deliberations came as the state staggered through its 63d day without a budget. The lawmakers worked past their deadline of midnight Monday before recessing early today. Leaders said they were prepared for another long session.
 
The Pressure Builds
 Intense pressure is building for a solution as the state continues to pay its bills with i.o.u.'s. It has stopped paying for health care for the poor; it will owe doctors and hospitals nearly $270 million by Thursday.
Over the last two months, the lawmakers have grudgingly yielded to the Governor in agreeing to balance this year's recession-racked $57.6 billion budget with many deep and painful cuts but no new taxes. No agreement has yet been possible, however, on the numbingly complex plan that Mr. Wilson has offered to hold down increases in school spending in future years.
The Governor has demanded and obtained legislative agreement to "recapture" $1.1 billion overpaid to local school districts last year under a state Constitutional provision called Proposition 98 that guarantees the public schools and community colleges 40 percent of state revenues, which is about $24 billion this year. To keep school spending steady this year, he would "lend" the schools $959 million from future years. This would reduce the original base on which support in future years is based.
 
Wanting a 'Poison Pill'
 And to protect this plan, he wants a "poison pill" in the legislation that would suspend Proposition 98 and allow him to cut spending should any school district successfully challenge the plan in court.
Democrats in the Assembly and educational interests, including the powerful California Teachers Association, opposed the Governor's idea.
But they have been discussing a number of concessions as the price of their support, including adding $100 million to the base of school support next year, changing the formula by which daily attendance is calculated, restoring some of the cuts suffered by community college and rolling back some of the fee increases forced on the two state university systems. Among other means, they would pay for this by cutting the state bureaucracy, laying off public information officers, for example.
"We've put to bed 99.967 percent of all spending," said Assemblyman Phil Isenberg, a Democrat from Sacramento who has been a leader in the budget issue. "The rest is some turf protection and giant egos."
 
Assembly Is the Key
 The difficulty was to get the two-thirds majority of 54 votes required in the 80-seat Assembly in which both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are unhappy with Governor Wilson. The Senate had earlier passed the bulk of his budget proposals and was expected to go along with whatever compromise he reached with the Assembly leadership.
The daylong negotiations followed a hectic legislative night on Monday, during which both houses passed all the necessary legislation to resolve the stalemate except for a school-spending plan acceptable to the Governor. After that, an aide to Mr. Wilson said, Speaker Brown telephoned the Governor and there was a "polite" conversation in which the two agreed to end the impasse and send their representatives to work out the details of the compromise.
"Anybody who thinks the Governor has won is crazy; none of us are winning," said the Senate Republican minority leader, Kenneth L. Maddy of Fresno, during the debate the other day. "We've all lost, in terms of the credibility of the public."
The Governor's aides hope he will benefit from public anger this November, when all the seats in the Assembly and half in the Senate are up for election. They hope to raise the number of Republicans in the 80-seat Assembly to 37 or 38 from the current 33. Assuming an alliance with conservative Democrats, the Republicans would have a working majority and could probably force Mr. Brown out as Speaker. Twenty-five of the incumbents are leaving the house, and 15 or so others are in tough races.
In addition, the Governor has mounted a voter initiative that would amend the State Constitution to give him considerable additional powers over budgetary matters and welfare grants.

HEADLINE: Teachers in 3 States Strike, Signaling Wider Unrest

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Teachers in three states have gone on strike in work stoppages that could spread to three other states. And union leaders and education analysts say the bitter mood among teachers goes beyond wage and compensation issues.
In the largest of the strikes, 10,000 teachers in the Detroit school system walked off their jobs on Monday, as did teachers in four other Michigan school systems of Mount Pleasant, Clarkston, Grand Haven and Plainwell. In Illinois, teachers in Harrisburg, Rochester, Bethany, Tri-Valley and Belvidere are on strike, as are teachers in the Bennington, Vt., school district. 
 The number of strikes, while smaller than in past years, could grow if current negotiations break down in several school districts in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and California. In addition, leaders of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, the two national teachers' unions, say there is another factor that could create more strikes: More teachers than in recent years are returning to work without contracts, many for the second or third year.
But a national school board expert said the teachers' demands were unrealistic, given the nation's economy.
"Unions are trying to force the issue, and they have no concerns about resources," said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of the National School Boards Association in Alexandria, Va., which represents 15,350 local school boards. "School boards cannot print money, and they are constrained by law in the revenues available to them."
More than at any point in the recent past, say union leaders and education analysts, teachers feel mounting frustration not just over pay and benefits, but over the level of state aid to school financing, which has led to teacher layoffs, larger class sizes in many schools and a dearth of basic supplies.
The current disputes are "a little bigger than just school boards versus the teachers," said Michael Kasserly, interim director of the Council of Great City Schools, which represents 45 of the nation's largest urban school districts. "It's an economic climate that's exacerbating tensions and divisions, in an education environment that's badly underfunded in the first place."
Indeed, at issue in some districts is not whether teachers should get more money, but whether local school districts can rescind previously set pay increases and health benefits that were struck in more prosperous times.
The average teacher's salary in the United States in 1991-92 was $34,213, according to the American Federation of Teachers.
Last year, said Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union with 2.1 million members, teachers across the nation received an average pay increase of just under 5 percent. That amount exceeded the rate of inflation last year, but teachers this year will be hard pressed to win increases near that level, Mr. Geiger said.
 
'Angry and Bitter'
 "We're used to being told there's no money for salary increases," Mr. Geiger said. "But this year for the first time not only are we not getting pay increases, you can't even get the $300 to $500 to $1,000 a year incremental pay increase."
Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which has 796,000 members, said the current unrest masks the moods of many teachers, who he said are going back to school "angry and bitter."
"They think that things are pretty hopeless," he added.
Mark Gniewek, a computer science teacher picketing outside Detroit Northern High School yesterday, told The Associated Press that he and his colleagues were angrier this year than during their last strike, a five-week walkout in 1987. "I think a lot of teachers would go back to work for a very little raise," he said. "What's being offered now isn't really a raise."
Detroit has offered a 3 percent salary bonus in exchange for attending 50 hours of workshops without pay.

HEADLINE: As Serbs See War: Foreign Plots and Ingratitude

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Isolated and embittered, the people of Serbia seem gripped by a kind of national psychosis fed by the Balkans' grim history and by visions of intricate international plots to humiliate them.
Their dark mood was captured by a crowd here this week on a central thoroughfare, Kneza Mihaila Avenue. Standing beside banners saying "Western countries want to rape Serbia!" and "Serbs need media justice," they signed a petition to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, protesting United Nations economic sanctions. 
 Ugljesa Jovanovic, a 32-year-old electrical engineer in the crowd, shook with rage. "I absolutely do not understand the West," he said. "Why does the United States want to persecute Serbia, which resisted Hitler and gave more than it was ever asked? Why are we alone singled out when there have been crimes on all sides in this war?"
Such anger is widespread in what is left of Yugoslavia, and it complicates the West's calculations on how to end the fighting between the Serbs and opposing forces in newly independent republics.
In theory, the United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia, adopted in May, are supposed to turn the people of Serbia, the dominant republic in the truncated new Yugoslav federation, against their hard-line President, Slobodan Milosevic. This in turn would help speed a move toward compromise in the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of which has been captured by Serbian forces. But the anger toward the outside world appears stronger than any directed at Mr. Milosevic.
There is no question that the sanctions have caused considerable hardship and that with the onset of winter, this could lead to growing political opposition to Mr. Milosevic. But the street protests of June and July have faded.
"We are pretty hard-headed under pressure and able to endure," said Momir Pavlicevic, an official of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce. "Now the U.S. and Western attacks on us are bringing us Serbs together, and I think they are reinforcing Mr. Milosevic."
To many Serbs, the war is largely the result of foreign myopia. In this view, violence became inevitable after 1.5 million ethnic Serbs found themselves marooned, without guarantees, in new countries after rapid recognition of the independence of Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
These Serbs say other governments have no right to dictate policy because they bungled in the breakup of old Yugoslavia and so are at least partly responsible for the war.
Arguing this way, many Serbs resort to conspiracy theories to explain their status as pariahs. Among these are that a German-Austrian-Croatian alliance, a grouping that existed during World War II, is once more dominant in Europe and bent on revenge against Serbia for its resistance to fascism.
It is also suggested that the United States has bowed to pressure from Saudi Arabia and Turkey and is supporting Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic. The Muslims of Bosnia, the biggest single ethnic group in the republic, have been under relentless attack by the Serbs. "Mideast oil is more important to Washington than Serbia," said Vuk Rosandic, a 23-year-old musician. "So we have been ditched by the United States, a country we thought was our firm ally."
 
All Sides Commit Atrocities
 Many Serbs are convinced that abuses in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been no more terrible than those by Croatian or Muslim forces, that the plight of more than 450,000 Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia has received far less attention than the suffering of Muslims or Croats, and that the Serbian fighters in Bosnia are not under Belgrade's control. Thus it follows that they believe they are the victims of a gross injustice.
Their indignation was sharpened by comments last week by the Acting American Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, at Yugoslav peace talks in London. His statement that "it is the Serbs, alas, who are most guilty today of crimes" was the most widely reported here of any remark made during the conference.
Mr. Eagleburger served here as United States Ambassador. "He is supposed to understand the situation," said a former Yugoslav diplomat who knows the Secretary well, "and he comes out with this."
Of course not all Serbs see plots against them and some concede that the policies of Mr. Milosevic, with his driving vision of a Greater Serbia, have been the main cause of the Yugoslav crisis. But not even those who oppose him and have sided with the conciliatory policies of the new Yugoslav Prime Minister, Milan Panic, blame him for giving support to Serbs in the newly independent states of the former Yugoslavia. Very few argue that Belgrade should have left these ethnic Serbs to fend for themselves.
Particularly galling to Serbs, who fought the Germans in two world wars and suffered heavily in the concentration camps of the puppet Nazi state of Croatia during World War II, was the European Community's quick recognition last year, under German pressure, of Croatian independence.
"Germans have made some serious mistakes," said Aleksandar Nenadovic, a political commentator, "and the worst was to hurry the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia without insuring that all ethnic communities throughout the old Yugoslavia had guarantees. We will not forget that."
As viewed here, the current drift in Europe involves a resurgent Germany, opposed as ever to Serbian power, a Germany that has secured its long-sought access to the Mediterranean through a subservient Croatia. This new Germany, many argue, is now bludgeoning Washington into an anti-Serbian policy.
They see themselves as isolated and united, heroically defending a truth that the world is blind to, but that will emerge in the end. Tough fighters in many wars, they again rally to the cry, "Only Solidarity Saves the Serb!"
Mr. Nenadovic, the political commentator, said that many here had been moved by the country's isolation to the defiant view that "the Serbs are best off alone and fighting everyone, and that is something their computers in London and Washington cannot understand."

HEADLINE: 23 States Face Suits on School Funds

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
As schools reopen this week from the summer break, many begin the new year under a cloud: Increasing numbers of states face lawsuits over their failure to close spending gaps between rich and poor school districts or their failure to give adequate aid to all schools.
Twenty-three states are embroiled in suits, most filed since 1990, over how they finance school districts. Three others -- New York, New Hampshire and California -- could face lawsuits again if plaintiffs make good on threats to appeal or refile cases that were decided this year. 
 By comparison, 11 states faced such suits five years ago, with most now settled.
 
Seeking Long-Term Solutions
 "Whatever comes out from these rounds of court cases, people should be thinking about long-term solutions and not short-term solutions," said Robert Berne, the assistant dean of the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University who has testified in several cases. "Giving cash infusions without anticipating inflation, growth or the cost of school reform may win you the short-term battle, but you don't win the war."
Chris Pipho, an analyst for the Education Commission of the States, a Denver education research and policy organization, said: "School finance is back on the front burner. Finance issues had taken a back seat to education reform in the 1980's, but the issues of equity and adequacy are too big to ignore."
The growing number of lawsuits reflects several problems, not the least of which is the lingering effects of the recession. For much of the 1980's, when resources were more plentiful, many states addressed spending disparities among schools by giving more money to poorer school districts. But the recession has hobbled those efforts.
 
Compounding the Problem
 Outdated ways of financing school districts have compounded the problem. Most school budgets still come primarily from local property taxes; thus, the more affluent the area is the more money its school district receives.
In addition, most school finance formulas do not take into account the mounting expenses caused by an increasing number of students who need special academic and social assistance.
But some states have started to search for remedies. In Massachusetts, for example, a business group last year proposed a plan, embraced by state legislators, that reflects what many school finance experts have proposed: Let education improvements and needs dictate the amount states allocate to schools.
Although the notion seems simple, basing school financing on educational needs would be difficult for two reasons. First, it requires states to abandon the decades-old approach of basing their school aid primarily on the number of students per district. Second, it is always debatable which education improvements and needs deserve financing.
Nowhere is the fight for equalizing state aid among school districts more divisive than in Texas.
 
Taking Texas to Court
 The State of Texas has been in and out of court over school financing since 1968, when a San Antonio sheet-metal worker, Demetrio Rodriguez, became the lead plaintiff for a group of parents in the predominantly Hispanic and property-poor Edgewood Independent School District.
Mr. Rodriguez's original suit, as well as a second suit filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, asserted that the state did too little to correct the gap in wealth between rich and poor school districts.
Some districts, with highly valued commercial and residential property, can afford to spend nearly $20,000 on each student every year. Other districts, like Edgewood, cursed by bad geography and homes too modest to generate much in the way of taxes, spend about $3,000 a year per student.
Such a gap means classrooms in well-off districts may be outfitted with the latest in technology and textbooks and well-equipped science laboratories while classrooms in poorer areas must settle for outdated school books and little technology, let alone science labs.
Three times Texas has tried to remedy the problem and three times in as many years the Texas Supreme Court has rejected the plans as insufficient. In its most recent rejection, the State Supreme Court gave the Texas Legislature until May 1993 to correct the problem, and Gov. Ann W. Richards is expected to call a special legislative session this fall to address the disparities, which rank among the greatest of any state.
Increasingly, lawsuits are challenging states on another front: whether all schools, rich and poor, are receiving adequate financing to give students a quality education.
The American Civil Liberties Union is testing that approach in Louisiana, where it filed a lawsuit five months ago charging the state with underfinancing all public schools.
The A.C.L.U. says the underfinancing results in deficient educations. Some school districts use history textbooks so outdated that in their pages men have not yet landed on the moon. Some buildings have been allowed to deteriorate to to the point where sewers back up into the restrooms in a heavy rain. Some schools do not even have indoor bathrooms.
While many states struggle to maintain at least their present levels of financing, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky have taken the lead in trying new ways to pay for schools.
All three states have assumed a larger responsibility in supporting schools than ever before through raising more taxes at the state level, putting a cap on how much rich districts can raise locally and giving more aid to all school districts, with larger allocations going to the poorer districts. Although these plans do not address all the discrepancies in school wealth -- and lawsuits are still active in West Virginia and Tennessee -- they have gone far toward closing the gaps.
Experts say school financing should at least reflect the higher cost of doing business in urban areas, which tend to have more youngsters who require special academic and social assistance. These experts also say that education needs should drive state financing if they can be properly defined and measured.

HEADLINE: Networks Intensify The Courtship Of David Letterman

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
David Letterman is the most wanted man in television. Though no decision can be made about his future television home, the intensity of the courtship of this NBC late-night star by other prospective suitors has increased in recent weeks and so has NBC's own interest in doing everything it can to keep Mr. Letterman from going elsewhere.
The odds may have changed recently in the Letterman sweepstakes, but the race to sign the late-night comedy star to a new contract won't -- and can't -- begin until NBC first negotiates with Mr. Letterman. John Agoglia, the president of NBC Enterprises, said yesterday that the network's contract calls for an exclusive negotiating period with Mr. Letterman, which will not begin until early next year. Mr. Letterman's contract will expire in April. 
 NBC still expresses the hope that it can keep Mr. Letterman despite the acknowledged friction between the star and the network's management, which began last year when he was passed over as the successor to Johnny Carson on the network's flagship late-night program, the "Tonight" show. The job went to Jay Leno.
 
Making Presentations
 Several executives from NBC, other networks and syndication companies said yesterday that the situation was unusually complex mainly because of Mr. Letterman's NBC contract. While representatives of other networks and syndication companies have made what they call presentations to Mr. Letterman's representatives at the Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles, no formal negotiations have taken place.
"Nobody wants to be accused of tampering with NBC's rights in the contract," said one senior network executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Indeed, NBC has explictly told those interested in Mr. Letterman that a lawsuit could ensue if the network perceives its exclusive negotiating period was violated.
One chief concern is the "onerous nature of some aspects of the contract" as one network programming executive, who has met with Mr. Letterman's representatives, put it. NBC declined to spell out the specific nature of the contract, saying it did not want to talk about conditions that may apply should Mr. Letterman decide to leave the network.
But one syndication executive and one senior executive from another network said Mr. Letterman might be prevented from starting a new television show for up to a year after his contract with NBC expires. "They can exercise an option and keep him off the market," the syndication executive said of Mr. Letterman.
The option would be put into force should Mr. Letterman make a deal with another party and not return to NBC to allow the network to match the offer. Because NBC has a year in which to match any competitive offer, it could, and probably would, exercise its option to keep Mr. Letterman off the air, the executive said.
Despite repeated requests to comment on the matter, Mr. Letterman has declined to be interviewed.
 
The Future of 'Nightline'
 Much of the speculation about Mr. Letterman's plans has been wild, including suggestions that ABC has committed to dropping its highly regarded late-night news program "Nightline," if Mr. Letterman can be signed. Phil Beuth, the ABC executive in charge of late-night programs, is one of the few network executives who has said on the record that he is not negotiating with Mr. Letterman.
That does not mean ABC would not be in the running for Mr. Letterman at some point. But Joanna Bistany, the senior vice president of ABC News, said the network remained unshakably committed to "Nightline." "The network has no plans to remove 'Nightline' under any circumstances," Ms. Bistany said. "The show is staying at 11:30 P.M."
Executives from CBS, Fox and several syndication companies say they are extremely interested in Mr. Letterman and will actively pursue establishing a new show for him should he become available.
 
'He May Get an Offer'
 What CBS has to offer is access to the 11:30 P.M. time period, which Mr. Letterman, whose NBC show is broadcast at 12:35 A.M., has made a chief priority. In an interview in January, Mr. Letterman said he was getting too old to have a show on that late at night.
Mr. Letterman would probably stand to make the most money if he chose to go into syndication. The syndication executive said, "He may get an offer of $20 million from somebody in syndication and he'd make nothing like that with a network." No one has said what Mr. Letterman earns. Mr. Leno has said he was paid $3 million a year by NBC while Arsenio Hall, whose late-night show for Paramount has been a major hit in syndication, makes $12 million a year.
 
An Improving Relationship
 But syndication also represents more of a risk, as was proved this year when a similar late-night show starring the comedian Dennis Miller failed quickly for the Tribune Entertainment Company. In syndication, a show may not necessarily appear at the same time on all stations, and it is much harder to promote than a network program.
But all the outside parties in the Letterman matter have agreed that NBC still retains some opportunity to re-sign Mr. Letterman. "C.A.A. knows it's just good business to allow NBC a whack at keeping him," a syndication executive said of Mr. Letterman's agents. For one thing, he said, the NBC offer will be a starting point in negotiations for any competitor.
NBC executives said they believed the network's relationship with Mr. Letterman, which they acknowledged was strained for much of the past year, has improved lately, since the arrival of a new producer, Peter Lassaley.
But part of that may reflect an increased commitment by NBC to keeping Mr. Letterman. NBC says it can argue to Mr. Letterman that any options presented by others have pitfalls, from the questionable lineup of stations that can be put together by a syndicator, to ABC's commitment to "Nightline," to the problems CBS might have in making the deals necessary to assure all its affiliates would carry Mr. Letterman's show at 11:30 P.M.
Still, NBC is unable to give Mr. Letterman the 11:30 P.M. slot because it went to Mr. Leno. Mr. Leno's program has experienced some early problems of its own, but no NBC executive has yet suggested that the resolution of the problems with Mr. Letterman will be to reconsider the decision to continue with Mr. Leno as the star.
One senior NBC executive said the network would hold off on negotiating with Mr. Letterman as long as it could. "We want to be best able to assess the entire situation, from ratings to sales to how the economy is looking at that point," he said.

Even Jose's Departure Was Huge

BYLINE: BY GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THOSE of us who were sitting halfway up in the Skydome in 1989 will never forget the moon-launch trajectory of the home run that kept soaring until it finally connected with something solid: the fifth row of the fifth deck. That was the Canseco home run, all 480 rising feet of it.
And nobody who was in the Oakland Coliseum on Monday night will ever forget the mysterious sight of Lance Blankenship suddenly becoming the answer to a trivia question: Who was the pinch-hitter on the night of the Jose Canseco trade? 
 "I was standing in the dugout, just waiting to watch Josie bat," said Bob Welch, the injured Oakland pitcher who knows it is never a good idea to turn your back on a Canseco swing. "All of a sudden, they called him back from the on-deck circle. He was stunned. The whole place was quiet. Everybody was down."
There are a lot of people in baseball, including some in the Oakland clubhouse, who think the A's got the better of the stupendous trade just before the midnight trading deadline. The A's may win a World Series with Ruben Sierra hitting and Bobby Witt and Jeff Russell pitching, but it will always be the Canseco trade.
The most flamboyant star in three World Series, the man who slammed his Porsche into his wife's BMW during a family squabble, the man who hit home runs into the fifth deck of the Skydome, the man who grinned and flexed his muscles when the crowd chanted "Ste-roids! Ste-roids!" was traded. Out of the game. Out of first place. Out of Oakland.
Welch watched his buddy clear out his locker and conduct a news conference, while the game was still on, still in uniform, still in shock. Everybody was in shock.
"It didn't hit me until I was driving back after the game," said Welch, who lives in San Francisco. "I was thinking about how sad Josie must feel, and I got to the toll booth and the guy didn't know who the heck I was, but I said to him, 'Hey, man, the A's just traded Jose Canseco. How do you feel about that?' The guy just said, 'I'm bummed, dude, I'm bummed.' "
The fans are bummed whenever a star is traded. The Red Sox and the Yankees never did pull the trigger on the Williams-for-DiMaggio trade, and the Cardinals never traded Musial, and the Cubs never traded Banks, but the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth because Harry Frazee needed money to finance a Broadway show, and Country Slaughter wept as he took off his St. Louis Cardinals uniform when he was traded in 1954.
The fans were bummed when Connie Mack strip-mined the original Athletics franchise in Philadelphia because he needed the money, and 50 years later the fans were bummed when Charles O. Finley did the very same thing with the franchise in Oakland.
In the old days, the owners had all the hammers, in the form of lifetime control of a player, but nowadays the players have free agency and they deserve it. But it is understandable when the owners unload a player because he might be hard to sign, the way the Mets did to David Cone last week. At least Cone wasn't standing in the on-deck circle when he was traded to Toronto.
Maybe this was a shrewd ploy by the baseball owners to take the focus off their own divided bumbling, as each of them comes up with some personal and petty reason why Fay Vincent isn't being nice to them in his job as commissioner. They will meet in Chicago tomorrow to try to pull their industry together, but in the meantime they have tossed some scraps to the fans.
The Cone trade and the Canseco trade may only be the first rumblings that these jokers are all going to scuttle their high-priced players to avoid being the first major league team to tap out during a season. Given the economy, it's inevitable, like a game of musical chairs. Somebody's going to go down.
Texas was not prepared to pay whatever massive figures Sierra is going to demand at the end of this season. Canseco's moodiness, his leaving a game in the eighth inning recently, the resurgence of Mark McGwire, the healing of Dave Henderson, all made a Canseco trade even thinkable. And the A's need pitching.
"A lot of players get traded," Welch said, speaking for himself and most of his teammates, "but there's only one Josie. Who's going to come out early to watch us stretch? Who's going to come out and scream at us? They came out to the yard to watch Josie."
Baseball players are realists, not fans. Tony La Russa passed the word around the dugout on Monday night that this was a baseball deal, intended to give the A's two more arms in September and October, and the players have great respect for Sierra. But no matter what happens later, the strange doings on Monday night will always be the Canseco trade.

HEADLINE: ON RACING;
2-Year-Olds and Up Had a Fine Summer

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

 BODY:
If you saw a herd of horses, trainers, riders and grooms driving south along the New York Thruway yesterday, you saw the annual migration from Saratoga Springs back to New York City, where the season will be resumed this afternoon at Belmont Park after five weeks in stately splendor and commercial success under the shade trees upstate. For the next seven weeks, New York will offer you nine races a day six days a week, with 28 stakes and nearly $6 million in purses.
Unfortunately, it can't offer you Saratoga Springs. No knock on the Big Apple or Santa Anita or Arlington or anyplace else. But Jerry Lawrence, general manager of the New York Racing Association, puts it this way: "Saratoga is the most solid race meet in the country, both from a business and esthetic standpoint." 
 The esthetic part is no secret: 30 stakes races in 30 days, star horses from all over the country, everybody gathering in a state-fair mood in the foothills of the Adirondacks a couple of furlongs down Route 9 from the summer homes of the New York City Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra.
The business part is no secret either. Twice as many people a day go to the races upstate than downstate. In the last five weeks, Saratoga drew 761,931 customers, a gain of 4 percent over last year, and they bet $103 million, up 3 percent from last year. On an average afternoon, 25,398 people went to the races in Saratoga, and 6,842 more went to Aqueduct in Queens to watch TV monitors and bet on the races 200 miles away. At betting windows across the state, $294 million was chanced on the Saratoga races in the last five weeks.
"In a period of depressed economic activity," Lawrence said before leaving the land of Adirondack opportunity, "Saratoga was not only able to hold its own, but it thrived. People think there's good value for their entertainment dollar. This thing is working."
So, if it's working for five weeks, why not get greedy and go for six?
"When we feel this meet can be expanded," Lawrence said, "we'll expand it. But I don't know when that will be, if ever. You have to look at the supply of horses, the shrinking foal crop, the 600 people who work for us from downstate, the needs of the community, people going back to school. And you have to worry that the daily average might be diluted. My best guess is we'll be back for five weeks next year."
Meanwhile, Belmont will jazz up its fall agenda to compensate for the fact that it's not Saratoga. It starts today with the Grade I Gazelle Handicap for fillies. Mostly, it will cluster some major races into two horse carnivals billed as "super Saturdays." One will be built around the $500,000 Woodward Stakes on Sept. 19; the other will be built around the $850,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 10 and will serve as the prelude to the Breeders' Cup championships at Gulfstream Park in Florida three weeks later.
At least, they're learning. People may not want to spend an entire day commuting to the track to get immersed in a two-minute horse race, but they'll probably show up if you provide a story line. Racing can't court the public with a pennant race, but it can court the public with a horse race that builds toward another horse race. You know, a scenario like the Triple Crown, the American Championship Racing Series or the Breeders' Cup.
Saratoga, for all its upsets, did produce several solid candidates for this year's Breeders' Cup and maybe even for next year's Triple Crown.
The two big races for 2-year-old fillies, the Adirondack and the Spinaway, were won by Georgia E. Hofmann's undefeated Sky Beauty, although she was disqualified for interference and was demoted to third place on Monday in the Spinaway. The two big races for 3-year-old fillies, the Test Stakes and the Alabama, were won by Earle Mack's November Snow. Both fillies are trained by Allen Jerkens, the man who beat Secretariat twice and Kelso three times. The two main races for 3-year-old colts, the Jim Dandy and the Travers, were won in upsets by Konrad Widmer's Thunder Rumble.
The moment of truth of the Saratoga season? That's easy. The moment when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo drove into the track and watched his first live race in New York State in nine years.
It was the $1 million Travers Stakes, and it was won by the New York-bred Thunder Rumble. But the crucial thing was that the horse was cheered on (and apparently wagered on) by the New York-bred Governor, who also expressed his support for racing in the state and implied that he was no longer aiming to dismantle the New York Racing Association.
Jerry Lawrence was asked if the Governor's visit was truly the highlight of the booming Saratoga season. He coughed diplomatically and replied patriotically: "One of the highlights, for sure."

HEADLINE: Plowshares From Russia

 BODY:
What an astonishing turnaround! For four decades Americans have cowered before the threat of nuclear annihilation from the Soviet Union. They have dug fallout shelters and marched to ban the bomb. They shivered at the 1959 movie "On the Beach" that portrayed a doomed species after nuclear war. And they kept on shivering into the 1980's over theories of a devastating "nuclear winter" and film images of "The Day After."
Meanwhile, hoping to head off Armageddon, America built enormous arsenals of atomic weapons that could reach anywhere. And then, when the enemy just kept building bombs, the strategists put their faith in Star Wars, incredible defenses to bat down an atomic blitz. 
 But now, in the wink of a capitalist's eye, comes a better solution. Under a new agreement in principle, the United States will simply buy many of those feared warheads from Russia and convert them to fuel for nuclear reactors. Dreaded nuclear swords will become peaceful nuclear plowshares. Instead of a nuclear firestorm, we will have a nuclear fire sale.
The agreement will not end all risk of a nuclear holocaust. The United States and Russia each retain thousands of nuclear weapons, more than enough to obliterate the globe. Until those arsenals are reduced to a bare minimum, and until the world finds surer ways to protect against renegade or terrorist use, no one can breathe easily.
But the new agreement will reduce the risk that uranium from thousands of weapons Russia has agreed to dismantle will fall into the wrong hands. And it will give that cash-starved republic a needed infusion of hard currency.
Under a contract to be negotiated within a year, the Department of Energy will buy some 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled Russian warheads over 15 to 20 years, at a cost in the low billions. The uranium will be diluted to make commercial reactor fuel.
The Bush Administration is wisely determined to minimize any adverse economic impact. It swears the agreement will not cost anything because the purchases will be offset by reductions in the Energy Department's reactor fuel production. And the impact on uranium miners would be eased by phasing in the new fuel gradually. Even the American nuclear industry seems pleased.
In Russia, the proceeds can boost economic reforms and ease the transition to a market-based economy. The Russian Federation will also spend some to upgrade the safety of its reactors, a threat to nearby nations.
What a wonderful way for America to help Russia, and America -- and the world.

HEADLINE: 6 Counties That Shine In Ratings For Bonds

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Although fiscal success stories are hard to find in the New York region, they do exist: 6 of the nation's 28 most credit-worthy county governments, for example, are in the suburbs of New York City.
These counties have had sound credit ratings for more than a decade. But experts say their fiscal strength is remarkable now because of the recession, which has been longer and deeper in the New York region than in most of the nation. 
 "There is an institutionalized conservativeness in these counties," said Michael Johnston, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service Inc., which has given its highest rating, Aaa, to the bonds issued by Westchester County in New York and Bergen, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union counties in New Jersey.
"These are mature, well-managed counties that have seen recessions come and go," Mr. Johnston said. "They prepare for them."
They also tend to be rich counties, where tax revenue comes primarily from homeowners rather than from businesses. And they often have governments that have been under the firm control of a single party for many years, thus avoiding the fiscal uncertainty of partisan budget battles.
 
The Westchester Model
 Among all New York-area counties, Westchester fits that mold best, with homes that sell for an average of $325,000, and several enclaves where values exceed $1 million. The county also benefits from taxes paid by more than a dozen large corporate headquarters. Moreover, its Board of Legislators has been in the hands of one party, the Republicans, for two decades.
Westchester has received triple-A ratings from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's since 1971. But Stephen V. Reitano, the county's Commissioner of Finance, said that maintaining the rating had not been simple. Hoping to shift costs to private industry, thus strengthening its own finances, he said, the county turned over its bus system and garbage-burning plant to private companies in the 1980's.
Westchester, with a 1991 budget of $1.1 billion, had a cash surplus of $22 million for that year, he said, up from $17 million in 1990.
Analysts said each of the most fiscally sound counties has maintained cash surpluses -- often building them up in times of economic expansion as an insurance policy against recessions. They also hold borrowing to a minimum.
In Union County, N.J., which has maintained its Aaa rating from Moody's since 1978, officials said they had struggled to maintain a surplus as insurance against unforeseen shortfalls, increasing the county's reserve from $4.5 million in 1990 to $7 million last year.
"The rating agencies expect to see a rainy-day fund, and we've got it," said Ann Baran, the Union County Manager.
 
The Exception
 But in Union, as elsewhere, retaining the highest rating has not been easy during the recession. Among measures Union has taken in the last year are a reduction of 100 county employees, bringing the work force down to 3,100, and an increase in fees for use of its golf course and parks.
Unlike most of the highest-rated counties, Union, which adopted an appointive, county-manager system of government in 1976, has had frequent shifts of control between Republicans and Democrats on its elected Board of Freeholders. But maintaining its Aaa rating has been a consistent priority.
"No one wants to be the one in office when a bond rating is lowered," said Lawrence M. Caroselli, the county's director of finance.
In Morris County, which has maintained its Aaa rating since 1975, officials employ an unusual form of self-policing of their credit standing. To maintain a cash surplus, the county's budget planning process each year deliberately fails to account for interest payments it is assured of receiving on certificates of deposit and other investments, and when the interest checks are received they are deposited in an account set aside as surplus.
Morris County officials said the method was not foolproof. Indeed, because interest rates have plummeted this year, the county's income -- and its surplus -- will be smaller than the $13.1 million it had in the bank at the end of 1991. Glenn Roe, the county's assistant treasurer, estimated that the year-end surplus would be about $8 million, still enough to protect its high credit rating.
 
The Price of Squabbling
 If wealth, stability and conservatism are the keys to a high credit rating, the two counties on Long Island offer lessons in how not to do things. Both are wealthy but have been plagued by political turmoil of late, and both have turned to short-term borrowing to deal with large budget gaps.
Suffolk, for example, has held a Baa1 rating from Moody's and a BBB rating from Standard & Poor's on and off for four years.
Although neither of the rating agencies advise investors not to buy the bonds of any government, Wall Street has traditionally considered a rating of BBB from Standard & Poor's or Baa1 from Moody's to be only slightly above the minimum required to be "investment grade," or reasonably safe.
"Suffolk has historically had a volatile political environment," said Mr. Johnston. He added that the low rating had resulted from periods of fiscal excess, which have left the county without a cash reserve, and the problems faced by the Grumman Corporation, its largest private employer.
Amid much political maneuvering, Suffolk is addressing its budget crisis by raising its sales tax a half percentage point, to 8.5 percent, the maximum allowed by state law, and it is deliberating borrowing $36.5 million to close the 1991 budget gap.
 
The Nassau Nightmare
 The problems in Nassau have been even more stark.
After years of affluence and one-party control of government, by Republicans, a crisis developed last fall when a budget shortfall of more than $100 million loomed in a budget of $1.9 billion. Rather than raise property taxes 24 percent, as proposed by the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, the county Board of Supervisors opted to make across-the-board budget cuts. But the cuts and related layoffs proved so unpopular that further layoffs were rescinded without any compensating budget cuts or tax increases.
In January, saying Nassau was in "the most serious financial stress in years," Moody's lowered its rating from A1 to A. Now, according to county officials, Nassau may be downgraded again.
"We feel we are fiscally strong, but we are greatly concerned," said Kenneth Cynar, a spokesman for Mr. Gulotta. "The problem is that we are bogged down in political bickering."
In the latest move to solve the county's budget problems, the Board of Supervisors last week authorized $675,000 in short-term borrowing to cover the payrolls of certain departments through Oct. 31. But the vote followed heated partisan debate. Although the measure did not result in a further downgrading of Nassau's credit rating, it clearly made the county more vulnerable.
"The need to develop and implement a long-term restructuring plan and find a less fractious decision-making process remains the principal issue" for Nassau, Moody's said in an advisory to its clients issued last week.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Pollack or Cod? Fish or Foul? F.D.A. Takes a Closer Look

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
Beluga caviar is selling for $32 an ounce wholesale and lumpfish roe for $1 an ounce, and the Food and Drug Administration says that someone in the New York region is making a pretty penny selling the latter as the former.
The agency said that if it hadn't been for a change in its own policy, the substitutions might have continued undetected for years. In April 1991, the agency's Commissioner, Dr. David A. Kessler, told the board of the National Fisheries Institute that the F.D.A. intended to find and prosecute institute members who substituted less expensive, less desirable species of fish for more valuable ones. His comment received a standing ovation. 
 Although no laws have been changed and no new ones introduced, and even though the F.D.A.'s budget for seafood enforcement has received only a token increase -- around half a million dollars -- there has been a change in the agency's attitude about enforcement. And while that is no substitute for inspection and regulation of seafood safety, the agency's primary mission, its increased enforcment activity against fraud has been noticed by the industry.
When industry members realized that the Commissioner was serious, they began to pass tips to the agency about deceptive industry practices, the beluga substitutions being one of them. Concern among legitimate businesses had been increasing in recent years, because illegal practices had become more widespread.
"We've been asking the F.D.A. to do a more consistent job on economic enforcement since 1985," said Lee Weddig, executive vice president of the National Fisheries Institute, a trade association in Washington for the fishing business.
"What the industry desires," said Tom Billy, the director of the agency's office of seafood, "is a level playing field." Since Dr. Kessler announced his decision, actions taken against deceptive practices in the fish business have increased; in the New York region, for example, the actions have involved more than $1.5 million worth of fish at wholesale in the first 10 months of the 1992 fiscal year, as against $454,000 for all of the 1991 fiscal year.
Even though the F.D.A. is eager to call attention to the new actions, it refused to name companies involved because many claims have not yet been resolved.
More than a decade ago, the agency decided that it didn't have enough money or people to prosecute businesses that sell five ounces of candy as six, colored water as fruit juice, frozen or processed foods as fresh, or frozen water at lobster prices. Since then, it has concentrated almost all its efforts on food safety and left such fraudulent practices to industry self-policing.
Food safety remains the agency's most important job, Dr. Kessler said, but he added that selective actions against deception are sending a message to the food industry that the F.D.A. means business. The agency has earmarked 1 to 2 percent of its $40.5 million seafood inspection budget, which was increased last year, to provide greater resources for finding and prosecuting fraud. The Agriculture Department is responsible for meat and poultry inspection; the F.D.A. for fish.
Some fraudulent practices in the seafood industry involve things like selling a cheaper fish, like Alaskan pollack, for a more expensive one, like cod; overglazing, or adding water to a frozen product and charging fish prices for the frozen water; using sodium tripolyphosphate excessively to make fish retain water, so it is heavier; overbreading shrimp so the bread crumbs will bring shrimp prices; calling cheaper species by names that imply they are more expensive; selling processed or previously frozen fish as fresh, and engaging in the caviar caper.
Consumers can protect themselves against some deceptive practices by becoming more familiar with fish species, but that is not easy. Mary Snyder, chief of the policy guidance branch of the F.D.A.'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, compares that task to becoming a wine expert.
Many fish have distinctive characteristics, and people who learn them are more likely to be able to detect the substitution of a cheap species for a more expensive one. But some species are so similar that it takes electronic equipment to tell them apart.
Among the most common substitutions are Pacific rockfish, which normally sells at $2 a pound, for red snapper, at $12 a pound; yellowtail at $2 to $3 a pound for mahi-mahi at $6 to $8; mako shark at $4 to $5 for swordfish at $8; John Dory at $2 for orange roughy at $6; Alaskan pollack at $1 for cod at $3 to $4, and sea bass at $2 to $3 for halibut at $8 to $9.
In the pursuit of this sort of fraud, the F.D.A. has uncovered food safety violations as well.
In July, the Government seized about 6,000 pounds of fish that was labeled cod and pollack but was less expensive species. Much of it was badly decomposed. The company from which the fish was seized freezes and compresses fish into blocks, then cuts it into smaller blocks and sells it to institutions. The seized shipment was headed for the University of Illinois. It was not the first time the company had been charged with substituting species.
Seizure is one of several steps the Government can take when statutes are violated. It can also get injunctions to keep companies from repeating illegal actions, and such injunctions can shut down a company. The most serious action is criminal prosecution, which can result in fines and jail sentences.
The F.D.A. can also send warning letters, and it has sent more than 1,000 about overglazing to seafood dealers. Safeway, the supermarket chain, sent copies of the letter to its suppliers and warned that suppliers who continued the illegal practice would be turned in to the F.D.A. It has made good on its threat, and the F.D.A. is investigating.
The increased F.D.A. enforcement has made a difference, said Mr. Weddig of the National Fisheries Institute. "I have had a very marked reduction in the number of complaints from people in the industry who felt they were being taken advantage of," he added. This shift is particularly true in the scallop industry.
The use of sodium tripolyphosphate in scallops to make them retain water has frequently been abused. The F.D.A. has a temporary policy permitting scallops to be soaked in a bath of the compound for 10 minutes and to absorb an additional 3 percent of their body weight in water. Scallops naturally contain 75 to 79 percent water. If they exceed 80 percent water they can no longer be called scallops; they must be called "scallop product" and the amount of added water must be declared on the label.
Recently in New Bedford, Mass., investigators for the F.D.A. found scallops that had been soaked for three to seven days in a bath so warm that they had decomposed.
Charging shrimp prices for bread crumbs is also common. A Federal standard for frozen breaded shrimp requires the product to contain at least 50 percent shrimp. But no standards exist for other frozen breaded seafood. In 1991, the agency seized $5,000 worth of breaded shrimp that was only 41.4 percent shrimp. The agency has also begun enforcing a regulation prohibiting the sale of heat-processed or previously frozen food as fresh. It is also cracking down on the practice of calling refrigerated caviar "fresh" when, in fact, it is preserved in salt.
Perhaps the most esoteric, and potentially the most costly deception, found by the F.D.A. involves sturgeon roe, the only roe that can be called caviar in the United States. A company that was selling whitefish roe under the name American golden caviar can no longer do so. The agency said it is on the trail of several companies in the New York area that sell lumpfish, catfish and salmon roe as caviar. Salmon and lumpfish roe are worth $1 an ounce; under its own name, catfish roe is worthless. Beluga caviar sells for $32 to $35 an ounce wholesale.
The F.D.A. has hired a zoologist to show that some so-called caviar is, in fact, roe from far less costly sources. The agency's New York district director, Edward Warner, said the substitution was "no accident."
Because the agency does not have the resources to pursue all instances of deception, it is training state and local authorities to do the work, too.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 9, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
The Eating Well column in The Living Section last Wednesday referred incompletely to Federal policy regulating the use of the word caviar on food labels. Only sturgeon roe can be called simply caviar. The roe of other fish can be labeled caviar only in conjunction with the name of the fish. For example, caviar made from salmon roe can be marketed as "salmon caviar."

HEADLINE: Dartmouth Redesigns Medical Training To Give Future Doctors a Human Touch

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H., Aug. 28

 BODY:
Nervous students in surgical gloves and aprons filed into a flourescent-lighted laboratory here and lined up alongside steel tables where cadavers lay ready for dissection.
Instead of feeling pressured to maintain a stoic composure, these first-year medical students were encouraged not to suppress their emotions but to cry, laugh, faint or leave the room if they wanted to. None did, but many said they appreciated the "permission" to do so. 
 "It's an eerie feeling when you walk into a room with 22 dead people," said Annie Tewel, a second-year student who coached the new students through their first day of anatomy class. "We try tell them it's O.K. to feel weird, upset about what they're doing."
 
Community Service
 This more sensitive approach to an age-old medical school tradition is part of a new program at Dartmouth Medical School, intended to inspire future physicians to be more human in their relationships with patients. It includes curriculum changes that will have students spend less time in lectures and labs and more time serving the community.
The catalyst for change at Dartmouth is the former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. He has returned to his alma mater to create the C. Everett Koop Institute, which will link the medical school to undergraduate pre-med students. Through it, Dr. Koop hopes to produce a "new kind of medical student," one who is dedicated to promoting health and preventing disease and is sensitive to the social and economic circumstances of patients.
"How do you do this?" he asks rhetorically. "By requiring them to teach preventive medicine to someone once a week for four years and to serve as a social advisers to distressed families."
Starting next year, Dartmouth will require its medical students to teach preventive medicine in nearby public schools as assistants to teachers and as instructors to children. Students will also be linked with needy families from the surrounding area whom they will advise on health care as well as on social services.
 
Mentoring Relationship
 Faculty members will serve as the students' mentors, advising on patient care. "This kind of mentoring relationship can make all the difference in training a medical student to be a good clinician," said Dr. Koop, who will head the institute and teach surgery.
Although few medical schools require students to perform community service, Dr. Koop believes such changes are essential if the nation is to have doctors who can better respond to the social and psychological needs of patients.
Many technological advances in the last decade have changed the way doctors practice medicine, Dr. Koop said, but in their preoccupation with learning and using new techniques, some doctors have lost sight of the human side of the doctor-patient relationship.
As Dr. Koop addressed Dartmouth's newest medical students this week, he reminded them: "There was a time when a medical doctor was one of the most respected professions. Today's physician's claim to that respect has dwindled."
To restore that respect, Dr. Koop and others said, medical schools must create a new model for medical education, one that introduces students to patients earlier and combines scientific instruction with practical experience. Several other medical schools are already doing so.
 
'Information Overload'
 Medical students have traditionally spent the first two years of school in lectures and laboratories and the last two years training in a hospital setting.
"Most people feel there is a tremendous information overload during the first two years of medical school," said Dr. Jonas A. Schulman, associate dean of education at Emory University's School of Medicine in Atlanta. "What all of us are trying to do is get students involved with patients early, before they are able to visualize them as diseases."
At Emory and dozens of other schools around the country, students are being introduced to less passive ways of learning. Harvard's "New Pathway" curriculum, introduced in 1985, places students in small groups rather than large lecture halls and encourages them to develop problem-solving skills by studying hypothetical cases.
Stanford University allows students to choose between a traditional track and a self-designed curriculum that can include electives in arts and literature and opportunities to serve as health care advisers in public schools and clinics for the homeless.
"The time is ripe for change because all parties -- students, faculty and public -- agree the system isn't working," Dr. Koop said. "Nobody doubts patients are dissatisfied. Medical faculties realize they are teaching a group of people who are not satisfied with their education. The average medical student feels disappointed, let down by his education."
The key to changing the system, said Dr. John Duffy of Dartmouth, is to excite students about practicing general medicine.
"What we are hoping to do is to expose students to dilemmas of physicians as generalists, but also give them enough time in this setting to learn the rewards," said Dr. Duffy, a former Assistant Surgeon General under Dr. Koop and the medical school's newly appointed assistant dean of admissions.
Dartmouth students will spend the last two years of their medical education working mostly in out-patient settings rather than in hospitals, where patients tend to be very sick and need the care of specialists. Students will also be given opportunities to work alongside generalists in clerkships.
 
Concern Over Specialization
 Dartmouth's emphasis on the work of such generalists -- family doctors, internists and general pediatricians -- comes at a time when many educators are concerned over the trend toward specialization. In the last decade the percentage of young doctors entering primary care specialities dropped by 14 percent, from 37.3 percent in 1981 to 23.6 percent in 1989, according to a survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges.
While most curriculum changes will not be put into effect until next year, Dr. Koop began spreading his message to first-year medical students here this week. It was a message that most students embraced.
"I think he is absolutely right about the need to restore the public's respect for this profession," said Gary Davis, a first-year student who said he came to Dartmouth because of its emphasis on primary care.
"This is a very confusing time in medicine," said Emily Transue, another first-year student. "I chose Dartmouth because it was looking at what the profession ought to be doing.
"I may feel differently next year if I'm afraid of not passing the boards," she said, referring to a series of competency tests that all medical students must pass at the end of their second year before they can go on. "I believe you can pick up technical skills and information you need to know along the way, but you can't just pick up how to have good relationships with patients. You have to know how to build them."

Beverly Hills' Symbol of 80's Finds Tenant

BYLINE: By Morris Newman

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.

 BODY:
THE sale and leasing of a long-vacant 78,000-square-foot office building has come as a welcome relief for the unaccustomedly soft office market in Beverly Hills. It has also provided a happy ending for a building that spent years in limbo as an asset of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the bailout agency for the savings and loan industry.
The building, the former headquarters of the Columbia Savings and Loan Association on Wilshire Boulevard, had become something of a symbol of both the overconfident 1980's and the chastened 90's. Columbia was a high-flying institution that had invested heavily in the market for high-yield junk bonds in the late 80's. 
 Columbia developed the building, clearly intending it as the company's headquarters, in 1989. Built for $50 million -- a cost of about $640 a square foot -- it was one of the most expensive office buildings of its size ever constructed in the Los Angeles area.
Some of the cost went to the building's architecture, an avant-garde cage covered in marble, granite and copper. Other costs, however, reflected Columbia Savings' extraordinary preoccupation with security. Television cameras scour nearly the whole interior, while certain rooms are reinforced structurally to withstand robbery or even terrorist attack.
It was not terrorists, however, but the failure of the junk-bond market that proved the undoing of Columbia Savings. Like the assets of so many other insolvent savings institutions, the building eventually became the property of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
Last spring, the R.T.C. sold the Columbia Savings building to the Casden Company, a local apartment and office developer based in Beverly Hills, for an undisclosed price, although people close to the transaction indicated the sales price was about $2.5 million -- a fraction of the building's construction cost. The building was built on leased land, reducing its value to an investor.
In June, the new owner leased the entire building for 15 years to International Creative Management Inc., a prominent talent agency formerly based in West Hollywood. The lease agreement is worth $60 million "on a gross rental term basis," according to Alan Casden, chairman of the Casden Company, who described the transaction as "one of the largest leases ever to be done in Beverly Hills -- if not the largest."
The lease of the three-floor former Columbia Savings Building is a significant event in Beverly Hills, which traditionally has been a high-priced office market of small tenants in small, "luxury" office buildings.
Local zoning restricts most new construction to three stories, and few buildings are larger than 100,000 square feet. The typical Beverly Hills tenant is a small professional firm occupying 2,000 to 5,000 square feet, according to Jeff Resnick, a broker with the First Property Realty Corporation of Los Angeles, which represented Casden in lease negotiations.
Historically, vacancy rates generally stayed in the single-digit range. That changed two years ago, when Columbia Savings and the securities firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, two of the city's largest tenants, vacated their buildings and dumped about 200,000 square feet on the market. By July 1991 the Beverly Hills office vacancy rate was 26.2 percent in July 1991, according to the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce. Currently, the vacancy rate is 17.3 percent.
International Creative Management's president, James Wiatt, said he chose Beverly Hills after looking for several years in West Hollywood, where the talent agency had been based for 20 years. "At different points, we had looked for property on which to build in West Hollywood," he said, "but there was nothing available.".
Mr. Wiatt added that the unfinished interior made it possible to design the offices to suit the talent agency, which, he said, "made the building an incredibly attractive proposition for us."
International Creative Management is among the entertainment firms that have recently left Hollywood and West Hollywood to relocate in Beverly Hills. Part of that phenomenon reflects the low level of new construction in those areas, coupled with the availability of attractive new office buildings in the city where many entertainment-industry figures live.
Recent entertainment newcomers to Beverly Hills include Playboy Enterprises Inc., United Talent Agency and Inter Talent Agency Inc.
Irving Azoff, chairman of Giant Records Inc., bought a 32,396-square-foot building on Wilshire Boulevard to house his company, a building also previously owned by Columbia Savings.
The recent spate of entertainment-related leases has not put the Beverly Hills market back on entirely solid ground, however, in light of the continued economic troubles both in California and nationally, according to Mr. Resnick, the office broker.
"I was talking to a landlord who has one million square feet in the city, who told me that one-third of his tenants are in trouble," he said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
Normal Economic Existence Is Years Away in Storm Area

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Despite the vast scale of Federal aid to hurricane victims that President Bush has announced, southern Dade County will take years to rebuild the houses and businesses it needs, say economists, business owners and local officials.
The President, who visited here on Tuesday, took a large first step toward reviving the local economy when he pledged to reconstruct one of its sturdiest props, Homestead Air Force Base, which employed almost 5,000 military personnel. Most roads have been cleared of debris, though not of horrendous traffic, and the battered telephone, electricity and water systems are expected to be strung back together in weeks or a couple of months. 
 But there is much more to the economy here than roads and the military. The homes, shopping strips, farms, offices and all the other places where people live and work are today nothing more than gruel for a front-end loader. The day when the 355,000 people in the disaster zone do regular jobs, shop in regular stores, watch television under a leak-proof roof in a home with a front lawn is a long time off.
 
No Trees; Few Stores
 For example, the area's agricultural base, a source of much money and many jobs, is in ruins. South Dade County had the nation's main concentration of lime groves and produced much of the country's avocados and ornamental house plants. But today the fields west of Homestead, Princeton and Goulds contain little more than broken sticks. While new lime trees can be planted tomorrow, it will take five to eight years before they produce as much fruit as they used to. For avocado trees it will be even longer.
Then there are the stores. Along a 20-mile stretch of U.S. 1, the main business corridor, about 1 store in 50 is open. The vast majority are destroyed or heavily damaged; others that are structurally sound cannot do business because they have no electrical power or because their owners and employees have lost their homes and must now concentrate on finding shelter.
Further, just as customers need stores, stores need customers, and it is hard to see where the people here will get much disposable income to shop with for some time to come. All at once, tens of thousands of people have lost both jobs and houses, and now they are essentially living as Federal welfare recipients.
"We're looking at two, three years to get any kind of normalcy," said the Vice Mayor of Homestead, Ruth Campbell.
Olin P. Wright, a Homestead Councilman, predicted: "Sixty days for necessities. Five years to bring the city back to where it was."
No one knows how the businesses that sustained the communities will respond to what is being called the nation's costliest natural disaster. A few new businesses -- primarily builders and merchants of motor homes that banks and insurance companies can use as mobile offices -- are pouring into the area because it is clear that their products will be needed. But some owners of long-established businesses are talking about leaving for good.
 
The Question of Rebuilding
 Dr. Robert Faine and Curtis Gardner stood recently in the parking lot of the Campbell Square shopping center, where they both had businesses, across from Homestead City Hall. Dr. Faine, a dentist who has practiced here for 21 years, lost his office to the storm, and while he would like to open another, he wonders how long it will be before he sees any but the most desperate patients.
"Do you think that any of these people are going to think about anything that isn't essential for the next year or two?" he asked. "But I've got no place to go. I'm going to try to reopen."
Mr. Gardner owned the Sonny's Real Pit Bar-B-Q restaurant and had 35 employees. The building stands, but its interior is a windswept ruin.
"I lease the premises," Mr. Gardner said. "But what is the lessor going to do? What's the person who owns the square going to do? Why not take what insurance money he can get and get out of Dodge?"
 
Ready to Move Away
 Just southwest of Homestead, in Florida City, the Starvin' Marvin convenience store reopened last Thursday. "We don't know if we'll stay open," said Khalid Hafeez, district manager for the chain. "We are going with the flow of the city of Homestead. Look around now and it's total devastation." He said six of his nine employees there had already quit and moved away.
Anna and Gary McKeehen are waiting for a Federal disaster check so they can move away, too. They had just finished paying off their mobile home, and they had cancelled the insurance policy that the lender had made them take.
Mrs. McKeehen worked in the women's clothing department of a Kmart. "The roof caved in and they lost everything there," she said.
Mr. McKeehen was a landscaper. Now the lawns are too cluttered with junk to groom, and, in any event, he has little left to groom them with.
"I had a utility shed," he said. "I had two mowers, one tractor, two Weed-eaters and two chain saws." After looters came through, he had only one Weed-eater and one mower.
The McKeehens, now living with Mr. McKeehen's father in North Miami, are talking about moving to Tennessee.
 
12 Years of Work -- Gone
 Tom and Carolyn Caldwell, who own an ornamental-plant nursery in Goulds, said that they had too large an investment to move but that it would be many years before they could restore a business it took them 12 years to build.
They had 5,000 anthuriums, a lush green flowering plant, and all were ruined. Mr. Caldwell said that even if he started today it would take 18 months for new anthuriums to grow large enough to sell.
Of tens of thousands of other plants, the Caldwells salvaged only a few Chinese fan palms. "I can never get back to where I was," Mr. Caldwell said.
Stephen Morrell, a former chief economist for Southeast Bank who is now an economics professor at Barry University in Miami Shores, equates the destruction here with that of bombed Japan and Germany in World War II. "Here in Dade County you had a reasonable similar occurrence without the bombs," he said.
The analogy could also apply to the recovery of south Dade County. "Clearly, they recovered, and you have to ask why," Mr. Morrell said. "The talent and skill and dedication of the people had a lot to do with it."
So did foreign aid, which is unlikely to be forthcoming for Dade County, though the Emir of Kuwait today announced a gift of $10 million to help both South Florida and the riot recovery in Los Angeles.
Further, the commitments of prime movers of the economies -- the governments and the banking systems -- were also crucial after World War II.
The Bush Administration, in the person of the President, has signaled such a commitment. On Tuesday, he announced an array of aid measures, including a pledge to have the Federal Government pay virtually all the costs of rebuilding public property and services instead of making the state pay 25 percent, as is customary.
In addition, Florida's big banks, in part to hold onto their big customer base in the county, seem prepared to bend some rules to help the economy. But no one knows whether local lenders alone can finance the replacement of so much that has been destroyed.
"I think you will see an increase in lending," said Buell G. Duncan, chairman of Sun Banks Inc. of Florida. "We're going to be making our own customers some loans you normally wouldn't make. We have an obligation to them. We're all in this together."
 
Buds of Economic Growth
 No one expects economic activity to dry up here. A temporary economy is already taking shape. The pick-up truck peddlers of tar paper and plywood came first; then came the peddlers of generators.
Now other businesses are gearing up. Tim Arb, a Coachmen Industries consultant helping out at Camptown R. V. Country Inc. on U.S. 1, said only 4 of dealership's 100 vehicles, costing $3,000 to $60,000 each, survived the storm. But Coachmen has already shipped 50 new vehicles to Camptown, and Mr. Arb said 200 more were on the way for businesses to use as temporary shops.
Plenty of people are finding work here, though not the same people -- the clerks and Hispanic farm workers -- who made up much of the pre-storm economy. Electricians, plumbers, carpenters and cabinet makers, many of whom had been laid off in Florida's recession-battered economy, are pouring into the region.
In Florida City, Mike Cook, a regional manager for Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc., is repairing his roof himself, but inside the house there is much more work needed, and he has hired Jerry Hale, a general contractor from Illinois, to do it. Mr. Hale, who had no place to stay when he came down on Friday, has pitched a tent on Mr. Cook's lawn.
"I booked $50,000 in work the first day," Mr. Hale said. "I've got 16 guys coming down from Illinois. From my experience, you're looking at three years of rebuilding here."
In the end, the strength of this area's recovery lies in the hopes of the people, and some here have still have plenty. George Cooper lost a popular restaurant and food market in Princeton. Next door on one side is an irrigation-supply dealership that lost his roof, Mr. Cooper said of the dealer, "He was open for business six hours after the hurricane."
Mr. Cooper has has reopened his own business, too, using one tent for a kitchen and another for the eating area.
"This place, in two or three years, you won't be able to recognize it," he said. "That was the first hurricane since 1965. We've got the best weather in the world November through April. In New York, you have bad weather every year."

Larry Hogue, a homeless man who until recently terrorized the Upper West Side neighborhood that he made his home, is among the growing ranks of mentally ill people who are also addicted to drugs. Although his is an extreme case, Mr. Hogue represents the sometimes dangerous fusion of two trends: the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill and the rise of cheap crack cocaine. A1

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
In Election Year, Politics Greases Arms Decisions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The sale of F-16's to Taiwan announced by President Bush today is the latest in a series of arms decisions that experts say appear to be based as much on political considerations as on military ones.
In trying to fend off Congressional pork-barrel programs, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has argued that the Pentagon is not a social welfare agency and that decisions on new weapons program and arms sales should be made strictly on national security grounds. 
 But recently there have been a number of developments suggesting that economic and electoral factors figure in the Administration's decision-making. Even when the Administration has yielded to the will of the Congress it has sought a way to capitalize politically.
 
Reversal on Tanks
 On Friday, Vice President Dan Quayle announced during a trip to Michigan, where he visited employees at a tank plant, that the Pentagon would spend $250 million to begin work on upgrading the Army's M-1 tanks. Mr. Cheney and his top civilian aides had previously argued that the end of the Cold War had made the upgrade unnecessary and had refused to spend the money Congress had appropriated for this purpose.
The White House pledged on Tuesday to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, which was a candidate for closing before it was devastated by Hurricane Andrew. Though Mr. Cheney argued there was a military rationale for the rebuilding, he acknowledged today in a television interview today on Cable News Network that concern for the economy of South Florida was a major consideration.
The likelihood of a $5 billion sale of 72 F-15's to Saudi Arabia also has potential benefits in Missouri, Connecticut and California. Mr. Cheney argued for the sale today, asserting that the move would strengthen ties with the Saudis. But the Bush Administration has been under intense pressure from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which is based in St. Louis, and Missouri lawmakers to sell the planes so that the aircraft company can keep open its production line.
In all cases, Administration officials insist that the decisions are, as Mr. Cheney has put it, "consistent" with American national security interests. But they do not deny that the moves have important political benefits for the Administration.
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee and who has been mentioned as a possible Defense Secretary in a Clinton Administration, was less charitable.
He told reporters that the sale of planes to Taiwan was driven by politics and that the decision to rebuild Homestead was "bad stuff" since the base had been a candidate for closure.
"He's got himself stuck by being slow on the response" to the hurricane, Mr. Aspin said of President Bush. "He is now overcompensating by talking about rebuilding Homestead."
The Administration's recent decision to upgrade the M-1 tanks illustrates the White House skill at taking credit for a move it has previously opposed. For years, lawmakers from Michigan and other Middle West states put money in the Pentagon budget for the upgrade of the tanks. But Mr. Cheney refused to spend it, arguing that the Pentagon could better use shrinking budget elsewhere. And when Congress appropriated the money anyway, he refused to spend it.
Earlier this year, the Bush Administration proposed that Congressionally appropriated funds for the tank upgrade be "rescinded," the procedure the Defense Department uses to avoid spending money that lawmakers tell them to spend. Congress refused to go along.
On Friday Mr. Quayle announced the decision to spend $250 million during a visit to a General Dynamics plant in Warren, Mich. The sum is only a down payment on the multibillion-dollar program that would be required to carry out the tank upgrade, which would involve fitting the tanks with new guns and electronic systems. "This should be welcome news to the Warren tank facility," Mr. Quayle said.
Though they have gone along with the decision to spend the $250 million, Mr. Cheney and top civilians are believed to still oppose the tank upgrade program. But now that Mr. Quayle's has given it such a strong endorsement, it will be more difficult for the Pentagon political leadership to block it.
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has led the effort to get the Pentagon to upgrade the M-1 tanks, welcomed the decision, but objected to Mr. Quayle's spin.
"This is exactly the opposite of what they have been saying for the past three years," Senator Levin said.

HEADLINE: As Quake Wreaks Havoc, Chamorro Appeals to U.S.

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 2

 BODY:
A natural disaster added to the pressures facing President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro today as she struggled to deal with demands from Washington that she rid her Government of the influence of the opposition Sandinista Front.
On Tuesday night, giant waves set off by an earthquake lashed most of the Nicaraguan coast. Estimates of the disaster's toll, given today as 40 or more, were significantly increased late tonight. The Civil Defense chief, Lieut. Guillermo Guevara, was quoted in news agency reports as saying there were about 100 dead, 150 missing, 4,200 evacuated and 16,000 homeless. 
 Mrs. Chamorro had expressed intense frustration. In a radio broadcast soon after the disaster, she pleaded for the United States to restore its financial aid to Nicaragua, calling for an end "to problems and restraints" by "those who have had a commitment to our people."
The huge waves, called tsunamis and popularly known as tidal waves, were set off by an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale with its epicenter about 35 miles off the Pacific coast. The waves, estimated at 20 to 30 feet high, struck the coast from the port of Corinto in the north to San Juan del Sur on the Costa Rican border.
The damage took place in an area several hundred yards wide along several hundred miles of shoreline, including fishermen's homes and boats, and some small hotels.
 
Swept Out of Their Homes
 Most of the victims were swept out of their homes and yards by the huge waves.
The Bush Administration had held up the $104 million in aid to Nicaragua remaining for this fiscal year last spring at the request of Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who has complained of continued Sandinista power, especially in the army and the police, and the delays in return of property confiscated by the Sandinistas when they ruled the country from 1979 until 1990, when they were defeated in elections by a center-right coalition headed by Mrs. Chamorro.
She retained several senior Sandinista security officials, including the army commander, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra.
Officials of the new leadership described the policy as an effort to forge a government of national unity and heal the wounds of the Nicaraguan civil war, but not the least of their calculations was the fear that without concessions the Sandinistas would not allow Mrs. Chamorro to take office. Whatever the reason, the armed forces and police have remained Sandinista strongholds.
The continued presence of Sandinistas in top posts has angered many of Mrs. Chamorro's supporters, and the State Department, after long supporting the Chamorro Government in public while criticizing it in private, has recently begun to say openly that it shares Mr. Helms's concerns. It announced on Tuesday that it was sending a delegation to Nicaragua today to discuss the issues raised by Mr. Helms, a conservative Reoublican.
Mrs. Chamorro recently had begun a series of moves that seemed to be aimed at meeting at least some of the criticisms from her own right wing and the United States, which organized and financed the contra rebellion against the Sandinistas during the Reagan Administration.
They included plans to announce the replacement of the police chief, Rene Vivas, a Sandinista often accused of using repressive tactics against former contras and of not obeying the Chamorro Government on matters like protecting property rights.
But on Tuesday, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista leader who lost the presidency to Mrs. Chamorro, said the Sandinista Front did not intend to allow the Government to replace Mr. Vivas. Mr. Ortega, the army commander's brother, suggested that if Mrs. Chamorro gave in to American pressure, the people would demand that she step aside. He denied that he was threatening a coup.
The money that Mrs. Chamorro wants released is the unused part of a $731 million, two-year aid package. The Government feels it must get the money soon to protect its currency-stabilization program.
In a further effort to resolve some of the issues linked to the aid cutoff, Mrs. Chamorro's chief minister and son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo, announced this week that the Government was working on a plan to indemnify owners of property confiscated in the Sandinista era without cause but which cannot now be returned to the original owners.
This would include property that is in the hands of third parties, including peasant cooperatives set up under the Sandinista land redistribution program. It would also include many urban tracts that the Sandinistas gave or sold cheaply to their followers.
Mr. Lacayo said that one method being considered to compensate those owners was giving them shares in state companies scheduled for privatization.
 
Corruption Is Charged
 The State Department decided to take a more public position of criticism toward the Chamorro policies after the release of a long report on Nicaragua prepared by Deborah De Moss, an aide to Mr. Helms, on behalf of the Republican staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
It urges, among other things, that aid to Nicaragua not be resumed until properties of several hundred Nicaraguans who became United States citizens are returned to them.
It complains of General Ortega's continued command of the army; contends corruption, some of it involving American aid, is "rampant," and charges that there has been a campaign to assassinate former contras.

HEADLINE: Late Buying Sends Dow Up 24.05, to 3,290.31

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose sharply yesterday after a late surge of buying in transportation, medical and retailing stocks helped to break the market's summer lull.
The stock market was also buoyed by further gains in bond prices and a steadier dollar. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 24.05 points to close at 3,290.31. Advancing issues led declining ones, 1,110 to 617, on the New York Stock Exchange, while volume rose to 187.5 million shares, from 174.4 million on Tuesday.
Chartists noted that the stock market tended to rise a few days before the Labor Day weekend. And traders said yesterday's market action suggested that investors might be expecting a resumption of economic growth, even though few recent statistics pointed to a strong rebound.
"There's the feeling the economy may be bottoming out," said Paul Hennessey, a vice president in trading at the Boston Company.
The August employment report, due tomorrow, may set the tone for investors' perceptions. So far, "it still feels as if momentum is slowing," said Ron Hill, investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
After a surge led by airline stocks Tuesday, the Dow Jones transportation index posted another steep rise of nearly 30 points. Gains in that index usually bode well for the market.
"Transports are cyclical," said David Bostian of Herzog Heine & Geduld. "In general, there's the perception that maybe the economy will build strength."
The Dow Jones industrial average traded in a 10-point range through early afternoon, then began to tick up steadily until the closing bell.
Mr. Bostian said some buyers might be encouraged because "the market is not buckling." In addition, the steadier dollar could give the Federal Reserve room to lower interest rates again, he said.
 
Gains by Airlines
 Within the transportation group, AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 2 1/4, to 59 5/8, while British Airways gained 2 1/4, to 47 1/2. American President added 1 1/2, to 42 3/4, and Yellow Freight gained 1, to 26 1/2.
Retail stocks rose on traders' expectations of strong gains when they report monthly sales figures today. The Limited rose 1 1/4, to 23 3/4; Merry-Go-Round Enterprises gained 1, to 13, and the Gap was up 1 1/2, to 35 5/8.
In the medical sector, Critical Care America rose 2 3/8, to 38, while Medical Care International was up 2 7/8, to 52 1/4. And Oxford Health Plans added 1 1/2, to 30 3/4. It said that enrollment in its health plans passed the 100,000 mark on Aug. 1 and that the pace of growth could be sustained.
Still, United States Surgical lost 2 1/2, to 73 1/2, after Johnson & Johnson, the parent of Ethicon, a competitor, said it would announce a significant development in endoscopic surgery.
CBS rose 2 7/8, to 200. Smith Barney upgraded its recommendation to buy from hold on the stock.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.91 points, to 417.98, while the Big Board's composite index gained 0.99, to 230.01. Among secondary issues, the American Stock Exchange index was up 1.29, to 382.73, and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks gained 5.64, to 571.25.

HEADLINE: No Inquiry On Neil Bush

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The Justice Department has let a 15-day deadline pass without filing a formal notice of a preliminary investigation of Neil Bush's role in a Colorado banking scandal, according to an order entered by a Federal court.
The three-judge court, which is responsible for the appointment of independent counsels, issued the order in response to a request by Frank Mandanici, a lawyer in New Haven whose late father was the mayor of Bridgeport from 1975 to 1981. 
 Mr. Mandanici asked Attorney General William Barr in July for an investigation by an independent counsel of possible crimes by the President's son in the collapse of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, in Denver.
Mr. Mandanici's older brother, John, was convicted of making false statements in an investigation in 1983, and he said his goal was to see that the son of a Republican President gets the same treatment as the son of a Democratic mayor. The law gives the Attorney General 15 days after receiving such a request to decide whether the facts warrant a preliminary investigation.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
Money, and Gripes, in Loan Program

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
When a natural disaster strikes, many businessmen and uninsured homeowners turn to the Federal Government for help in rebuilding, and in the 39 years of its existence the Government's main disaster loan program has distributed more than $15 billion.
Along with that record of accomplishment, however, is red tape that frustrates many applicants and and an overall loss rate of 9 percent. 
 Hurricane Andrew's destructive path through Florida and Louisiana is expected to generate $500 million to $700 million in disaster loan applications, according to estimates by officials of the Small Business Administration, which runs the loan program. A spokesman for the agency said that it had loan officers at 16 temporary disaster assistance centers in Florida and five in Louisiana and that they had issued almost 4,500 loan applications.
"We will be handing out checks for our first loans in Florida on Thursday," said Patricia Saiki, administrator of the Small Business Administration, responding to criticism that the Bush Administration's response to the disaster had dangerously lagged.
While the Federal Emergency Management Agency coordinates immediate relief efforts from clearing debris to providing food and shelter and emergency money grants to needy families, the disaster loans are the main direct Federal assistance to businesses seeking to rebuild and to homeowners seeking to replace uninsured personal property and cover the uninsured costs of rebuilding their homes.
 
$40 Million for Temporary Help
 Ms. Saiki said the agency was expecting to spend $40 million to keep 600 special temporary employees on the job reviewing loan requests in south Florida and Louisiana for up to six months.
Terry McKelvey, who lost both his restaurant and home when Hurricane Hugo struck Sullivans Island, S.C., in 1989, had nothing but praise for the help the disaster loan program gave him and his wife in rebuilding their home. But he was less than pleased about the volume of paperwork and the criteria he faced when trying to borrow to rebuild his restaurant.
"It was very frustrating because they seemed to be offering us an opportunity to get back on our feet with low-interest loans, but they wound up telling us we didn't have the cash flow to handle a loan," he said, referring to the rejected loan for the restaurant. "If we could have gotten our business going again, we would have had the cash flow. But they didn't see it that way. I think they were so afraid of fraud that they just labeled us as people out to take something."
Agency officials said the program approved loans only for those whose applications show "a reasonable ability to repay." The disaster loan program has an estimated 9 percent rate of loss over its lifetime, including loans that Congress has voted to forgive.
"We understand that we run a risky loan program," said Bernard Kulik, the Small Business Administration's assistant administrator for disaster assistance. "For one thing, we don't take collateral for our loans, and we base them on cash flow."
What has happened over the years, Mr. Kulik and other Federal officials said, is that Congress has voted to wipe out all or part of outstanding disaster loan balances. It happened after Hurricanes Betsy in 1965 and Camille in 1969, for example. The largest total forgiveness, and the last one, came months after Hurricane Agnes in 1972, when Congress voted to forgive what amounted to $478 million out of $1.02 billion in loans.
Discounting the forgiven loans, the loss rate for disaster loans would be about the same as those on other loan programs of the Small Business Administration, just under 2.5 percent annually, said a spokesman for the agency, Mike Stamler.
The Small Business Administration Disaster Loan Program, created in 1953, is the primary form of Federal disaster loan assistance to individuals and businesses outside of farming, though the Federal Emergency Management Agency's grant program is larger by far. According to a General Accounting Office study, F.E.M.A. spent $2.1 billion in helping victims of both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California in 1989 while the S.B.A. program gave out $1.3 billion in loans in those disasters.
The loans cover only uninsured losses with a limit of $20,000 for personal property, $100,000 for homes and $500,000 for businesses. The program also provides businesses with loans of up to $500,000 to offset the "economic injury" from slumping sales resulting from a disaster.
The terms and interest rates vary, extending up to 30 years and going as low as 4 percent for homeowners and business owners who are unable to get credit elsewhere. Homeowners with other sources of credit pay 8 percent interest and businesses pay 6 percent. At present, about 80 percent of the program's 141,000 outstanding loans are to homeowners for home repairs and rebuilding, Mr. Kulik said. But in dollar value, the $3.2 billion loan portfolio is split about evenly between homeowners and businesses.
So far this year, the program's average loan for home rebuilding is $23,000 and its average loan to businesses is $57,400.
The program's past is littered with stories of abuses growing out of the pressure for quick loans after a disaster. There have also been many occasions of lax internal controls and of the frequent need to use temporary employees to process applications.
Controls have been strengthened in recent years, but that has prompted many officials, like Mayor Joseph Riley of Charleston, S.C., to assert that the paperwork and fine print make it difficult for "mom and pop businesses" to take advantage of the program.
Mr. Kulik defended the policy, saying, "Some expect the Government to do whatever it takes to make them whole again."

HEADLINE: A Jail Garden's Harvest: Hope and Redemption

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The leeks, raspberries, swiss chard and rose fir potatoes that Cathrine Sneed and her inmate gardeners coax from the soil are not merely fruits and vegetables.
Rather they are metaphors for what went wrong in a prisoner's troubled past, lessons about how to live a healthy and honorable life, and proof that love and work make a garden flourish. 
 A 12-acre farm at a jail south of here in San Bruno and a half-acre strip of land behind a bakery at the tattered edges of San Francisco are Ms. Sneed's classrooms.
At the farm, the 37-year-old Ms. Sneed combines her careers as prison counselor and horticulturist by teaching gardening to county inmates, most of them serving four-to-six-month sentences for drug offenses. At the garden, she offers recently released prisoners a way to avoid the hazards of the street, to earn a little money and to continue planting, growing and harvesting.
A product of the hard streets who ran away from a troubled New Jersey family of 14 children, Ms. Sneed avoids the pieties that so often permeate jail-house rehabilitation. There is no need to preach about hope and redemption, she says; the vegetables, fruits and flowers preach for her.
 
Nature's Quiet Lessons
 First, there is the peace of a garden, so still that one can hear the butterflies. Long before they discover the therapeutic value of weeding and planting, she said, the prisoners delight in being away from the clatter of jail.
The simple process of weeding is a good place to start re-examining a life gone wrong. The weeds are whatever got in the way: smoking crack or whoring or stealing. Once they are gone, no longer leaching water and nutrients from all that grows around them, the vegetables and fruits thrive.
And what could offer a clearer message than cutting away old leaves and flowers so there is room for fresh growth?
"I take these big, giant crack dealers and show them the roses we've cut back," Ms. Sneed said. "And they say, 'These ain't no roses; these are dead sticks.' " So I say: 'You watch these dead sticks. They're just like you; get rid of the dead stuff and the new stuff will grow.' "
 
Helping Is Healing
 Less metaphysical lessons await the harvest. Produce from the prison garden, where more than 150 male and female inmates work each day, is donated to soup kitchens and AIDS pantries.
"They're here because they hurt people," Ms. Sneed said of her jail-house gardeners. "Now they have a chance to help. That's part of the healing."
The city garden was the brainchild of Elliot Hoffman, the founder and president of the Just Desserts bakery chain, a $15-million-a-year business. The garden's produce is sold, thus introducing the newly-released inmates to the rewards of commerce.
Mr. Hoffman was the garden's first client, buying fruit for his tarts and muffins, and rosemary for the bread baked at Tassajara, an independent bakery that Just Deserts recently purchased. Chez Panisse, Berkeley's temple of California cuisine, was Ms. Sneed's second client. Between them, Just Desserts and Chez Panisse buy about $100 worth of produce a week from Ms. Sneed's garden.
 
Inspiration in the Land
 The city garden, a recent addition to Ms. Sneed's horticulture program, came into being serendipitously.
The jail farm began in 1983, after Ms. Sneed read "The Grapes of Wrath," John Steinbeck's tale of itinerant California farm workers, while recuperating from a life-threatening kidney disease. She persuaded her boss, Sheriff Michael Hennessy, that inmates would find inspiration in the land.
The sheriff, her longtime mentor and friend, was an unconventional administrator. He also feared that Ms. Sneed was dying, and that if the garden was her last wish, he had no choice but to grant it.
As Ms. Sneed recovered, her horticulture program flourished. She saw mean, lazy inmates change before her eyes. Men and women who at first could not focus for more than a few minutes on weeding a strawberry patch soon lingered at the end of the day, unwilling to abandon a project that wasn't finished.
While learning about work, the inmates also learned about hope, but that lesson proved a cruel joke once they were released, with nowhere to go but the same streets that had already been their downfall.
"I could help get them some clothes, maybe a little job," Ms. Sneed said. "I could find out what the pimp had done with their babies. But I was not impacting their lives. When they went back to the world, they were squashed like bugs."
Enter Mr. Hoffman. Invited to tour the jail one day last year, he was impressed by the garden, but even more impressed by the intensity of the counselor who ran it.
Ms. Sneed was hoping to sweet-talk Mr. Hoffman out of some extra money for her jail garden, which operates on a shoestring of county funds and donations. But he started talking about this garbage-strewn lot behind his bakery. "Yeah, yeah," Ms. Sneed remembers muttering. "What I need is a check."
But she soon saw what he had in mind: sort of a halfway house for recently released jail-house gardeners. It took four months to clean the lot and find donated plants and tools. Then Ms. Sneed planted a garden and encouraged her graduates to come and work.
The garden's sales are barely enough to pay expenses, but by hounding foundations and local businesses for grant money, some months Ms. Sneed is able to pay the 40-odd gardeners as much as $60 for a 20-hour workweek. And even when the grant money runs out, as it did recently, they come around anyway, for the sunshine, the feel of dirt under their fingernails, the company of others who are struggling to stay sober, safe and out of jail.
Mr. Hoffman has made the ex-convicts welcome. They bring their children to play in the dirt or watch the bakers knead dough. They use the bathrooms and help themselves to day-old bread and cake, which is often the mainstay of their diets.
Some of the men and women at the garden have wound up employed at the bakery, although Ms. Sneed and Mr. Hoffman note that it is unrealistic to think that most of them are ready for mainstream work. Mr. Hoffman said that the first two ex-inmates he hired as bakers were chronically late or absent and had to be dismissed. But they continue to hang out at the garden, have not wound up back in jail and have not been destructive to others.
"We call them the strawberry men," Mr. Hoffman said. "They will never hold down a regular job, but they are productive in a special environment."
The very best of Ms. Sneed's gardeners are getting salaried jobs these days, thanks to a joint venture between the San Francisco County Sheriff's office and the city's Department of Public Works. For 10 weeks, as part of a demonstration project, eight of the former inmates were paid $8 an hour to plant 650 trees around the city. The city was happy with the work, and last month it agreed to hire 10 tree planters for three years.
Recently, as she drove from the city garden to the jail farm, Ms. Sneed detoured past a housing project here, its walls scarred with graffiti and its courtyards crowded with unemployed men and women, up to no good and about out of hope. This is one of the places Ms. Sneed had sent the members of her Tree Corps to plant saplings, and she wondered whether the young trees would survive the vandalism that is endemic here.
The trees looked fine this bright morning, and Ms. Sneed marveled that there seemed to be less litter than usual on the curb strips. That could be wishful thinking, she said, but what of it?
"I want them planting these trees not just because it's a job," Ms. Sneed said, "but because it is something that will last, that gives hope to other people. Instead of being a crack dealer, you can be a tree planter. That is the message my students have to communicate."

HEADLINE: U.S. Cooling Toward Sandinistas' Successors

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Nicaragua's relations with Washington have badly deteriorated over accusations that President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has ceded too much authority to the leftist Sandinista Front.
A little more than a year ago, President Bush welcomed Mrs. Chamorro to the White House with promises of loans and trade concessions. But today, as Managua attempted to deal with a powerful earthquake unleashing giant waves that smothered several towns on the Pacific coast, Washington's preliminary offer of $25,000 worth of tents, water and food was viewed by Nicaraguan officials as inadequate. 
 Without fanfare, the Administration in June simply stopped spending the last $104 million of a two-year $731-million aid package for Nicaragua, and on Tuesday the State Department reversed its policy of publicly praising the Chamorro Government. Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, condemned Managua for failing to prosecute those responsible for the reported killings of former members of the contra army that fought to overthrow the Sandinistas with United States support in the 1980's.
The State Department's criticism came in response to a Senate report written by an aide to Senator Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina, alleging that Mrs. Chamorro was a figurehead manipulated by the Sandinistas.
The 144-page report alleged that the Chamorro Government has failed to return tens of thousands of homes confiscated by the Sandinistas and broken its promise to protect contras who laid down their arms. It also assembled a list of 217 former contras who have been assassinated since Mrs. Chamorro took office.
Seeking to avert problems with Mr. Helms and highlight its agreement with many of the report's conclusions, the State Department sent a delegation to Managua today led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State John F. Maisto to demonstrate unhappiness with Mrs. Chamorro's policies.
Mr. Boucher said today that the Administration would be willing to grant more aid, depending on Nicaragua's needs. He added that the Maisto delegation would discuss with Nicaraguan authorities "strengthening democracy, human rights and the rule of law, professionalizing the security forces, returning confiscated properties or compensating rightful owners, and economic growth and development."
Ernesto Palazio, Managua's Ambassador to the United States, voiced little enthusiasm for Washington's response to the disaster. "We need more support," he said. "Certainly we expect our friends to come to Nicaragua's aid now that we face this new tragedy."
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, called the initial American aid response "ridiculous."
"Its become an outrageous situation," he said. "The Administration appears to like the theory of national reconcilation more than the practical reality."

HEADLINE: Investing Into the Wind: An Odd, Volatile Game

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
In May 1991, about 80 homeowners in the Hampshire Homes development of southern Miami filed suit against the Lennar Corporation, accusing Florida's largest home builder of shoddy construction with substandard materials. The company fixed some decoration and trim, but said the suits were groundless and the homes structurally sound.
Then came last week's hurricane. 
 Lennar's stock, which had reached $30.125 last Thursday in anticipation of South Florida's rebuilding, fell $1.625, to $26.625 yesterday, as lawyers announced that more homeowners, their houses ruined by the storm, had joined the suit. Lennar's decline on the New York Stock Exchange came despite the market's strong advance.
 
When Bad Is Good
 Whatever the case's outcome, Lennar's situation illustrates the perils of Wall Street's penchant for death-and-destruction plays. No matter how macabre the news, traders always look for something to celebrate. Makers of gas masks and poison antidotes, for example, won favor during the Persian Gulf war.
And after Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida, construction, development and building-supply stocks all surged in anticipation of the rebuilding to follow. Lennar stoked the fires by responding with plans for thousands of new homes and apartments worth at least $100 million.
But several analysts say traders and brokers have gotten carried away, both in bidding many stocks up and in beating Lennar back down.
"Emotion got the better of reason," said Richard M. Lilly, the research director at J W Charles Securities, the second-largest brokerage firm based in Florida. "Literally, as soon as I got into the office, I had 100 of this firm's brokers calling me, asking how to profit from the hurricane."
Mr. Lilly, whose own house was damaged by the storm, said that several stocks were still puffed up with the recent winds. "They better be praying for another hurricane next week or they're going to be in a world of trouble," he said.
Louis S. Robles, a Miami lawyer, said that 100 homeowners in the West Kendall section of Hampshire Homes were now taking part in the suit. Five other Lennar developments are likely to join the suit, whose claims could run into tens of millions of dollars, he said. Mr. Robles spoke of inferior wood, nails and bolts, and of roofs only casually attached to homes.
"We were asking Lennar to fix the properties," he said from the telephone in his Jeep Cherokee as he headed toward another Lennar project. "Now we're asking for a lot more. Plus we want consequential damages, evacuation costs, loss of personal property, personal injury."
Lennar responded to the initial complaints by repairing what it called the fascia, or decorative trim, on some homes -- "not of a structural nature at all," said Alan J. Pekor, the company's financial vice president.
Since the hurricane, he said, the Miami-based company has been occupied with relief efforts, trucking food and water to its damaged developments. "Our people have been focused on dealing with human needs, not lawsuits," Mr. Pekor said. The lawsuit is so lacking in merit, he said, that Lennar will seek compensation for its defense costs.
Despite the economic slowdown, Lennar's profits rose 55 percent last year to $21 million, mostly from strong results at the mortgage and property-management subsidiaries.
Some investors say they are paying more attention to the healthy balance sheet than to calamities and lawsuits.
"I think some people were under the impression that the entire state is devastated, and Lennar gets to rebuild every home they ever built," said Katherine A. Collins, a manager at the Fidelity mutual fund group, the second-largest institutional holder of Lennar shares.
Despite the hurricane damage and lawsuit, she added, "if you liked Lennar before, there's no reason not to like it now."

HEADLINE: 63 Days After Its Cash Ran Out, California Passes Austere Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept. 2

 BODY:
California's protracted budget crisis sputtered to an unhappy end early this morning when the weary State Assembly capitulated to Gov. Pete Wilson and approved the final elements of an austere budget 63 days after the state ran out of cash.
But the final package was so tenuous, with a pitifully small cash reserve of only $435 million in a $57.4 billion budget, that fiscal experts here warned that the State Government was likely to go broke again by spring and have to go through yet another painful round of cutting, barring an unexpectedly strong recovery from recession. 
 While the Republican Governor stared down the Democratic-controlled Legislature, he had little to gloat over. He will preside over the erosion of vaunted programs built under many predecessors, both Republican and Democrat, that helped make California prosperous and golden.
 
Prospects Look Bleak
 Under Governor Wilson, the gates to the state colleges will narrow, the poor, blind and disabled will find their meager allotments cut even more, and local governments will be forced to shut libraries and parks and cut back on police, fire and sanitation services.
Moreover, there was very little in the budget that addressed the underlying "structural" problems of California, a state long able to expect both rich public services and low taxes because of the relentless economic growth it has enjoyed since World War II.
Those problems date back at least to 1978, when voters passed Proposition 13, limiting the ability of local governments to raise property taxes and shifting much of the burden of government to the state. That was followed by other voter initiatives reserving fixed amounts of state support for schools and other purposes. Now, with revenues falling and the economy of the state mired deep in the post-cold-war recession with little hope of speedy recovery, the entire house of cards is collapsing.
 
$3.4 Billion in I.O.U.'s

 But for now, Californians can breathe a sigh of relief at the end of the state's worst fiscal crisis since the Depression.
State Controller Gray Davis today began to pay the vendors, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and others who have not been paid for weeks. But he said he would still have to issue warrants, or i.o.u.'s, for a few more days until the state could borrow $3.5 billion on Wall Street. Major banks said today that they would resume honoring the i.o.u.'s, $3.4 billion of which have been issued since July 1.
After signing the budget at 1:45 this morning, Governor Wilson called it a "very difficult budget that reflects the trying times that we are experiencing, the worst economic times since the Great Depression."
He said he was pleased it contained no new taxes or deficit spending and chided the Legislature, saying he would have accepted this budget in June. "I am content with the result," he said. "I am not content it took two and a half months to get it."
 
Local Taxes May Rise
 While the budget includes nothing labeled as new taxes, it did include many higher fees that critics said amounted to the same. Also, with the state's having diverted $1.3 billion in property taxes away from local governments in order to balance the state budget, many local governments are likely to try to raise taxes and fees.
The end came shortly after midnight after a day of intense negotiations during which the Democratic and Republican leaders, Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. and Assemblyman Bill Jones, tried to obtain some facing-saving concessions from Mr. Wilson to make the legislative surrender seem less ignominious than it was.
The Governor did grant minor concessions, and the 80-member Assembly, in a fitful dispirited session passed the Governor's plan, 55 to 9, with some agreed-upon amendments on educational financing. The Senate concurred a short while later, with not a vote to spare.
"Clearly this measure represents a compromise," Mr. Brown told a hushed chamber. "It represents the best decision we could make tonight to solve the budget problem."
Democrats gave up weeks ago on trying to persuade the Governor to raise taxes. His popularity plummeted after he raised taxes by $7 billion to resolve a $14 billion budget gap last year. The dispute, rather, boiled down to how to allocate school spending and how the budget would affect such spending in future years.
Unlike most other government services, the Governor's budget increases school spending this year to keep per-pupil spending even with last, to accommodate 200,000 new pupils. But it does so with a complex mechanism that "recaptures" excess state support given school districts last year, then "lends" them $973 million this year, to be repaid in later years.
The Legislature reluctantly agreed today to this plan, which was vigorously opposed by the powerful California Teachers Association and other school interests because they feared it would permanently reduce the base for school spending in the future.
But they obtained a few concessions, lengthening the pay-back period from two to three years, absolving the obligation to repay should there not be enough money to provide the same per-pupil spending as the previous fiscal year, and specifying a certain base for financing should the courts overturn the recapture provision.
The Governor also agreed to calculate school attendance figures on which spending is based on a daily rather than hourly basis and to increase community college fees from $6 to $10 rather than $12 a credit. The Governor had earlier retreated on a proposal to force 110,000 children to delay starting kindergarten until next year.
 
A Losing Battle
 "We fought hard and essentially lost," Bill Honig, the elected Superintendent of Public Instruction, said in an interview. He said that by holding school spending essentially flat, California would continue to fall behind other states in school support, falling from 34th to 39th among the states in per-pupil spending, just above South Carolina. New Jersey is No. 1, and New York second. Twenty years ago, California spent 15 percent above the national average.
In an interview, Delaine Eastin, the chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, said the education forces had given up because the state could no longer suffer the pain. "This battle will go to the courts and the streets now," she said.
The resolution only intensified the antipathy toward Governor Wilson felt not only by Speaker Brown but also by members of the Republican right wing, many of whom joined liberal Democrats in demanding, futilely, that the Governor cut his own bureaucracy to help bolster education support.
"Pete Wilson isn't getting tough, he's getting mean," said Ross Johnson, an Orange County Republican whom Governor Wilson forced out as minority leader last year. "Governor Wilson seems intent on preserving, even expanding, the prerogatives of the power of the Governor of the State of California. There's nothing conservative about that." A bill to cut the bureaucracy, including eliminating 108 public information officers, passed the Assembly on Tuesday night but failed to get the needed two-thirds majority in the Senate.
 
Squeeze on California
 California's troubles are rooted in a squeeze between growing demands for schooling, welfare, health and other programs at a time of declining personal income and revenues during the worst economic slump since the 1930's.
The state has lost about one million jobs, particularly in the high-income aerospace and military industries, since the recession began. According to the State Department of Finance, the main source of state revenues, the personal income tax, is already running 10 percent below expectations for the fiscal year that began July 1.
Anticipating the cuts signed into law today, numerous state agencies, school districts and university campuses had already imposed cutbacks in programs.
For example, when final figures are ready, they are expected to show that enrollment at the 20-campus California State University system dropped to about 270,000 students this fall, down by around 20,000, because of lack of needed classes and increased fees. The Sacramento campus was expecting next year to drop to a 10-year-low of about 17,000 students.
At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Wilson argued that the state should never again be subjected to this kind of budget crisis, and urged reforms in the state's fraud-ridden Workers Compensation program and passage of a constitutional amendment he has put on the November ballot to cut welfare grants further and give him potent new powers in times of fiscal crisis.
It was difficult today to determine who would pay the ultimate political price for the budget fiasco, but the Controller, Mr. Davis, certainly spoke the truth when he said, "I don't think the people who were messed over in this dispute will forget."

Chart: Some cuts in California's new budget:
 Education
 Support is cut by 11 percent from last year at the University of California and by 8 percent at California State University.
 
Welfare
 Grants are reduced by an average of 5.6 percent. The monthly grant to a single mother with two children drops from $663 to $625; grants to the aged and disabled go from $645 to $608.
 
Health
 Insurance for the poor is cut by limiting prescriptions allowed, reducing reimbursement for surgery, radiology and anesthesia, and excluding nonresidents.

HEADLINE: Japan Is Tough, but Xerox Prevails

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEBSTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
A case study in how to beat the Japanese: When the Xerox Corporation began designing its new high-speed photocopying machine, the Model 5100, it had world markets in mind, especially the Japanese.
But it took a different tack from American auto makers, which, in pursuit of Japanese markets, tried to sell cars with steering wheels on the wrong side. Xerox took great pains to understand the needs of its foreign customers, developing a machine for the Japanese that would duplicate the delicate kanji language characters, for instance, or would handle the flimsy papers used in Japan. 
 Now the American machine, capable of producing high-quality reproductions faster than anything made by Japanese manufacturers, has become the biggest-selling high-speed paper copier in Japan. A spokesman for Fuji Xerox, an independent affiliate that distributes the 5100 in Japan, said its sales there were approaching 90 percent of the high-speed market.
 
Customers Are Pleased
 Xerox's Japanese competitors declined to comment on the success of the American product but the company's Japanese customers are clearly pleased. The NEC Corporation, one of the country's biggest electronics companies, has purchased 22 of the big copiers. "The machines are better than anything we can get in Japan," a spokesman said. "We are not concerned that it is an American product. We wanted the best and most efficient machine."
The Model 5100, the people who built it and the approach they took have played a major part in rescuing an American corporation from damaging competition by the Japanese.
In the early 80's, the situation at Xerox had become so bad that as David T. Kearns, its former chairman, later wrote: "If nothing were done to correct things, we were destined to have a fire sale and close down by some time in the 1990's." Japanese companies -- Canon, Sharp, Toshiba, Ricoh and Minolta -- had made the company a special target, he said, and were hurting it badly.
Unlike the makers of television sets and other consumer electronic products, many of which closed American factories or sold them to foreign companies, Xerox chose to fight: The strategy was to beat the Japanese at their own game, and Xerox went on a quality binge.
The Xerox approach is by no means trouble free. But by and large management consultants and the company are pleased with the results and believe they hold great promise for American competitiveness.
First, Xerox directed attention to working and factory conditions. Lifts were installed at each work station at its plant in Webster, near Rochester, so that the 5100 frame would be raised to a comfortable height for assembly-line workers. Changes were made, too, so that completed parts would flow smoothly to assembly areas. Workers were given daily reports on the quality of products they were working on. Employees were given extra training in quality techniques.
Walking through the sprawling Webster plant, clean and brightly lighted, one encounters many assemblers who say the management attitude and the plant atmosphere have changed markedly. "Until four years ago they didn't care how you put the machines together, as long as you did it in time," said Randy Parry, who has been with the company for 23 years. "And so people hurt themselves -- they had back problems, wrist problems, all kinds of problems." He said the managers once had a list of corporate goals, with consumer satisfaction No. 1 and employee satisfaction fourth or fifth on the list. "Now it is No. 2," Mr. Parry said. "The company knows employee satisfaction has a direct relation to customer satisfaction."
Again copying its Japanese competitors, Xerox resolved to develop formal, long-term-planning, replacing its one-step-at-a-time approach. The Japanese plan product development as if it were a military campaign. "They relish thinking about how do we get from here to there," Mr. Kearns said, "and map it out on big charts.
Xerox formed development teams, as a growing number of American manufacturers are now also doing: designers, engineers, manufacturing experts, marketing specialists, repair people.
Improved communication is a premium. Team members hope to spot problems early, and spread the warnings. Quality problems in the production of American goods have oftenbeen traced to the sequential system of product development. One phase may be completed and frozen in stone before work begins on the next. Manufacturing specialists estimate that 80 percent of a product's costs are built in during the design phase.
 
Gap in Its Markets
 The conception of the 5100 occurred in 1984 when the company perceived a gap in its markets between their 1090 machine, which can produce 92 copies a minute, and the 5090, a highly automated model that spins out 135 a minute. In contrast with the model 5090, which is intended to be run by a trained operator, the 5100 was to be made simple enough to be used by ordinary office workers.
The team was then increased to about 50 people, who defined the machine's broad features, prepared sales estimates and began looking hard at the economics. Subgroups focused on such elements details as the optical systems used in the reproductions, or the automatic document handler and stapler.
The specific-design phase began in early 1986, when some 200 people worked on blueprints for 5,000 individual parts. It was decided then to use the company's manufacturing complex here for assembly but to buy parts worldwide, and parts suppliers were brought in to help in planning.
All along the way, manufacturing costs had to be evaluated. Unlike those in Japanese product development, the costs had to be kept low enough to generate a rate of return on investment that would satisfy stockholders. Relatively free of stockholder pressure, Toshiba, for example, is prepared to lose money for 10 years on flat panel video displays.
As problems were discovered, team members were still around to cope: One was that electricity is generated at 60 cycles a second in northern Japan -- but 50 cycles in the south. "You have to design a power supply that can switch," said David Erwin, a Xerox vice president.
In June 1990, field testing intensified. About 40 machines were placed with customers with quick-print businesses, people not slow to complain when things go wrong. "If there is any kind of problem, it will show up in these field tests," James J. Miller, a marketing manager, said. Found acceptable, the machine was introduced in Japan in October.
Xerox will not disclose figures on sales but says it is pleased with sales around the world. The company's revitalization since the early 80's has been dramatic, and the 5100 is given a major share of the credit. The stock, which hit its lowest level in 1982 -- $27.125 a share -- since it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1961, is now at $76.25, and quarterly losses reported in 1984 and 1985 are replaced by robust earnings now, $139 million in the second quarter of 1992.
Xerox received the Federal Government's Baldrige Award in 1989 as the nation's leading large manufacturer of high-quality products. And early this year, Buyers Laboratory, an American consumer-oriented group, rated its Model 5100 as the "Most Outstanding Copier Overall for 1991."
Despite the 5100 triumph, Xerox and American competitiveness still needs work.
The paper-handling mechanism the American model had to be redesigned, for example, because the heavier American paper "jammed like mad," Mr. Miller said, and delayed introduction six months.
"The best Japanese companies have characteristics in management structure, training and career paths that become advantages" said Prof. Steven Wheelwright, a manufacturing specialist at the Harvard Business School. Japanese executives tend to be broadly trained in a variety of disciplines, including engineering, marketing and finance, he said. As a result they can form smaller, faster teams. "The best Japanese companies have development teams one-third to one-quarter the size of Americans," he said. "The smaller the team, the faster you can move."
Speed counts. The 5100 was developed with traditional optical copying technology -- but already the industry is moving toward converting documents to digital information before reproduction. So how long the 5100 remains out front is a question.
Still, Xerox is generally regarded as having been quicker than most American manufacturers in competing internationally with high quality. Paul A. Allaire, the chairman, says the company is addressing the criticisms, particularly the slowness question. "We should be able to cut 18 months to 2 years out of the cycle," he said.
A number of other changes will be made, such as adding the company president to the development team. He will hold periodic reviews at which team members will describe current mistakes. The idea, again, is communication, and team members are not going to be skewered, Mr. Miller said, but added:
"Nobody likes standing up in front of the president and saying, 'I screwed up.' "

HEADLINE: Growth in Average Income Trailed Inflation Rate in 1991

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Income growth for the average American lagged behind inflation in 1991 for the first time in nine years, the Government said today.
"This very nicely reflects the mood of the electorate," said Paul Getman, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. "They're being squeezed very hard by rising taxes and rising health costs on the one hand, and by negligible increases in wages and salaries on the other." 
 The Commerce Department said average per capita income grew 2.4 percent, to $19,092, last year, slightly more than half the 4.4 percent inflation rate.
It was the smallest increase in nominal income since 1961, during the Kennedy Administration, although economists said the drop in inflation in 1991 was one reason for the small increase. Last year was the first time since 1982, during the last recession, that income growth fell behind inflation.
The failure of income growth to keep up with inflation is expected to be one of the economic statistics the Democrats seize on in the Presidential campaign.
Personal income is measured before taxes but after Social Security deductions. It includes income from all sources, including wages, investment earnings and government payments like welfare and farm subsidies. The per capita figure is derived by dividing total income in 1991 -- $4.81 trillion -- by the total population, 252 million.
Adjusted for inflation, incomes declined 1.9 percent last year, the worst on record going back to 1970, the first year for which comparable inflation-adjusted numbers are available.
And it was the third year in a row that the figure was worse than the year before. Inflation-adjusted per capita incomes were unchanged in 1990, rose 1.4 percent in 1989 and 1.9 percent in 1988.
"One reason why the public is in such an ornery mood is that the pain has been building for several years," Mr. Getman said. "Income growth has been sliding for a while and it's not going to turn around very soon."
 
Revised Figures
 Today's figures represent a revision of an earlier report released in April.
Differences among rich and poor states narrowed last year, although Connecticut retained its 1990 ranking as the richest state, with average income of $26,022. Mississippi remained the poorest, with average income of $13,328.
After Connecticut, the highest incomes were in New Jersey, $25,066; Massachusetts, $23,003; New York, $22,471, and Maryland, $22,189.
The low-income states, after Mississippi, were West Virginia, $14,301; Utah, $14,625; Arkansas, $14,629, and New Mexico, $14,644.
Most of the slowest-growing states were on or near the East or West Coasts. That was the opposite of the "bicoastal economy" of the mid-1980's, in which low-income inland states lagged behind the boom in richer coastal states.
Montana had the fastest income growth last year, at 7 percent, followed by Louisiana, 5.4 percent; Mississippi, 4.9 percent, and Arkansas, Kentucky and West Virginia, all 4.4 percent. State figures were not adjusted for inflation.
Incomes grew slowest in Nevada, up five-tenths of 1 percent, followed by California, up 1.3 percent, and Alaska, Delaware and Idaho, all up 1.5 percent.
Despite the relative differences in growth, 48 states had one thing in common: They all had slower growth than the year before. Growth rates picked up only in Montana and New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Vice President;
Quayle Tries to Separate Family Values and 'Murphy Brown'

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle sought today to rein in a political debate on family values that seems to have spun out of his control since he opened it last May with an attack on the television show "Murphy Brown."
In a speech to community leaders here, Mr. Quayle defiantly rejected the view that the Republicans have used "family values" as an issue to inflame prejudices against homosexuals, welfare recipients and feminists. He said he also dismissed the notion that family values is an empty subject. 
 "I especially reject the notion that discussing this issue is intended to divide Americans from one another, or to imply that some families are superior to others," Mr. Quayle told about 500 people at a luncheon organized by the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. "Family values is neither meaningless nor mean-spirited."
But it was the increasingly hostile tone of the family values debate, at the Republican National Convention and in Hollywood's response to Mr. Quayle's "Murphy Brown speech," that led the Vice President to address the issue today. Although Mr. Quayle did not say so, his top aides said the speech was aimed at reclaiming an issue they felt had been misrepresented.
Strategists at the White House and the Bush-Quayle campaign have expressed concern in recent weeks that some swing voters were alienated by the judgmental tone of recent speeches on family values by Patrick J. Buchanan, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, and even Marilyn Quayle.
Any poisoning of the family values debate could prove particularly lethal for Mr. Quayle because he has become so closely associated with it. The Vice President has used the issue not only to appeal to wayward conservatives but to try to rebuild his own image as a politican of toughness and resilience.
Mr. Quayle took pains today not to back away from his assault on what he refers to as the "cultural elite." Indeed, he reaffirmed his belief that Hollywood, the news media and liberal Democrats have undermined the Midwestern values he says he learned from family, church and school.
"Many powerful non-governmental institutions have been heavily influenced by the views of an adversary culture," he said. "This is a culture that flinches when it hears the word 'morality' and lashes out when it is challenged to discuss values.
"Hollywood is a stronghold of the adversary culture. It is on the other side of the cultural divide from Huntington, and they don't like it when someone from Huntington, with Midwestern values, challenges their so-called moral authority."
Responding to those who saw his "Murphy Brown" speech as an assault on single mothers, Mr. Quayle noted that his sister is a divorced mother, as was his maternal grandmother. And in what appeared to be a reflection on Mrs. Quayle's comment at the Republican convention that "most women do not wish to be liberated from their essential natures as women," Mr. Quayle praised the women's movement:
"Some changes have been for the good. Women have gained economic opportunities they deserve. This is both just and good for the country. We are still working out solutions to the new arrangements in our workplaces and in our domestic lives. And I have the greatest respect for the women who face these challenges and meet the demands of work and family."

Bonds Countering Dollar's Plunge

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
When the dollar plunged to new lows against the German mark in late August, the bond market went with it, giving up much of the gains it made in July and early August. And there was concern that a continued fall in the dollar would pull the bond market even lower.
But while that could still be the case, a look at the recent performance of the dollar and the 30-year bonds shows the opposite: 
 This year, when the dollar has been rising (and, consequently, the German mark has been falling) the price of the 30-year bond has dropped. And when the dollar has fallen and the mark has risen, as has happened since late spring, the price of the 30-year bond has been on the rise and yields have plunged to their lowest level in five and half years.
"They were all screaming that the market is going down because of the dollar," said Terrence Crowe, a vice president at Nikko Securities Inc. "Are they correct? Who Knows?
"But the line," he said, referring to a computer-generated graph, "is telling you that the correlation of the mark going up and the bond going up is what is happening."
The correlation can be seen in a comparison of the performance of the dollar this year to the performance of the December futures contract for the 30-year bond. It is not a perfect correlation because the dollar was rising as the 30-year bonds reached a high in January.
But since then, the bond fell to its lowest price of the year on March 17, while the dollar hit its peak on March 16. The the bond began a steady, but not alway straight, rise toward its present levels on April 28 and the dollar began its relatively steady fall to its current all-time lows against the German mark on April 20. The only real break in this pattern came in the week after Aug. 20, when the dollar's plunge accelerated despite intervention by the Federal Reserve and a host of Europen central banks to support the dollar.
This correlation has something to do with the fact that the reasons for the dollar's rise early in the year were reasons that also worried the bond market. At that time, economists expected an economic recovery with some punch that would draw foreign investment, which would support the dollar. At the same time, that raised the possibility of an upward move in interest rates and some concern about inflation.
Now the dollar is weak, in part because the economic recovery has barely materialized. There is no draw for foreigners. Rather, investors prefer the much higher interest rates they can get in Europe compared with America. but the weak economy is good for the bond market because there is no fear of interest rates going up or inflation reigniting.
So a mild decline in the dollar is not likely to have a strong downward pull on the dollar, as long as this correlation holds and as long as the decline does not appear to be getting out of hand.
 
Treasury Market
 Bonds and notes had a volatile day in thin trading yesterday. By late in the afternoon, much of the gains from earlier in the day had been lost, in part because of some remarks of unnamed Federal Reserve officials reported by the Market News Service.
According to the report, the two officials seemed to indicate the Fed would move to ease interest rates further if necessary, even if the dollar remains weak.
It was fairly clear from the timing of the report that the prices of bonds and notes, especially the 30-year bond, began to fall after the report. But it is not exactly clear why. This is because the indication of another easing by the Fed would support the market.
The discount rates on three-month and six-month Treasury bills did decline one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, each. But the 7.25 percent 30-year bond, which was up 10/32 earlier in the day, finished at an offered price of 98 16/32 up just 1/32 , to yield 7.37 percent, the same as Tuesday.
The shorter-maturity notes, which have outperformed the long bond recently, also fared better yesterday. The 10-year note was up 5/32 , to yield 6.53 percent, down from 6.54 percent Tuesday, and the five-year note was up 3/32 , to yield 5.50 percent, the same as the day before.
Matthew Alexy, the government trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation, said it was not clear why bonds and notes fell at the end of the day. But the cautious nature of the market just ahead of the release of the unemployment report for August on tomorrow was to be expected.
The Treasury will announce today when it will begin its testing of a new auction technique. The test will be for a sealed bid auction where all the securities are awarded at a single price even though the winning bids may be at several different prices. The current system awards the securities at several prices, beginning at the highest bid and moving down until all the auctioned securities are sold.

Rising Challenger In Tough Market

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
THE consumer electronics business in and around Manhattan is not for the faint of heart or small of ego.
The bazaar atmosphere that preys on unwary tourists, the bustling gray market of this port city and razor-thin margins have cut deeply into the ranks of companies that have tried to make it here. Although some retailers -- the Wiz, for example -- are surviving and expanding in the market, casualties include Newmark & Lewis, Lafayette and Crazy Eddie. Even 47th Street Photo, which long appeared to have made a success of organized chaos, is operating under bankruptcy protection. 
 "It's the most competitive market in the country," said Edwin L. Underwood, an analyst with Scott & Stringfellow.
Enter Leslie S. Turchin, a one-time Sears salesman bristling with confidence, brandishing an ambitious plan to expand his newly public Tops Appliance City chain into New York from his current four-store chain in New Jersey.
Mr. Turchin is competitive. After Newmark & Lewis left the market, a trade publication quoted Mr. Turchin as saying, "Anybody else comes here, we'll send them home in a body bag, too."
If nothing else, Tops Appliance City, which sells a broad range of appliances and consumer electronics, is an example of an entrepreneurial drive to test a clearly marked hazardous road.
As an investment, however, the Tops story grows more complex. Industry analysts cite many reasons that Mr. Turchin, who started his company in 1970, might succeed where others have failed. But investors clearly have their doubts, reflected in the company's stock, which has dropped 14 percent in the three weeks since it went public at $14 a share. It closed at $12 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading, up 62.5 cents.
"Investors should be cautious," Mr. Underwood said of the stock.
Several analysts echoed his comments but declined to be identified for this article because their firms helped underwrite the recent stock offering.
The winnowed ranks of competitors leave Tops much more breathing room to operate and expand outside its home state of New Jersey. In October, Tops plans to open a 68,000-square-foot store in Mount Pleasant in Westchester County. Its future expansion plans call for one new store of more than 60,000 square feet every 12 to 15 months in the New York metropolitan area, and eventually, Mr. Turchin has said, in New England.
Mr. Turchin, 50 years old, who declined to be interviewed because of the stock offering, has carried out a long list of operating procedures, which he monitors from his desk in the Edison, N.J., store. No callers are to wait more than two rings to talk to a store operator. No customers are to wait more than 10 seconds before they are approached by a sales representative.
Analysts note that the large stores -- ranging from 43,000 to 120,000 square feet -- are generally clean, bright and logically laid out. Tops offers free delivery and free removal of old appliances. Tops promises to pay customers $100 if it cannot beat a competitor's price, a promise on which analysts say it rarely has to deliver because so few customers take the time to shop around. The pace of business at the store is swift, and salespeople have license to make deals.
As a result, Tops is the undisputed leader among consumer electronics chains for sales per square foot, at more than $1,700 a year. "The strategy is sound," said Kurt Barnard, president of Retail Marketing Report.
Even so, the company was fined for its aggressive tactics last year by New Jersey's Consumer Affairs Division. Specifically, it was told to change certain practices -- like charging a "restocking fee" for returned items without warning -- and pay the state almost $90,000 in fines and other charges.
As the company has expanded its number of stores, its revenues and profits have increased. Revenues rose to more than $300 million in 1991 from $212 million in 1988. Over the same period, net profits rose to $5.3 million from $1.7 million.
For the first six months of 1992, however, the company reported a net loss of $4.3 million on revenues of $148 million, a loss attributable primarily to a $4.9 million payout to Mr. Turchin, which will be completed in 1994. The bonus, Tops states, is cash compensation due to Mr. Turchin as a result of the Tops recapitalization in 1988 as a limited partnership. Following the offering, Mr. Turchin owned 36.6 percent of the stock.
An additional $1.56 million was charged against second-quarter earnings to transfer equity interests worth 3 percent to Mr. Turchin's top three lieutenants.
After absorbing these costs, the company's profit-and-loss statement may impress more investors when third-quarter results are reported.
But for the long term, Mr. Barnard and others said, opportunities may be limited for the chain. The Tops name is well known in New Jersey, but the company may have difficulties in quickly building the recognition and traffic it needs to sustain its high-volume operations.
In addition, the economy will no doubt prove challenging for Tops, as consumers continue to be slow and cautious in buying electronics and appliances. "We are in an economic climate that is somewhat averse to big-ticket expenditures," Mr. Barnard said.

Dollar Revives on Quiet Day Ahead of the Jobless Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar recovered slightly against most major currencies in quiet trading yesterday as traders took profits ahead of Washington's monthly unemployment report.
Early yesterday, the dollar fell to a low against the German mark, at one point reaching 1.3860, down from Tuesday's record-low close of 1.3900. But it soon recovered to close at 1.3935 marks. 
 The dollar traded in narrow ranges yesterday, and Mike Faust, senior currency strategist with MMS International in New York, said, "The underlying position of the dollar is still one of weakness."
Investors were selling marks and buying dollars to milk profits ahead of tomorrow's scheduled release of August jobless figures, Kevin Lawrie, the Bank of Boston's director of foreign exchange, said.
There is uncertainty among economists about what those numbers will show, he said, but if they are weak, the Federal Reserve could ease interest rates further, which could lead to further declines in the dollar. United States interest rates are already far lower than Germany's, making mark-denominated investments more attractive.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $338.50 an ounce, down $2.30 from late Tuesday. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a price of $338.70, off $2.20.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 122.63 yen, down 0.42 yen from Tuesday's finish. It was the dollar's lowest closing in Tokyo since Dec. 9, 1988, when the currency finished at 122.43 yen. Later, in London the dollar closed higher at 122.93 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 123.10 yen, up from 122.84 Tuesday.
In Europe, the dollar hit 1.3870 marks twice yesterday before firming to trade late in the session at 1.3905 marks.
Also in Europe, the dollar fell to a record low 1.2300 Swiss francs and was trading late in the day at 1.2385 francs, down from 1.2400 francs Tuesday. The previous low for the dollar was 1.2305 Swiss francs, set Feb. 7, 1991. In New York the dollar closed at 1.2425 Swiss francs, up from 1.2360 Tuesday.
The pound traded late in Europe at $2.0035, up from $1.9970 Tuesday. Bank of England figures show the pound last closed in Europe above $2 on June 23, 1981, when it traded at $2.0014. In New York, the pound closed at $2.0005, down from $2.0025 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 4.7505 French francs, up from 4.7385; 1,066.00 Italian lire, up from 1,063.00, and 1.19695 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19465.

HEADLINE: Partisan Air Clouds a Trenton Hearing on the Loss of Medicaid Funds

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Despite the vow of its chairman that no "witch hunt" is in store, a legislative committee began hearings today on the apparent loss of nearly a half-billion dollars in Medicaid money, with Republicans pointing fingers directly at Gov. Jim Florio.
The lone Democrat on the committee responded in kind, blaming Republicans for both a downgrade of the state's bond rating and a budget that will require sharp cutbacks in services and layoffs of some 2,700 state employees. 
 Republicans say everything would have turned out all right if Governor Florio had not announced that the state would be getting $450 million from the Federal Government in Medicaid reimbursements for psychiatric care. Then, in the midst of the budget-making process, he said the payment was in peril -- an announcement that sent the Republicans scrambling to balance the budget.
Governor Florio and the Democrats said that it was not the Medicaid money that caused the budget problems, but rather the Republican move cutting the sales tax by a penny, eliminating $608 million in revenues.
 
No 'Witch Hunt'
 Senator Richard J. LaRossa, a Trenton Republican who is chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Medicaid Reimbursement, which held its first meeting today, said last week, "The committee will not conduct a witch hunt, but instead will gather information to determine, once and for all, the circumstance surrounding the loss of $454 million in anticipated Medicaid reimbursement funds."
Washington has indicated that the state will get only $74 million of the money it is seeking. But aides to Governor Florio continue to insist that it may get the full $454 million, which includes about $380 million in retroactive claims Washington is disputing.
Mr. LaRossa restated his pledge today not to politicize the issue, saying, "Sensationalism is not the guiding principle of the factual review process."
He said the committee would examine documents relating to the reimbursement request, call witnesses from the administration -- and subpoena them if they are recalcitrant -- and request input from the Federal Government, holding a hearing in Washington if necessary.
 
Invisible Revenues
 The committee's Republican vice chairman, Assemblyman Richard H. Bagger of Westfield, said today that the panel was "not convened to randomly point fingers of blame." But he then went on to maintain that Governor Florio had "brought the budget process to a new low."
"We must not allow another budget blunder to wreak havoc with the lives of state employees, the health of the state's economy and the confidence of our citizens," he said.
Another Republican, Senator Harriet Derman of Edison, said, "It was as if the revenue estimates were written with disappearing ink."
With that, the lone Democrat on the committee, Assemblyman Bernard F. Kenny Jr. of Hoboken, suggested that "there may be a drift toward partisanship as we go along" and warned that "the minute we go off track and begin to point partisan finger, I will point partisan fingers as well."
He then pointed to one, saying, "There is a lot of blame to be thrown around," and accused the Republican majority of ignoring warnings that a tax cut could jeopardize the state's bond rating by cutting revenues below a level Wall Street considers optimum.
That happened just last week, when Moody's Investors Service dropped the rating a notch from the top level, Aaa, to its second-highest rating, Aa1. The downgrade means the state will have to pay more interest on the money it borrows.

HEADLINE: Assembly Speaker Pressed To Help Stop Car Thefts

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly told a group of black clergymen today that the Legislature must respond to the increasingly violent car-theft problem in the Newark area, but he said an effective response requires more discussion between community leaders and lawmakers.
"We're not at a point yet for legislation," said the Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, a Republican, "although it will not be delayed forever. It can't be." 
 Several bills that would increase penalties for car theft and create military-style boot camps for offenders have been introduced in the Legislature but have remained bottled up in committee. Differing versions of a measure allowing municipalities to declare a 10 P.M. curfew for children under the age of 18 have passed in the Senate and Assembly, but no bill has passed in its final form.
Members of some community organizations have said that simply strengthening law enforcement will not solve the car-theft problem. They maintain that a successful response must also address high unemployment, poor educational achievement and the aimlessness of young people in the inner cities.
Mr. Haytaian said today that the Legislature would heed a plea for help made by Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, where in recent months confrontations between car thieves and the police have resulted in the fatal shootings of four young people riding in stolen vehicles and the wounding of three others. At the same time, police officers have become the target of car thieves who try to run them down or ram their vehicles.
In the latest incident, a Harrison police officer fired two shots at a stolen van Tuesday after the driver tried to run him down at an intersection in Harrison, the police said. The officer, Kevin Murphy, fired at the van's tires, hitting one, according to the police. The van, with its flat tire, was found abandoned a short time later about two miles away in Newark.
 
Subject Wasn't on Agenda
 The car-theft problem was not on the agenda of the breakfast meeting today between Mr. Haytaian and about two dozen members of the Newark-North Jersey Committee of Black Churchmen at St. James A.M.E. Church on Martin Luther King Boulevard. The meeting was scheduled weeks ago to deal chiefly with the religious leaders' concerns about school funding and the impact of budget cuts on programs affecting the cities.
But as the 90-minute session was winding down, the Rev. Robert H. Johnson, pastor of the First Hopewell Baptist Church, asked Mr. Haytaian what the Legislature was prepared to do about car theft. "Kids are getting shot; cars are getting stolen," he said, eliciting Mr. Haytaian's promise of some action after consultation with community leaders.
The Rev. Perry Simmons, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church and president of the Newark Board of Education, said after the meeting that the car-theft problem "is very serious" and will require the cooperation of law-enforcement agencies, elected officials and community leaders.
He said that repeat offenders should face certain jail sentences, something not assured now because of overcrowded juvenile-detention centers and the low priority often given car theft.
"We must untie the hands of the judiciary," Mr. Simmons said. "If you have a cancer you don't try to treat it with a lotion. When anyone tries to run people down with a car, it becomes a weapon."
Mr. Simmons and other clergymen told Mr. Haytaian that they did not believe the Legislature was sincere about meeting the New Jersey Supreme Court's mandate to bring spending on education in poor urban districts up to parity with that in the suburbs. They said recent statements by some Republican legislative leaders that school aid should be shifted away from the cities to the suburbs had heightened their concern.
Mr. Haytaian said the Legislature supported bringing suburban and city districts to parity, but he said the court had allowed that to be done gradually, and he urged the ministers to withold judgment on the Republican-controlled Legislature's spending on education for another year.

HEADLINE: SCARSDALE JOURNAL;
In Fight Over Tennis Courts, a Village Examines Its Priorities

DATELINE: SCARSDALE, N.Y.

 BODY:
THE opinions are flying as fast here as the tennis balls at Flushing Meadows. Would it be unseemly for this village to build more tennis courts, given the tough economic climate?
The question has bounced around the village this summer, becoming a rallying point for a debate about values and local priorities. 
 Leading the opposition to new courts is the Scarsdale League of Women Voters.
Speaking for the league's 725 members, its president, Ann Rose Simon, told the Scarsdale board of trustees: "This is an inappropriate time to build new tennis courts in the village. We are in an economic recession, with cutbacks and cost-saving measures being instituted at every level of government."
Building courts after school budgets had been cut would set a bad example for children, Mrs. Simon said, noting that despite the village's reputation for affluence, many residents had lost their jobs or seen their incomes reduced during the recession.
Supporters of the effort to build new courts say they are baffled by the opposition because only those who play would have to pay.
The board of trustees is expected to vote on Sept. 8 on whether to add two new public courts to the 25 existing ones in this village of 17,000. The $70,000 project would be financed with surcharges on tennis permits of $5 for adults and $3 for children. About 3,000 permits are now issued each year. The money would be borrowed from a developers' fund that is held in escrow for recreation, and would be repaid over six years.
Opponents of the new courts raise questions about what will happen if the charges do not cover all the construction and maintenance costs of new courts. Mrs. Simon points out that the number of people using the town's once popular paddle tennis courts had dropped sharply, and warned that the number of tennis permits issued could also decline.
Robert H. Harrison, director of the Scarsdale branch of the New York Junior Tennis League, said the courts are needed to ease the frustrations of young players and those who volunteer to coach them, because rules favoring adults kept the 600 youths in the league from playing during peak after-school and weekend hours in the spring.
In response to suggestions that youth matches be moved to the fall to relieve crowding on the courts, Mr. Harrison replied: "Tennis is a spring sport and that's when it should be played. It gets dark soon after 6 P.M. in the fall. Let the League of Women Voters play in October and November if they think that's a good time to play."
Letters to The Scarsdale Inquirer, the village newspaper, have been vocal on the subject, both pro and con. In the editorial and opinion columns, the paper is solidly pro courts. A columnist ridiculed what he called the League of Women Voters' "message of doom and gloom" and advised the group to "lighten up." And an editorial took the view that tennis was especially appropriate in difficult times because "people have more time to play and a greater need to relieve stress."
Alan R. Morse, a parent volunteer in the elementary- and middle-school tennis program run by the village recreation department, said new courts could only enhance Scarsdale's desirability as a place to live. "Our fine recreational facilities are one more thing which help to distinguish Scarsdale from many of our neighbors in Westchester," he wrote to The Inquirer. He called tennis courts a "substantial asset."
But Matthew Taubin, another resident who has been active in youth recreation programs, thinks the village should hold on to its money, and called the building of more tennis courts in Scarsdale an overindulgence.
"There are so many courts in our little town that it's mind-boggling," he said. "I'd rather spend money on something that would help the whole village, like suspending parking fees for an hour each day to help our retail merchants."
Mrs. Simon said she feared that the debate would make Scarsdale "seem flighty," when, in fact, it was strongly civic-minded, with many volunteers serving in village government and on advisory boards.
"I don't know of another place that gives so much time, effort and heart to community service," Mrs. Simon said. "The village is special, not because it is affluent but because it is a community of socially responsible people."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ascii of Japan Says It Has Lined Up Lenders

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Kazuhiko Nishi, the entrepreneur who helped create Japan's personal computer industry, has rescued his company from the threat of bankruptcy.
Mr. Nishi, 36 years old, announced Tuesday that six banks had agreed in principle to lend his company, the Ascii Corporation, 16.4 billion yen, or about $130 million, which will allow Ascii to pay off a huge bond that must be redeemed next March. 
 In exchange, Ascii (pronounced AS-key) has promised to cut back sharply on hiring, to sell or close unprofitable subsidiaries and to take other steps to cut expenses. A manager from the Industrial Bank of Japan, the lead bank in the bailout effort, will join Ascii's management in an as-yet undetermined position, although Mr. Nishi is expected to remain president.
"They have not requested, as part of this deal, that I should resign or step back," Mr. Nishi said in an interview Tuesday.
 
The Plight of 'Kay'
 The plight of Mr. Nishi, known by the nickname Kay, has been closely watched here because he is a rare example of a self-made man in a nation notoriously short of successful entrepreneurs. Mr. Nishi started Ascii when he was a college student in 1977 and has nurtured it into a $270 million company centered on software and computer magazine publishing. And in a nation that shuns flamboyance, he has attracted attention by flying around in helicopters and owning several luxurious cars.
But Mr. Nishi, who has no shortage of visions, took advantage of the easy money available during the boom years in Japan's stock and real estate markets to borrow heavily and move Ascii into new businesses, including movie production and distribution, semiconductors, satellite communications and even helicopter chartering. While Ascii remains profitable, the company could not raise money to pay its debts once Japan's boom ended, requiring it to seek the loan from the six banks.
 
'We're Not in Crisis'
 Since news reports about Ascii's problems appeared in the United States last week, Ascii has been besieged by offers from American companies interested in buying all or part of it. Mr. Nishi said Ascii might eventually need a partner and would listen to offers, especially for minority stakes. But, he added, "For the time being, we're not in a crisis."
Mr. Nishi was vague about which operations Ascii would cut, other than its helicopter service and its Japanese satellite communications business.
He said Ascii would retain its movie business, which it formed by acquiring the Japanese operations of Vestron Inc., a videocassette distributor, and a one-third stake in the Edward R. Pressman Film Company, an independent film maker. The film operations have been buoyed recently because Ascii helped finance the production of the hit movie "Fried Green Tomatoes."
 
To Sell Some U.S. Stakes
 Ascii will also sell its stakes in some of the more than 20 small American technology companies in which it has invested.
But Mr. Nishi said he had great hopes for two Silicon Valley companies in which Ascii holds stakes -- Crosspoint Solutions, which makes user-programmable computer chips, and Nexgen Microsystems, which is developing powerful microprocessors to compete with those of Intel. Mr. Nishi said that if these and other investments paid off Ascii would thrive again in the future.
Asked if he had any regrets, Mr. Nishi paused and closed his eyes. "My regret," he finally answered, "is I had optimistic optimism. I should have had optimistic pessimism or pessimistic optimism."

HEADLINE: De Beers May Be Losing Grip on Diamond Market

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Less than a month ago De Beers Consolidated Mines, the secretive South African company that dominates the world diamond trade through a cartel that controls 80 percent of the world's uncut diamonds, seemed to have coasted miraculously through a recession that had rattled other luxury industries.
But in the last few weeks the industry has admitted that it is suffering its worst swoon in a decade, provoking speculation, once unthinkable, that the cartel is losing its grip. 
 One source of the disarray is a flood of Angolan diamonds that have begun to pour onto the normally orderly world market.
Now that Angola's civil war has ended, some 50,000 prospectors are digging for gems, mainly along the diamond-rich Cuango River. As the African drought has dried up the rivers, alluvial diamond deposits in the riverbeds and riverbanks have become more accessible to the wildcat miners, who smuggle them out to buyers in Antwerp.
The Angolan Government normally cooperates with the cartel, but the war has left large portions of the country virtually ungoverned. The illicit diamonds are hitting a market that, it turns out, is not as immune to the world recession as it seemed. Consumers in the world's two largest diamond-buying countries, America and Japan, have been cutting back or trading down to cheaper stones.
Adding to the industry's gloom are charges that De Beers, which speaks for the diamond establishment, misled investors about the wobbly state of the industry by glossing over evidence of falling demand and ignoring the Angolan problem.
"The diamond market was already going badly last year, and they tried to give it a lift by pretending sales were better than they actually were," said James Picton, a Cape Town analyst who forecast the industry's problems well before De Beers did. "The diamond trade is a very sentimental animal. If it seems to be doing well it sort of feeds on that."
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, insists that the company was not unduly optimistic. De Beers, he said, could not have foreseen the crash of the stock market in Japan, which cast a chill over the diamond market in that country, or the explosion of diamonds from Angola.
 
Chairman Denies Allegations
 "The allegations that De Beers has lost credibility are unfair and ill founded, and the facts support me," he declared with the regal assurance for which the company is famous.
The cartel is scrambling to hold retail prices stable by buying up the oversupply. But for now, the big industrial economies show no signs of returning to the bauble-buying euphoria of the 1980's, and there seems to be little immediate prospect of arresting the flow of gems from Angola.
"It might have been easy at the beginning to control it," said Richard Stuart of Martin & Company, a Johannesburg brokerage. "But now you've got 5,000 demobilized soldiers running wild. If you fly a patrol over the province you can get shot down by a missile. And it's a 100-mile river. You can't put a fence around it."
To keep prices from collapsing, the cartel may be forced to buy up $500 million worth of illicit diamonds from Angola this year -- twice as much as Angola's official production, and far more than De Beers anticipated.
As recently as Aug. 10, De Beers seemed to be a lustrous exception to the world economic slump. The cartel had secured new five-year contracts with its stable of collaborating producers, now enhanced by the addition of Russia. A new Japanese taste for baubles seemed to have buoyed the industry through a sales slump in America. The new De Beers diamond mine at Venetia in the northern Transvaal, which opened in August, was set to yield gems worth $400 million a year.
Diamonds were forever, as the cartel's ad agency is spending $160 million this year to remind the world, and so, it appeared, was De Beers.
 
Some Noticed Danger Signs
 While some analysts noticed danger signals in the persistent world recession and the Angolan diamond rush, many were lulled by the bullish assurances of De Beers's patrician chairman, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson.
Then on Aug. 11, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson broke the news: De Beers was slashing its dividend for the second time in its postwar history and ordering its contractors to hold back production. The mining giant's stock plunged from 75 rands ($28) a share to the low 50's, taking with it much of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the company's credibility.
For the first time since the diamond market collapsed in 1981, investors wondered openly whether the De Beers cartel could continue to dominate the gem trade.
"When this question arose 10 years ago, I said, 'Of course De Beers can hold the line,' " said Mr. Picton, the Cape Town analyst, who forecast the dividend cut. "This time, I don't think there's any 'of course' about it. I do think they will hold the line. But at what price?"
De Beers has worked hard to create stability in an industry that in effect sells caprice. After all, no one really needs diamonds. Even the gems used in industry now have synthetic alternatives. Like luxury tours and sable coats, gem diamonds have the makings of a cyclical business that should flutter with economic trends. But it does not, largely because De Beers has kept tight controls on the supply.
Through its corporate Siamese twin, De Beers Centenary A.G. -- a Swiss-based concern created to insulate the diamond trade from international sanctions against South Africa's apartheid system -- De Beers runs the marketing organ called the Central Selling Organization, which grades, distributes and promotes most of the world's rough diamonds.
When demand grows, as it did in the 1980's, the selling organization releases more stones to keep price from soaring. When supply threatens to outstrip demand, the cartel buys the surplus and stockpiles it.
By preventing sharp fluctuations in price, De Beers argues, the manipulations protect the jobs of miners, cutters, traders and jewelers, and secure the value of what consumers buy.
The diamond industry generally plays along with the cartel because it trusts De Beers to foresee trends and act accordingly.
Secrecy is an essential ingredient in the De Beers mystique, but Mr. Picton offers the following stark calculations to illustrate the magnitude of De Beers's predicament:
The Central Selling Organization, he estimates, was obliged to buy uncut diamonds worth $4.8 billion -- $4.3 billion from its contractors, plus the Angolan stones. It could expect to sell consumers less than $3.5 billion, by Mr. Picton's reckoning. The difference was a huge volume of diamonds.
The company moved quickly to restore the balance, ordering cartel members to hold back 25 percent of the diamonds they were contracted to market through the cartel.
But some producers, desperate for cash, will be strongly tempted to evade the cutbacks and sneak their diamonds onto the market.
One analyst, Kevin G. Kartun of Frankel Kruger Vinerine Inc. in Johannesburg, speculates that De Beers is shrewdly exaggerating the Angolan problem to frighten wayward producers like the Russians into hewing closer to the cartel.
"In the meantime De Beers is increasing their share of production," Mr. Kartun said. "Their Venetia mine will be at full production by 1993, and they are putting a huge emphasis on marine diamonds" mined from oceangoing platforms. Owning a greater share of the rough stones, Mr. Kartun said, would give De Beers more muscle to cow other producers into line.
But Mr. Kartun's theory is a contrarian view among brokers, who tend to think the company's woes are genuine and, if anything, likely to get worse. Much worse, if a big producer like Russia breaks ranks.
That worry may explain why Harry Oppenheimer, the 83-year-old scion of the mining dynasty that built De Beers, is in Russia this week, ostensibly on vacation.
 
How Much Have Times Changed?
 Mr. Picton, for one, wonders if the diamond industry will ever fully recover its luster. "There are concerns that overt displays of wealth are a thing of the past," he said.
While few suggest that De Beers and the cartel are in mortal danger, many analysts predict that regaining its grip will cost De Beers heavily.
Aside from the expense of mopping up the diamond surplus, some analysts say De Beers may have to loosen its autocratic hold on the industry.
Sharing power in the cartel would undermine De Beers's secrecy, nibble into its profits and violate its old-boys-club corporate culture.

Tax-Exempt Yields Gain but Taxables Slip

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The yields offered by money market funds were mixed in the latest week, as the supply of municipal debt remained heavy and money markets regained composure after last week's decline in the dollar, according to The IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, which surveyed 857 funds.
The assets of tax-exempt money funds were down $1.3 billion for the week, to $95 billion, as the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios increased a day, to 65. 
 Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, said the flow of cash from the tax-exempt funds reflected the rise in long-term yields that is affecting the short end.
 
'Upward Pressure on Yields'
 "The more attractive yields of the longer maturities brought on by higher borrowing costs and the increased supply of tax-exempt issues have combined to exert upward pressure on yields in the short paper that funds invest in," Mr. Frank said.
The seven-day average for both compounded and simple yields of tax-exempt funds rose by 11 basis points, to 2.32 percent and 2.30 percent, respectively. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Over 30 days, the average was 2.20 percent for a simple yield and 2.22 percent for a compounded yield.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded tax-free yield is 3.22 percent, while the equivalent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.36 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Dreyfus Basic Municipal fund was the best performer with a return of 3.14 percent, or 17 basis points higher than the top fund of the previous week.
 
Taxable Funds
 The yields of taxable money market funds slipped, meanwhile, as assets were down $15.8 billion, to $489.9 billion. As in the previous week, most of the outflow came from institutional funds. In the latest period, the institutionals were down $11.4 billion, to $173.1 billion.
The average seven-day compounded yield for taxable money market funds was 3.05 percent, down 2 basis points, with the simple yield down a similar amount to 3.01 percent. For the 30-day average, the compounded and simple yields were both down 3 basis points, to 3.09 percent and 3.04 percent, respectively.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios rose a day, to 64.
The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company of New York, maintained the top return among general-purpose funds with a yield of 3.82 percent.
With government funds and funds with assets under $100 million included, however, the best yield was the United Services Government Securities Savings fund, distributed by United Services of San Antonio.
By comparison, the average bank money market account slipped 2 basis points in the latest week, to yield 3 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.

One Currency: Pain or Gain?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE fall of the dollar is yesterday's news in America, a mere digression from enduring issues like witchcraft and family values. But the rise of the German mark -- the flip side of the dollar's humbling -- is not about to be brushed aside in Europe.
Even in ordinary times, currency turmoil would be greater cause for alarm in relatively small, open economies that live or die by trade. And with France poised to vote this month on monetary union with the rest of the European Community, these are hardly ordinary times. 
 The community, on what was supposed to be a deliberate march toward a single currency, has been jolted by the discovery that getting there is much less than half the fun. Indeed, the shock of being caught in the turbulence of the jet-propelled mark is raising basic questions about whether it is worth getting there at all.
Stripped to essentials, the appeal of a common European currency is the attraction of surrendering economic sovereignty to a benevolent despot -- one bent on assuring German-style price stability for the entire community. Or, as Shafiqul Islam, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, bluntly puts it, the idea is "to import the credibility of the Bundesbank."
A first taste of the benefits is already being enjoyed under the existing monetary arrangements, in which the major European currencies are linked in a narrow exchange band. British borrowers, for example, no longer pay a significant interest premium over their German counterparts because private lenders have become convinced that London will do whatever is necessary to keep the pound locked to German currency -- and thus immune from locally driven inflation. But as recent events suggest, traveling with the mark can mean a bumpy ride.
The origins of the current problem lie in domestic German politics. To prevent unemployed or low-paid eastern Germans from seeking western German jobs, Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed in 1990 to bribe them to stay home. This year, Bonn will spend 160 billion marks -- about $11,000 for every eastern German -- to subsidize living standards in the former socialist paradise. But Chancellor Kohl never consented to raise taxes sufficiently to cover the bill. And rather than allow government spending to spill into inflation, the Bundesbank has tightened the monetary screws.
The resulting sky-high German interest rates have sucked in a torrent of foreign capital, permitting Bonn to finance reunification now and pay later. But the rest of Europe has been buffeted by the storm.
Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, sees striking parallels to Ronald Reagan's fiscal policy of the early 1980's. Then, America financed big budget deficits with foreign capital attracted by high short-term interest rates. That suited the Administration, which thereby escaped the dire capital crunch predicted by most economists. But it proved a double whammy for Rust Belt manufacturers, who were forced to pay more for credit and were priced out of foreign markets by the overvalued dollar.
Unlike Michigan and Ohio, Britain and Italy could devalue their currencies, ending pressure to raise interest rates and making their exports more competitive abroad. But that would undercut the credibility of the current exchange-rate system and raise further doubts about the workability of a true currency union.
The best solution, Mr. Lawrence argues, would be for Germany to prove its loyalty to the community by raising taxes and lowering interest rates. But he is not holding his breath.
An alternative, suggested months ago by Alberto Giovannini of Columbia University, would be to end the convergence dance and go directly to monetary union. An accelerated commitment to a common money would eliminate speculation against weaker European currencies that is simply a byproduct of the surge toward the mark. Some currency union supporters in France are now arguing that it would also give all of Europe a say over policies now effectively controlled by Germany.
But all this begs the core question: Is the potential gain from monetary union worth the pain?
Certainly most European leaders think so, if only because it would bury nascent German nationalism under a blanket of collective responsibility for the economic welfare of the community. But some economists, including one pillar of the American academic establishment, Martin Feldstein, have serious doubts.
Mr. Feldstein, the director of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a former adviser to President Reagan, argues that Europe can enjoy most of the benefits of economic integration without the strains that go with the surrender of independent fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policies. That view, little heard in Europe until very recently, could prove decisive in the French referendum on Sept. 20, which polls suggest is too close to call.

HEADLINE: The Cartoon's Characters Squish And Twist? It Must Be a Plympton

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
When the cartoonist Bill Plympton looks at a face, all sorts of things cross his mind. Weird things, like pulling both ears until they stretch a couple of feet, and then tying them in a knot. Or winding a face up like the rubber band for a model-airplane propeller. Or expanding the nostril until the nose inhales the entire head.
"I think the human body is the ultimate cliche, so that's why I like tearing it apart, smooshing it and kneading it like dough," Mr. Plympton said in a recent interview in his studio in Chelsea. By way of example, he reached for a prop, a latex-rubber model of an actor, and planted his fist right in the middle of its face, which quietly imploded. Mr. Plympton seemed pleased with the result. A boyish-looking 46 years old, in big shorts, an oversize short-sleeved white shirt, Top-Siders and socks, he looked like a large version of Tintin. 
 Among animation buffs, surreal physical humor that Mr. Plympton has made his stock in trade in eight animated short subjects over the last decade carries an admiring adjective: "Plymptonesque." That quality is on full view in "The Tune," an animated feature-length musical that opens in New York tomorrow at the Quad Cinema.
The film, whose 10 songs and 1 instrumental are written by Maureen McElheron, follows the adventures of Del, a struggling songwriter, as he searches for the perfect song, which he must present to the evil Mr. Mega of Mega Music. If he fails, he risks losing his sweetheart, Didi. An unfamiliar exit on the highway puts Del in a bizarre town called Flooby Nooby, where a series of Plymptonesque encounters unfold.
The musical and visual styles change from scene to scene. In one sequence, Del watches a realistically rendered couple doing the tango. Each time the music calls for a dip, the man leans over his partner and tells a profoundly bad joke. When a blowsy diner waitress sings "Good Again," a country song about reunited couples getting back together, Looney Tunes images appear on the screen, including a hamburger that sits in a living-room chair, pining for the french fry whose framed picture he holds in his hand.
"The Tune" is a monument to persistence. Mr. Plympton drew all 30,000 cels for the film himself, over a period of about two years. His assistant, Jessica Wolk-Stanley, used a $10 set of Pelikan watercolors to add color, with Mr. Plympton putting on the final details with colored pencil, a technique that accounts for the characteristic shimmer of his images. He worked at a small drawing table, wearing a fingerless cotton glove on his right hand to keep oils from his skin away from the paper, with a mirror propped up in front of him so that he could make faces.
To finance the film, which cost about $175,000, he sold segments of it to Expanded Entertainment for the "Tournee of Animation," an annual touring festival of short subjects, and to MTV, which had featured his Microtoons in the past. One segment, "Push Comes to Shove," won the jury prize at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1991. His big breakthrough came when Grey Advertising hired him to make two commercials for Trivial Pursuit.
 
Once Was Quite Enough
 "I'll probably never animate another film by myself," said Mr. Plympton, whose bland, placid manner seems entirely at odds with his work. "It was fun and an adventure, but the joy is gone for me. Next time, I'm hiring animators."
Mr. Plympton said he approached a few large studios, without success. "They wanted nothing to do with it," he said. "A gag in which a rock goes through a guy's head was something they weren't used to." The film was picked up by October Films, a small art-film distributor.
Like most other Americans of his generation, Mr. Plympton, a native of Oregon, grew up on Disney animation, the most important early influence on his art, along with the Warner Brothers cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, who animated Daffy Duck and early Bugs Bunny cartoons, and Chuck Jones in his Road Runner period. As a child, he would draw for hours on used butcher paper that his mother gave him, working the bloodstains into story lines. At 14, he sent his work to Disney Studios, which told him he was too young for a job.
Although he studied graphic design at Portland State University, he is self-taught as a cartoonist and animator. While at college he discovered the work of Rene Magritte, the Belgian Surrealist, and Roland Topor, whom he describes as "Magritte on drugs -- actually, Magritte on bad drugs." Another influence is A. B. Frost, a turn-of-the-century American illustrator best known for his drawings for the Uncle Remus tales.
 
'I Was Treated Like a God'
 After moving to New York in 1969, Mr. Plympton worked as an illustrator and cartoonist for newspapers and magazines. For a time he turned out a syndicated political cartoon strip, "Plympton," carried in about 20 newspapers in the United States. In 1985 he animated "Boomtown," a song by Jules Feiffer, and, as the cartoon made its way from festival to festival, got his first taste of fame.
"That was an eye-opener," he said. "Basically, I was treated like a god, with limos picking me up, the whole works, and I thought, 'Why am I wasting my time illustrating?' "
Mr. Plympton turned to animation full time, making such films as "25 Ways to Quit Smoking," "How to Kiss" and "Your Face," which was nominated for an Academy Award for best animation in 1987. All of them are conceptually quirky and rough around the edges, in part out of economic necessity, in part because Mr. Plympton prefers the look. "We're the garage band of animation compared to the symphony orchestra of Disney," he said. "I like the raw quality. It's a counter to the glossy, airbrushed quality of 'Beauty and the Beast.' "
Mr. Plympton's short films also reflect a fascination with the oddities of the human body, whose bizarre metamorphoses he executes with great facility. "The hard part for me is the sound effects," he said. "I don't know what it would sound like if a boulder passed through somebody's nose."
 
Physical, Please, Not Cerebral
 Mr. Plympton recoiled at the suggestion that his work, for all its idiosyncrasy, might be described as intellectual. If the mild-mannered Mr. Plympton can be said to despise anything, it is cerebral cartoonists and the government grants that support them. "A lot of films are supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and others," he said, "and as a rule they are the most unbearable to watch."
Mr. Plympton says he does not care to share their company. "My work is physical humor," he said. "I'm more visceral and unself-conscious."
This is literally true. His next feature, a combination of live action and animation, includes a sequence in which a character's brain, heart, lung and spleen jump up on his shoulder and sing a number called "It Takes Guts."
The singing, dancing organs are the kind of twist that fans of Mr. Plympton look for, like the sumo wrestler who drops from the sky to extinguish a cigarette in "25 Ways to Quit Smoking," hitting the ground with a satisfying splat. He is the first of 25 increasingly bizarre variations on a theme, which returns, triumphantly, to the sumo wrestler, the final, weighty exclamation point to the film.
"The ideal cartoon should build, hit a plateau, ease off and then build again, until the people are in such a frenzy they can't stand it, and then the credits roll," Mr. Plympton said. "Really, it's the same with food or sex."

HEADLINE: Harmful Politicking in California

 BODY:
Despite a serious recession, California remains wealthier than many nations. Yet for two months it has had to pay some employees and many bills with i.o.u.'s, and its credit rating has plummeted. The episode has embarrassed California's politicians. It also challenges them to a higher order of statesmanship the next time around.
Yesterday's $57.4 billion budget agreement may well improve the state's credit rating and its investment climate. It may also be sufficient to finance hard-pressed schools, health clinics and other public programs. But the margin for error is slim. If the revenue projections are too optimistic, California will face some tough choices next year. Budget planners assume that personal income will rise by 7.8 percent by 1993; but economists expect less. 
 California's problems are threefold. Its huge population is accustomed to generous public services. Its economy has been battered by recession and cuts in defense spending. And its politicians -- a Republican administration and a Democratic Legislature -- usually seem more interested in looking good for their constituencies than in doing good for the state as a whole.
The Legislature, embittered by voter-mandated term limits and deep staff cuts, has been running scared. And Gov. Pete Wilson, whose popularity dropped when he imposed modest tax increases last year, wasn't eager to take the same risk again.
There was also a genuinely difficult division over funds for education. Democrats insisted on honoring a voter-approved law that guarantees a minimum of 40 percent of general funds for education. Governor Wilson argued that the schools were overpaid last year and that in hard times they had to take their fair share of budget cuts.
In the end, Mr. Wilson got most of what he wanted, though the Legislature managed to spare some items. But little was changed from a budget proposal that could have been adopted in the spring.
Economic health may not return to California in time to prevent more budgetary pain next year. Even so, there's time for Californians to ask their officials whether they can't do a little bit more for their state with a lot less posturing.

HEADLINE: China Flunks a Freedom Test

 BODY:
China would like Americans to applaud its economic reforms while averting their eyes from abuses like arbitrary arrest, torture and slave labor. But such selective vision now becomes much harder after two disturbing events.
A report was smuggled out of China documenting the harsh torture of political prisoners. And Chinese police, striking at night, arrested a peaceful democracy campaigner, Shen Tong, and two young associates. The disposition of their case remains unclear. 
 The United States does not have to stand idly by while human rights are so outrageously violated. The best way to encourage a long-overdue political thaw in China is for the Senate to approve a House-passed trade bill that would penalize China for human rights abuses.
Shen Tong, a leader of the 1989 democracy movement in Tiananmen Square, returned to China a month ago following three years of exile in the United States. He was arrested just hours before he was to address a press conference to inaugurate the first Chinese chapter of the Democracy for China Fund, the movement Mr. Shen helped launch from the U.S.
Shen Tong's brave plans challenged Beijing to clarify its attitude toward freedom of association. While China remains a Communist police state, its leaders brag that political stability has been restored. They recently invited student exiles to return home without fear of retribution.
But when confronted with the prospect of public criticism, Chinese authorities spectacularly failed the test. Along with Shen Tong, they seized Qi Dafeng and Qian Liyun, and expelled Ross Terrill, a scholar from Boston accompanying them. The police also confiscated notebooks and computer disks, placing at risk all Chinese who may have spoken with Mr. Shen or his friends.
Yesterday the Times Op-Ed page published a plea by Shen Tong for peaceful change, along with a document smuggled out of Lingyuan prison detailing barbaric tortures now being inflicted on the imprisoned democrats of Tiananmen Square. International pressure is needed to protect Shen Tong and his colleagues from a similar fate.
Americans have a ready vehicle for demanding an early end to China's outrageous treatment of those who dare to call for democracy and civil rights. The Senate will soon be voting on President Bush's request to exempt China from the high tariffs it would otherwise face because of its Communist system and its failure to permit free emigration.
The House has wisely ignored the President, approving a bill to impose selective tariffs if abuses continue. This bill carefully protects the reform-minded private sector of China's coastal enclaves, reserving penalties only for state industries and only if they persist in defying internationally recognized human rights for another year.
Enacting that legislation, by the necessary veto-proof margin, would place America on the side of political as well as economic reform. That, not the side of torture and repression, is where America belongs.

HEADLINE: Essay;
I Am a Pencil

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE, Md.

 BODY:
One sign, up near the stage in the amphitheater, reads "Stills," inviting not moonshiners but still photographers.
Another, near good seats in the center, proclaims "Cameras," for the TV medium. 
 Behind them, the view largely blocked, is the designation "Radio and Pencils," which was where I took a seat at yesterday's Clinton rally at Montgomery College in Maryland.
What a deliciously archaic synecdoche: pencils, to stand for "the writing press," much as head is the part used for the whole of "cattle." Most of the pencils around me take notes with laser-point pens or hand-held recorders or laptop computers and would not know a lead pencil from an antique quill, but the figure of speech is apt and original to this campaign.
I am a pencil. So is the 10-year-old boy sitting in the row below, laboriously writing an essay while we await the arrival of the candidate. I can make out the large block letters at the top of the page on his composition pad: "A Saga of Carnage," presumably about Hurricane Andrew; it is unlikely his topic is the plight of the Bosnians or Somalis.
The school chosen to be the setting for the day's public campaign event is the two-year community college in Montgomery County, Maryland, a wealthy area in a Democratic state. It has good facilities and teachers, superb jewelry-making and crafts courses, and is close enough to Washington D.C. to provide a useful suburban backdrop for a stump speech with emphasis on education during a day of political huddles.
The crowd is a couple of thousand nice people on a pleasant day. Many are bedecked in badges, festooned in ribbons of momentary authority.
Governor Clinton ambles in. I remember Richard Nixon explaining how a political leader should make an entrance, striding into a room or onto a stage briskly and authoritatively, taking charge -- but that's not the Clinton style. He eases his way to the platform, almost sleepily listens to the introductions, and embarks on his speech in a folksy way.
What's good about his stump speech is this: Clinton speaks from notes but does not read at an audience, in contrast to President Bush, who is chained to his ever-changing text. The repeated Democratic mes- sage is health care, education, the new economy -- positive themes, delivered in a non-threatening way. He scored a mild point by deriding last year's 23 percent bloating of the White House staff.
The general impression is that this guy means well and is not likely to do much harm, which befits a front-runner's strategy of playing not to lose.
What's not so good about the Clinton stump speech is this: He won't win by playing not to lose. He must sharpen and toughen his assault on the present deadness in the water, and stop calling it the status quo. He has to learn to bring people out of their seats.
Unlike President Bush, who knows how to capitalize on current events, Mr. Clinton does not use a new fact to work himself into some passion. He briefly cited that day's economic news -- that personal income in real dollars had declined last year -- but with quicker staff work, could have made that shocker the centerpiece of his speech and made the network news with his most effective message: Times are tough.
The unwary Clinton, pleased that the Bush family-values balloon has failed to rise, may be stepping into a generational trap. Mr. Bush charges that Democrats will raise taxes, striking fear into wage-earners; Mr. Clinton is counter-charging that Republicans will cut services, frightening retirees. Workers outnumber retirees; if these are the battle lines, Bush will win.
Here in the amphitheater, candidate Clinton is wrapping up, charging wonkily that the country is "undereducated, underorganized, underinvested and underled."
I'm underwhelmed. So is the kid doing his homework, who has made good progress with "A Saga of Carnage."
But the campaign is just getting started; the opposing candidates are sparring, not yet slugging; we undecideds are in no rush to make a decision; and the political carnage lies ahead. It's a great time to be a pencil.

HEADLINE: Don't Pity Japan's Part-Time Rice Farmers;
Rejecting Profligacy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Japan's Broken Pledge of Change Comes Back to Haunt Its Economy" (front page, Aug. 15): From the 1970's, the United States has admonished Germany and Japan to jump-start a lagging world economy by importing and consuming with American abandon.
In the early 1980's, the Reagan Administration showed the way with munificent tax cuts and military expenditures, turning the country into the world's largest debtor nation. The demise of the cold war nullified most of the investment in military hardware, and research and development programs like "Star Wars"; massive deficits also prolong the recession. 
 Japan, fortunately for its economy and the world's, would have none of this profligacy. Its federal budget shows a rare surplus among the richest countries, enabling it to finance an increased public-works program of $48 billion to bolster a slowing economy. The slowdown has adversely affected corporate profits, leading not to massive layoffs, as in America, but to less private capital spending.
Meanwhile, Japanese foreign aid (grown to United States levels) and corporate direct investments have helped turn East and Southeast Asia into one of the most dynamic regions in the world. Germany is attempting a similar transformation in Eastern Europe, so far without much support from a highly indebted Washington.
In a capital-starved world with actual starvation in parts of Africa and Asia, it borders on the barbaric to advocate that a major dispenser of foreign aid and investment funds like Japan should instead switch to consuming the output of other wealthy nations.

HEADLINE: 3 Haitians With H.I.V. Are Allowed to Enter U.S.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Waiving regulations that bar foreigners with the virus that causes AIDS from entering the United States, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization has allowed three infected Haitians held at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to come to American hospitals for treatment.
The decision to grant the Haitians "humanitarian parole" is the first breach in a wall of rules, policies and court decisions that have combined to trap nearly 300 Haitians at Guantanamo because either they or a family member on whom they depend has tested positive for H.I.V. 
 All these Haitians were initially determined to be eligible to enter the United States to apply for asylum because they had demonstrated a plausible fear of persecution in immigration interviews. Haitian refugees who could not demonstrate such a threat have been returned.
But because these Haitians tested H.I.V. positive, they were left behind when others were moved to Miami to apply for asylum.
The Haitians at Guantanamo are becoming increasingly restive. They have staged three demonstrations since mid-July, two of them violent. In the most recent one on Saturday, buildings were destroyed by a mob trying to free fellow refugees who had been detained and quarantined for earlier acts of violence.
A 1987 rule that bars entry into the United States to foreigners who have tested positive for H.I.V. has drawn wide criticism and recently led to the shift of a conference on AIDS to Amsterdam from Boston when some participants were not granted visas.
The three Haitians for whom the rule was waived include a man sent to Bethesda Naval Hospital for the treatment of an eye fungus about 10 days ago and a mother and baby evacuated to a children's hospital in Norfolk, Va., on Tuesday night because the child had pneumonia and needed a respirator. They are expected to remain in the United States. Once on American soil, they have the right to legal counsel.
More than 37,000 Haitians were intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard as they fled Haiti after the September 1991 coup that overthrew the elected Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. More than a quarter of them, 10,736 people, were able to convince immigration officials who interviewed them aboard ships at sea or at Guantanamo that they could face persecution if returned.
This extremely high proportion of Haitians qualifying for formal asylum hearings, which must take place on United States territory, was widely seen as a contradiction of arguments by the Bush Administration that most were economic migrants looking for a better life.
Some Administration officials apparently accused the Immigration service of being too lenient.
On May 24, President Bush directed that all Haitians picked up at sea be sent back to Port-au-Prince, the capital, without a hearing.
The first parole order issued on humanitarian grounds by the I.N.S. Commissioner, Gene McNary, was for Rigaud Milenette, 26 years old. The request to move him was made several weeks ago by the Navy, which sought specialist treatment for his eye condition.
Mr. Milenette was treated at Bethesda Naval Hospital, then moved to the Varick Street immigration detention center in Manhattan, where he is expected to apply for asylum. The still-unidentified woman and child are at the Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters in Norfolk, Va.
Arthur C. Helton, refugee project director for the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, which is trying to arrange legal counsel for Mr. Milenette, said: "While it may be politically awkward for the Administration, the decision to parole the H.I.V. Haitians is an appropriate humanitarian response It perhaps signals a willingness by the I.N.S. to respond to the plight of these Haitians in a humane fashion."
The Milenette case is seen as a test by lawyers who believe that other Haitians who are H.I.V. positive may develop full-scale AIDS or may have other medical problems for which they need treatment in American hospitals.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 5, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about an Immigration and Naturalization Service decision to grant visas to three Haitian refugees with the virus that causes AIDS misstated the reason why a recent international conference on the disease was moved from Boston to Amsterdam. It was because the United States had rejected a blanket request from conference organizers to change its policy barring H.I.V.-positive people from entering the country, not because some conference participants were denied visas.

The Economy
Sales rose 9.2 percent for domestically built cars and light trucks in late August. Analysts said demand for cars was flat, but purchases of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and other light trucks for personal transportation sent that category up 24.2 percent. [D1.]
Small businesses were the hardest hit by Hurricane Andrew, said I.B.M.'s general manager in South Florida, whose own home was devastated. But the damage will take weeks to assess. [D1.] 
 Retail sales meandered up slightly in August, with discounters and value merchants attracting the most shoppers. [D1.]
New claims for jobless benefits held near a two-year low in mid-August for the second consecutive week, the Labor Department said, offering hope that the job market is perking up. [D2.]
An expected plea bargain was aborted in the Southampton insider securities trading scandal, by a judge's vacation. [D12.]
 
Markets
The Treasury will award securities at a single price and yield in a year-long test of a new auction technique. The new process, to begin later this month, follows last summer's Treasury bidding scandal at Salomon Brothers. [D1.] With California's $57.4 billion budget signed, the state entered the market with $3.3 billion of one-month notes to pay past-due bills and salaries. [D12.]
Stocks closed slightly higher, but well below the day's peak as traders turned cautious ahead of the August employment report. The Dow industrials closed up 1.89 points at 3,292.20. Japanese stocks soared. [D6.]
Natural gas prices rose sharply, following Government reports of serious hurricane damage to gas-producing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. [D13.] The dollar and gold both rose. [D13.]
 
Companies
Chrylser, finding a minor defect in its crucial L/H sedan, tried to recall the first 4,000 cars quietly, lest a public announcement jeopardize sales. Then a reporter found out. [D3.]
G.M. said there would be no bonuses for its 95,000 salaried workers in North America. Separately, the automaker and a U.A.W. local in Lordstown, Ohio, agreed that future layoffs because of sluggish demand would hit workers in Ramos, Mexico, first. [D3.]
A $21 million settlement was agreed to by Sandoz and Baxter International's Caremark. They were sued by 33 states because of annual charges of $8,944 for clozapine, a schizophrenia drug. [D3.]
Ames Stores cut second-quarter losses to $36.2 million from $46.5 million a year earlier by slashing expenses and reducing interest before filing for bankruptcy protection. [D3.]
Victor Posner agreed to sell half of his shares in DWG, a soft drink, restaurant, textile and propane company, to Trian Group L.P. for $71.8 million. He will exchange the remainder into nonvoting preferred stock, and resign as chairman. [D3.]
GTE plans to sell nearly $1 billion of newly issued shares to the public. It is the nation's largest local-telephone company. [D3.]
Boeing will scale back 757 jetliner production, making seven of the mid-size aircraft a month, down from eight and a half. [D4.]
Kevin Maxwell was declared bankrupt by a British court, as part of an effort to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that he is accused of helping his father, the late Robert Maxwell, loot from the Maxwell media empire's pension funds. [D4.]
 
Today's Columns
Bargain hunters in European bond markets are betting that the dream of European monetary union will survive when France goes to the polls in two weeks and bidding up prices of E.C.U. bonds. With rates still at 9.65 percent, buy-and-hold investors could benefit regardless. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D6.]
In Florida, banks, insurance companies and other service marketers are using informative ads in the wake of Hurricane Andrew, rather than the self-congratulatory warm and fuzzy spots that followed previous disasters. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Sewer Districts Are Faulted on Pollution

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OYSTER BAY, L.I., Aug. 3

 BODY:
Warning that rising levels of nitrogen are killing marine life in Long Island Sound, environmentalists gathered here this morning and accused shoreline sewer districts of stalling on an agreement with Connecticut to reduce nitrogen pollution from sewage-treatment plants.
While praising Connecticut for meeting the standards set in a pact with New York State a year ago, the environmentalists said sewer districts in New York, from Westchester to Suffolk County, were dragging their feet by calling for more hearings and more costly studies. 
 "Long Island Sound is dying," said Jeffrey Fullmer of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment. "This unmatched natural and economic resource has been slowly degraded and abused to the point where much of the life that inhabits its waters is now, quite literally, gasping for breath due to severe hypoxia."
 
End to Opposition Urged
 Nitrogen from sewage-treatment plants has been identified by marine biologists as a primary contributor to hypoxia, a condition in which low levels of oxygen kills bottom-dwelling marine life. Nitrogen levels can be reduced they said, by storing the effluent for a longer period before discharging it. For most plants, however, such action requires building additional storage tanks.
Mr. Fullmer urged local officials to drop their opposition to cleanup measures and join in seeking state and Federal funds to improve sewage-treatment plants.
His remarks were applauded by other environmentalists and several baymen at the small gathering near the boat ramps here in Roosevelt Park. But at least one man standing at the fringe was not pleased.
David Layton, one of three commissioners of the Oyster Bay Sewer District, objected to the group holding its meeting in the park, with Oyster Bay Harbor in the background.
He described the demand for a cap on the release of nitrogen as "environmental glitz" and said it was "not fair to ask local taxpayers to pay for something that had yet to be proved was totally necessary." Besides, he said, the Oyster Bay sewer district is meeting its 1990 nitrogen cap.
Discharge permits for each sewage district are issued by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The state sets the effluent limitations and requires compliance. But a district can request hearings on matters concerning discharge permits, a procedure the environmentalists fear will be used to delay the capping of nitrogen levels.
In Albany, Robert Bendick, the department's Deputy Commissioner for Natural Resources, said he had sent letters to all nine districts seeking hearings, offering to negotiate settlements, which he said would avoid "further costly delays." So far, he said he had received no replies.
He said the state was able to help a district in Westchester secure a Federal grant to upgrade its plant. He said that other districts could apply for funds, at 3 percent interest, made available under a program recently signed into law by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. In addition, he said the Governor's economic development bond act would make funds available if it is approved by voters in November.

HEADLINE: Businesses Reeling From Storm

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CORAL GABLES, Fla., Sept. 3

 BODY:
For Tony Romero, the general manager of I.B.M.'s operations in South Florida, Hurricane Andrew was as much a personal hardship as a business challenge. His spacious white-stucco house overlooking Biscayne Bay, several miles south of I.B.M.'s regional office here, is now a battered, mud-caked wreck.
The surge from the storm shattered the bolts on his front door. The living room furniture lies broken like kindling against one wall. The hurricane ripped down his ceilings, toppled walls and spread a thick layer of mud everywhere. "As you can see, I've lost everything here," Mr. Romero said. 
 But this week, Mr. Romero was back on the job, helping I.B.M. families recover and working with hundreds of I.B.M. customers, from large corporations to tiny companies, whose businesses were hit by Hurricane Andrew. And during an afternoon stint on the road with Mr. Romero, surveying the damage, he offered a judgment of the hurricane's impact on his customers and the danger it poses to South Florida's $85 billion-a-year economy that echoes the consensus heard in the last few days from business people and government officials.
 
Burger King Hit
 Some big companies, like the Burger King Corporation, were hit hard. Yet large corporations are the ones with deep pockets, ample manpower and backup disaster programs that should enable them to make it through without lasting damage to their business.
But, Mr. Romero says, it is the small businesses whose fortunes are most in doubt now. "It will be in the next few weeks that we really know how badly some of our small-business customers were hurt," he said, driving past a strip of boarded-up commercial buildings. "A lot of them are still struggling to find shelter for their families. They haven't gone back to their offices, shops and stores yet."
The Beacon Council, the economic development agency for Dade County, estimates that up to 7,800 small companies, employing more than 50,000 workers, are in danger of going out of business in the next couple of months unless they receive emergency funds and logistical help to get up and running quickly. "The greatest risk to this economy is that we will lose huge numbers of small businesses," said John Anderson, president of Beacon Council, a government-business partnership.
The concern is well founded. In South Florida, it is mainly small companies in service industries -- wholesalers, retailers, financial and business services -- that generate most of the economic activity and jobs. Nearly 95 percent of the 60,000 companies in Dade County employ 50 or fewer workers, and 75 percent of the total have 10 or fewer. Sixty-five percent of the 840,000 workers in the county are employed in wholesale and retail trade and business and financial services, according to John Godfrey, chief economist of Barnett Banks Inc., the state's largest bank.
To help small businesses, especially in south Dade County, the area hit hardest, the state announced today that the Beacon Council would be granted $10 million in state funds to provide interest-free, six-month emergency loans of up to $25,000 each. The council says that many of the loans could be for as little as $5,000 to $10,000. Most important, council officials say, is to have an expedited procedure for disbursing the funds in a few days rather than the weeks or longer it can take to go through the paperwork for Federal disaster relief.
A business will qualify for quick cash if it can show it was a going enterprise before the hurricane. "We're trying to break the rules to help save businesses," Mr. Anderson explained. "Time is short for many of these firms -- they can't wait 60 to 120 days."
 
Teetering on the Edge
 Ursula Vaccaro, the president of Tops Plus Inc., a three-person specialty advertising company that supplies big companies with everything from coffee mugs bearing the corporate logo to sales awards, is one of the small companies teetering on the edge. The roof was blown off her warehouse and office in Kendall, a town a few miles north of Homestead, and the rains destroyed more than $10,000 worth of inventory and office equipment.
For now, Ms. Vaccaro is trying to keep her business going, working by telephone from the bedroom of her storm-damaged house, redirecting shipments and getting in touch with customers nationwide. A single mother who supports two children, she has a slender savings account that will not support the business without emergency funds and a temporary location, until her business is repaired. "This is not the kind of business where you have a lot of working capital," she said. "We live from week to week."
Nearby, Tony Mears runs a bigger business, but has similar problems. He is the president of the Sharon Lawrence Company, a nine-employee enterprise that supplies bathroom accessories, from toilet seats to shower curtains, to specialty retailers. The company did both light manufacturing and marketing from the 5,000-square-foot building it leased. The company had sales of more than $300,000 a year, but Mr. Mears estimates the storm damage at more than $50,000.
Mr. Mears needs to get his building repaired and power restored quickly if the business is to survive. Meanwhile, his nine employees are not being paid. "I'd like to, but I can't," he said.
At big companies, Hurricane Andrew has been more a manageable hardship than a struggle for economic survival. Particularly, the companies that supply the infrastructure of business, like I.B.M. or the Atlanta-based BellSouth Corporation, moved almost as soon as the winds eased, to dispatch people, food, trucks and cash to their local employees and to attend to customers' problems.
Linda Isenhour, for example, is the network manager for BellSouth, the regional telephone company providing service in Dade County. She is in charge of restoring the phones here and managing nearly four times the normal load of calls while working nearly round-the-clock even though she lost her home to Hurricane Andrew. "I've been working most days from 5 A.M. to 11 P.M. to try to keep up," she said.
At I.B.M., the company has all but set up its own privately stocked economy. Food has been brought in and a tractor-trailer with 40,000 pounds of scarce ice is parked behind the office in Coral Gables. Teams of volunteers found new housing for suddenly homeless I.B.M. families. Mr. Romero and his family are now residing in a company-provided house in Fort Lauderdale. "I.B.M. took care of my wife and two children while I went back to work," Mr. Romero explained.
One job Mr. Romero has tackled is helping to get Burger King's worldwide computer network up and running again. The fast-food company's headquarters overlooking Biscayne Bay, near the town of Perrine, was gutted by the hurricane. The company's data processing center, where four I.B.M. mainframes churn away, is in a separate building about six miles inland from the headquarters. It lost its roof and suffered water damage.
 
Temporary Offices
 Burger King's 16-member support staff for personal computers and point-of-sale equipment, which helps the outlets with computer questions, has moved from the headquarters to temporary office space at I.B.M.'s building in Coral Gables. And about 80 people from Burger King's data center, software maintenance engineers and systems specialists, are about to move into a floor in the I.B.M. building temporarily.
Though scattered, the Burger King data center staff should be operating pretty much normally by next week. "I'm surprised we're getting back up so quickly," said Robert Ramsden, Burger King's vice president for information systems.
I.B.M. could make room for the Burger King staff partly because its own local work force has been sliced by 18 percent in a little more than a year, to 630, as part of the computer giant's sharp cutbacks worldwide. And for his part, the 42-year-old Mr. Romero sees an intangible payoff for the company resulting from the hurricane as people worked in pickup teams to help each other and customers.
"For the past two weeks there have been no individual agendas around here, only a corporate agenda and I.B.M. family agenda," he said. "It sounds strange but I think this experience has been terrific for I.B.M. here."

9.2% Rise In Sales Of Vehicles

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose 9.2 percent in late August. Analysts said automotive demand, although still on the sluggish side, was influenced more than ever by consumers who chose mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and other light trucks instead of cars for personal use.
In late August car sales were flat, while light-truck sales rose 24.2 percent. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 5.9 million for the Aug. 21-31 period, compared with 6.2 million last year and 6.2 million in the middle of August. 
 But automotive analysts noted that sales of light trucks, imported and domestic, were up 17.9 percent, to 397,884, for the entire month, while car sales dropped 3 percent, to 648,664, in the corresponding period. Over all, vehicle sales for the month of August rose 4 percent, to 1,046,548.
"Demand weakened in July," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "It's not getting any worse; it's not getting any better. It just looks a lot worse if you concentrate on cars only."
John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company, said light trucks were slightly more than 20 percent of total automotive purchases in 1981. Last month, light trucks were more than 38 percent of vehicles purchased.
For the last few months, retail car dealers have said they have not been able to discern a demand pattern. Nor have sales developed momentum: A few weeks of strong sales suddenly are followed by few buyers, or vice versa. "We just scratch our heads and wonder if everybody gets together and says let's buy a car, or, as we say here, maybe it's the full moon," said Dick LaGruth, who sells General Motors brands in Pine City, Minn.
The Big Three continued to take market share from Japanese brands in August. G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation cumulatively captured 68 percent of car and light-truck sales, up from 64.2 percent last August. Japanese brands, meanwhile, captured 26.8 percent, down from 29 percent a year ago. Other import brands dropped to 5.2 percent of the market, from 6.8 percent last year.
 
Market Shares Shift
 In the car market, including imports and domestics, G.M.'s share of the market slipped, while Chrysler and Ford gained. G.M.'s sales dropped 7.1 percent from a year earlier to 198,172, while Ford's car sales increased 8.1 percent, to 139,964. Chrysler car sales rose 7.7 percent, to 52,763.
Robert L. Rewey, Ford's vice president-sales operations, said because interest rates on car loans were the lowest since Ford began that business in 1959, "our dealers remain optimistic about their potential for further sales and share improvement in the months ahead." He singled out the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, among car lines, for particularly strong sales.
Among Japanese auto makers, the Honda Motor Company's car sales slipped 7.6 percent, to 72,045; the Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales slipped 4.6 percent, to 66,278, and the Nissan Motor Company's car sales rose 1.8 percent, to 39,821. All Honda's models, except the Honda Prelude and Acura Integra, were below last August. Japanese auto makers have been hurt by price increases taken partly in response to the weak dollar.
In light trucks, Ford gained market share, while G.M. and Chrysler lost slightly.

HEADLINE: Officials Seek More Ferries To Manhattan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In a vision of hydrofoils and catamarans whisking commuters across New York's waterways, officials said yesterday that they were asking private companies to provide new high-speed commuter ferry lines between Manhattan and eight terminals across the city and suburbs.
Under the plan, announced jointly by the Dinkins and Cuomo administrations, the ferries would provide commuter service to communities including Oyster Bay, L.I., Nyack in Rockland County and Yonkers and Rye in Westchester. 
 Since the mid-1980's, private ferry operators have made large investments in new service from docks in Manhattan to La Guardia Airport in Queens, Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River. Yesterday's announcement represents the first concerted effort by the city and state to expand service elsewhere in the region.
Under the proposal, the city and state would designate routes and provide piers and terminals at little or no cost to ferry operators. But government "is not contemplating operating subsidies," according to a formal request for proposals, which is being distributed among shipping companies and ferry operators.
 
A Question of Affordable Fares
 How much of the ambitious plan will become reality remains to be seen. The key question is whether, without government subsidies, ferry operators can offer service at a price commuters will pay.
One new private ferry line, linking the St. George terminal on Staten Island to Pier 84 on the West Side of midtown Manhattan, is clearly the most likely to succeed because $12 million in Federal financing has already been committed to the project.
Without public subsidy, ferry services have proven risky ventures. Unless they can lure a high volume of passengers and justify frequent trips, they must charge unattractively high prices. Of a dozen private services that have started serving New York City since 1990, four have failed.
One success has been the Port Imperial Ferrybus line, serving downtown Manhattan for $5 one way, and midtown Manhattan for $4 one way, from Weehawken since 1986. It has more than 8,000 riders a day.
Vince Baglivo, a spokesman for the line's owner, Arthur E. Imperatore, said yesterday, "Our system continues to grow, and that speaks well for the potential of other new service." He said Mr. Imperatore might consider submitting a proposal to operate one or more of the new routes.
 
Sixteenfold Increase in 6 Years
 Proponents of the plan can point to a rapid increase in ridership on private ferry services started over the last eight years, particularly those plying the Hudson River between Manhattan and New Jersey. From 1986, when the ferries carried less than 1,000 passengers a day, New York State officials said ridership grew to over 16,000 people a day in July.
The plan was created by the High Speed Ferry Task Force, an advisory panel formed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a year ago. The group said 70 ferry operators and shipbuilding concerns attended a conference on an early version of the plan in April at the World Trade Center.
The officials said they would set a November deadline for private proposals, and select routes and operators early next year. Some of the new ferry services could begin by the fall of 1993, according to the announcement.
If it succeeds, the plan could help alleviate some of the region's most vexing environmental and economic problems. Any increase in commuting by ferry would reduce traffic congestion and auto emissions, and make better use of long-abandoned piers that have blighted the region's waterfront for decades.
"We must move forward with transportation systems that are environmentally sound," said Mayor David N. Dinkins in a prepared statement.
The plan could also revive some of the maritime activity that has long been lost in New York Harbor, the Hudson River and the East River. When ferry service in the region peaked soon after 1900, it included 125 separate lines.
Ultimately, officials said, the plan may also stimulate a revival of the long-dormant shipbuilding that once thrived in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and elsewhere in Brooklyn and Queens. The state's Urban Development Corporation said it would provide $1.5 million in low-interest loans and other incentives to shipbuilders who start new operations in the city.
If it appears a throwback, the new plan also depends on advanced technology. Officials said they would leave it to private companies to determine what type of ferries work best, but one requirement is speed.
The city and state said they would only consider proposals for ferries that routinely operate at a minimum of 23 miles an hour, and would prefer faster boats that command 34.5 miles an hour. By comparison, the stalwart of New York ferry service, the Staten Island Ferry, chugs to St. George from lower Manhattan at a maximum of 18.4 miles an hour.
Among the sites designated for service outside Manhattan are the Tappan Beach Marina in Oyster Bay; Rye Playland, an amusement park in Westchester; Hunters Point in Queens, the Yonkers Recreational Pier; a site adjacent to the Tappan Zee Bridge in Rockland County; Ferry Point Park in the Bronx; and the Brooklyn Army Terminal or the 69th Street Pier in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: In Israel, Cuomo Stresses Economics Over Defense

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Taking his first look at Israel, both on the ground and from the air, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that although no one doubts the legitimacy of Israel's security concerns, Israeli leaders may find that solving their economic problems is a more formidable task than protecting themselves from military threat.
To underline that point, the Governor flew by helicopter to the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War, to see a highly fortified territory that Israel annexed 11 years ago and that most Israelis say they cannot return without undermining their safety. 
 He was aware of the Golan's military significance, he said, "But even if you know the words, knowing the music is something else. I want to stand there and look at it myself." Mr. Cuomo and his wife, Matilda, were on the first full day of a trip that is to last through Saturday.
 
Meeting With Rabin
 The Governor also offered some advice on getting one's fiscal house in order. On that score, he got no argument from Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, with whom he held an hourlong meeting. Mr. Rabin has often said that generating jobs and rebuilding Israel's infrastructure are priorities of his seven-week-old Government.
"Finding work in the private sector for people -- that's Israel's big problem in the long range, probably an even more formidable problem than finding appropriate military security arrangements," Mr. Cuomo said.
In meetings with the country's leaders, Mr. Cuomo focused on economic cooperation between New York State, with its $54 billion annual budget and Israel, whose annual budget is about $40 billion.
Israel's importance to New York State cannot be overstated, he said. Israel buys more than $800 million a year in goods produced in New York, a figure that does not include services like banking and law. With the Israeli Finance Ministry, the Governor announced a new "task force for economic progress" to explore ways of expanding the cooperation.
Mr. Cuomo visited a subsidiary of the AVX Company, a New York designer and manufacturer of electronic components. He also went to Hebrew University to see a demonstration of the New York State Education and Research Network, a high-speed communications system that links researchers in New York, Israel and Germany.

New claims for unemployment benefits in mid-August held near a two-year low for the second consecutive week, the Government said yesterday, offering hope that the nation's job market is perking up.
The number of claims increased a less-than-expected 3,000, to 386,000, during the week ended Aug. 22, the Labor Department said. Before the previous week, the claims number had not dipped below 400,000 since October 1990, early in the recession. 
 "We're gradually crawling up from the bottom," said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.
Two reports on the second quarter -- one on Americans' productivity, the other on mortgage delinquencies -- showed that the economy was struggling.
The productivity of nonfarm workers increased at a healthy seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 percent, building on an even bigger gain in the first quarter, the Labor Department said.
But economists said the figure largely reflected employers' decisions to defer hiring in a soft economy and to work their existing people harder.
The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said the percentage of homeowners 30 or more days behind on their mortgage payments jumped to 4.77 percent in the second quarter from 4.52 percent in the first three months of the year.
When claims fell to 383,000 during the week ended Aug. 15 from 474,000 the week before, many analysts were skeptical. They said the big swing might have simply been a rebound from a surge caused by a temporary shutdown at General Motors factories. But they were reassured that the improvement held during the latest week.
"It's an important number and if we get one or two more weeks of it, it will confirm that the labor market is stabilizing at the minimum and perhaps moving in the direction of acceleration," said Thomas Carpenter, an economist with ASB Capital Management in Washington.
A moving four-week average of claims, which smooths out the weekly fluctuations, fell to 411,500, from 432,250. It was the lowest in five weeks.
Economists warn, however, that claims will probably surge temporarily after employees working for hurricane-destroyed businesses in Florida and Louisiana file for benefits.

HEADLINE: The Secret Night Life of Wall St.;
After Hours, a Surprising Mix of Work, Noise and Solitude

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
From the portals of Trinity Church on lower Broadway, you can look down the grand alley of Wall Street and see across the East River to the rooftops in Brooklyn. That's the high sightline, a lovely slice of New York.
But at 5 P.M. no one is looking down Wall Street because everyone is walking up, thousands of people and briefcases, two sidewalks' worth, a purposeful, slightly bedraggled mass of bankers and brokers and lawyers sending as single-minded a message as New Yorkers ever send: Let's get out of here. Let's go home. 
 And in an hour, more or less, all of them are gone, from Wall Street, from the World Trade Center, from Financial Square, leaving behind them the manmade caverns that, according to popular belief, echo with emptiness till dawn.
That was a myth belied this week by the burst water main at South and Broad Streets, which at 1:30 on Tuesday morning forced the evacuation of two buildings, 55 Water and 125 Broad, where -- surprise! -- hundreds of people happened to be at work.
 
People Even Live There
 The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps no figures on the number of people who work at night in the financial district, but in addition to the white collars working overtime, they include data entry clerks for the financial firms, legal assistants, building maintenance and security people. There is a handful of bartenders and deli workers and a phalanx of limo drivers. And according to the 1990 census, there are 2,215 people actually living there, in the triangle south of Fulton and Vesey Streets, but not including the development at Battery Park City.
Whatever the exact dimensions of the population, a sundown-to-sunup ramble through the area two nights after the water-main break turned up a whole idiosyncratic pocket of street culture. It's very uncitylike, where all the traffic is limousines and garbage trucks (even in deepest night, it's never quiet), where you encounter people one at a time and everyone says hello and will more than likely stop to chat if you ask them to. To judge from a night of such conversations, they tend to be loquacious and amiable and a little melancholy, and, like people in a small town, they seem to share a secret they're proud of.
"It's nice to come out here at 3 A.M.," said Tad Davis, a 27-year-old legal proofreader who was strolling the vast Austin J. Tobin Plaza in the middle of his shift, a lone speck at the base of the twin World Trade towers. "There's a sense of owning the World Trade Center."
A portly, bespectacled man with a long ponytail, Mr. Davis arrived in New York seven years ago from Austin, Tex., he said, with aspirations to be an opera singer.
"But somewhere along the line the reality of making a living hits you," he said, "and you end up doing something ridiculous like this."
 
Working Without Windows
 He works three nights a week from 7 P.M. to 7 A.M., on the 57th floor of One World Trade Center, but in a room without windows. That's why he was taking his break outside. Solitude in such a spectacular setting, he agreed, is a rare and valuable thing.
"By the time we leave in the morning, we're like salmon swimming upstream," he said.
Mr. Davis said things had grown steadily grimmer in the last few years; the decline of prosperity on Wall Street has meant cutbacks in his co-workers, fewer perks. And that was a refrain repeated all night long.
At 1 A.M. yesterday in front of the Broad Gourmet Deli on the corner of Beaver and Broad, a fleet of white limousines -- maybe a dozen -- idled empty and their drivers sat on the street playing cards. They were waiting around for the lawyers or brokers, dozens of stories above them, who would need rides home to Nassau County or New Jersey. But with the mergers and acquisitions market dried up -- the drivers use the jargon -- there aren't as many late-night deals as there once were.
It wasn't all gloom and doom. Before the lights were doused at midnight on the statue of George Washington at 26 Wall (it's where Washington took his Presidential oath in 1789, and where Jon Bon Jovi filmed a rock video at dusk), four young people who described themselves as tourists from Bayside, Queens, pulled up in their car and took pictures of themselves dancing around the statue.
"We heard Bon Jovi was here," said Joel Goldenburg, getting back behind the wheel. "He owes me money."
One of his companions, Pamela Soskin, added: "This is our mission, to harass New York." And they sped off to locations unknown.
"Tourists," said a security guard coming off duty nearby who would give his name only as Ken. The building he works in, 40 Wall, is 71 stories tall and has a prominent spire. "Three times a day people come in thinking it's the Empire State Building."
A few blocks away in front of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Frank Sherry was just beginning his nightly exercise routine, which features acrobatic stretches and sit-ups on the memorial plaza, among other things. Mr. Sherry, who runs a courier company and works 10 P.M. to 5 A.M., takes an hour and a half every night to work out.
"I've kind of made my own gymnasium out of the neighborhood," he said. "I do my sit-ups here, wherever there's construction I can find a bar to do pull-ups. And I run steps over at the seaport."
Mr. Sherry, 40 years old, lives in Montclair, N.J., but he thinks of this neighborhood as a second home and of himself, apparently, as kind of a small town police chief. "I should tell you about my relentless pursuit of people who urinate in doorways," he said, before jogging into the darkness. "That's my pet peeve."
And one man, Richard Condello, who lives at 3 Hanover Square, was just heading off to a party on the Upper East Side at 2 A.M. He said he relished living in the neighborhood mainly because of its quietude and privacy, but he obviously hadn't met Mr. Sherry. "I could have sex right now, right over there on that bench, and nobody would care," he said. "They might look, but they wouldn't care."
As the night waned, back at 40 Wall, Tony Cestare put it all in some kind of order. Mr. Cestare, for three and a half years the security man from midnight to 8 A.M., has committed the nocturnal flow of events to memory. Surveying the empty street sometime after 3 A.M., he said, without irony, "Wall Street is becoming a ghost town, really." And when a garbage truck stopped to pick up the trash in front of the building, he recalled better days, before 40 Wall lost half its tenants.
"They used to have two trucks stop here," he said.
Mr. Cestare is a former transit policeman with the haircut and compact swagger that recall the actor James Caan -- "Yeah, I've heard that before," he said. He said he prefers night work, "because I'm not into people too much, to tell you the truth."
To all appearances, however, this isn't true. It was he who explained that the flurry of activity between midnight and 12:30 was the cleaning crews getting off work. And it was he who explained the chain of events that takes place nightly beginning at 4 A.M., and signaling the dawn.
It happened just as he said. First the vans arrive, a battalion of them, each towing a coffee cart which is dropped off on a sidewalk. Then the trucks begin -- the milk trucks, the bread trucks, the newspaper trucks. Then the daytime maintenance workers begin to trickle in off the subway.
"The first briefcases," Mr. Cestare said, "show up about 5:30."
Indeed, at 5:35, a gray-haired woman carrying a briefcase, wearing a blazer and a skirt and walking sneakers, got off the subway at Nassau and Wall and headed down the block. It was still pitch dark.
Headed in the door at 60 Wall, the J. P. Morgan building, she wouldn't give her name, nor comment on what it was like to work on Wall Street at night.
"Thank God I don't work at night," she said. "I work during the day."

GRAPHIC: Photos: At 5:00 A.M., one of the first signs of the coming business day on Wall Street was a coffee vendor's cart being set up in front of the steps of Federal Hall, which is diagonally across the street from the New York Stock Exchange; "I've kind of made my own gymnasium out of the neighborhood," Frank Sherry said, stretching at 2 A.M. by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; At 1:30 A.M., Andreas Vasiliou, a limousine driver, bounced a rubber ball in the street as he waited for a fare. The recession has meant fewer power-brokers working into the early morning hours before going home. (Photographs by Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Higher as Traders Await August Jobless Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against other major currencies yesterday as traders took positions ahead of the unemployment data due today. Gold prices rose.
An announcement by Britain's Treasury that it was borrowing billions to strenghten the pound also brought the dollar higher, said John McCarthy, chief currency trader at ABN-Amro Bank N.V. in New York. 
 "The announcement started traders selling off the German mark," Mr. McCarthy said. The pound and the dollar rose in afternoon European trading after the British announcement.
The mark had been rising against other currencies, pushing the dollar to record lows this week, mostly because German interest rates are several percentage points higher than those in other nations.
Higher rates, along with concern that a planned European monetary union will fall apart and send the mark even higher, have made investors sell other currencies and buy marks.
Traders were waiting for the Labor Department's unemployment figures for August. Mr. McCarthy said a positive report would likely move the dollar slightly higher.
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.4135 German marks, up from 1.3935 late Wednesday. Earlier in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.4130 marks, up from 1.3906 late Wednesday.
In New York, the dollar rose to 123.80 Japanese yen, up from 123.10 yen late Wednesday. Earlier in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.05 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.03 yen, up 0.40 yen from Wednesday's close, which was the lowest in nearly four years.
In New York, the British pound fell to $1.9835, from $2.0015 late Wednesday. In London, the British pound fell to $1.9825, from $2.0035 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.2635 Swiss francs, up from 1.2425; 4.8120 French francs, up from 4.7500; 1,083 Italian lire, up from 1,066.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $340.80 an ounce, up from $338.50 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
California Gets Back in the Market Quickly

 BODY:
With California's new $57.4 billion budget now signed, the state quickly entered the debt market yesterday to price $3.3 billion of one-month notes that will be used to pay bills and i.o.u.'s to its employees, businesses and local governments not paid since July 1.
The budget crisis lasted 63 days, the longest period ever that the state had been without a budget. 
 Initially, Lehman Brothers priced the California notes due on Oct. 8 at par to yield 3.50 percent, but because of good investor demand the firm was able to reprice the issue to offer a lower yield of 3.40 percent.
According to state officials, the one-month note sale will serve as a bridge loan until the state can sell about $4 billion in notes that will mature next June, the end of the 1993 fiscal year.
Yesterday's note sale was not rated by either Moody's Investors Service or the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The state will also be seeking a bank letter of credit to back part of the proposed $4 billion note sale, which will be managed by Lehman Brothers as well.
Traders said investors had been kind to California throughout its fiscal crisis, with the state's bonds actually increasing in value in the last few sessions.
For example, California's 6.25 percent general obligation bonds due in 2012 trade at $1,000.40 per $1,000 of bonds, for a yield of 6.213 percent, according to a Bloomberg Fair Value analysis.
While the state's recession has sliced into tax revenues and precipitated the budget crisis, investors still assume that California, with a diverse economy, will always make good on its debts.
Currently the state's long-term debt ratings are under close scrutiny by the rating agencies. They have been lowered twice in the last year. In July, Standard & Poor's downgraded the rating of the general obligation bonds two notches, to A+ from AA. Moody's cut California to Aa from Aa-1.

HEADLINE: A District That May Not Be Forever

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A few years ago, the scent of cheese blintzes and the buzz of shop talk and schmoozing filled Berger's Delicatessen and Restaurant long before the first rays of sunlight glinted down West 47th Street. No more. Now, only during normal Manhattan breakfast hours do the counter stools and stackable chairs begin to fill up at this narrow hangout in the diamond district.
This block, the prime distribution center for a nation that buys more diamonds than any other, has suffered its sharpest decline since the trade migrated from Canal Street to midtown after World War II. 
 Falling worldwide demand and the collapse of the country's largest jewelry store chains have left fewer buyers and dealers searching the diamond district's cramped booths and high-security offices for glittering emblems of love.
 
A Suffering Industry
 These sullen economic times have treated few industries as meanly as this secretive enclave, long populated by Orthodox Jews but now increasingly by Asians. Hundreds of cutters and dealers have closed their doors.
Sales of diamond jewelry in the United States, which rose sharply during the 1980's, have declined for the last two years, falling by $600 million, to $10.8 billion, in 1991. The industry foresees no improvement this year.
In the last two decades, the diamond business, buoyed by the newly rich, the hopelessly smitten and the Westernized Japanese, annexed West 46th and 48th Streets. Rents soared past $50 a square foot in the late 1980's, almost to the levels that space sold for a decade before.
Now the district has shriveled back to its original boundaries, West 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. Rents have plummeted, more steeply than elsewhere, to $25 or $30 a square foot, and landlords forbear when tenants fall a month or two behind.
At the diamond district branch of the Merchants Bank of New York, lines used to stretch out past the swinging glass doors on Thursday and Friday paydays. Late last week, the worn velvet ropes inside dangled listlessly; the lone half-dozen customers in line at lunchtime had to wait only a couple of minutes for their turns.
In his 46 years with the bank, Rudolf H. Hertz, the vice chairman, has seen as many downturns in the diamond business as anyone. "This," he said, hunching over his desk as if for protection, "is the most serious one since the 1930's. It's never been like this since the Depression."
Mr. Hertz is one of the people De Beers -- the South African mining giant that rules the diamond cartel -- calls regularly in calibrating its own purchases and sales. Demand is so weak, Mr. Hertz says, that De Beers's 25 percent cutback in purchases of rough diamonds is essential to support prices.
The diamond business is painfully cyclical, he says. In the early 1980's, the price for a perfect 1-carat diamond peaked at about $65,000, only to plunge to $10,000 a couple of years later. Said Michael D. Altman, the branch's chief loan officer and a 28-year veteran himself, "We're talking about a luxury item that in a recession is the first to be hurt and the last to recover."
The industry's loan demand is now so slack, Mr. Hertz said, that the bank's investment portfolio, mostly treasury securities, has grown to $320 million, while loans have fallen to $280 million. Bank credit is essential for dealers to buy rough stones from De Beers and stay afloat while waiting for retailers to make payment.
Sometimes that payment never comes. Mr. Hertz spread the National Jeweler bimonthly on his desk and began reading in a funereal tone: "Zale, Barry's, Birks, Rauch . . ." he said as he started down a list of the retail chains that had filed for bankruptcy protection, closing hundreds of stores. "Our customers don't know who to sell to. They are afraid. They don't want to lose money."
"Especially," Mr. Altman said, "when they owe money to a bank."
When a Zale, with 2,000 stores, closes about 500, that means fewer outlets, fewer salespeople, less advertising to move the stones. Meanwhile, even the healthy chains keep fewer diamonds in inventory, and take longer to pay.
Which is all playing out on 47th Street. "Previous downturns were very, absolutely, totally different," said Martin Rapaport, the rapid-fire publisher of the weekly Rapaport Diamond Report and a diamond broker. "No comparison."
Past slumps came from a weak economy, or speculative booms that pushed a segment of the market -- high-priced investment stones in the early 1980's -- to unreasonable levels.
Now, the decline of the jewelry store chains is compounding the effects of the stagnant economy and the luxury tax, Mr. Rapaport said in a telephone interview, all the while aiming commands at his assistants.
"You are seeing unparalleled change in how the industry is adapting itself to new economic realities," he said. "The mall stores were saying that access to the customer guaranteed sales and high markups. ('Don't even think about what they're offering,' he yelled to a helper. 'It's junk, but try to steal it.') If you opened a thousand stores, you sold a thousand rings. If you opened 2,000 stores, you sold 2,000 rings. The key factor was availability and convenience."
The debt-backed growth binge is now over. "There's less use of credit," Mr. Rapaport said. "The dealer is more conservative, more careful. You pay today, you get the goods."
The diamond district that most shoppers visit -- the sidewalk-level diamond district, with its mazes of stalls the size of diamond chips -- is only the equivalent of a walk-in brokerage office down the street from the New York Stock Exchange.
The real business in this Byzantine industry goes on upstairs, behind triple steel doors, down tight hallways surveyed by closed-circuit cameras. There, billions of dollars worth of diamonds are cut and traded and graded and traded and certified and often set in platinum or gold and finally sold to a retailer. Or shipped abroad, where the cycle can continue.
New York is the funnel through which most of the nation's diamonds pass. Some 98 percent of the nation's diamond cutting takes place here.
On the 10th floor of a nearly anonymous building is the district's nexis, the Diamond Dealers Club. It presents a monochromatic tableau. Bearded men in dark gray knee-length coats sit under gray fluorescent lights at rows of gray tables on gray carpets. They unfold pocket-size paper packets, then gather around to eye the jewels within. In these surroundings, the stones glisten all the more brightly.
Stones are scrutinized, deals made and prices set for the entire industry, all on the basis of handshakes and a Hebrew blessing repeated even by the growing numbers of Indians, Koreans and Thais.
To a visitor, a dealer is likely to repeat a version of the diamond industry's mantra. "As long as there is love . . ." Meyer Herz, a diamond dealer, began, rising from one of the tables as if about to break into song. He stopped in midsentence, then decided to put it more bluntly: "You still have to cut a girl's finger off to get the diamond off."
This year, love at the wholesale level will flicker perhaps 15 percent less brightly. In the club's offices one floor up, Eli Izhakoff, president of both the New York club and the World Federation of Diamond Bourses, says diamond imports will fall from their high of about $4 billion, in 1989, to about $3.5 billion. An aide later calls to say that Mr. Izhakoff meant to be more optimistic: maybe the decline will be slight.
 
Diamond Cutting Goes Abroad
 More and more diamond cutting has gone abroad, to low-wage locales like India, while only the most expensive stones are cut in the United States. Mr. Rapaport estimates that the diamond district had 2,000 cutters in the late 1970's, only 300 today. Last year, only $527 million, or 13 percent, of this country's diamond imports were rough stones.
As in other industries, the merchants and managers blame tight-fisted bankers for their troubles, even as the bankers blame the borrowers.
"Our industry is not overleveraged; it's not overinventoried," said Eli Haas, the secretary of the Diamond Dealers Club. "As I told my banker lately, you have to lend money somewhere, or you're out of business."
With few retail customers still able or willing to buy some bauble on a whim, the diamond district's merchants say they are sustained by the soon-to-be-married.
However they got engaged, the shoppers leaning against the counters, squinting at the rings, are in no passionate rush to buy. They comparison-shop, they hem, they haw, until salespeople feel like jumping out from behind their counters and shaking them.
Yamasheta Wilson recently spent three months shopping for a 1.7-carat engagement ring. "I shopped on Canal Street, on Fordham Road, and in the diamond district," he said. He bought in Atlanta.
Now that he's looking for wedding bands, the diamond district, in the person of Victoria Krugleck, desperately wants him back.
She showed him and his fiancee wide rings and narrow rings, rings with diamond chips and rings with engagement-size stones, rings contemporary and rings traditional.
"They don't have to match," Mr. Wilson assured Ms. Krugleck. "The only things that have to match are the kids."
The fiancee, "Patricia I-go-by-Wilson," lowered her voice when she said she's a lawyer, for fear that the scent of disposable income might tempt Ms. Krugleck to drive a harder bargain.
As the couple admired rings set with tiny diamonds, $250 each, Ms. Krugleck made her offer: "$450 total for both rings."
"I still have to think about it," Ms. Wilson said.
"$425," Ms. Krugleck said.
More hesitation. Ms. Krugleck rushed out from behind the counter, grabbed their hands and told them she was taking them to a nearby factory. "I'm not trying to be difficult," Ms. Wilson said, meekly following.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Predicts Bush Will Trim Social Security

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Sept. 3

 BODY:
Pushing his new class-oriented attack that President Bush secretly plans to "devastate America's middle class and its workers" to pay for tax cuts favoring the rich, Bill Clinton today accused the President of pursuing economic policies that would force him to gut Social Security.
The accusation was not based on any known plans by the Bush Administration but rather on an edifice of inductive and political reasoning: a series of mathematical assumptions worked out by the Democratic Presidential nominee's advisers, based in turn on Mr. Bush's promise to cut taxes while also achieving a savings in Federal spending.
 
Clinton Tours Dade County
 "Two weeks ago at the Republican convention Mr. Bush addressed an anxious people who looked for real answers to our economic problems," Mr. Clinton told leaders of an A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting in Washington. "But instead of a credible plan, he gave us more incredible promises. In the face of a $400 billion deficit this year he made a promise of another tax cut for the wealthy, then promised everybody else an across-the-board tax cut. He said 'We're going to pay for it with spending cuts and I'll tell you about it later.' " 
 After spending the morning deep into the politics of attack, Mr. Clinton spent the afternoon and evening on the politics of compassion, touring this city and other areas devastated by last week's hurricane in Dade County. Mr. Clinton was punctilious in his care to avoid criticizing President Bush for his response to Hurricane Andrew, while matching Mr. Bush in promising help for the people and places hurt by the storm.
"I did not come here for any political purpose," Mr. Clinton told reporters in Miami. "I do not believe there is a partisan element to this disaster." He barely hinted at criticism, saying at one point, "There may be things we could do, there may be ways we could be better prepared for the next one."
Asked if he would match Mr. Bush in the President's pledge that the Federal Government would finance 100 percent -- as opposed to 75 percent, the normal amount the Government provides -- of the recovery effort for the public infrastructure in South Florida, Mr. Clinton said, "Given the scope of the disaster and the total destruction of the infrastructure, I think it would be appropriate to fulfill the 100 percent requirement." The Federal Government's liability, at 100 percent financing, is estimated at $5 billion to $15 billion.
Likewise, Mr. Clinton strongly suggested that as President, he would repair and reopen the nearly destroyed Homestead Air Force Base, which would cost $500 million to $1 billion. Some military analysts and Congressional Democrats have criticized the President for promising to do this, arguing that the base serves no useful military purpose.
 
'He'll be Forced to Cut'
 In Washington earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Bush's universal tax cut, combined with other Administration proposals like a capital-gains tax cut and allowing parents tax credits for private school tuition, would cost the Federal Government $1 trillion over five years.
To offset this, Mr. Clinton said, Mr. Bush would eliminate farm price supports, tax Medicare benefits, freeze discretionary Federal spending and freeze cost-of-living increases in spending.
"But even if he gets rid of all of it, he'll still need another $324 billion to cut," Mr. Clinton said. He concluded with the triumph of a man who has, at last, pulled a rabbit from the hat: "And then, he'll have no choice. He'll be forced to cut -- even to gut -- Medicare and Social Security."
Judy Smith, a White House spokeswoman, called Mr. Clinton's accusations "absolutely false -- another example of double speak."
"The President said in his address that he's not going to cut Medicaid and Medicare," she said. "He said he was not going to touch Social Security."
In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Mr. Bush called only for ceilings on the growth of such benefits.
Mr. Clinton wove his Social Security charge into a speech before the cheering and hooting labor leaders in an elaborate bid to turn Mr. Bush's favorite question -- "Can Bill Clinton be trusted?" -- against him.
"Mr. Bush says the election should be about trust, and I believe that's right," Mr. Clinton said, beginning the assault. "But for George Bush to say the election should be about trust is like me saying it should be about short speeches."
Mr. Clinton's appearance before the leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was a conspicuous, if expected, success for a candidate who was never a favorite of labor groups. Recognizing obvious realities, the delegates offered Mr. Clinton an overwhelming and perfunctory endorsement, cheered Mr. Clinton's applause lines, and did not make impolite noises when he walked the careful line he has made for himself on a subject hardly popular in labor quarters, free trade.
"I want a policy that expands trade in terms fair to the United States," Mr. Clinton said, in explaining his neither-for-nor-against position on the North American Free Trade Act recently negotiated by the Bush Administration. "I hope we can sign the right kind of agreement with Mexico." But he was, he said, just not sure if Mr. Bush's agreement was the right one; keeping to his theme, he sought to turn the question of his ambivalence into a referendum on Mr. Bush's.
"The President has accused me of waffling because I wouldn't support an agreement I hadn't read," he said. "Well, he taught me four years ago I can't read his lips. I'm going to have to read the paper."
Mr. Clinton has been flirting with the issue of "trust" for weeks, but today's speech, in which he incorporated his accusation that Mr. Bush is the plutocrat's President into a larger theme that he is inherently untrustworthy, was his most forceful and coherent exposition of the idea.
The theme of trust seems designed to function both offensively and defensively. Offensively, it addresses the greatest vulnerability of an opponent unforgiven by some voters for breaking his explicit 1988 promise to not raise taxes. Defensively, it addresses, if only in implicit terms, Mr. Clinton's worst problem, the suspicion -- much encouraged by Republicans -- that he is too slick for his own, and the nation's, good.
It is notable that the unveiling of this theme followed immediately one of Mr. Clinton's worst days on the trust front in some time, with the broadcasting of news reports on Wednesday that focused fresh attention on the Democrat's extensive efforts to avoid the draft in the Vietnam War, and on the incomplete explanations he offered of his behavior concerning the draft earlier in the campaign.

HEADLINE: Fighter vs. Peacemaker As 2 Blacks Seek Seat

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3

 BODY:
On paper, Diane E. Watson and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke have a lot in common. Born two blocks and less than a year apart in South-Central Los Angeles, both graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles, where they were sorority sisters. Both are black, both are liberal Democrats and both are political fixtures in Los Angeles.
This year, the two longtime friends have become adversaries. In what is viewed as an epochal contest for the region's black voters, Ms. Watson, a 58-year-old state Senator, and Ms. Burke, 59, who was a member of Congress in the mid-1970's, are opponents in a November runoff election for a seat on the powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
 The winner will become the first elected black supervisor in county history. Ms. Burke, who gave up her seat in the House of Representatives in 1978 in an unsuccessful race for State Attorney General, sat on the board in 1979 and 1980 as the appointed successor to a supervisor who had died in office.
Despite the parallels in their resumes, the public personas of the two rivals could scarcely be more different. Ms. Burke, a partner at the staid law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, seems better suited to the corporate board room than the hustings. She stresses her ability to work with colleagues and to massage a recalcitrant bureaucracy into compliance. "I'm more interested in effectiveness than in being a firebrand," she said.
Ms. Watson, who relishes a fight, promises "nothing short of revolution in county government." During the Los Angeles riots last spring, she gave voice to the anger felt by many blacks over perceived injustices and accused Police Chief Daryl F. Gates of allowing civil unrest to explode in an attempt to make blacks look bad.
"It's the politics of accommodation versus the politics of confrontation," said Lorn S. Foster, a professor of politics at Pomona College.
Despite their closeness in age, the candidates personify a fairly abrupt generational shift under way in Los Angeles politics, as the cautious black leaders who gained prominence in the 1950's and 1960's give way to a more aggressive, less conciliatory and younger wave of elected officials. "Higher income and older blacks tend to be much more comfortable with Yvonne Burke," Mr. Foster said. "Diane Watson clearly speaks for those, particularly the young, who feel more estranged from politics and from the economic system."
Political scientists believe the riots strengthened the hand of those black politicians who insisted that blacks had been shortchanged by government, continued to suffer from discrimination and must demand to be heard.
"A lot of young black voters turned to leaders, like Diane Watson, who seem as angry as they are," said H. Eric Schockman, a political scientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
The changes in Los Angeles mirror what is happening around the country, said David A. Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, a research center devoted to racial issues. "A lot of younger black political activists and leaders look at older black leaders as just sort of blending into the political wallpaper, being part of the power structure, being out of touch," Mr. Bositis said.
He cited the victories this year of Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther leader who unseated a veteran black lawmaker, Representative Charles A. Hayes, Democrat of Illinois, and "a whole crop of new members" in the state legislatures of the South.
 
The Bradley Generation
 The transformation is most pronounced in the Los Angeles area, analysts say, in part because blacks, who account for 14 percent of the population in the city and 11 percent in Los Angeles County, have always been a smaller minority here than in New York and many other major cities. In the 1950's and early 1960's, those demographics fostered a generation of black politicians, including Mayor Thomas Bradley, who tended to keep a low profile and work behind the scenes.
"Tom Bradley and his generation always felt they couldn't afford to alienate white voters," Mr. Schockman said. "They always had to get along with the white power structure, and now, that accommodation looks suspect to a lot of younger blacks. I think what we're seeing with this group of Young Turks is a reaction against that."
For many years, the ambitions of young and middle-aged black politicians in Los Angeles were stifled by the remarkable longevity of their elders. But Representative Augustus F. Hawkins retired in 1991 at the age of 83; Representative Mervyn M. Dymally, 66, who has spent three decades in elective office, decided not to run for re-election this year, and several local officials have either stepped aside or died.
The most visible symbol of the older generation, Mr. Bradley, 74, is the subject of speculation that he may retire after 20 years as Mayor when his term expires next year.
Ms. Watson and Ms. Burke are running for the seat being vacated by Supervisor Kenneth L. Hahn, 72, a white man who has represented most of the county's predominantly black areas since 1952.
Beginning with an angry fist-waving address on the night the riots began, Ms. Watson turned up repeatedly on television, saying the rage felt by rioters was justified.
Ms. Burke insists that she was just as active, just as vocal, but was ignored by reporters. "The press was looking for somebody who was incendiary, not someone who said we've got to solve problems and get along," she said.
The power wielded by the Board of Supervisors will catapult whoever wins the race to the top ranks of black elected officials in California. The five-member board functions as both the legislative and executive branches of an $11 billion-a-year government with nine million constituents and responsibility for services ranging from health care for the poor to law enforcement, sanitation and mass transit.
Both Ms. Burke and Ms. Watson promise to devote more of the county's resources to health care, creation of inner-city jobs and aid to the homeless. Each pledges to wrest power from entrenched bureaucrats. Since being elected last year, Gloria Molina, the first Hispanic supervisor in more than a century, has made confrontation a way of life. Ms. Molina, whose election ended conservative domination of the board, has embarrassed the board into re-examining many of its practices. The election of Ms. Watson would produce more of the same, analysts say. But there is no consensus as to whether her performance would differ much in substance from Ms. Burke's, in light of the similarity in their positions and current fiscal constraints.

HEADLINE: RANKS OF U.S. POOR REACH 35.7 MILLION, THE MOST SINCE '64

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The number of Americans living in poverty soared last year by 2.1 million, to a total of 35.7 million, and the poverty rate rose for the second consecutive year, to 14.2 percent, the Government reported today.
The new rate is the highest since the peak caused by the recession of the early 1980's. The actual number of poor people is the highest since 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson declared his war on poverty. 
 In a disclosure that may be even more politically damaging to President Bush and his re-election campaign, the Census Bureau also said the purchasing power of the typical American household shrank last year by nearly $1,100. The report provides statistical evidence of the hardship experienced by millions of potential voters.
 
Household Income Dips
 The Census Bureau, in its annual report on income and poverty, said the decline in the purchasing power of Americans was also the second straight as median household income, after adjusting for inflation, fell by $1,077, to $30,126. The number of households above the median is the same as the number below it.
A family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income of less than $13,924 in 1991. The poverty level is updated each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. While the whole concept of poverty reflects political and social judgments about the amount of money needed for subsistence, the process of calculating each year's poverty levels is a statistical, nonpolitical operation.
The poverty rate tends to move in tandem with the unemployment rate and with the number of people receiving food stamps. Since those indicators have risen sharply in 1992, economists say it is likely that poverty has continued to spread this year.
 
Harsh Words From Clinton
 Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic candidate for President, cited the new poverty figures in a speech to leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., meeting here today. "This Administration has compiled the worst economic record in 50 years, since Herbert Hoover was President," Mr. Clinton said, "and at Houston we saw what their promise for the next four years is: more of the same."
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the increase in poverty was understandable. "Certainly, I think we have to expect that the recession would have a significant and serious impact on income and on poverty levels," Mr. Fitzwater said. "We have tried to target a number of programs in the last couple of years particularly to those problems, knowing that the recession would have a deleterious effect."
Economists say the recession began in July 1990. Since mid-1991, the economy has shown some signs of growth, but not enough for the official arbiters to declare the recession ended.
In the last two years, the Census Bureau said, the number of poor people increased by 4.2 million, while the proportion of people living in poverty climbed steadily, to 14.2 percent in 1991, from 13.5 percent in 1990 and 12.8 percent in 1989. The data do not include homeless people.
Both the number of poor people and the poverty rate declined from 1983 to 1989.
 
The Toll on Families
 After adjustment for inflation, median household income has declined 5.1 percent since 1989. Household purchasing power is lower now than in 1979, the Census Bureau said.
The report suggests there is ample reason for the concern about the welfare of American families being expressed by politicians of both parties. The number of poor families increased to 7.7 million in 1991, from 7.1 million in 1990, it said. The proportion of families living below the official poverty level rose to 11.5 percent last year, from 10.7 percent in 1990.
Many Republicans have criticized the official statistics on the ground that they do not reflect the value of food stamps, Medicaid, housing subsidies and other noncash benefits. But when the Census Bureau used alternative definitions of income that include the value of such aid, it still found that poverty rose sharply from 1989 to 1991. The data do not show the effects of capital gains, 92 percent of which go to the most affluent fifth of all households.
The Census Bureau report made these points:
*The poverty rate for white people rose to 11.3 percent last year, from 10.7 percent in 1990. The rate rose even for white married couples, considered the most economically secure of all families. For black people, the poverty rate rose to 32.7 percent last year, from 31.9 percent in 1990. For Hispanic people, it rose to 28.7 percent, from 28.1 percent. (Hispanic people may be of any race.) For Asian Americans, the poverty rate rose to 13.8 percent last year, from 12.2 percent in 1990.
*In the last two years, household purchasing power declined 5.5 percent for whites, 5.3 percent for blacks, 8.1 percent for Asian Americans and 5.8 percent for Hispanic people.
*The South still has the highest poverty rate (16 percent), but it is the only region where there was not a significant increase in poverty in 1991. The poverty rate rose last year in seven of the 10 most populous states, including such likely battlegrounds of the Presidential election as California, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Texas.
*In the New York metropolitan area, the poverty rate rose to 14.8 percent in 1991, from 14.3 percent in 1990 and 12.1 percent in 1989. In the Los Angeles area, it went up to 16.6 percent from 15 percent in 1990 and 13.8 percent in 1989.
*While the gap between rich and poor did not widen in 1991, there is a clear long-term trend toward increasing inequality of income. The most affluent fifth of all households got 46.5 percent of all household income in 1991, up from 43.5 percent in 1971 and 44.4 percent in 1981. By contrast, the poorest fifth got 3.8 percent of all income last year, down from 4.1 percent in 1971 and 1981.
The Census Bureau also reported that 35.4 million Americans had no health insurance in 1991, an increase from 34.7 million in 1990. About 29 percent of all poor people said they had no medical insurance of any kind at any time in 1991. By contrast, 11.7 percent of people above the poverty level and 14.1 percent of all Americans said they were uninsured.
One of the most significant measures of economic well-being, real per capita income, declined in 1991 for the second consecutive year, to $14,617, after increasing for seven consecutive years, from 1983 to 1989. This figure measures the average income of all men, women and children in the United States, adjusted for inflation.
Democrats seized the data to support their criticism of President Bush's economic policies. Representative Thomas J. Downey of Long Island, acting chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee responsible for many welfare programs, said, "The data underscore the worsening plight of American children."
The poverty rate for children under 18 reached 21.8 percent last year, up from 20.6 percent in 1990 and 19.6 percent in 1989. Poverty is more common among children than among other age groups like the elderly, who had a poverty rate of 12.4 percent last year.
 
Looking Beyond Recession
 Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said the high rate of poverty could not be completely explained as a result of the recession. "Many people were facing economic distress even before the recession began," said Mr. Sarbanes. "The economic expansion of the 1980's left the poverty rate higher than it had been at the end of the expansion of the 1970's."
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research institute, said "a further substantial jump in poverty is virtually certain in 1992" because unemployment is well above 1991 levels.
But Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, said the official data "systematically exaggerate the extent of income inequity and poverty by ignoring almost 75 percent of all government assistance to the poor." He said the Census Bureau had done nothing to adjust its poverty statistics for a huge increase in the number of one-parent families over the last two decades.
The increase in the number of poor families headed by women accounted for nearly two-thirds of the net increase in the number of poor families last year, the Census Bureau said.
If noncash benefits like food stamps and Medicaid were counted as income, the poverty rate would have been 11.4 percent last year, rather than the reported 14.2 percent, the bureau said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Al Gore;
Gore Lashes Out at Bush On His Iran-Contra Role

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Sept. 3

 BODY:
In his sharpest and most personal attack on President Bush since being selected as the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Al Gore today questioned the President's explanation of his role in the Iran-contra affair, stopping just short of calling him a liar.
In remarks inserted into his basic campaign speech, Mr. Gore repeatedly referred to the President's "credibility canyon" in his handling of the economy and foreign affairs. More significantly, Mr. Gore, for the first time, used the phrase to belittle Mr. Bush's oft-repeated explanation about his part in the Iran-contra affair. 
 Mr. Bush has long asserted that when he was Vice President, he was unaware of the details of efforts undertaken under President Ronald Reagan to secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon by selling arms to Iran and the use of the profits from those sales to finance anti-Communist guerrillas in Nicaragua.
To underscore the personal nature of Mr. Gore's broadside against the President, the Democrat failed to utter his customary line in which he says he does not believe Mr. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle are "bad people" but are merely following erroneous policies.
 
Doubts by 2 Reagan Aides
 Mr. Gore suggested that the central piece of evidence to question the President's credibility was a recent report that two top Reagan aides who opposed the arms-for-hostages deal did not believe Mr. Bush's statements that he had been kept in the dark about the policy.
"George Bush is still saying he didn't know anything about one of the most controversial policies of the Reagan Administration," Senator Gore said in a speech to the 26th constitutional convention of the United Steelworkers of America here. "Now we have some reasons to wonder about the story George Bush has told."
In addition, the Tennessee Senator criticized Mr. Bush for the decision by Attorney General William P. Barr not to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate charges that Administration officials hampered efforts to prosecute people who helped the Iraqi Government illegally use American agricultural credits to purchase arms.
"The similarities between the two crises are overwhelming," Mr. Gore said after his speech, referring to the Iran-contra affair and the illegal methods that were used to allow Iraq to purchase weapons. "If he refuses to answers questions about the first and refuses to comply with the law and establish a special prosecutor in the second, then it raises extremely serious questions of credibility."
Mr. Gore is raising questions about Mr. Bush's veracity, and, in effect, his character, at a time when new questions have been raised about the explanations by Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, of how he was able to avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War. Mr. Gore told reporters that his remarks were not an attempt to deflect the character issue away from Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Plan to Allow Cuts n Investment Taxes Is Dropped by Bush

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The White House today abandoned a proposal, popular among conservative Republicans, to reduce the taxes on profits from investments without consulting Congress. Government lawyers said the plan was unconstitutional.
President Bush had been considering the proposal, which was favored by his new chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, as part of his search for ways to fill out his economic-policy portfolio for the November election. 
 Under the plan, Mr. Bush would have used his executive powers to reduce the taxes on capital gains by whatever amount that inflation has reduced the gain. Republican strategists hoped such a move would spur the economy and satisfy conservative Republican lawmakers, business executives and columnists who have been increasing pressure on Mr. Bush to take such action.
This morning, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the proposal was "on the front burner."
But Administration officials said the Justice Department told the White House two days ago that the idea was unconstitutional, an opinion that supported earlier ones by Mr. Bush's chief counsel, C. Boyden Gray, and Treasury Department attorneys.
Mr. Fitzwater later issued a written statement saying that Mr. Bush was no longer pursuing the idea and would seek instead to have the change enacted in legislation.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Roberta Smith

 BODY:
Behind the summer lull, it's been a tense, tumultuous few months for contemporary-art galleries in New York City. As if enduring its own version of the London blitz, the art world seems to be holding its breath, waiting to see which galleries will still be operating when the dust settles and Labor Day is past.
Although some dealers say they think the art market is stabilizing and perhaps beginning a slow recovery, others are less optimistic. But all of the nearly dozen people interviewed tend to agree that galleries are having widespread difficulties as they struggle to bring 1980's overhead -- especially rents -- into line with the contracted art market of the 90's. 
 Recent months have brought more gallery closings, and certainly more rumors of closings, than any other summer in memory. At least six galleries have closed, most of them relative newcomers in SoHo that concentrated on showing younger or less established artists.
In addition, more galleries than usual have moved over the summer, often lured by lower rents, smaller spaces or more central locations. In a seeming contradiction, some galleries have moved to buildings that other galleries had left: in the soft real-estate market, the new tenants negotiated lower rents. Other galleries have cut back on the amount of space they rent, reduced staff or scheduled fewer but longer-running exhibitions for the new season.
Consolidation and lease renegotiation seem to abound on all fronts. For dealers whose leases were signed during the art- and real-estate booms of the 1980's, negotiating a rent adjustment has become a primary goal. At least one reputable operation, the Jack Tilton Gallery, has broken its lease on West 57th Street to move out and look for more favorable terms. Many more have been embroiled in lease renegotiations for up to a year.
But there are some bright spots. Several galleries report successful rent reductions. The Marlborough Gallery has expanded and renovated its gallery at 40 West 57th Street and is opening a branch in Madrid, an undertaking on which its publicity agent says the gallery "has spent a staggering $4 million, without help from the bank." And the Matthew Marks Gallery, a young gallery that shows a successful mix of blue-chip and new art, has expanded its space at 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, taking over the second floor, previously occupied by Wittenborn Art Books, which closed. Michel Kohn, a French contemporary-art dealer who has worked privately on the West Coast for several years, is also opening a gallery in that building.
 
Showdown at Fuller
 The Fuller Building, at 41 East 57th Street, for several decades one of Manhattan's most prestigious gallery addresses, is the site of the largest and most intense renegotiation effort. The building, an Art Deco landmark on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue, is home to more than 20 galleries. More than a dozen have banded together and hired a lawyer to try to renegotiate rents that they describe as exorbitant. The group is also looking at other buildings on 57th Street that might be more accommodating.
Interviews with several gallery tenants showed widespread unhappiness with both rents and services in the building, which has been managed by Cushman & Wakefield since 1990. The dealers assert that the building has changed hands so many times in the last decade that they no longer know who owns it. They also say the repeated sales have increased real estate taxes, which are passed on to the tenants on top of rent increases specified in the leases.
"This all started a year ago, when we were charged a $10,000 real estate tax increment," said Diana Burroughs, who with her husband, Jason McCoy, owns the Jason McCoy Gallery, which moved to the building from East 71st Street three years ago. "I know someone in the building who was charged $30,000."
 
Magic vs. Money
 Ms. Burroughs, a member of the tenant group's executive committee, said most galleries in the building were paying "from $42 or $48 a square foot to as high as $60, and the going rate on the street for new tenants is closer to $25 or $30." She went on: "We've lowered our prices on our art; our suppliers have lowered theirs. The Fuller Building is the Fuller Building because we're there. It's got its magic because it's got a bunch of great galleries in it. We may have to do something like the Designers and Decorators building on Third Avenue: find a building and open up a gallery center."
James Goodman, who has had a gallery in the Fuller Building since 1986, said: "If people don't get relief, they are going to move out when their leases are up. We're trying very hard to do this in a professional way, but we're making very little progress."
Andre Emmerich, who has had a gallery in the building for nearly 30 years, called the building and its management "short-sighted in not being more accommodating with art-gallery tenants, many of whom face real economic pressures." He continued: "The building's attitude was very much more cooperative under previous owners. The present landlord, whoever he is, seems to take his role model out of Dickens."
Although none of these dealers would verify it, people outside the group have said that the Crown Building at 730 Fifth Avenue, on the southwest corner of 57th Street, is among the buildings to which the dealers are considering moving. When asked about the Crown Building, Mr. Emmerich would say only: "It certainly is an interesting building with a fine location and a good management, all of which is very inviting. The wonderful thing is there's competition in this world."
Reached by telephone, Christopher Kraus, a leasing agent at Cushman & Wakefield, and Frank Freda, who oversees the Fuller Building's management for the firm, responded that the building had had the same owner for six years and that, as far as they knew, there had been only one other owner in the 1980's.
Mr. Freda also said: "The truth is that the building is providing the same services it has provided for years, and we are in the process of modernizing all our elevators and we've added a security guard. The landlord continues to pursue relief through tax certiorari proceedings every year. It's not the landlord's fault as to the amount of taxes that the city chooses to levy on commercial real estate. We are victims as much as the tenants.
"We met with the group's legal representative and requested financial information with respect to the galleries, which they have failed to supply. They have not requested any further meetings."
Mr. Freda also added that "$25 to $30 a square foot is well below what's being asked for a first-class building like the Fuller Building."
Mr. Goodman responded: "As to services, the security in the building has not been good and they haven't addressed that. The same owner can't have owned it for six years: we got tax increases three years ago because the building was sold. As for financial information, they want an accountant's record of just how painful this is. To divulge that kind of information makes everyone feel very vulnerable."
 
Moving In, and Out
 Despite the Fuller Building's troubles, the Barbara Mathes Gallery recently moved in, taking the third-floor corner space previously occupied by Kent Fine Art. And Joan Washburn, another gallery, has moved out. Mrs. Mathes said that her gallery had been at 851 Madison Avenue for 10 years and that her landlord was "not too accommodating" when her lease came up for renewal. She acknowledged that her rent at the Fuller Building was "'no bargain" but said that "it's less than I was paying uptown, and it's lower than people who signed leases here five years ago, naturally."
She continued: "This is the time for a buyer to buy pictures and the time for a tenant to write a lease. If the art market is going to be tighter and smaller, then it's more important than ever to be centrally located."
Joan Washburn, whose 21-year-old gallery specializing in modern and contemporary American art had been in the Fuller Building since 1986, has moved to a smaller, less expensive space on the eighth floor of 20 West 57th Street. Mrs. Washburn declined to discuss her sudden move other than to describe herself as "a good tenant." She also would not elaborate on the name Lindsay & Thomas, which appears on her new gallery stationery, along with the name Washburn, other than to say that she has found financial backers but is still in complete control of the program.
"This is not a good time for anybody," she said. "There's nothing in the news that indicates that this is going to be an easy year. People have to feel good about themselves to buy art."
Until very recently, Mrs. Washburn's new space was occupied by the Blum Helman Gallery, whose main gallery is still on the building's second floor. Rumors of Blum Helman's demise were rampant this summer, but Irving Blum, who owns the gallery with Joseph Helman, said they were greatly exaggerated. "We have given up the eighth floor," Mr. Blum said by telephone. "But we're simply doing what every other gallery in New York is doing, which is to cut back as radically as we can because things are so shaky. I don't find any growth yet, but I do see some signs of stabilization. However, I think something dramatic will have to happen -- a new style from the artists, a new generation of collectors -- before things can turn around in a big way."
 
On West 57th Street
 A similar pattern of musical galleries can be found at 24 West 57th Street, another important gallery building. One of the oldest contemporary gallery spaces closed when the rent could not be renegotiated, and another gallery moved into the building under extremely favorable circumstances.
From 1961 to 1983, the first one, the third-floor front space with high ceilings, round-cornered rooms and big French windows, was the Betty Parsons Gallery, the dealer of many Abstract Expressionists; in 1983, it became the gallery of Jack Tilton, who was Mrs. Parsons's director from 1976 until her death in 1982. Mr. Tilton moved out suddenly last month after trying to persuade his landlord, the Ronesto Corporation, to reduce his rent from $60 a square foot to $30 for the three years remaining on his 12-year lease. Mr. Tilton said he stopped paying rent eight months ago as a form of leverage on the advice of his lawyer, after he heard that new tenants moving into the building were paying $25 a square foot with a year's free rent and construction costs paid by the building.
While Mr. Tilton said other tenants in the building were able to renegotiate leases at about $30 a square foot, he said the landlord's offer to him never went below $35, probably because he withheld rent.
Speaking for Ronesto, Jay D. Lisnow, executive vice president of Gafisa (USA) Inc., which is Ronesto's managing director in this country, said by telephone yesterday: "Certainly those tenants who thought that withholding rent would be a means of leverage were tenants that we stopped negotiating with."
Does Mr. Tilton regret trying such an aggressive tactic? "Not really," he said. "It took a big part out of me to leave that space. I loved it, but leaving has also opened a whole new life for me and the gallery. And what I can get elsewhere on 57th Street or in SoHo is much cheaper than what they were offering."
Mr. Tilton has moved to an office in the Cable Building, at 611 Broadway, at Houston Street, where he is dealing privately. He is looking at spaces and says he plans to reopen in late fall.
Mr. Tilton and his landlord are in court, but negotiations continue. Mr. Tilton said he had offered to pay a portion of his back rent to Ronesto, which seized some office equipment after he informed it of his intention to move out.
 
A New Tenant
 The new tenant in the building is the Mary Ryan Gallery, which concentrates on contemporary prints and drawings. Last month, after 10 years on the Upper West Side, Mrs. Ryan opened her gallery on the building's second floor with a retrospective of Lucian Freud's prints (review on page C17). She denied that her new landlord had paid any of her considerable construction costs. Her rent, she said, is about $25 a square foot, but that figure does not include real estate taxes and yearly increases. She said she had received a year's free rent. "Business is tough," she said, "but this is a great time to expand. I'll be paying about the same for four times as much space, and I'm much more centrally located."
Commenting on both Mr. Tilton's and Ms. Ryan's statements, Cid Keller, chief executive of the Promenade Real Estate Corporation, which manages the building for Ronesto, said: "It's very difficult to make comparisons when you have completely different spaces. Mary Ryan has no windows and is on the second floor. Another gallery, Sherry French, has the front space on the second floor and a lease signed in April 1991, and they pay much more than $25 a square foot. And there's another important issue: when the market goes up, can I go back to the tenant and say 'Your space is worth more now, so you have to pay more rent'?"
 
SoHo: A Toll on Youth
 The gallery situation in SoHo, traditionally the haven of younger artists and dealers, seems especially volatile this summer. Several galleries have closed, but some have moved and there are even a couple of new arrivals.
For example, Hirschl & Adler Modern, which, like Barbara Mathes, was a tenant at 851 Madison Avenue, has moved downtown to 420 West Broadway, the area's oldest gallery building, which is near Spring Street. The gallery took over the fourth floor, recently vacated by the 49th Parallel, an alternative gallery supported largely by the Canadian Government. Donald McKinney, Hirschl & Adler Modern's director, says he has doubled his space for "basically the same rent I paid uptown."
Paul Kasmin, who has had a small gallery at 580 Broadway, near Prince Street, for three years, is moving to a larger ground-floor space at 74 Grand Street. He said he will be paying "one-third more rent for twice the gallery space, plus a basement and my own entrance," a situation that he describes as "definitely more interesting."
The Daniel Newburg Gallery, next door to Mr. Kasmin at 580 Broadway, has closed and may reopen near him on Grand Street, Mr. Kasmin and others in the art world said. Mr. Newburg did not return telephone calls, but one of the owners of 580 Broadway, Richard Feldman, confirmed that Mr. Newburg had moved out and that his former gallery has been rented to Achim Kubinski, a contemporary-art gallery from Stuttgart, Germany.
The Christine Burgin Gallery, at 130 Prince Street, one of SoHo's most expensive buildings, has closed. Ms. Burgin said she was thwarted less by high rents than by shipping costs, since she shows mainly European artists. "For the last two years, I've thought only about business and not about art," she said. "I'm going to try to organize shows for the artists I work with, without having a formal gallery, by using different spaces around the city."
The Diane Brown Gallery, which only last year moved to 23 Watts Street, has also closed. Ms. Brown said she had "a dream landlord" but that "overhead and revenues were not consistent."
"I intend to stay involved and am considering several options," she said.
 
A Slogan Is Coined
 Other closings include the Jamison-Thomas Gallery at 588 Broadway and the Berland-Hall Gallery at 579 Broadway, both near Prince Street. Reached for comment, one of Berland-Hall's owners, Sue Berland, said: "People are really not supporting younger artists right now. Yet it still costs just as much to show them as more mature artists."
The Bess Cutler Gallery, previously on Mercer Street, has relocated to a less expensive space on the third floor of 379 West Broadway, near Broome Street.
And the Pat Hearn Gallery has successfully renegotiated its lease on the three-story building at 39 Wooster Street, which it has occupied since 1988, relinquishing the top two floors. "It would have been difficult to proceed otherwise in that space," Ms. Hearn said. "I think as long as one can figure out how to cut back, you can keep going. It's absolutely possible."
She added that one of her friends, another dealer, had coined what may be the gallery slogan of the season: "Stay Alive 'Til '95."

HEADLINE: Review/Film: Bob Roberts;
A Singing Candidate, A Happy Trail of Hait

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
"BOB ROBERTS," written and directed by Tim Robbins, who also plays the title role, is a very funny, sometimes prescient satire of American politics, and of the comparatively small, voting portion of the electorate that makes a Bob Roberts phenomenon possible. Recent events haven't completely overtaken the movie, but they do indicate just how wild a satire must be these days to remain on the cutting edge of the outrageous.
In the person of Mr. Robbins, whose performance is a career-defining achievement, Bob Roberts is a smoothly ingratiating, guitar-playing businessman, a self-made millionaire who wants to be the next United States Senator from Pennsylvania. He's good-looking, but in the way of a familiar television personality, not of a major movie star. His charisma doesn't intimidate. 
 He's young, healthy and sincere. More important, he appropriates gestures and language associated with 1960's protest movements and uses them in the cause of his own brand of 1990's right-wing rabble-rousing. He calls himself a "rebel conservative." He's the kind of guy who answers a young fan's letter by cautioning her not to do crack, adding, "It's a ghetto drug."
When Bob strums his guitar and sings such upbeat numbers as "My Land," "Times Are Changin' Back" and "Wall Street Rap," he is selling family values and patriotism and assuring his supporters that, in effect, it's their duty to "take, make and win by any means," even if they can't. Among other things, Bob understands the appeal of an ultra-conservative political and economic policy even to those who have nothing: anticipating the day when they do have it all, they want to make sure they will be able to keep it.
"Bob Roberts" takes the form of a documentary being made about the candidate's campaign from its opening days until its eventful close, through the election itself and its aftermath. Driving through the state in his caravan called the Pride, he speaks and sings at fund-raisers and rallies and attends a beauty contest where the young woman with a ribbon identifying her as Miss Three Mile Island becomes one of the film's sight gags. He's fawned on by some of the news media, insulted by others, called a savior by his supporters and a crypto-fascist by the disenchanted.
Interviewed from time to time in the course of Bob's campaign, and seen on one occasion attempting to debate the issues with him, is the liberal incumbent whose seat Bob covets. Senator Brickley Paiste is a patrician fellow whose breeding, wit and political intelligence are tested by Bob's money, razzle-dazzle public shows, dirty tricks and supermarket charm.
As played by Gore Vidal, the novelist, essayist, political commentator and sometime aspirant to political office, Brickley Paiste is the film's conscience and most articulate voice. Mr. Vidal performs on-screen much as he does in print. His manner is one of detached amusement combined with feigned shock that the world has somehow come to this ghastly pass. Without him "Bob Roberts" would be no more than an exceptionally clever, feature-length revue sketch.
The film's mock-documentary form, which echoes two classic comedies, Woody Allen's "Take the Money and Run" and Rob Reiner's "This Is Spinal Tap," can't easily accommodate the sort of melodrama and conspiracies with which Mr. Robbins begins to load the movie toward the end. It's not only because the melodrama and the conspiracies are a little far-fetched. It's also because no documentary film maker who was privy to such explosive information could have kept it under wraps for very long. If he had, he certainly wouldn't have finished his movie quite as gently as Terry Manchester (Brian Murray), the director of the film-within, finishes this one.
It can be argued that the documentary form is not to be taken too seriously, that it's only a narrative device, but Mr. Robbins can't decently enjoy all the advantages of the form without acknowledging the limitations.
A documentary is the record of the way people and events look and sound. It is a collection of surfaces that can reveal interior truths. Almost everything one needs to know about this candidate can be found in the mundane details Terry Manchester records for his film. Bob is so charming and plausible that his supporters probably couldn't care less that he did not work his way through college, as he says, but, as his mother says, forged her name to a check to pay his tuition.
"Bob Roberts" works best when it is most documentary-like. Jean Lepine's use of the hand-held camera is wizardly, creating a sense of mounting hysteria as it captures the candidate and his handlers at public functions and in those small private moments that no film maker can ever anticipate.
The movie is terrific when it attends to reportorial detail, to the behavior of people, to the found incident, to campaign decisions relating to print and television commercials, and especially to Bob's repertory of campaign songs. These are alternately foot-stomping battle cries for fat-cats or cautionary, lunatic-fringe dirges, all written, in fact, by Mr. Robbins and his older brother David.
Mr. Robbins has learned a lot from Robert Altman, who directed him in "The Player" and whose "Nashville" and "Tanner '88" would seem to have influenced both the spirit and the style of "Bob Roberts." The new film's soundtrack is layered with as much information as the images.
With one exception, the movie is beautifully cast, from the featured roles (Giancarlo Esposito, Ray Wise) to the bits in which Susan Sarandon, James Spader, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward and John Cusack, among others, appear as some of the television anchors and hosts who deal with the Bob Roberts phenomenon.
The exception is Alan Rickman as Lukas Hart 3d, the chief architect of Bob's campaign. Mr. Rickman is not a subtle actor. The minute he comes on the screen, he is so arrogant, shifty and Mephistophelean that it seems likely someone would have checked out his connections before it actually happens.
With "Bob Roberts," Mr. Robbins emerges as a formidable triple-threat man. There's a big imagination at work here. The movie sometimes overstates its case, but the music-making, success-oriented Bob represents an authentic American political tradition. Our politics has always been entertainment. Think of the crowds that came out for the Lincoln-Douglas debates. It's just that the entertainment has declined a bit in quality and, with television, become pervasive in ways to numb the thought processes.
"Bob Roberts," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has vulgar language and some violence.

The Psychologically Revealing Etchings of Lucian Freud

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
The British artist Lucian Freud has received belated but fascinated attention in America in the past five years, thanks to successive traveling shows of his paintings and works on paper. Now the Mary Ryan Gallery is offering an absorbing survey of the artist's complete etchings, a body of work never shown before in the United States, and one that helps round out the picture of a half-centurylong career.
Mr. Freud is a figurative painter who works in the vein of highly stylized realism that became a British specialty after World War II. Most of his subjects are portraits and studio nudes, male and female, rendered with both an Expressionist's feel for his materials and an attention to intimate naturalistic details. In Mr. Freud's hands the figure is neither idealized nor truly objectified; it looks like a product of well-schooled academic painting turned slightly freakish, as if filtered through the distorting lens of an intense disquietude. 
 Much that is true of the artist's paintings is also true of his etchings, though as a group the prints give a greater overall sense of stylistic cohesiveness. This is due to a quirk of chronology. Although the artist made his first few etchings in Paris in the late 1940's, he quickly abandoned the medium and didn't pick it up again until 1982. As a result, fully three dozen of the 40 prints shown here were executed in the past decade, and reflect his mature style.
It's just as well they do, since the earliest works are undistinguished. Two tiny etchings done in Paris in 1946 are sweet but slight, and a 1948 portrait of Mr. Freud's first wife looking out half-hidden from behind a large fig leaf has the self-conscious whimsy of children's book illustration. Another likeness of the same woman from the same year is, however, more interesting. Titled "Ill in Paris," it shows her in bed, staring up from her pillow with a look of unfocused apprehension. In the foreground is a single upright rose, its thorned stem bisecting the picture, its sharp leaves and layered blossom carrying unmistakable sexual connotations.
Certain characteristics of Mr. Freud's later etchings are already in place at this point: a formal facility that he later elaborated; a tendency to view his often reclining models from odd angles, and a gift, sometimes used, sometimes not, for psychological acuity. The last quality is best demonstrated in two very different portrait etchings from 1982. In one, titled "Lord Goodman in His Yellow Pajamas," the sitter, with his massive neck and flat features viewed from slightly below eye level, looks like an alert and agreeably disheveled old animal; in the other, the artist's mother, her frowning visage a thick knot of dark, snaking gestural lines, radiates a fierce existential disapproval.
Not all of the portraits are so successful. Some display a heavy-lidded, all-purpose angst, as ineffectual in its way as the unvarying expressions of mild good humor on the faces of Alex Katz's figures. And the portraits printed in developmental stages usually start out well but end up looking overworked. In the first state of a likeness of Sir Lawrence Gowing, the scholar's bespectacled face is economically drawn against a white ground; in the second state the same face has, inexplicably, been covered with a dark, netlike fabric, under which the features lie all but obscured.
Among the most striking images in the show are the nudes. Some emerge straight from a classical studio tradition. A woman sits placidly staring down at her feet; a man lies on his stomach as if sleeping, his hand held protectively under his chest. Yet most often the figure is oddly placed within the picture space. In "Girl Sitting" (1987), for example, the figure is pushed to the top of the composition, so that the artist is looking down at her from a wide expanse of empty foreground. The play of domination and submission Mr. Freud sets up here and elsewhere is surely -- and successfully -- calculated to give otherwise ordinary figure studies a provocative psychic tension.
That tension is also present in the large male nudes, though for somewhat different reasons. Even reclining on a bed the men fill and dominate their space and look straight at the viewer, blank-faced but unintimidated. They are the only figures in the show given the realistic detail and the technical finish of Mr. Freud's paintings; in fact, one etching of a male nude has the face fully worked up in pastel. In "Man Posing," from 1985, the subject lies flat on a couch, his legs spread so that his genitals are at the picture's center. The room around him is as minutely observed as the skin and hair of the body itself. All of Mr. Freud's virtuosic command of the etched line comes into play here, from the varieties of cross hatching used for floor, walls and couch to the carefully rendered books that the man uses as a footrest, as if symbolically asserting the sensual rather than intellectual import of the picture.
It's a strong, claustrophobic image. To find its like, one has to go back to Egon Schiele in turn-of-the-century Vienna (interestingly, a time and place associated with Mr. Freud's grandfather Sigmund Freud). And like much of the artist's work, it is remarkable less for sheer originality than for the way it enlivens an existing pictorial genre often thought to be exhausted. It is a tribute to the power of these etchings that were they the only work of Mr. Freud's to survive, they would confirm him to be an artist of unusual interest. That is certainly the impression left by this fine show.
"Lucian Freud: The Complete Etchings, 1946-1992" remains at the Mary Ryan Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, mid-Manhattan, through Sept. 26.

America's Pint-Size Philosophers

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
As appealing a cast as you are likely to come across in this or any other television season is on show tonight in "Age 7 in America." Nineteen children from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Lincoln, Neb., and Dublin, Ga., offer their thoughts on life as they know it and would like to know it.
The hourlong documentary, directed by Phil Joanou, is an American version of "7 Up." That 1963 program opened a notable British series directed by Michael Apted, who is producing "Age 7 in America." Every seven years after that, the British team revisited its 14 subjects to ask how life was living up to their expectations. At the most recent encounter, shown this year, the group had turned 35. 
The American children -- 10 boys and 9 girls, black and white, urban, suburban and rural, from public schools, prep schools and parochial schools -- can be glimpsed at work and play before being brought together for a party. They come from both sides of the economic divide: one boy in a Chicago suburb is busy at his computer; another, in a Chicago project, rides his bicycle around what passes for a seventh-floor terrace instead of on the street "so nobody won't take it from me."
The conversational off-screen interviewer asks about school, money, race, drugs, dreams, religion. (God is taken seriously. One boy, seen soliciting for Jehovah's Witnesses, says entering Paradise is high on his wish list, and a girl confesses earnestly, "I never had a religious experience.") The answers are not readily summarized, but they leave no doubt that grimmer aspects of urban America have already been impressed on the less fortunate youngsters. Julio, who was born in El Salvador and now lives in Los Angeles, says, "In El Salvador they kill people with big guns, here with small guns."
The claim relayed by Meryl Streep, who narrates, that the children are "mirrors and crystal balls of our society" does not seem far-fetched. A Japanese-American boy says black people are treated badly in America. A Chinese-American girl says she is frightened of black people.
Money is on many minds. Both rich and poor children seem to believe that a poor person could become a rich person, as one puts it, "if he works harder and gets smarter." Parental injunctions may be discerned in avowals of a desire to share with the poor, but one prep school girl declares that she wants to be rich because then "I won't run out of money." Such forthright phrasings keep the hour bubbling.
A hint of melancholy links children wherever they live who are seen playing alone or just hanging around, like the girl who says thoughtfully that she has no friends. Joey, the polite and reserved Jehovah's Witness, lives in a rural Georgia town. Asked what he would like to be when he grows up, he replies soberly, a comedian. Maybe it is the influence of television, or maybe some 7-year-olds could use more laughs. Louis, who lives at the moment in a shelter for the homeless on New York City's Lower East Side with an extended family that does not include his father, also wants to be a comedian.
Perhaps the evening's saddest line comes from a girl whose one wish is: "Be an adult right away."
Along with the similarities of age and the divisions of class, there are signs of developing personalities that, if the British series is any guide, will have taken surprising forms when the producers return to the group at age 14.
For now, choose your favorites. The camera understandably keeps coming back to pint-size, practical Louis, who likes to talk and has a lot to say. He provides a motto for the program with this self-description: "I'm bad, I'm good. I'm friendly, I'm not friendly. I'm American."
 
Scared Silent
Exposing and Ending
Child Abuse
CBS, NBC, PBS, tonight at 10 (Channels 2, 4, 13 and 49 in New York)
ABC, Sunday at 10 P.M. (Channel 7 in New York)
Oprah Winfrey, in person and in spirit, makes a big visit to prime-time this weekend. She is the host of "Scared Silent: Exposing and Ending Child Abuse," an hourlong documentary that occupies CBS, NBC and PBS simultaneously tonight and will be repeated on Sunday on ABC. The announced purpose is to alert the nation to what Ms. Winfrey calls a "national epidemic" of sexual, physical and psychological abuse of children, usually by other family members, especially Dad.
Despite the title, which refers to the victims' fear of speaking up, child abuse is no secret to television viewers. It has been a staple of afternoon talk shows for several years, for reasons tonight's program make evident. Ingredients like sexual taboos, vulnerable children, brutal parents and pop psychology have proved irresistible. Earlier this week, for example, CNN carried "Breaking the Silence: Survivors of Incest," complete with victims, experts and call-ins.
"Scared Silent" focuses on six accounts of abuse: a church usher who spent a year in jail for sexually molesting his two daughters; a teen-ager who says she was molested by her brother and, in turn, molested a younger cousin; a grown brother and sister who tell of frequent beatings by their father; a mother whose conviction for killing her young son was overturned on appeal but who still feels guilty; a man described as "a lecturer and consultant" who says he suffered from being constantly criticized by his mother, and a man who served a jail term for sexually molesting his young daughter.
Everyone involved seems to have passed through therapy, as evidenced by the lingo that slips into the meetings, evidently arranged for the program, between abusers and abused. "Some shattered families can turn tragedy into healing," says Ms. Winfrey, who periodically provides an "800" number where help is said to be available. The language is explicit and the usual visual and musical effects are laid on for dramatic impact.
Although the intentions are no doubt righteous, the reporting leaves something to be desired and no responsibility is taken by network news departments. The script given to Ms. Winfrey, who begins by once again announcing she was raped by other members of her family beginning when she was 9 years old, relays a catch-all figure of 2.7 million cases of child abuse and neglect reported in 1991 without pausing to sort out what might be included.
Is the emphasis on sexual abuse in this hour and on the afternoon shows it emulates a reflection of reality or merely of television's partiality to the sensational? What constitutes violent abuse and does it occur more commonly among some groups than among others? The category of psychological abuse seems spacious enough to accommodate any family problem anyone cares to drop in. The question raised in recent child-abuse trials of the power therapists can exert on children's memories is not addressed.
But reporting is too much to ask of this sort of exercise. Viewers in need can dial the "800" number. Others may wish to dial "20/20."

Tampa Bay Is Ready for the Zamboni

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla.

 BODY:
Outside Expo Hall, the temperature was in the low 80's and so was the humidity. Palm trees shaded the bright morning sun. Inside the dark arena, the air felt much cooler and drier as a few players glided across the playing surface in an unofficial workout before training camp.
Doug Smith, in charge of air-conditioning and ice for the only National Hockey League team in the subtropics, stood next to the glass and boards and promised suitable playing conditions in the temporary home of the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
 "It's a matter of trial and error," said Smith, the building superintendent. "We're not going to have ice problems, I guarantee you that, no doubt in my mind. We could create snow in here."
 
Process of Trial and Error
 Artificial winter could be the least of the challenges for the Lightning, one of two expansion teams entering the league this season. The entire founding of the franchise has been a process of trial and error as the Lightning, along with the Ottawa Senators, bring the league's total membership to 24 teams.
After the N.H.L. approved a franchise bid led by Phil Esposito, the Lightning's financing flickered and the team got behind on payments of its $50 million entry fee. After first announcing that it would play in the Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, the Lightning abruptly moved to a smaller arena east of Tampa, on the state fair grounds, with livestock barns nearby.
Despite N.H.L. guidelines urging 18,500-seat arenas and 10,000 season tickets, the Lightning will play in a 10,500-seat arena and has so far sold only about 5,000 season-tickets. Plans for a big, new arena have been announced, but financing is incomplete and no ground-breaking date has been set.
Expressway billboards announce "Kick Ice" and "We Are the Lightning, You Are the Thunder," but much preseason light and sound here has been stolen by baseball because the San Francisco Giants may move to the Tampa Bay area next season.
Considering that much of the market is made up of senior citizens and that the economy is still in recession and that baseball may provide competition for customers and that Florida is closer to Cuba than it is to Canada, can major league hockey survive and thrive in a place like this?
Certainly, according to David LeFevre, the Manhattan lawyer who runs the team for the Japanese companies that paid the $50 million.
"There are more Canadians in Tampa than there are in Ottawa," LeFevre said after the first day of ticket sales for individual games. "We've sold out four of the games entirely. People now understand it really is going to happen. To have an ice-cold building and a game with the excitement of hockey in the middle of Tampa is a pretty exciting event."
 
Fan Interest on Rise
 "It's been a big turnabout over the last two or three months," LeFevre said of fan interest. "It's been a long struggle, but now we are having a little bit of success and you sort of say 'How do you deal with that?' instead of putting out fires."
Hundreds of fans stood in line Tuesday and were greeted by Esposito, the team president, who shook hands, signed autographs and posed for pictures like a presidential candidate. Ticket prices range from $12 to $50. Next to the arena, the team is constructing a big tent as a private club for season-ticket holders.
As was the case when he was general manager of the Rangers, Esposito has hired several friends. His brother, Tony, is the director of hockey operations. Don Murdoch, a former Ranger teammate, is a scout. Wayne Cashman, who played with Phil on the Boston Bruins, is an assistant coach to Terry Crisp. Esposito is no longer the general partner of the team, losing the position when Japanese investors became distressed at his dealings. LeFevre now holds the position.
 
Female Goaltender Invited
 Perhaps to generate publicity during training camp, Esposito invited goaltender Manon Rheaume, a woman who played one period of junior hockey last season in Three Rivers, Quebec. (She will have a private dressing room.)
A third-round draft choice with a chance to stick is Brent Gretzky, one of Wayne's brothers. A veteran trying out is Ron Duguay, one of Esposito's old pals from his playing days with the Rangers. At age 35, Duguay may have lost some of his playing skills, but he still retains the facial features and long, flowing locks that helped make him popular on his previous tours of various teams. Rob Zamuner was signed as a free-agent from the Rangers and Rob DiMaio was drafted from the Islanders.
Another former Islander is Joe Reekie, a defenseman who says Florida takes some getting used to.
So is the progress on a new arena. If the private group can't raise the funds in the next few months, the Lightning can get out of its lease. Marc Ganis, spokesman for Tampa Coliseum Inc., said that the new $114 million arena "is going to get done" right next to the football stadium despite "the tough banking climate these days."

HEADLINE: Worse Than a Lie

 BODY:
When President Bush keeps insisting that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas has raised taxes and fees 128 times, he knows he is falsifying the record. He seems so eager to smear his opponent as a big taxer that he's willing to trash the truth over trivia. But he jeopardizes more than credibility.
In a time of economic pain newly documented by the Census Bureau's report of soaring poverty, one would think the President would wish to ask voters for a mandate endorsing a sensible economic program. But his program so far remains incoherent, and meanwhile he keeps flailing at his opponent with this silly list. When will Mr. Bush get serious? 
 The number of tax increases during a governor's administration simply doesn't matter. What matters is the reason for any increases or cuts and, at bottom, the burden on taxpayers. Arkansas was a relatively low-tax state when Mr. Clinton became Governor 12 years ago, and still is.
Mr. Bush has seized on a gimmick that has a ring of truth to it but is, in fact, a misrepresentation. Exactly 128 tax and fee increases, he says, brandishing an amazingly sloppy list his staff asserts came from official Arkansas legislative records.
The list is endlessly misleading. It includes dozens of fee increases, not usually counted as tax increases, and it ignores tax reductions. But that's the very nature of this shabby tactic. In this case, the idea seems to be to plant in voters' minds the impression of many increases. If critics cavil, arguing over whether it was 128 or 138 or 59 or something else, so much the better; that keeps the issue alive.
Governor Clinton's record on taxes is, not surprisingly, by no means the horror that is thereby implied. There have been two increases in the state sales tax during the Clinton years, both earmarked for education, and three increases in the tax on gasoline, earmarked for highways.
The Legislature has rejected several Clinton proposals for higher personal and corporate income taxes, which would make the tax structure more progressive and more open to growth. The State Constitution requires three-fourths majorities to raise income taxes, but only simple majorities to raise the sales tax. When Mr. Clinton sought repeal of the three-fourths requirement, he lost.
In a larger perspective, the overall tax burden in Arkansas has hardly changed at all in the Clinton years. Revenue from state and local taxes equaled 9.5 percent of total personal income in 1980, and 9.6 percent in 1990, the latest figure available. The national average is almost 11.5 percent.
 The President would be wise to forget his list of 128 and turn instead to newer, truer numbers, starting with those just released by the Census Bureau: In the last year, 2.1 million more people have sunk below the poverty line.

The European Danger

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Anthony Lewis is on vacation.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The question about Europe now is what is more dangerous the eruptions of the same old murderous hatreds or the eruptions of the same old attempts to explain, rationalize or excuse them.
Sooner or later, Americans will have to pay attention. European nastinesses have a way of involving the U.S. and so do European evasions of the truth. Sooner would be better -- say before Election Day. 
 Take Germany, please. In a half-dozen cities, Nazis -- plain Nazis, there is no such thing as a neo-Nazi -- smash and burn in riot against foreign refugees and job-seekers.
Now, no decent European, German or otherwise, actually justifies the Nazi violence. How could you think such a thing? But a lot of them, German and otherwise, thoughtfully explain that Germany has taken in more than 250,000 refugees, and that even in their powerful economy Germans resent foreign competition for jobs and welfare, naturally.
Naturally. This is said as if refugees had not existed before -- nor history. It was not long ago that on any productive month the German Army created more refugees than Germany has taken in all together -- to say nothing about corpses.
Other countries handled refugees without rioting and hate. Poverty-ridden Pakistan accepted millions of Afghans. Israel is happy to gather in as many refugees from Arab or former Communist countries as can get there. And the U.S. has not done too badly either.
Of course, we all know, don't we, that Nazis no longer represent the German nation. Still, I was a bit surprised to discover in comments by the European representative of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, no less, that Germans who "wavered in their commitment to democracy" and voted for the right wing were not Nazis but just trying to say how angry and frightened they were, and that what Jews should do was converse more with Germans about fighting discrimination.
Myself, I had thought that message must have gotten across to Germans by now, some time since the end of World War II.
No -- what is happening in those German towns is not for lack of Jews "reaching out" to comfort and educate "mainstream" Germans, but because of Nazi race-mongering used as a political weapon, as usual. Now it is used against Muslims and other foreigners. German Jews are in low supply, thus available neither for purposes of conversation nor slaughter.
In the Balkans, Europe could not bring itself to take meaningful action until thousands of Europeans had been murdered, dozens of towns blown apart. Then, despite its armies and alliances it did not really bestir itself until the U.S. was set to get in.
Czechoslovakia. It was the former Soviet colony with the best chance of success. Now it prepares for its own burial. Europe takes it for granted that since Czechs and Slovaks had differences, they had to divorce.
Why? Why was it so inevitable that Czech and Slovak could not live together in the unified freedom they had before Western European appeasement of Hitler, the German Army and the Soviet Union incarcerated them?
Has Europe noticed that countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and, yes, the United States stay in one piece despite mixtures of religions and races and histories of racial and cultural tensions?
I live under and rejoice in the philosophies of political and intellectual freedom that came from Europe. But it is sinful delusion to forget the truth that for centuries religious and national hatreds were encouraged to fester in Europe -- and still are used by some Europeans to dominate, conquer or kill other Europeans.
Until that is recognized and fought intellectually and politically by today's Europe, the Continent cannot become a union no matter how many treaties are signed. A trading and travel bloc, maybe -- a union of nations and peoples, no.
The U.S. cannot bring that about. The best it can and should do is to help those who suffer from racism and despotism, whether European, Asian or African. And in Europe, as everywhere including their own country and hemisphere, Americans can refuse to wear the dangerous blindfold of rationalization or excuse. It hides from them the difference between perpetrator and victim, thus preventing the defeat of one and the succor of the other.

HEADLINE: If Government Protected Us, We'd Sue Less

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The latest demonstration of the unfortunate popular practice of lawyer-bashing came from both President Bush and Vice President Quayle in accepting their party's renominations on the last night of the Republican National Convention (speech transcripts, Aug. 21). 
 While the habit of blaming lawyers for many of society's ills has been practiced by both political parties, it has never received such prominent, nationwide, prime-time exposure.
Vice President Quayle asserted that the nation's financial woes and overloaded court calendars were the fault of the legal profession. He declared: "The explosion of frivolous lawsuits burdens our economy and weakens our system of justice."
The Vice President, a lawyer himself, then presented, as prima facie evidence, that "America has 5 percent of the world's population and 70 percent of the world's lawyers."
One can assume he will soon announce that the reason Americans are annoyed with the Federal Government and the Administration is that we have more newspapers, radio and television stations, reporters and editors per capita than the world's population average.
Mr. Bush's denunciation of the legal profession was peppered with phrases like "sharp lawyers," "crazy lawsuits" and "every trial lawyer who ever wore a tasseled loafer."
There are, however, many causes for the high level of litigation initiated by citizens against physicians, hospitals, manufacturers and government.
America has the best protections of an individual's rights and ability to seek recourse for damages of any nation. Our Federal and state constitutions, laws and court decisions wisely place great emphasis on an individual's prerogatives and ability to seek justice in the courts.
This is a blessing, not a curse. Curtailing this freedom would violate a basic principle of our society.
Better and continued evaluation of doctors and hospitals, and quicker actions when warranted, are the means to reduce malpractice litigation and lower insurance costs.
Weak product liability legislation or none at all, with almost meaningless government testing of a product's claims, safety and reliability, are the basis for much of today's civil actions against merchandise, drugs and goods.
The overburdened court calendars are due, in great measure, to the lack of sufficient numbers of judges and constant underfunding of our courts.
But the majority of civil suits against manufacturers, physicians and hospitals would not be initiated, entertained by the courts and supported by decision of juries if government agencies responsible for pro
tecting the public lived up to their legal and moral obligations.
Government, to a large extent, still follows a "let the buyer beware" policy, which leaves seeking justice in the courts as the only means of gaining protection and safety in the marketplace.

HEADLINE: New York Risks Losing Lucrative Film and TV Production

 BODY:
To the Editor:
More than a year ago the Directors Guild suggested to the New York City Council that the film, television and commercial production business -- the business that creates and depicts New York's reputation to the rest of the world -- was leaving the city and taking with it the pool of talent that drives New York's cultural and creative community. The Directors Guild represents the directors, assistant directors and unit production managers who create American theatrical motion pictures. 
 From that day until this, our analysis is that the city has done nothing to prevent the death of the industry. Deputy Mayor Barry F. Sullivan has failed to fill the top slot at the Mayor's Office of Film and Broadcasting. Without someone to provide leadership, focus and direction, the office has become little more than a granter of filming permits.
The Mayor and his administration still fail to comprehend the need to treat the entertainment industry as an economic asset that needs nurturing and development. Their failure undermines our efforts to refocus the spotlight on New York City as a producer-friendly center of production, rather than a hassle-filled location.
The Directors Guild, with the other unions representing creative talent (the Writers Guild East, the New York Local of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Screen Actors Guild), has commissioned an economic-impact study to help demonstrate to the city's bureaucracy the high-stakes issues involved.
Worse than the disastrous economic significance of a loss of the film and television business is the city government's failure fully to understand the threat to the city's reputation and the way it is portrayed to and perceived by the rest of the world.
The administration must remember that while the talent we represent can move elsewhere to follow the work, the city will be hard pressed to recover from the loss of this central business. Perhaps the time has come for the City Council to create an office of its own to act on behalf of the film industry.

A Noble Calling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a lifelong conservative Republican who also happens to be a plaintiffs' lawyer, I am compelled to respond to the attacks on trial lawyers by both President Bush and Vice President Quayle in their acceptance speeches at the Republican National Convention. 
 We have safer highways, automobiles and other products, higher standards of health care and a more humane workplace in the United States because of trial lawyers. This profession was once esteemed by the public as a noble calling.
Our greatest political leaders (for example, Daniel Webster, Abraham Lincoln and William Jennings Bryan) were trial lawyers.
It is my experience from 20 years of trying cases that it is extremely difficult to persuade a jury to award damages to an undeserving plaintiff. Indeed, roughly half of all civil cases are successfully defended. Generally, jurors make a conscientious effort to reach just and truthful verdicts.
According to a 1991 Rand Corporation study there are fewer lawsuits today as a percentage of the general population than there were in Colonial times. Such mechanisms as post-trial motions and appellate review protect against occasional excessive or unwarranted jury awards.
The one group dedicated to protecting and preserving individual rights in this country does not deserve to be made scapegoats by our nation's leaders.

In a stunningly grim reflection of the midsummer economy, the Government reported that 167,000 private-sector jobs were lost in August as factory employment skidded to its lowest level since April 1983. The unemployment rate edged down, to 7.6 percent, but that drop resulted from a decline in the number of people seeking work. The new figures led to another interest-rate cut by the Fed, a move that was intended to spur economic growth but could hurt the dollar. 1

The Economy
Some 167,000 private-sector jobs were lost in August as factory employment skidded to its lowest level since April 1983, stunningly grim Government figures showed, even though the unemployment rate edged down one-tenth of a point, to 7.6 percent. The figures promptly led to another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, which pushed the Federal funds rate down to 3 percent. The Administration called the decline in the jobless rate encouraging, while the Clinton camp hammered at the Administration. [Page 1.]
 
International
 A liberal aviation pact was agreed to by the U.S. and the Netherlands. The agreement could allow KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest to operate as a single airline. [1.]U.S. airlines are offering incentives to frequent fliers.[33.] 
 Japanese companies, angered by "patent wars," as some call American companies' demands for large royalties from Japanese companies for the use of patented technology, are fighting back. [1.]
The Administration released part of the free-trade pact struck by the United States, Mexico and Canada on Aug. 12 -- a three-inch-thick computer printout. [31.]
Although Lloyd's of London faces more potential losses, there seems to be growing confidence among the institution's management and the "names," as its financial backers are known, that Lloyd's, after a most tumultuous period, is stabilizing. [31.]
 
Markets
The bond market was stunned by the surprisingly steep decline in employment in August. Prices soared and yields tumbled. [31.]
Stock prices sagged in the slowest trading of the year, with the Dow off 10.27, to 3,281.93. [35.]
The Amex was closed after a half hour by a fire nearby. Four hundred workers were evacuated by 10 A.M. [32.]
The dollar fell against most other currencies, and gold rose. [41.] Soybeans and corn futures prices posted moderate gains as traders rolled the dice on forecasts of frost. [41.]
 
Companies
Allstate Insurance said it expected $1.2 billion in claims from Hurricane Andrew, more than four times what it paid out for Hurricane Hugo in 1989. [31.]
A Lockheed-led team won a $689 million contract to develop an anti-missile system to replace the Patriot missile. Other companies involved are Honeywell, Rockwell International, Westinghouse Electric and United Technologies. [31.]
G.M. prepared to close two more assembly plants in Wilmington, Del., and Lansing, Mich., as negotiations continued on ending the eight-day-old strike at its Lordstown parts plant. [33.]
Carl Karcher Enterprises said a buyout of the company had been discussed by its chairman and chief executive. [43.]
Merck has created a new division to make a generic version of an anti-inflammatory drug. [43.]

WATCHING THE MEDICINE GO DOWN

ELECTRONIC MONITORS FOUND FAULTY
In a policy shift, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said yesterday that they would oppose the use of electronic monitoring devices to keep track of criminal defendants out on bail, because the prosecutors believed the devices did not deter defendants from fleeing the country or committing other crimes. Page 23.
SAFETY VIOLATIONS SEEN
Before an old post office building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan partly collapsed on Thursday, the contractor demolishing it was cited by city inspectors 10 times for safety violations during the last three weeks, city officials said yesterday. Page 23.
TWO EXPLOSIONS IN MIDTOWN
Two explosions, ignited by sparks from a Consolidated Edison cable, rocked a midtown Manhattan street yesterday morning, terrifying pedestrians, shattering windows and hurling manhole covers "into the air like pizzas," a Fire Department official said. Page 23.

NASSAU CLERK MAY RETIRE
The Nassau County Clerk has taken steps to retire, ending his 45-year career in the County Clerk's office under an avalanche of criticism for logjams in its operations. "This is not the way I wanted to go out," Harold W. McConnell said. "I thought I would go out after serving my full term, but the problems got to be too much. I'm not 30 years old anymore." Page 24.
ACKERMAN INVESTIGATION SOUGHT
Congress should investigate allegations that Representative Gary Ackerman, the Queens Democrat, evaded House limits on outside income, his opponent for the Democratic nomination for Congress said. The allegations were raised in a Newsday article that said Mr. Ackerman negotiated a $45,000-a-year consulting contract for his wife, Rita, when he sold his newspaper and advertising company in 1989.

TORNADO? NO, A MICROBURST
Meteorological sleuths attributed the damage of Thursday's fierce thunderstorms in southwestern Connecticut not to a tornado, but to an equally rare marauder known as a microburst, a sudden violent downdraft of a kind that has caused plane crashes and carried away buildings. But the National Weather Service confirmed that two small tornadoes had touched down in Scarsdale and in Endicott, 150 miles northwest of New York City. Page 24.
AN AMUSEMENT PARK'S SPECIAL WEEKEND
After a sorry, silent season, the roller coaster at Lake Compounce Festival Park in Bristol, Conn., was again clattering.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Courts Small Businesses by Offering Loans

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FREDERICKSBURG, Va., Sept. 4

 BODY:
Campaigning as a skeptical outsider while behaving as a Washington insider, President Bush today sharply attacked Congress for rejecting most of his legislation and then praised and signed a bill promoting small business loans.
In a street-corner campaign speech here that was billed as an endorsement of small business, Mr. Bush described himself as a former businessman who got ulcers meeting payrolls and felt disgust for too many regulations and high taxes. He also spoke of his contempt for a "gridlocked Congress" that routinely dismissed his proposals. 
 Mr. Bush then rolled up his sleeves and made a ceremony out of signing a bill that the House and Senate approved last month. It increased the amount of small business loan guarantees to $8 billion in 1994, from $6 billion in 1992. The actual Federal outlays for such loan guarantees are about 5 percent of the loans, which is $300 million in 1992 and $400 million by 1994.
 
'They Create Jobs'
 The bill-signing ended a week of barnstorming across the nation during which the President announced approval of new foreign arms sales and military spending, an increase in Federal agricultural subsidies and authorization for large-scale Federal spending in South Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.
Mr. Bush brushed off questions about whether all the Federal largesse was an effort to buy votes. "These are good, sound proposals," he said. "They create jobs. So I take nothing but great pride in them."
Arriving at this city by helicopter from the White House 55 miles away, Mr. Bush briefly visited the Fredericksburg Hardware store before being whisked in his black limousine a few blocks to Goolrick's Pharmacy.
In front of the pharmacy, he reiterated his intention to cut taxes and regulation on small businesses but offered no new specifics on how he would do that. He also criticized Gov. Bill Clinton's economic plan, saying it would raise taxes for most Americans, increase the deficit and cause the elimination of 2.6 million jobs.
 
Response From Clinton Camp
 "Our differences couldn't be sharper," Mr. Bush said. "I see small business as the backbone of the American economy. He sees a golden-egg-laying goose that ought to pay more in taxes."
Aides to Mr. Clinton noted that Mr. Bush had avoided mentioning the grim new employment figures announced today, and they challenged Mr. Bush's economic policies.
The Labor Department said today that the August jobless rate fell to 7.6 percent, from 7.7 percent in July. But the department said 167,000 jobs were lost last month despite a new Government program that hired 100,000 people.
"If George Bush is so good for business, how come there's been three times more bankruptcies than new private-sector jobs," said George Stephanopoulos, the Clinton campaign's communications director.
While Mr. Bush was warmly received by most of the crowd, the appearance was not without dissenting voices. One sign asked, "If recession's over, where's my job?," while another said, "Our Family Values Jobs."

HEADLINE: Downed Plane: Serbs and Bosnians Trade Charges

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the country's rebel Serbs today accused each other of responsibility for the downing Thursday of an Italian relief plane in the mountains outside Sarajevo.
Although the plane was downed in territory held by Croatian forces loyal to Bosnia, troops from various Muslim, Croatian and Serbian factions are said to operate in the area. United Nations officials said they had still not determined which group might have fired at the plane. Nor was it clear which faction fired at two United States helicopters that were searching for the wreckage, forcing them to withdraw. 
 Gen. Ratko Mladic, the top army commander of the so-called Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, asserted that Croatian and Muslim fighters had downed the cargo plane. He denied any connection between Serbian forces and the downing of the plane. He made his accusation in a letter to Gen. Satish Nambiar of India, the commander of the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
But President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia said the plane had been hit by missiles that came from an area controlled by Serbs.
Neither General Mladic nor President Izetbegovic offered evidence for their statements.
Italian Air Force and United Nations investigators arrived at the crash site today to inspect the wreckage of the G-222 twin-propeller airplane, which crashed in Jasenik, 20 miles west of the capital. All four crew members died.
Witnesses told journalists and United Nations officials that at least one missile had hit the plane, but a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, Fernando del Mundo, said United Nations personnel had not yet found hard evidence to support these accounts.
"The wreckage of the plane is strewn around an area of about 1.5 kilometers, which indicates there was some sort of explosion before impact," said Peter Kessler, a United Nations spokesman in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
Fighting between all the factions in Bosnia continued today, and diplomats said it was too early to tell whether there was progress in fulfilling commitments made last week at a London peace conference.
 
Parliament Backs Premier
 In Belgrade, factions on the Serbian side that favor a conciliatory stance achieved a victory when the federal Parliament voted to endorse the policies of Prime Minister Milan Panic. But Serbian forces in the field are believed to pay far more attention to the Serbian Government, which is led by President Slobodan Milosevic. Serbia and Montenegro are the only two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Mr. Panic, a Serbian-American millionaire, was appointed Prime Minister to improve Yugoslavia's image and help persuade the United States and European countries to lift economic sanctions, and he appears to have achieved a measure of support among people weary of the hardships caused by the sanctions.
Mr. Panic favors adherence to Serbian promises to dismantle detention camps and turn over heavy weapons to United Nations forces. But negotiators express doubt that Mr. Milosevic will let these steps be carried out in full.
Mr. Panic, for instance, has angered nationalist Serbs by advocating the recognition of Croatia and Bosnia within the borders that existed before the fighting began, in effect supporting withdrawal of Serbian forces from large areas of the republics.
In London, representatives of all the factions agreed to end their sieges of various towns and cities and bring irregular militias under central control. The Serbs have also lifted their four-month siege of the mostly Muslim Bosnian town of Gorazde and allowed United Nations observers access to gun emplacements above Sarajevo, one diplomat said.

HEADLINE: Deal With Russia Is Said to Involve More Uranium Than Believed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Federal officials say an East-West deal in which the United States would buy Russian uranium from scrapped nuclear arms involves far greater amounts than generally reported, at least 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium. The purchased uranium is to be diluted for sale as commercial reactor fuel.
The agreement was announced by the White House late on Monday, but its complete terms were not spelled out, leading to differing interpretations of its meaning. 
 The New York Times said the deal involved at least 80 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium, while some other publications stated proposed yearly rates of purchases without giving a time period or total quantity to be bought, implying that it might be relatively small.
In interviews, officials at the Energy and State Departments said the agreement was a 20-year arrangement and that no less than 10 metric tons of highly enriched uranium would be bought annually for the first five years and no less than 30 metric tons annually for the next 15 years. In other words, 50 tons would be bought during the first period and 450 tons in the second period, for a total of 500 metric tons.
"These are target numbers," said Philip G. Sewell, the Energy Department's deputy assistant secretary for uranium enrichment. "If we can do it faster and in higher quantities, we will."
Administration officials said the agreement is confidential and declined to make it public. Details of the overall deal remain to be worked out, and the final agreement requires the formal approval of both Moscow and Washington. The American aim is to bolster the shaky Russian economy and to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents and theft.
Private experts once considered 500 metric tons to be the total inventory of Russian uranium bomb fuel, but they are now raising their estimates because it seems unlikely that Moscow would sell its entire supply.
It is unclear whether the vagueness and the lateness of the White House announcement was by accident or design. A State Department official said the news was played down out of worry that it might embarrass the Russian military, elements of which are angered by the dismantling of large parts of Russia's nuclear arsenal.
But a private analyst, Marvin S. Fertel, vice president of the Council for Energy Awareness, the communications arm of the nuclear power industry, suggested the deal was slighted by general White House fumbling and foreign-policy defensiveness in an election year dominated by domestic issues.
The nature of the White House announcement, Mr. Fertel said, was "indicative of the ineptitude" of the Bush Administration in recent months.

Airlines Fight for Frequent Fliers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The airlines' battle for passengers took a new turn yesterday when carriers announced special travel awards for frequent fliers.
"The airlines have bled themselves dry with the fare wars," said Randy Petersen, editor and publisher of Inside Flyer, a newsletter covering frequent-flier programs. "This is an effort to stop costing themselves real money." 
 The carriers have not used frequent-flier programs recently to stimulate business, Mr. Peterson said. Now, they are making up for lost time.
United Airlines announced a new program on Thursday that offers two free "connoisseur class" round-the-world tickets to passengers who make 25 round-trip flights on the airline in the next two months.
Through Dec. 18, passengers earn credits for round-trip tickets -- one credit for each economy fare and two for a first- or connoisseur-class ticket.
Four bonus credits earn one free economy round trip within the continental United States or four 1,000-mile upgrade certificates.
Seven bonus credits earn one free economy-class round trip between the continental United States and Hawaii, Europe, the Caribbean or Latin America, or eight 1,000-mile upgrade certificates.
Eleven bonus credits count toward one free economy-class round-trip between the United States and Asia or the South Pacific, or 12 1,000-mile upgrade certificates.
Yesterday, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and USAir all announced award programs of their own. Like United's, their awards are in addition to regular miles earned through airline frequent-flier programs.
Continental said it announced a similar program to members of its frequent-flier program, One Pass, in August. Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines said they were studying the offers.
American will award one certificate good for one free coach-class ticket for travel within or between the continental United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean for every 10 flight segments or 12,000 miles flown.
Two award certificates can be redeemd for one round-trip coach class ticket to Hawaii, Europe, Latin America or Japan. All the special awards must be used between Feb. 1, 1993, and May 31, 1993.
USAir's bonus awards are similar to American's, although they are good for travel between Jan. 15 and May 15. They are also subject to blackout dates and capacity controls, the airline said.
Under Delta's program, two award certificates will be given for eight segments traveled. One will be good for a domestic upgrade, two for one free coach ticket in North America or an upgrade to Europe or Asia.
With four certificates, a passenger earns a coach ticket to Hawaii, Europe or Asia, with six, a business-class ticket to Europe or Asia, and with eight, a first-class ticket to Europe or Asia.
Like American's, Delta's award tickets are valid February through May next year.
Fall is traditionally the slowest for the airlines, which have lost billions of dollars in the last two years of recession.
And airlines have said they expect this summer's fare wars will mean large losses in the third quarter, usually their best.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Strategy;
Discipline, Message and Good Luck: How Clinton's Campaign Came Back

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 4

 BODY:
In the last three months, Gov. Bill Clinton has transformed the Presidential campaign from a referendum on his character into one on George Bush's Presidency by sticking to a disciplined plan, and the tactic has salvaged the Democrats' hopes of regaining the White House.
The process of burnishing Mr. Clinton's tarnished image began shortly after the June 2 California primary. Top advisers, including James Carville, Mandy Grunwald, Stan Greenberg and George Stephanopoulos, formed a working group to plan their candidate's rehabilitation. 
 They developed a carefully honed message and organized a campaign of taut, centralized discipline. But beyond that, the process has relied on some major strokes of good luck as well.
"If anybody tells you they knew what was going to happen, they're lying," Mr. Greenberg said.
 
The Economy and Perot
 Indeed, nobody could say for sure in the early spring that the nation's economy would remain sour into the fall. And the Clinton strategists could scarcely have known that President Bush would fail to address it in a convincing way at the Republican National Convention.
Moreover, the independent candidacy of Ross Perot proved valuable. It was a distraction for the press and voters at the time Mr. Clinton was regrouping, and when the Perot campaign collapsed it was a source of support, with its backers turning to Mr. Clinton as the only remaining alternative to the incumbent.
Still, it has not all been luck. Mr. Clinton and his top advisers have missed few chances to take advantage of circumstances and events.
Crucial to the resurrection of the Clinton candidacy was Mr. Greenberg's discovery, through voter surveys, that there were many people who knew little of substance about Mr. Clinton but were receptive to learning more.
 
Showing His Favorable Side
 He also discovered that voters' minds could be changed about the Arkansas Governor once they were presented with favorable information about his family background, his wife and their daughter.
Setting aside the personal issues that had come to define the campaign and might yet derail it -- Mr. Clinton's draft record, his belated admission that he had smoked, but not inhaled, marijuana and accusations of marital infidelity -- the strategists determined to use late-night television shows, televised "town meetings" and pop culture magazines to reach voters directly. This way, they could pierce the veil of conventional, and more critical, news reporting.
The results are best shown in the poll-takers' measurements. In June, when Mr. Perot was still in the race and after Mr. Clinton had clinched the Democratic nomination, more than twice as many voters responding to a New York Times/CBS News survey viewed him unfavorably, 40 percent, as did favorably, 16 percent.
By last week, the Times/CBS poll showed that 36 percent viewed Mr. Clinton favorably, while 28 percent had unfavorable impressions.
In the six weeks between the California primary and the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Clinton appeared on Arsenio Hall, MTV, morning talk shows and the cover of People Magazine.
 
Image of a Family Man
 His strategists were so determined to play up the image of Mr. Clinton as a family man that it rejected People's plan to feature only Mrs. Clinton on the cover. Instead, shoppers at checkout stands across the country saw the whole Clinton family pictured.
Talk show hosts and their viewers learned about the house Mr. Clinton lived in -- briefly, it turns out -- that lacked indoor plumbing, and the jobs he held to put himself through school. They learned he was born to a single mother and battled an abusive and alcoholic stepfather.
"Some of it was smart," Mr. Greenberg said of the series of events that led to the Clinton comeback. "Some of it was accident."
One accident was that Mr. Clinton introduced his economic plan in a period when voters were being alienated by the static of the feud between Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot.
"They learned in vague ways that he had an economic plan," Mr. Greenberg said, "but the most important thing they learned was that he worked for what he got in life. The same set of facts look very different if it's a working-class kid instead of a rich kid."
 
'A Strategic Dictator'
 The plan to begin a grass-roots media assault was, by most accounts, the brainchild of Ms. Grunwald. Mr. Greenberg used his surveys to expose the soft spots in the psyche of the electorate. And Mr. Carville took over the strategic end of the campaign, emphasizing discipline above all else.
"It's not like we're flying blind anymore," one Clinton strategist said. "Campaigns demand benevolent dictatorships, and this one has it. James has become a strategic dictator."
The campaign moved to a new headquarters here in Little Rock, where top officials work 18-hour days, eat hearty lunches at a restaurant named "Your Mama's" that specializes in mashed potatoes and meatloaf, and plot a hungry strategy.
Unlike typical Presidential campaigns, the Clinton effort is run entirely from the headquarters, not from a peripatetic campaign plane. What the candidate does on the plane and on the bus, from scheduling to message, is driven by decisions made at the 7 A.M. meetings here led by Mr. Carville.
 
Changing Personalities
 As the strategic plan hardened, personalities rose and fell. Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman, returned to the strategic periphery, planning for debates and acting as liaison to party leaders. David Wilhelm's role evolved into that of a political director who runs the state operations. And Susan Thomases, the New York lawyer who is close to the Clintons, took over scheduling, a pivotal position that touches many areas of the campaign. Overseeing the communications, polling and media strategy was Mr. Stephanopoulos.
Once this structure was in place the campaign was poised to take advantage of circumstance. The best day of the campaign was July 16, when Mr. Perot dropped out of the race on the last day of the Democratic convention.
Another potent lift materialized when Mr. Clinton selected Senator Al Gore of Tennessee as his running mate. Strategists naturally planned for Mr. Gore to help the ticket, but not to the degree that polls now show he did.
"Gore was reinforcing," Mr. Greenberg said of the addition of the Senator and his family. "If you assume that the primary process did not allow Bill Clinton to be known, the Vice-Presidential process, rather than to balance him, needed to reinforce him."
 
Joint Appearances
 Campaign officials suggest this was a happy accident, one they were quick to exploit with bus tours and joint appearances at every opportunity.
"If we do only a competent job of keeping the campaign focused on the economy, we're prepared to let the chips fall where they may," said another top adviser, Eli Segal. "As long as we keep the debate on the issues, George Bush has nothing to say."
The Democratic nominee has now rebuilt his campaign from the bottom up, from the nuts and bolts of installing an efficient phone system at the headquarters here to the creation of a strategic hierarchy that has spent the week making a series of aggressive attacks on Mr. Bush.
From Michael S. Dukakis's campaign in 1988 the leaders have learned the value of speedy response. And from last winter's bouts with "character" questions they have learned the value of pre-emptive strikes.
 
Running a Close Race
 Mr. Clinton's strategists have concluded from the experience of 1988 that this year's race will be won narrowly if it is to be won at all.
"Two months ago, whenever I made a speech to fund-raising group, I would say, 'We can win, so stick with us,' " said Mr. Segal, the Boston businessman and veteran Democratic party worker who is the campaign's chief of staff. "Now I say, 'We can lose, so stick with us.' "
For Clinton partisans, the difference is that they now believe they can fight for the Presidency on their own terms. They are not yet cocky, but nearly so.
"For the last couple of months we were running against ourselves," Mr. Greenberg said recently. "We're running against George Bush now. It's a different campaign now."

In a stunningly grim portrayal of the midsummer economy, Government figures showed today that American business and industry lost 167,000 jobs in August as factory employment skidded to its lowest level since April 1983.
The job losses shown in today's labor-market report, the next to last reading before Election Day, were almost completely unexpected by private analysts. The release of the figures promptly led to another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board. The action was intended to spur economic growth, but it could also help push the already weak dollar lower against foreign currencies. 
 The unemployment rate edged down one-tenth of a point, to 7.6 percent, but this resulted from fewer people seeking work, perhaps because they saw little prospect of finding any.
The Bush camp put on a brave face. The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called the one-tenth of a point decline in the jobless rate "an encouraging sign that the economy is improving," even though the Labor Department considers it statistically insignificant.
 
Tax Incentives Urged
 Michael J. Boskin, the President's top economic adviser, added, "While the decline in the unemployment rate and the increases in the workweek and hourly earnings were welcome, the employment numbers reiterate the need for the Congress to pass the President's proposed tax incentives to spur growth and create jobs now."
But Congressional Democrats and Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign seized on the figures to disparage the country's economic performance of recent years.
When the Federal Reserve injected money into the banking system just before noon, it was clear that the central bank had established a new 3 percent level for Federal funds, the overnight lending rate among commercial banks. The rate had been 3 1/4 percent.
Analysts said that this, in turn, could mean lower rates on certificates of deposit and money market funds but that the 6 percent prime rate would likely remain.
 
Central Bank Is Inhibited
 But a more aggressive move by the Federal Reserve is not considered likely. In early July, after a comparably dismal jobs report, the central bank cut the discount rate, which is the rate it charges on loans to banks, as well as the Federal funds rate. But now the Fed would be inhibited by the dollar's weakness on international currency markets in recent months and by a lack of evidence that some of the lowest rates in decades are actually spurring economic recovery.
"It's a real jolt," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, referring to the Labor Department's report and its psychological, as well as economic, impact. "Even if you haven't lost your job, you've got to be pretty nervous."
The figures, said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, head of the Joint Economic Committee, "are striking evidence that the frail condition of the American economy continued into August," with the jobless rate above 7 percent for the ninth straight month. "Despite more than a year of reported growth in the gross domestic product, there are still 1.8 million fewer jobs in the American economy now than there were when this recession started more than two years ago," he said.
Governor Clinton, who has been hammering at President Bush's economic record all week, was quick to work the new unemployment figures into a speech at Pinnacle Mountain, Ark., where he accepted the endorsement of the Sierra Club.
He noted that "there was an actual reduction of 167,000 people employed in the private sector," and said, "If it weren't for summer jobs programs, this country's unemployment would have gone up again this last month." Mr. Clinton then suggested the nation's economic woes were linked to the Bush Administration's environmental policies, saying that unlike the Governments of Japan and Germany, the Administration did not recognize the job-creating potential in industries related to environmental cleanup programs.
Among the 11 large states for which individual data were published today, New York posted a nine-tenths of a point decline in its jobless rate, to 8.5 percent, while the Illinois rate dropped 1.9 points, to 6.5 percent. In California, however, which has been hit by cutbacks in military spending, the riot in Los Angeles in the spring and the state's protracted budget crisis, unemployment surged nine-tenths of a point, to 9.8 percent.
The huge improvement for Illinois, an important political battleground, brought joblessness there eight-tenths of a point below the August 1991 level.
Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., noted in a statement that the jobless rate for adults actually rose in August -- to 6.3 percent from 6.2 for people 25 and over.
Mr. Kirkland, referring to those who could find only part-time jobs and those who have given up the job search, contended that if these people were included, nearly 18 million would be unemployed, a rate of 14 percent.
Today's glum job news prompted some economists to question whether the recession -- which began in July 1990 and probably ended sometime last year, although no formal designation that it is over has been made -- may resume. As measured by gross domestic product, the economy has expanded modestly in the five most recent quarters after contracting in the final three months of 1990 and the first three months of 1991.
Although he did not necessarily foresee a so-called triple dip, Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said there was considerable cause for concern.
Over all, employment was down 83,000 in August, according to the department's survey of payrolls. The decline reflects the 167,000 drop in private-sector employment and a gain of 84,000 government jobs, nearly all of which opened up at the local level with the help of a Federal jobs program established in the wake of the Los Angeles riots.
Manufacturing was particularly weak. In all, 97,000 factory jobs disappeared last month, the second decline in three months after a short period of stability, the department noted. And the weakness was widespread, with losses appearing for 16 of the 20 industries specified, including industrial machinery and transportation equipment.
Jobs in retail trade grew far less than usual in August, declining 71,000 after seasonal adjustment. Construction jobs also fell, with summer losses now having offset increases during the spring.
The department's survey of households, on which the unemployment rate is based, showed 35,000 fewer jobs, along with a 95,000 decline in the labor force. Together, this cut meant that the number of unemployed fell by 60,000, to 9.7 million.
 
Rate Among Teen-Agers
 The one-tenth of a point decline in the unemployment rate followed a similar drop in July. In June it jumped three-tenths of a point, to an eight-year peak. The decline has been largely confined, however, to teen-agers, whose rate fell 1.2 points in August to 19.8 percent.
Without seasonal adjustment, there were 119,082,000 people with jobs last month, the department reported, down from 119,754,000 in July but up from 117,859,000 in August 1991.
William G. Barron Jr., Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, pointed today to what he called a striking pattern over the past year in which the unemployment rate has been governed by growth in the labor force.
For most of the second half of 1991, he told the Joint Economic Committee, there was no labor force growth and the jobless rate held at just under 7 percent. Then, beginning in November, growth became rapid, jobs could not keep up, and the unemployment rate rose nearly a point to June's 7.8 percent. The jobless rate has eased for two months because growth of the labor force has halted without significant job growth.

Scriptures to Floridians
Along with the hot meals, clothing and bottles of water that have been moving briskly at the emergency distribution centers in Florida and Louisiana has been one other commodity: Bibles.
The American Bible Society in New York reported yesterday that it had shipped more than 31,000 copies of the Scriptures to victims of Hurricane Andrew. English, Spanish and French Bibles were sent. 
 Most of the Bibles were distributed in cooperation with the Salvation Army, which stacked them on their mobile food vans.
"We have 13, soon to be 16, mobile kitchens that are going every day to Dade County, distributing meals," said Capt. Ron Busroe of the Salvation Army office in Fort Lauderdale. "We can use as many Bibles as you can send."
The Rev. Doyle L. Wetherington, executive director of the Miami Baptist Association, said many families had lost their Bibles in the devastation. And whether they had Bibles before or not, he added, reading the Scriptures in a crisis "provides comfort and a sense of stability."
Dr. Wetherington said 16 of the 100 churches in his association were so severely damaged in the hurricane that they could not be used.
Dozens of others religious structures, including a handful of synagogues, also suffered serious damage. Worshipers have been gathering in temporary chapels, parking lots and tents near their churches.
Rabbi David H. Auerbach of Bet Shira Congregation said his goal was to get his badly damaged sanctuary in working order for Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish new year, which begins the evening of Sept. 27. As he spoke, workers were replacing a glass wall that had been smashed by the winds with a new concrete wall. "It's not going to be pretty," he said, "but we are determined to hold services."
The Lubavitch Hasidic group, which has 40 centers in southern Florida, combined its relief efforts in the area with a spiritual message. Rabbi Zalman Schmotkin, a Lubavitch spokesman in New York, said yesterday that the group had distributed 65,000 sandwiches -- tuna, egg salad and cold cuts -- to people who suffered from the hurricane. The sandwiches, which were kosher, were distributed to Jews and non-Jews.
"We also spoke to people about the miracles they experienced," Rabbi Schmotkin said. "Given the wrath of the hurricane, we have to be thankful that there were comparatively few casualties."
 
Inflation Rose Faster
 Contributions to nine major Protestant denominations rose 4.4 percent in 1990 but failed to keep pace with the consumer price index rise of 5.4 percent, according to the recently released 1992 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches.
The yearbook, published by the National Council of Churches, uses the nine denominations as a bellwether of overall church economic vitality because they are large bodies that regularly report their income from contributions.
Of the nine, the Episcopal Church reported the highest per-capita giving, rising to $811 in 1990 form $763 in 1989, an increase of 6.2 percent.
The largest percentage increase was reported by the United Church of Christ, which showed a 7.1 percent rise to $374 in 1990 from $350 in 1989.
 
Clerics Protest in Israel
 The effort by Ethiopian Jewish clerics in Israel to be treated as officially recognized rabbis took a more aggressive turn this week when 16 of the clerics broke through police barricades in front of the office of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Jerusalem and were arrested.
"We requested and begged," said Daniel Adgah, a spokesmen for the clerics, known as kessim, told the Religious News Service. "This apartheid is growing."
Israeli rabbis are authorized by law to wed and divorce Jews and officiate at burials. Similar authority is given to Muslim and Christian clerics. Israel's chief rabbinate, which is responsible for Jewish clerics, has acknowledged the status of the kessim. But the chief rabbis said the Ethiopian clerics must study modern Judaism as practiced in Israel if they want authority.
Although some Ethiopians have been trained in modern Orthodox Judaism, many have not. Ethiopian Jewry is said to date from the time of King Solomon nearly 3,000 years ago. Almost from that time, the Ethiopians had been cut off from Jewish community in Israel and therefore had little knowledge of the Talmud and medieval commentaries that shaped rabbinic Judaism.
Uzi Baram, the Religious Affairs Minister, and Yair Tsaban, the Absorption Minister, called on the police to release the Ethiopian kessim, who represent a community that was largely airlifted by Israel from Ethiopia. The ministers also called on Israel's chief rabbinate to treat the kessim no differently than rabbis.
"It's a shame that there was violence and there were these arrests," Mr. Tsaban said. "This is a quiet community that has gone through a lot."

HEADLINE: Bonds Surge on Poor Jobs Report

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The surprisingly steep decline reported yesterday for employment in August, including a loss of 167,000 private-sector jobs, stunned the bond market, where investors and analysts were expecting a modest increase.
The decidedly bad economic news sent prices soaring and yields tumbling across the board, from the three-month bill to the 30-year bond. 
 The discount rate on three- and six-month bills fell below 3 percent for the first time since 1963. The yield on the two-year note is at its lowest ever, having dipped below 4 percent. The yield on the 30-year bond fell briefly to its lowest level since September 1986 and ended at 7.28 percent, the yield it touched briefly in August and matching the lowest since January 1987.
 
The Fed Makes a Move
 And the Federal Reserve, by injecting money into the financial system after the employment report, indicated that it had lowered its benchmark short-term interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3 percent, the lowest level in almost 30 years.
The declines in rates for bills, notes and bonds happened in a matter of minutes just after the release of the employment data on a trading day that was cut in half because of the Labor Day weekend. The price of the 30-year bond was up over a point and the increases for notes were similar. The prices came off just a bit after the Fed acted, apparently because some investors and traders had hoped the central bank would go further in bringing down rates.
But all of these new lows in interest rates only emphasized the economy's trouble, because bad economic news is what drives the bond market higher.
These sharp declines and the Fed's 23 previous cuts in short-term interest rates since 1989 have apparently failed to get the economy moving, so the central bank's cautious reduction yesterday was judged by several economists and traders to be far short of what was needed.
They acknowledged that concerns about a weak dollar, which has plunged to a string of lows recently against the German mark, are probably hemming the Fed in. But, they said that given the weakness uncovered by the unexpected jobs data, the Fed must act more emphatically.
"The Fed should say the dollar be damned and lower interest rates," said Robert A. Brusca, the chief economist at Nikko Securities Inc. in New York.
 
Urging That More Be Done
 Neal M. Soss, the chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said the failure of the Fed to reduce its closely watched discount rate, as it did in December and again in July, left its performance yesterday without the theatrics necessary to get convey the message that the Fed cared about the workers who have lost jobs and about those who are worried that their jobs will be the next to go.
"If the central bank is trying to reach out to Main Street, they should be more declarative," Mr. Soss said.
Now that the Fed has moved to push interest rates lower again, the immediate question is: Will the central bank cut any further? After recent reductions in the Federal funds rate, which the Federal Reserve controls and is a benchmark for other short-term rates, the immediate conclusion has generally been that the Fed was finished. Then new, pessimistic economic data would prompt speculation that the Fed would move again.
Yesterday, analysts were generally convinced that this was not the Fed's last move, although there was no consensus on whether the Fed would act again soon or would wait until the September employment report is released on Oct. 2. That report will be the last monthly jobs data released before the Presidential election on Nov. 3.
For the bond market, this could mean a continuation of the spectacular rally that began in July after the last Fed interest rate cut. Yields on the 30-year bond could even dip below 7 percent soon.
 
Fears About the Deficit
 But at the same time, the bad employment numbers make it more likely that whoever is elected President in November will try to stimulate the economy with a program of new spending and perhaps tax cuts, moves that would increase the record Federal budget deficit. Worries about that could soon begin to trouble the bond market, slowing the decline in long-term interest rates.
For the economy, a sharp decline in long-term interest rates now is more crucial than the fall in shorter-term rates. Many economists have joined the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, in bemoaning the sluggish decline in long-term rates, which are crucial to stimulating the growth in housing and construction that could lead an economic recovery.
"It is possible to have the market trade down and get close to 7 percent on the 30-year bond," said James S. Fralick, the senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "But as we get closer to the election, political anxiety will push yields back up again."

HEADLINE: Slowest Trading of Year As the Dow Drops 10.27

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices sagged yesterday in the slowest trading of the year, registering a wary response to unexpected new evidence of weakness in the economy.
Activity tapered off to a near standstill in the afternoon as investors got an early start on the long Labor Day weekend. 
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.27, to 3,281.93, finishing the week with a net gain of 14.32 points.
Declining issues held a slight edge on advances in the daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Very Light Volume
 Big Board volume came to 124.3 million shares, down from 212.5 million Thursday and the lightest total since 76.82 million were traded in a post-Thanksgiving session last Nov. 29.
The Labor Department reported yesterday morning that nonfarm payroll employment fell by 83,000 last month, rather than posting the sharp increase economists had been expecting.
Without a temporary surge from a Government summer jobs program, analysts said the drop in employment would have been even bigger.
The news was taken as a strong sign that the economy was still struggling to gather momentum as summer draws toward a close.
It sent interest rates tumbling in the credit markets as traders concluded that the Federal Reserve was moving to ease credit conditions further.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell more than 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, in some cases to below 3 percent. Prices of long-term Government bonds rose almost $10 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to around 7.28 percent.
But brokers said stock-market investors' response was more equivocal, influenced by worries about economic growth prospects.
Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose 3/4, to 49; General Motors gained 3/8, to 35 1/8; Philip Morris slipped 1/4, to 84 3/4, and I.B.M. lost 5/8, to 86.
Glaxo Holdings climbed 3/8, to 29 5/8. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended approval of the company's drug Zofran for use against post-operative nausea.
Digital Communications Associates, which warned late Thursday that its earnings for the current quarter would fall short of analysts' estimates, tumbled 3 1/2, to 15 3/4.
Bank stocks managed only a mixed showing on the drop in interest rates. J. P. Morgan rose 5/8, to 60 1/4, and Chemical Banking added 1/2, to 33 1/4, but BankAmerica lost 1/8, to 43 7/8, and Citicorp dropped 1/8, to 16 3/8.
Federal National Mortgage, or Fannie Mae, rose 1, to 66 1/2, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage, or Freddie Mac, was up 1/8 at 42 7/8.
Amerada Hess, subject of a rating downwgrade by a brokerage firm, dropped 1, to 47 3/4.
The Nasdaq composite index for the over-the-counter market slipped 1.44, to 573.44. At the American Stock Exchange, which had an abbreviated session because of a fire at a nearby building, the market value fell 0.25, to 384.85.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Unemployment Report Sends the Dollar Skidding

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most other currencies yesterday after the Labor Department released surprisingly gloomy news on unemployment and traders anticipated a cut in interest rates. Gold prices rose.
"Today's economic news was enough to make the dollar give up all the steam it got in the previous session," said Hillel Waxman, chief currency trader at the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York. 
 The Labor Department said that the nation's unemployment rate fell slightly in August, to 7.6 percent, but that employers cut 83,000 nonfarm jobs from their payrolls. A temporary summer jobs program for teen-agers helped the August unemployment rate ease, but adult joblessness worsened slightly and the economy lost thousands of key manufacturing jobs.
 
Fed Cuts Funds Rate
 In response to the report, the Federal Reserve cut its target for the Federal funds rate -- the fee commerical banks charge each other on overnight loans -- to 3 percent from 3.25 percent. The move caused little reaction in currency markets because investors had expected it after the unemployment report, traders said.
Italy raised its discount rate 1.75 points, to 15 percent, and dealers said that both the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy had intervened in currency markets to support the lira.
In New York, the dollar fell to 1.4015 German marks, from 1.4135 late Thursday. In Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.4040 marks, down from 1.4130 late Thursday. Before the Federal unemployment report, the dollar had been trading at around 1.4300 marks in Europe.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 123.15 Japanese yen, down from 123.80 late Thursday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 123.20 yen. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.15 yen, up 1.12 yen from Thursday's close.
In New York, the British pound was quoted at $1.9960, up from $1.9835 late Thursday. In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9945, up from $1.9825 late Thursday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.25075 Swiss francs, down from 1.2635; 4.7685 French francs, down from 4.8120; 1.19875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19695; 1,071.50 Italian lire, down from 1,083.
Gold prices rose worldwide.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $341.30 a troy ounce, up from $340.80 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
I.R.S. May Help Storm Victims

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
One source of relief for some of Hurricane Andrew's victims is the Internal Revenue Service.
Taxpayers who file an amended 1991 tax return claiming a casualty loss can expect a refund check within four to six weeks because President Bush declared the hard-hit sites of Florida and Louisiana a disaster area. That designation means that people who suffered losses do not have to wait until they file 1992 returns to claim them. However, many taxpayers will be severely disappointed by the size of the losses they can claim, if any. 
 "Many people presume they can take a casualty loss, but the rules eliminate 90 percent of the people I see," said Doug Stives, a member of the Federal tax division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and a partner in Curchin & Company, Red Bank, N.J. But the hurricane's devastation was so complete, he added, some people could get "money in their pockets right away if they go back and amend the '91 return."
For personal property, including a home, furnishings, car and clothing, losses can be claimed only to the extent they exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income plus $100 per occurrence. The loss itself is the lower of the taxpayer's cost basis or current market value less any reimbursement from insurance.
Jerry S. Williford of Houston, chairman of the real estate tax committee of Grant Thornton, a national accounting firm, said, "Each taxpayer's situation is going to be different," under those rules. He discussed three examples of neighbors who had homes worth $200,000 apiece before the hurricane; afterward they had only the land, valued at $40,000, and a pile of rubble.
The first neighbor bought his house in 1970 for $40,000 and had it insured for $150,000, having failed to keep pace with inflation. Although he is going to have to come up with additional money to rebuild, he has no loss for tax purposes since the insurance recovery is more than his cost basis.
The second neighbor bought her house in 1987 for $250,000 and carried replacement-cost insurance. She also has no loss for tax purposes since her insurance carrier will pay her and the mortgage holder enough to rebuild the house. The fact that the house has gone down in value is not at issue. Even if she should sell the rebuilt house for $200,000, capital losses on a personal residence are not deductible.
The third neighbor, like the second, paid $250,000, but like the first is underinsured and collects only $120,000, or $40,000 less than the loss, based on the house's pre-hurricane market value, of $160,000. Say the taxpayer's income was $50,000. The loss that can be claimed is $34,900 -- that is, $40,000 minus 10 percent of income minus $100 -- enough that the taxpayer should be able to get a refund for most or all of the taxes paid last year.
In addition to home losses, of course, many hurricane victims have big losses for other personal possessions. "People never have enough insurance," Mr. Stives said, so when they list everything that was destroyed and add up its current market value, many people may qualify for tax refunds.
Yet many who qualify may be timid about claiming refunds, fearful of the I.R.S. or fearful they have no proof because their records were lost along with everything else.
"You don't have to have proof in filing the return," Mr. Williford said. "Just come up with the best possible estimate. Technically, the I.R.S. could disallow it, but generally they're reasonable people."
In fact, he noted, proof should not be attached to the return. Taxpayers should, however, collect and keep any evidence they can like photographs or receipts in case a return is audited. That is most likely when a return claims losses that seem out of line with income or when it may be examined for other reasons like sizable deductions for medical expenses or charitable donations or unreported income.
Taxpayers should use Form 1040X to file an amended return and attach Form 4684 to list the casualty losses plus a signed statement that they are making the choice to file for 1991 because of Hurricane Andrew. Those who have not yet filed 1991 returns because they are on extension can claim the hurricane losses when they do so, Mr. Williford noted. Detailed information on claiming nonbusiness casualty losses is available in I.R.S. publication 547.
Business losses, net of insurance recovery and depreciation already taken, can be claimed in full, without the income restrictions that affect personal losses.
Many people in Florida have offices in their homes, Mr. Williford noted, so they may have both personal and business losses.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Baseball's Two-Party System

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
During the last three months, pressure from what was originally thought to be a minority of baseball owners has grown into a committed movement to force Fay Vincent's resignation as commissioner of baseball.
On Thursday the first shoe dropped when owners, meeting in Rosemont, Ill., voted by secret ballot to ask for Vincent's immediate resignation. Vincent has already said that he would never resign, so the battle will move to St. Louis on Wednesday, when the owners will reconvene, apparently with the idea of forceably removing Vincent from office. 
 The dispute between Vincent and his employers has sparked debates between fans and division among owners. If neither side gives in, the feud is very likely to instigate a legal battle that could ultimately define the ability of a private sports enterprise to hire and fire as it sees fit.
As intriguing as all of that is, however, something larger than either Vincent or the owners appears to be taking place in our game. I use "our game" not as an expression of emotion or endearment, but as acknowledgement that baseball is a vital historical possession of a country that, in a relative sense, has such a brief history. In a nation without the haunting magnificence of Europe's castles, cathedrals, synagogues and mosques, which stand as monuments to human effort and endurance, even the most mundane of institutions can be precious, and precarious.
Baseball, as it happens, is one of our most cherished cultural, social and political institutions. The history of the game offers an enlightening insight into the complex ethnic, racial and gender dynamics of our society.
When the foundation of the game changes -- as it is may well be doing at this moment with the owners trying to retrieve the power they gave the commissioner -- the shift becomes more important, historically, than whether Vincent stays or goes. A fundamental shift in baseball should prompt people to examine the reasons behind the shift.
The nation appears to have grown more conservative and less tolerant during the last eight years. According to Clifford Alexander, the former Secretary of the Army who works with baseball to improve minority hiring, the three most recent commissioners -- Peter Ueberroth, A. Bartlett Giamatti and Vincent -- have been Republicans. But ironically, they slowly transformed the office from a job primarily concerned with baseball's narrow interests to one that has focused on higher moral and ethical standards.
Of the three, it is Vincent who has most clearly articulated the notion that the commissioner should be the conscience of baseball.
What this essentially means is that the commissioner will intervene on the side of what is right and moral and in what he defines as the best interests of baseball. And that definition may not necessarily be in the owners' or the players' best interests.
Ueberroth ordered clubhouses open to all reporters regardless of gender and began the minority hiring push that exposed and swept out Al Campanis; Giamatti banned Pete Rose from baseball for gambling; Vincent banned George Steinbrenner and has prodded owners to open their front offices by hiring more minorities.
And perhaps because Vincent himself is wealthy, he felt that baseball owners with vast amounts of money needed to be prevented, or at least discouraged, from stampeding to greater riches and ego gratification at the expense of the game. The evidence has already been recorded, from the owners conspiring to avoid paying high salaries, to their locking out players from training camps.
Now the owners have arrived at a crossroads. The majority of them have apparently grown weary of Vincent's moral platform and have decided to attempt to fire him, effectively reducing him to a pitcher with a sore arm who has outlived his usefulness. They have apparently become so disenchanted that the first name mentioned as a possible successor is that of Ron Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Apparently, the national pastime, like the nation itself, is reassessing its direction and priorities. For baseball, as for the country, the bottom line is economic survival. With the collective bargaining agreement between the players and owners expiring at the end of next season and some teams in dire economic straits, a certain strain of owners feels an urgent need for a change.
Meanwhile, Vincent has vowed to fight. The smaller question is whether this is an egocentric struggle to stay in power or whether he is fighting for the right to enforce a higher conscience.
The larger question is whether the foundation of the game is changing, and what the best interests of the game really are.

HEADLINE: Credit Cards on the Rise in High Schools

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
When Saskia Herz, a 16-year-old high school student, needed to buy some expensive supplies this summer for a photography class, she didn't bring along her mother. She brought along a credit card.
"I don't use it that much," said Ms. Herz, who has had a credit card since she was 13. "Because when I do, I have to pay it back out of my allowance." 
 As millions of high school students start a new year, many of them are carrying something besides driver's permits in their wallets. A recent study by Mastercard International suggested that about 10 percent of high school juniors and seniors, or about 640,000 teen-agers, had regular access to a credit card either in their own name or that of an adult, said Gary Flood, a company spokesman.
The Mastercard study appears to be the first effort by a large issuer to determine the extent to which the credit-card culture has penetrated high schools. But there is little doubt that credit-card use by those under 18 is growing and that issuers are increasingly focusing their marketing efforts toward high schools.
"It used to be that college was the big free-for-all for new customers," said Marian Salzman, president of BKG Youth, a New York City marketing concern. "But now, the big push is to get them between 16 and 18."
 
New Programs, New Criticism
 A person under 18 cannot legally get a credit card unless a parent or other adult agrees to take financial responsibility for it. Still, over the last two years, large credit-card issuers like Mastercard, Visa and Discover have started educational programs about personal finance in thousands of high schools nationwide. Some of the programs also include mention or advertisements for their sponsors.
The new programs have attracted criticism from some consumer advocates, who argue that in trying to line up a new generation of customers, credit-card issuers are creating a new generation of debtors. About 65 percent of those who get a credit card stay with their first brand for 15 years or more, Mastercard says.
"It is outrageous for companies to go after kids in high school," said Paul Richards, education director of the National Center for Financial Education, a San Francisco advocacy group. "Young people today are being indoctrinated to spend, not save."
Spokesmen for companies like Mastercard, Visa and Discover said they were not trying to promote credit cards for those under 18 but rather to give them a grounding in basic financial management. Many college freshmen fall into serious debt soon after getting their first credit card, and ruin their credit ratings.
"We are trying to make kids more financially responsible," said Beth Metzler, a spokeswoman for Discover Card Services Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company.
The growing debate comes amid both changing economic mores and broad gaps in the type of financial information young people receive. While many teen-agers are still encouraged to save, they are increasingly the targets of marketers beseeching them to spend. And few high schools have programs that teach young people financial management.
"There is certainly a need for this type of education as there is for other life skills like how to get a job," said Lew Armistead, a spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, a professional group in Reston, Va. "But we have to balance all needs against how many minutes there are in the school day."
The programs developed by credit-card issuers have taken different forms. For the last two years, for example, Discover has sponsored an annual supplement in several magazines produced by Scholastic Inc., a high-school publisher. A recent issue of the supplement called Extra Credit included articles on holding down a part-time job, how credit works and complusive shopping by teen-agers.
The back of the supplement carried a full-page advertisement showing students in a classroom and a picture of a Discover card with the headline: "Go Ahead, We're Behind You."
 
'Choices and Decisions'
 Ernest Fleishman, the director of education for Scholastic, said that the Discover-sponsored supplements had been well received both by teachers and students. "We are very comfortable with this approach, which doesn't encourage students to purchase or not purchase credit cards," Mr. Fleishman said.
By contrast, Visa has developed a classroom teaching program about personal finance called "Choices and Decisions." Visa sells it to banks at a nominal cost, and they, in turn, distribute it to schools. The program, which does not identify Visa as its sponsor, is being used in more than 2,800 schools, said Brad Hennig, a spokesman for Visa International. Mastercard is also developing a teaching program, Mr. Flood said.
Mary Beth Butler, a spokeswoman for Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer-advocacy group in Herndon, Va., said that the group had supported educational efforts about personal finance, but she added that she feared that leaving the effort solely to card issuers might give children the wrong ideas about lenders.
"They need to know that credit-card companies are not doing them a favor but are in business to make money off them," Ms. Butler said.
 
Safer Than Cash?
 Elizabeth Herz, a Manhattan real estate broker and Saskia's mother, said she believed that credit cards were a fact of modern life and that teen-agers should learn how to use them properly. She said they were helpful in emergencies and safer for a young child than carrying cash.
"Do you want a kid walking around with $100?" Ms. Herz asked.
But some parents in smaller cities were shocked by the notion of credit-card-toting high schoolers. "My son hardly spends any money," said Nancy Seldin, a licensed school counselor in Missoula, Mont. "The things he wants to consume, like a big car, are so expensive he knows it is nuts, so he doesn't think about it."

49 PART-TIME JOBS TO BE CUT BY DELTA AIR

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines plans to lay off 49 part-time employees this month at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport as part of a systemwide plan to cut costs. The airline has told the employees their last day of work will be Sept. 15, Frances Conner, Delta spokeswoman, said. The workers stock airplanes with supplies, take tickets and handle baggage. 
In addition, an additional 300 part-time, temporary employees might be laid off at the airport, although Delta said it has not made a final decision. Delta announced in July that it would lay off temporary workers, cut benefits and freeze wages in an effort to reduce annual costs $700 million by 1995.

HEADLINE: Contrasts Mark Republican Primary for Senate

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Sept. 4

 BODY:
Connecticut's southwestern corner has produced a pair of Republican candidates for the United States Senate this year whose styles highlight contradictions within Fairfield County and, indeed, the rest of the state.
One of the candidates, Brook Johnson, makes his home in a Greenwich subdivision where the lots are sprawling and residents enter through an electronically monitored security gate. The other, Chris Burnham, lives in Stamford, a city that borders Greenwich to the east and where neighborhoods range from rows of shabby tenements to elaborate estates tucked behind stone walls. 
 For years, the ultimate insult in Stamford has been to characterize someone as being from Greenwich; at the same time, Greenwich youngsters have been known to make snide comments about "Stamford" and "welfare" in the same breath.
Mr. Johnson, a self-proclaimed "self-made man," moved to Fairfield fairly recently. He was born in Willimantic, a hardscrabble mill town in eastern Connecticut, the son of a textile worker who eventually became an executive. A graduate of public high schools and North Carolina State University, he joined the Army after college. He now plays polo in his spare time and belongs to a yacht club.
Mr. Burnham's life went in an opposite direction. Born into a middle-class family in Stamford, he graduated from the Kent School, a private boarding school in northwestern Connecticut. After college (Washington and Lee), he joined the Marines and saw active duty during the Persian Gulf war. He has said that his only asset is his golden retriever, although he does own a nonfunctioning Saab automobile that is sitting in someone else's driveway, he said.
 
Tenfold Difference in Money
 The two candidates, who will face off in a primary Sept. 15, both have business experience: Mr. Burnham, 35, is an investment banker, on leave from First Boston, and Mr. Johnson, 45, owns and runs a towel and bedding concern called C. S. Brooks, although he says he is divesting.
But otherwise their backgrounds are as different as their campaign styles. Mr. Burnham has logged two terms as a state representative and worked for a year as an intern for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., then a Republican Senator from Connecticut. Mr. Johnson has no political experience but says that is the kind of refreshing change the state needs in a senator.
Perhaps the most obvious contrast in the race is their money. Mr. Burnham has raised about $400,000 and spent slightly more than that, while Mr. Johnson has said he thinks his primary race may cost as much as $4 million and has used mostly his own money so far, aides say.
Mr. Burnham says he is running a classic grass-roots campaign, which has included walking some 150 miles through the state to talk with voters. Mr. Johnson seems to prefer meeting with groups at homes for the elderly or at factories and has spent about $400,000 on television and radio ads.
"It's a close race," said Richard Foley, Connecticut's Republican Party chairman, who, in his capacity as a state representative, voted for Mr. Johnson when the businessman won the party's endorsement at its convention in July.
 
Wooing Fickle Republicans
 Both candidates claim to be underdogs in the primary, and both insist that their efforts are aimed at a bigger goal -- unseating Christopher J. Dodd, the state's senior Senator and a two-term Democrat.
The most recent poll of Connecticut voters by the University of Connecticut Institute for Social Inquiry, conducted in late June and released in July, found that few voters had heard of either Republican candidate.
The poll reported that only one in eight people surveyed were willing to state an impression of Mr. Burnham, with roughly the same results for Mr. Johnson. About 57 percent said they would like to see Mr. Dodd re-elected.
The poll, a survey of 500 adult state residents selected at random, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
A Quinnipiac College poll of 667 registered voters released today showed similar support for Mr. Dodd, with him getting about three-fifths of the vote compared to about one-fifth for either of the Republicans.
In the primary race, the two candidates are vying for the loyalties of the state's 461,000 registered Republicans, traditionally a fickle bunch, who are deeply worried this year.
They include people like Lynn Helfer of Newtown, a mother of two who was stopped on her way into a grocery store this week by Mr. Burnham, whose name and mission were news to her. He pumped her hand and explained he was running for the Senate.
"I'm having a lot of trouble with the Republican Party's stance on issues," Mrs. Helfer, a registered Republican, said afterward, citing the opposition to abortion and the emphasis on "family values" in the national platform. "I'm worried about the state of the economy also," she added. "I know people who have been hit pretty hard by this."
 
Focus on the Economy
 The two Republicans have made turning the economy around a priority. Mr. Burnham advocates reducing the Federal deficit first, by trimming away government programs he considers unnecessary. With the savings on debt financing that such a move would mean, he says, the country would soon be on the mend.
Late last month, Mr. Johnson released a booklet titled "Blueprint for an Economic Renaissance," featuring an architect's blueprint for a residence, complete with service entrance, on the cover. He calls for enterprise zones to be set up in faltering cities like Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury and New Britain, as well as across New England. He supports additional deregulation of business in the manner of Ronald Reagan.
Today, as the candidates met for their first debate, to be televised Sunday, Mr. Burnham heatedly accused Mr. Johnson of plagiarizing his economic plan from a book on fiscal issues by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank.
"You said that you wrote that plan. I'd challenge you to show one original idea," Mr. Burnham said.
Mr. Johnson responded, "I find it interesting that you've been in this race for over a year, as you keep telling people, and you've yet to produce any plan for anyone to read."
Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Burnham favor giving investment tax credits to businesses, indexing capital gains tax rates and finding alternatives for workers in the defense industry -- long the linchpin of Connecticut's economy.
To get the state's economy moving, Mr. Johnson's ideas range from improving ports like Bridgeport and New Haven to pushing Connecticut as a home for both another minor-league baseball team (New Britain already has one, the Red Sox) and an amusement park based on Lego toys.
 
An Exchange of Charges
 Like Mr. Burnham, Mr. Johnson supports deficit reduction, beginning with a 4 percent cap on annual spending increases. He also supports the proposed Deficit Reduction Act, which would allow taxpayers to designate 10 percent of income-tax payments for debt retirement.
Both candidates support abortion rights, as does Mr. Dodd.
While the campaigns have spared voters televised mudslinging, neither Republican shrinks from a chance to take potshots at his rival.
Here is Mark Rivers, Mr. Johnson's campaign director, discussing Mr. Burnham's walk last month through parts of Connecticut: "Chris Burnham's walk across Connecticut was a sophomoric publicity stunt. The only issue he raised was which candidate had better shoes or a better pair of feet. While he was walking down the shoulder of I-95, we were visiting factories and senior-citizens homes."
And here is Mr. Burnham, on the differences between him and his opponent: "I'm very optimistic, although the race has come down to money versus message." He adds: "He has a campaign based on slick commercials. I have a campaign based on the grass roots. I believe that the people of this state will make a decision based on my message, rather than his money."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 8, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the Republican primary for the United States Senate in Connecticut misidentified the winner of the party endorsement at its convention in July. It was Chris Burnham, not Brook Johnson.

HEADLINE: 2 Women Defy History in New Hampshire Governor Race

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOOKSETT, N.H., Sept. 3

 BODY:
For many people in New Hampshire, the primary next Tuesday in the race for governor has become a tale of two women.
New Hampshire is one of only two states that have never elected a woman to either a statewide office or to Congress; Alaska is the other. But the front-runner in the Democratic primary is Deborah (Arnie) Arnesen, a 38-year-old State Representative, while in the Republican race another State Representative, Elizabeth Hager, 47, is given a chance of an upset victory. 
 Even more surprising, in a fiercely conservative state where candidates for years have taken what is known as "the pledge" not to impose a state income or sales tax, both Ms. Arnesen and Ms. Hager have made calls for a state income tax a major part of their campaigns.
Moreover, both women are advocates of the right to choose abortion. But Ms. Hager's chief opponent in the Republican primary, Steven Merrill, a former State Attorney General, has said he would propose criminal penalties for doctors who perform abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to preserve a pregnant woman's health.
 
'An Absolute Watershed'
 "It's an astonishing turn of events for New Hampshire," said Richard Winters, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, speaking of the two women's emergence and their position on taxes.
Thomas Rath, a lawyer and treasurer of the state Republican Party, said, "The governor's race has the potential to be an absolute watershed in terms of the direction of public policy in New Hampshire."
Even if both women are defeated in the primary, he said, "I don't think we can go back to the way it was before."
The race for the governorship opened up when Senator Warren B. Rudman decided not to run for re-election this fall. That opened the door for Gov. Judd Gregg, a conservative Republican, to start a campaign for his party's nomination to succeed Mr. Rudman. Mr. Gregg has repeatedly denounced attempts to institute any state income or sales tax.
 
The Recession Factor
 In large measure what has allowed Ms. Arnesen and Ms. Hager to become popular candidates in the face of the state's conservative tradition has been the recession.
For most of the 1980's New Hampshire was the fastest growing state east of the Mississippi except for Florida. But since New England's economy slumped in 1989, New Hampshire has lost nearly 10 percent of its jobs, and it has had one of the highest percentage increases in bankruptcies and welfare caseloads of any state.
These troubles have been exacerbated by New Hampshire's singular tax structure, which relies on the property tax for almost 70 percent of government revenue, three times the national average, according to state figures. Property taxes have doubled in the last four years, becoming the highest in the country, Ms. Arnesen says.
The high real estate taxes have been particularly hard on the elderly, who have homes but little income. The escalating property taxes have also touched off a crisis in the state's public schools, which get only 7 percent of their funds from the state, by far the lowest amount in the nation, making each school district almost entirely dependent on the property base of its community.
 
Tax Structure Faulted
 Enter Ms. Arnesen, a native of Brooklyn who settled in a small town near Hanover, the seat of Dartmouth College, after earning a law degree at the University of Vermont Law School. An impassioned, articulate candidate who speaks at machine-gun pace, she says she decided to run for governor because she believes the tax structure is undermining the state.
"Let's remember that in taking 'the pledge' we are not pledging not to have taxes," she told a small audience at a candidate's forum here in Hooksett, a town of 2,500 people in southern New Hampshire. "We are just pledging not to have certain taxes."
The state's current tax system, she said, "is not only bad tax policy; it is bad economic policy," penalizing elderly people and schoolchildren, making housing unaffordable and hurting some businesses, which are subject to a business profits tax.
Ms. Hager, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, offers much the same argument from the Republican side. "It's time for people in New Hampshire to face up to the facts," she said at the same forum.
 
Aid to Public Education
 She said the state budget for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, would have had a deficit of 21 percent if New Hampshire had not received a special one-time bailout from the Federal Government in reimbursements for Medicaid payments. That, Ms. Hager believes, constitutes a structural deficit that cannot be made up by the patchwork of taxes and fees the state levies on items like beer, cigarettes, hotel rooms and restaurant meals.
As remedies, Ms. Arnesen and Ms. Hager have proposed similar plans that would establish a state income tax but guarantee that 75 percent of the new revenue would be channeled back to the towns for public education, reducing property taxes in the process.
Mr. Merrill, who is strongly supported by The Manchester Union Leader, for many years the state's most influential editorial voice, has promised not to introduce an income or a sales tax. He has not indicated where he would get the money to make up the deficit, except by cutting spending.
Ms. Arnesen's strongest challenger, Norman D'Amours, a former Congressman, has also vowed to resist new taxes. A third Democratic candidate, Ned Helms, a former commissioner of the State Department of Health and Human Services, supports tax reform.
A third major Republican challenger, Edward DuPont, the president of the State Senate, is against new taxes.
There have been no published scientific polls on the governor's contests, and the candidates' private polls show that large numbers of voters are still undecided. The private polls tend to show Ms. Arnesen leading in the Democratic race and Mr. Merrill ahead in the Republican race. Some private polls indicate that Ms. Hager has been rapidly overtaking Mr. Merrill, but others put her well behind.
After listening to the candidates in Hooksett, Carl Lindblade, manager of the Red Jacket Mountainview Motor Inn, a resort hotel in North Conway, said he was impressed by both Ms. Arnesen and Ms. Hager but was still skeptical of their proposals.
"Having this debate is healthy," he said. "The tourist industry is being killed by hidden fees, which we pretend are not taxes. But I don't think the people of New Hampshire are ready for a broad-based tax. Steve Merrill taking the pledge makes people comfortable."
Still, Ms. Hager is optimistic. At another forum, she said, a man in the audience repeatedly confronted her about taxes, but after the session he approached her and said: "I'm really angry at you. I don't want an income tax in this state. But it's so clear that you're right that I'm going to support you."
Ms. Arnesen acknowledged that in the past few months the growing interest nationwide in female candidates has probably helped her and Ms. Hager. But when she began running more than a year ago, she said, "being a woman was a liability."
"Everyone felt sorry for me," she continued. "They said, 'It's too bad Arnie's not a guy -- she's so bright and articulate.' Now it's helping us."

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRAEBER

 BODY:
THE NIGHT TRAVELLERS, by Elizabeth Spencer. (Penguin, $10.) This novel takes place during the Vietnam War, but its conflicts are personal as well as political. Mary, a former dance student, is torn between the cold rationalism of her scientist mother and the romantic idealism of her husband, an activist and fugitive. Last year our reviewer, Edward Hower, found the book more "about relationships than about historical events, and this is one of its greatest strengths."
DEN OF THIEVES, by James B. Stewart. (Touchstone/ Simon & Schuster, $12.) There is street crime and there is Wall Street crime, and as different as the latter is from the former, James B. Stewart shows that it has no less power to threaten society. This book, which examines the insider-trading scandals of the 1980's, reveals how brokerage-house bad guys manipulated not only money but fundamental free-market principles in their quest -- staggering in its scope -- for ever-increasing wealth. " 'Den of Thieves' should, must be read by every American who gives a damn about this country," Michael M. Thomas said in The Book Review last year, calling it "as good a book on Wall Street as I have ever read." 
 WILL YOU PLEASE BE QUIET, PLEASE? by Raymond Carver. (Vintage Contemporaries, $10.) This edition brings back into print Raymond Carver's first short-story collection, consisting of 22 of his spare, desperate odes to working-class life. "They have been carefully shaped, shorn of ornamentation and directed away from anything that might mislead," our reviewer, Geoffrey Wolff, said in 1976. Also new in paperback is . . . WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RAYMOND CARVER, edited by Sam Halpert (Peregrine Smith/Gibbs Smith, $11.95), a series of interviews with the late author's intimates, including his first wife, Maryann, Richard Ford and Jay McInerney.
BROTHERLY LOVE, by Pete Dexter. (Penguin, $10.) In a poor neighborhood in South Philadelphia, a tragedy unfolds that our reviewer, Robert Stone, found nearly Jacobean. Peter Flood, a man indirectly responsible for the childhood death of his sister, grows up to assume the mantle of violence that grief and guilt have cast upon him. "Few writers are better at describing the ways in which bad men do evil things and forgive themselves, while good men do nothing and suffer agonies of remorse," Mr. Stone said last year.
THE STARCHED BLUE SKY OF SPAIN: And Other Memoirs, by Josephine Herbst. (Harper Perennial, $10.) Josephine Herbst (1892-1969), an author and radical, had her roots in Sioux City, Iowa, but her travels and her imagination ranged all over the world. Last year our reviewer, Alfred Kazin, described this book as her best, a "startling personal document."
STRANGE FRUIT, by Lillian Smith. (Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $10.95.) This 1944 novel, a best seller that was banned in some cities, focuses on a love affair between a black woman and a white man in 1920's Georgia. "The tragedy of the South is explicit in every line," said our reviewer, William Du Bois.
CHAIN REACTION: The Impact of Race, Rights, and Taxes on American Politics, by Thomas Byrne Edsall with Mary D. Edsall. (Norton, $10.95.) The Edsalls scrutinize America's political parties and find them both guilty: the Republicans of exploiting white middle- and working-class racial and economic fears, the Democrats of letting an activist agenda take them too far from their constituents' concerns. In The Book Review last year, David Oshinsky said that "Chain Reaction," now with a new afterword, "should be read by anyone with an interest in American politics, but it should be required reading for Democratic leaders who dream of someday winning another national election."
CITY OF THE MIND, by Penelope Lively. (Harper Perennial, $10.) Cities are the sum total not only of concrete and brick, but of the memories and impressions they leave with their citizens. Last year our reviewer, Gary Krist, compared this novel about a London architect and the crumbling edifice of his marriage to a "Proustian Baedeker, an effortless blending of geography and free association."
ALVA MYRDAL: A Daughter's Memoir, by Sissela Bok. (Merloyd Lawrence/Addison Wesley, $12.95.) Alva Myrdal (1902-86) was a wife, mother and a Nobel Peace Prize winner in an era in which it was difficult for a woman to combine family and work, much less high achievement. "Accurate, compassionate and honorable, the book itself is a record of spiritual courage," Ursula K. Le Guin said here last year.
A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA, by Robert Barnard. (Dell, $4.99.) Peter Proctor, as proper as his name sounds, uses his retirement from the British Government to unravel the decades-old murder of a colleague. Last year our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, said, "Mr. Barnard never loses control of his polished form, even as he does his pretty hatchet job on the last half-century of Conservative Party politics in England."
REMEMBERING HEAVEN'S FACE: A Moral Witness in Vietnam, by John Balaban. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $11.) Mr. Balaban, a conscientious objector, recalls his own tour in Vietnam as a member of International Voluntary Services, a group he joined as an alternative to military duty. Not surprisingly, he found the experience as scarring as that of his battlefield peers. Last year our reviewer, Doug Anderson, called this an "important book" and "a deeply moving memoir."

HEADLINE: The Cologne Challenge: Is New York's Art Monopoly Kaput?

BYLINE: By Deborah Solomon; Deborah Solomon, a frequent contributor to this magazine, is working on a biography of the artist Joseph Cornell.

 BODY:
In Cologne not long ago, a party was held at the Ludwig Museum to celebrate a new exhibition. As the guests milled for an hour or so, there was much smiling and handshaking and a clatter of German. Everyone sipped not wine or Champagne, but the local party fare -- cold drafts of Kolsch beer. Most of the guests were Cologne art collectors who are, as they say, "into contemporary." The exhibition, borrowed from their holdings, was organized as a tribute to their audacious taste.
Everything about the show was designed to provoke, most notably the cover of the catalogue. It featured a photograph by the American Cindy Sherman, a self-portrait in which the artist is posed amid assorted condoms and dildos. Despite its attempt at in-your-face outrageousness, "Art for the Home," as the show was jokingly entitled, included the usual fashionable names, and in the end seemed less to buck prevailing taste than to endorse it. 
 Like the exhibition, the Ludwig Museum itself is a reminder of the fluidity of cultural power. It was built by the city in 1986 to house the collection of Peter Ludwig, a local chocolate magnate with a hankering for America's Pop Art confections. Wandering the museum's vast, sparsely hung rooms, one finds signed soup cans and sculptured Brillo boxes and jumbo-size cartoon girls, a parade of Pop hits assembled by Ludwig in the 1960's, when American culture was king. But that moment seemed like so much lost history at the opening last May. Of the 32 artists in "Art for the Home," about half were American and half were German, a ratio that reflects as well as anything the recent upsurge of German assurance in its own art as against New York's.
The guests, too, that evening, were measuring themselves against their American counterparts. Among them was Eberhard Garnatz, a prominent collector who is also the director of Cologne's Chamber of Commerce. A large, friendly man who was wearing a loud tie designed by the artist Jean Tinguely, Garnatz shares the widespread German view that American taste is befouled by the pursuit of wealth and status. As he toured the exhibition, he observed: "In America, Frank Stella is like a Frigidaire. No collector is without one!"
WELCOME TO COLOGNE, THE city that has unexpectedly emerged as the European capital of contemporary art and, in the process, busted up the New York monopoly on painting. It isn't only Cologne art collectors who are inclined to inveigh against America; the city's art scene as a whole is consumed by a desire to surpass New York -- and the ecstatic suspicion that perhaps it already has. The rumblings first began in the early 1980's, when a group of German painters stepped into the international limelight under the rubric of Neo-Expressionism. What started as a sensation in slick Manhattan galleries went on to create a new canon in American museums, where artists like Anselm Kiefer, Georg Baselitz and Gerhard Richter have become an abiding presence. Those who keep up with contemporary art in Manhattan can sometimes feel they're viewing a skewed world map on which the only countries that exist are Germany and America.
It's hard to think of a less probable art center than Cologne, a grimy industrial metropolis on the Rhine with a population of about a million. Its previous cultural heyday was in the Middle Ages, and since the 18th century its renown has rested mainly on the perfumy water called eau de Cologne. Heavily bombed during World War II, the city was rebuilt in the 1950's with block after block of Bauhaus knockoffs that resemble nothing so much as airport hotels. Yet it is here in this architectural wasteland that the German art scene is headquartered, with its shining legends (like Richter and Sigmar Polke), cluster of young stars (like Rosemarie Trockel and Martin Kippenberger) and inevitable troupe of the merely hopeful.
It is here, too, that the German galleries are concentrated, pumping out images and ideas that have had a pivotal influence on the rest of the world's post-modernists. Much has been made of the revival of figurative painting that took hold in New York in the early 80's, after a decade of Minimalist rule. This development was spurred in large part by Germans, who since the time of Durer and anonymous Gothic carvers before him, have sought to bring the drama of real life into the cloistered world of art. At the other extreme, "appropriation," art's cynical version of the recycling movement, is also a German specialty: the concept is rooted in a loss of belief in the questing, quixotic adventure of modernism and can have no more meaning anywhere than in Germany, whose history is a monument to the absurdity of enlightened visions.
German artists are hardly unaware of the challenge they have posed to America's cultural hegemony, and they do not lack for confidence. Asked how he viewed the New York art scene, Gerhard Richter, sitting in his sprawling studio in Cologne, paused thoughtfully over his coffee. "Kaput!" he said with a chuckle. "America had such a big and great period, starting with the Abstract Expressionists and then Pop Art and then Minimal and Conceptual. Those were all American things. But you can't expect it goes and goes and goes." He made a circling motion with his hands. "You have to have a break."
Back in New York, few would disagree that American art lost some steam in the 80's. As the Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein observes, "It's hard to say who's ahead -- New York or Cologne -- but you can say that New York isn't as important as it once was." After pointing out that the German art boom might be understood as a belated discovery of artists who came of age in the 1960's, Lichtenstein added in a hopeful tone: "They're having a great period, but it'll fall off eventually."
Art is not the Olympics, and some artists feel it is philistine to keep a running tally on America's artistic standing. Frank Stella, the veteran abstract painter, is among them. "I have no interest in what America does," he told me recently. "What's important is culture and civilization, and we're all in this together." Yet when I mentioned to him that certain Germans felt their country was outpacing ours on the painting front, Stella discarded his lordly detachment. "The best art in the world is still produced in New York," he shouted into the telephone receiver. "German art is O.K. But is O.K. good enough? Vanity plays a big part in their culture. They can't be good. They have to supersede. They have to take over."
IT IS POSSIBLE, ON SOME DAYS, TO find Cologne almost picturesque. Though nearly all its buildings and distinguishing marks were damaged or demolished in bombing raids during the war, the city nonetheless has the hoary, hobbly feel of an age-old village. Its skyline is dominated by the Cologne Cathedral, a masterpiece of the Gothic whose soaring silhouette is the trademark image of the city, beaming from postcard racks and souvenir key chains all over town. The writer Heinrich Boll, a native of Cologne and a Nobel laureate, once bemoaned in an essay that prewar Cologne survives only in photographs -- and that one day "even the actual photographs will become part of a fairy tale." One might add that Cologne's prewar years, paradoxically, seem less real, less imaginable, than the medieval past that produced the cathedral, whose spires guided weary peasants homeward from the fields and beckoned pilgrims to the shrine below.
Cologne still attracts its share of wayfarers: every artist seems to have come from someplace else in Germany. Their turf is the Belgian Quarter, a maze of narrow streets where many of the city's 130 or so galleries occupy the requisite pristine white rooms. Cologne is said to have more galleries per square foot than any other city, a statistic that is difficult to prove but useful in its suggestion of a brash atmosphere. The most prestigious galleries tend to specialize in contemporary German art, and inside their precincts the usual bias against America prevails. Michael Werner, a well-known Cologne dealer who owns a second gallery in New York, insists: "Compared to European artists, American artists are like accountants." How surprising, then, that prices for contemporary German art have remained more stable in the current recession than those for contemporary American art.
The artists of Cologne are apt to practice a studied indifference toward money. There is no place they patronize that qualifies as "haute," or where the food gets much fancier than blood sausage, a ubiquitous local specialty. The city's best-known art critic is an anonymous guerrilla reviewer who voices his appraisals by spray-painting a plump yellow banana outside any gallery he recommends.
IN ITS INSISTENCE ON scruffiness, Cologne's art scene is reminiscent of a college town with everything but the college. The Walther Konig Bookshop has art tomes crammed from floor to ceiling and browsers dressed in bohemian black eternally hunched in the aisles. Across the street is the artists' main hangout, the Broadway Cafe, a smoky little hovel where the art villagers congregate to talk shop. It's no accident that the place takes its name from an American landmark; for all its impudence towards New York, Cologne remains hooked on American culture.
You find reminders on virtually every block of America's contributions to modern civilization, albeit not all of them lofty. On the Hohe strasse, the city's main shopping street, a slender woman sports a gray T-shirt emblazoned with the American television conundrum: "Who killed Laura Palmer?" At an outdoor cafe, a punk in a leather jacket hunches over a paperback copy of a John Irving novel, "Das Hotel New Hampshire." Our junk food is their junk food, down to the last M&M.
American artists fantasize about exhibiting in Cologne, the mark of an auspicious career. One afternoon, I slipped into the hushed elegance of the Jablonka Galerie, whose exhibition consisted in its entirety of five stuffed turkeys displayed on tall pedestals and variously bedecked in a tie, a sport jacket, a blindfold and American Indian headgear. These "Untitled Turkeys" (1992), as the accompanying literature scrupulously identified them, were the work of the New York art star Meyer Vaisman. Standing before them, one stood as well before the legacy of Warhol, for whom nothing was to be taken seriously except the gravely hip joke. Perhaps it was precisely America's pre-eminence in the arts that had allowed for such jesting and wanton banality. Play, after all, is premised on privilege.
How revealing, then, that so many well-known German artists are emigres from East Germany, where their rights were sorely constrained. Is totalitarianism somehow good for art, making the imagination the only safe place to hide? It's a question you can't help but consider in Germany, where most of the prominent older painters -- including Georg Baselitz, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, A. R. Penck and Markus Lupertz -- are refugees from political oppression. Much has been made of the collective German guilt that produced an artist like Anselm Kiefer, who is famous for his war-haunted confessions. Yet what needs to be said is that many German artists were caught in an additional predicament; long after Hitler was crushed and West Germany emerged as a democratic state with an enlightened cultural life, the Communist party line in East Germany still denounced modern art as a crime against the state.
Penck, for instance, whose large, clamorous canvases explore the modernist obsession with primitive art on a billboard-size scale, was stuck in East Germany until 1980. Unable to show his work publicly, he smuggled it to Cologne in rolled-up newspapers. We arrange to meet one day at a cafe, and I ask Penck, a rotund man with a long, gray beard, how an artist trapped inside a cultural void could create pictures brimming with references to Picasso and Klee. He replies succinctly: "Repression unleashes strong desires."
Gerhard Richter, perhaps the most widely respected painter in Germany, recalls the air of charged mystery surrounding modern art during his student days in Dresden in the 1950's. "Secretly we saw the catalogues and reproductions, but it was forbidden to see any work after French Impressionism," he says. "At the library whole sections were missing from the shelves. When we did look at Cezanne or Cubism, we were attracted to it, but we didn't have the knowledge to understand it."
Such a bleak predicament seems impossibly remote on this shining spring morning in Richter's studio. The place is fastidious, with paintings-in-progress hung in careful rows and the artist's materials hidden away behind labels like Papier, Tesa and Hand schuhe (paper, tape and gloves, he explains; discretion prevents me from asking why he works in gloves). Richter -- a diminutive, dark-eyed man of 60 -- wears an air of general modesty, as if none of his ideas could be of much interest to a visitor. As he sets out coffee and a tin of lacy cookies, he says: "There are two problems with this interview. One is my English. The other is that I'm not very intellectual." He shakes his head. "It's a pity."
Critics writing about Richter's work invariably remark that over the years he has shuttled restlessly between landscape, portraiture and pure abstraction, as if his very inability to settle on a style were somehow the point. Yet all styles are not equal. In defiance of the German tradition of graphic figuration -- Ernst Ludwig Kirchner with his thin, jittery bodies, Max Beckmann with his unhappy urbanites, Baselitz's upside-down men -- it is as an abstract painter that Richter has created some of the most original images of our time and wielded immense influence on other "neo-abstractionists."
A typical Richter abstract painting is easy to recognize. It's composed of shrill reds and yellows that look as if they were smeared by a giant windshield wiper, or rotated on one of those "spin art" machines found at street fairs. The work has a deliberately chilly quality; its streaks and splatters suggest a petrified version of Abstract Expressionism. Perhaps Richter is taking refuge in the post-modern plea that after the darkness of the war, conventional forms can only fail us. When I ask him if he sees his work as German, he replies with characteristic ambivalence: "I'm not interested in a German style and I don't know what it is. But whenever I see my work in another country, I think, ah, it looks a bit German. It has to do with Germany."
It can be unsettling to contemplate the speed with which a nation nowadays rises as an art power, or declines. Like brokers watching the fluctuations of the stock market, the art crowd can confidently tell you the latest -- that Barcelona and London are rapidly gaining, that Italy is fading despite an 80's surge, that French art remains irretrievably dead, entombed by academic theory. Things used to happen more slowly. From the 17th century up until World War II, Paris remained the seat of world culture. Then New York took the lead. No story in American art has been given the Hollywood treatment more than the 1940's ascent of the Abstract Expressionists, starring Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and the rest of the hard-drinking, impecunious gang who set out to topple the supremacy of Paris. Their victory was so stunning it's still prompting sour-grapes grumbling about "How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art," to borrow the title of the 1983 book by the French art historian Serge Guilbaut.
Today, in an age of mass communication and mass travel, it is sometimes said that the notion of an art capital -- one single, unstoppable fountainhead of new ideas -- is becoming anachronistic. If air travel reduces the distance between countries, it also reduces the cultural differences that constitute a reason for leaving home. More art is like other art than ever before. With German money and political power convening in a united Berlin, it is believed that city will eventually become the next new brazen center of culture. And yet surely its art scene will have the weaknesses of its strengths, the most obvious among them being a trendiness to its art. Already older German painters complain about a bland global esthetic they see overtaking the young. As Markus Lupertz tells me one morning in his dim, cluttered studio in Dusseldorf: "The same way the international food is steak and salad, the German critics, who are the stupidest people, have this idea of an international art style, and that style is conceptual art."
At 40, Rosemarie Trockel is among the celebrated young artists of Cologne who have sworn off painting in favor of a more conceptual approach. She earned her first fame in the late 1980's for "knitted paintings," blunt, rather doctrinaire creations composed from computer-made textiles. Where Trockel rises to eloquence is in her more sculptural works, like the 1989 "Untitled (Eva in Trance with Ectoplasm)," a papier-mache and plaster object depicting a not unsubtle image -- a human head oozing gunk. The piece harks back to the smooth, spare, dreaming heads of Brancusi, while rejecting his formal purity. Trockel's punctured head is a metaphor for a postwar Europe in which everyone is bruised and no one any longer believes that the modernist engagement with abstract forms can save them.
Trockel lives on the outskirts of Cologne, in a rambling red-brick building that was formerly the Edelweiss Laundromat, as a sign hanging outside attests. Stopping by one Saturday afternoon, I find her in the kitchen, a sturdy and soft-spoken blond woman picking limp strands of sauerkraut from a bowl with her fingers. "I've heard that it helps prevent cancer," she explains with a smile, leading me into the well-stocked library that adjoins her studio. There are no conventional art supplies around; the artist needs little beyond the wooden chair where she sits and thinks, since her recent creations have been fabricated in factories.
Trockel may be a lapsed painter, yet her work remains as tethered to a specific time and place as that of any of her older compatriots. Born in 1952, she was reared in the small town of Schwerte and recalls an atmosphere in which children had to live with both the sins of their parents and the uneasy hush of denial. "When I was growing up," Trockel says solemnly, "no one talked about the war. We weren't taught about it at school, and whenever it came up, the nuns would simply cry and run away. My father was in the war. I never asked him if he killed anyone, but it was always in my head: Did he or didn't he? I'd meet my uncle and think: Did he or didn't he?" She pauses, and her mouth twists into a frown. "If you can't believe in your own brother, you have to believe in art."
Fierce words, and yet fierce words are the local dialect of Cologne. Every artist has a story to tell, dolorous tales of hometowns being bombed, of paintings being banished, of life as people knew it crumbling into nothing. To younger artists like Trockel, by contrast, the single most indelible event is not World War II, but the fact that they missed it, and grew up in frustrated ignorance of the incomprehensible deeds of their elders. Listening to the countless fevered stories, it's as if the events of half a century ago had happened half a year ago. And yet what gives Cologne its distinct flavor is less the intrusion of haunting memories than the way the art galleries so prosperously market them. This is a city with inner demons for sale.
Perhaps it has always been that way in Cologne, the transcendental and the commercial existing side by side. One evening, seated at an outdoor cafe beside the cathedral, its arching spires now blue against the dusky sky, the art critic Wilfried Dickhoff explained: "In the Middle Ages, relic dealing was concentrated in Cologne. There were so many bones of holy people that the Pope closed the borders." He relayed the information in an amused tone, the implication being that Cologne has a very long history of turning the ideal into a material deal.
In discussing the rise of German art, cynics tend to dwell on the country's economic "miracle," the implication being that art is an automatic byproduct of wealth. (If this were true, Tokyo would be the Parnassus of the modern world.) However, it is incontestable that German artists have benefited from their Government's prodigious patronage. In the area of public funds for the arts, the country has little competition from the United States, whose per capita budget for cultural affairs is among the lowest in the industrialized world. In 1987, the most recent year for which such comparative statistics were compiled, Germany's arts expenditures came to $39.40 per citizen, while the United States meted out just $3.30.
It is easy to count marks and dollars, yet harder to measure the sense of mission the Germans have brought to their Kulturkampf -- the quest for cultural excellence. In America, as the National Endowment for the Arts continues to be enmeshed in controversies over the financing of sexually explicit artwork, it sometimes seems that our Federal arts officials do little but fret over questions of propriety. Meanwhile, Bonn, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Dusseldorf can all claim important new art museums, as I learn one morning in the office of Marc Scheps, a genial, sixtyish man who became the director of the Ludwig Museum last year. "Germany has been offering far more than France and Italy and Spain, more than any country in Europe," he tells me, gazing up at the Kenneth Noland painting of a target that hangs on his otherwise bare walls and echoes his invincible tone.
Perhaps nothing demonstrates the Ludwig's eagerness for world standing more than the installment of Scheps himself. The museum's new director was selected from, of all places, Israel, where he was the longtime director of the Tel Aviv Museum.
Germany's culture is notoriously decentralized. In a country where every town seems to have its own opera house, there is no single metropolis like New York where publishing, art, theater and music are all firmly centered. Before the art scene gravitated to Cologne in the early 1980's, nearby Dusseldorf was the place to be. There, Joseph Beuys, the charismatic artist-guru in his signature gray felt hat, enthralled a generation of students at the fabled Dusseldorf Academy and became "the Pied Piper of postwar German aesthetic renewal," as the critic Robert Hughes once dubbed him. Berlin, in the meantime, was the locus of the Neo-Expressionists, who sought to reconnect the thread of German Expressionism severed by the war, often with facile results; undisciplined brushwork was splashed out by the yard.
The Cologne art scene, by contrast, has historically been associated less with high-minded strivings than with simple high jinks. Here, Max Ernst and Hans Arp promulgated the shock tactics of Dadaism after World War I. But yesterday's rascal is today's blue-chip master, and the only voice of dissent nowadays heard in the galleries of Cologne belongs to collectors bemoaning the high cost of the art.
AS MINISTERS OF culture plot their strategy, as new museums rise and existing ones expand, as art dealers and critics rush to discover the latest "ism," the artists of Cologne remain loath to acknowledge any interest in the activity swirling around them. To the contrary, they like to pretend that the attention lavished on them is a miserable burden they wish would instantly evaporate. Their bohemian posturing might be understood as yet another aspect of their rivalry with New York artists, whom they tend to speak of as if they were all Madonna with a paintbrush.
Surely no one relishes his outsider status more than Sigmar Polke; at 51, he's Cologne's most worshiped art legend. He shuns publicity, avoids his own openings and can be so elusive that his friends and benefactors competitively trade ancecdotes about the lengths they have gone to find him. He and Richter were close in the 1960's, when they helped found a movement called Capitalist Realism, a homegrown strain of Pop Art, but even they don't speak anymore. I harbored little hope of meeting Polke during my visit to Cologne, yet telephoned anyway late one afternoon. Had he received my letter? "I don't read my mail," he replied brusquely. Was he willing to be interviewed? "No," he growled. Yet when I suggested a quick cup of coffee, he surprised me by agreeing, providing I could come to his studio right away. Then he added smugly: "You won't be able to find it."
Indeed, a cab ride that should have taken 10 minutes took nearly an hour, during which time it seemed increasingly plausible that the artist's invitation was instead a sardonic joke. Finally, the taxi pulled up at a squat factory building sequestered behind a chain-link fence. Polke, a thickset man in shorts and bare feet, was sitting outside with a clutch of young assistants, a 16-millimeter movie camera in his hand. As I stepped from the cab, he trained the camera on his interloper and shouted with unexpected geniality: "I knew you'd find it! New Yorkers can find anything!"
He led me into his studio, a looming, hangar-like space where a dozen new paintings were stacked up carelessly in a far corner. Though painted on sheets of cheap, see-through vinyl, they evoked an airy rococo dream, complete with vaporous mists and fluttering angels. Polke is a master at marrying images and effects that don't belong together. He was raiding art history for material long before that nervy deed acquired respectability as "appropriation," and his influence on young American artists like David Salle has been considerable.
When I raised the question of whether New York was still the international capital of art, Polke appeared baffled. "What does zis mean, art capital?" he replied. "There are some activities here, and some activities where you are, and we profit each other. Every city treats the problems of art in a special way, whether it's Cologne or New York or the Cote D'Azur in France." As he talked on, the thin light of early evening cast shadows across the gray-carpeted floor of his studio. The question of an art capital seemed suddenly beside the point. Polke's paintings were an affecting reminder that every artist draws on the art of his age to create something that will outlast him, something that stretches beyond the boundaries of time and place.
Then again, art may be larger than nations, but artists are not, as Polke himself demonstrated only minutes later. Combing through his stack of recent paintings, he pulled out a particularly lyrical work and gestured toward a section in which veils of amber pigment twist gently through space. And then taking aim at an American famed for his supple touch, he bellowed as if for all the world to hear: "Never could Willem de Kooning do this!" Clearly the race is on.

Family Values

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
INTEGRITY, COURAGE, strength" -- those were the family values as defined by Barbara Bush at the Republican convention in Houston. She added "sharing, love of God and pride in being an American." Not much controversy in that definition.
But on "family values night," as Marilyn Quayle described the session dominated by Republican women, the values took on an accusatory edge: after recalling that many in the baby boom had not "joined the counterculture" or "dodged the draft," the Vice President's wife made clear to cheering conservatives what she felt was at the center of family values: "Commitment, marriage and fidelity are not just arbitrary arrangements." 
 Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster who sought the Presidential nomination four years ago, eschewed such innuendo and slammed home the political point: "When Bill and Hillary Clinton talk about family values, they are not talking about either families or values. They are talking about a radical plan to destroy the traditional family."
We have here the G.O.P.'s political attack phrase of the 1992 campaign. When Mario Cuomo stressed the words family and values in his speech to the 1984 Democratic convention, he used them in a warmly positive sense. But this year, packaged in a single phrase, the terms are an assertion of moral traditionalism that carries an implicit charge: the other side seeks to undermine the institution of the family by taking a permissive line on (a) abortion rights, (b) homosexual rights and (c) the "character issue," code words for marital infidelity.
Sometimes pot smoking is included, but sex is most often the common denominator, and the pointing finger includes women who do not center their lives inside the home: the defeated candidate Pat Buchanan includes "radical feminist" in his angry denunciation of those who lack what he considers to be family values.
The use of family as an attributive noun in its modern sense can be traced back to the 18th century, as in Samuel Johnson's 1781 sales pitch for his dictionary: "This Lexicon . . . might become a concomitant to the Family Bible." In that decade, family man was coined, followed a generation later by family circle.
The word family is based on the Latin famulus, "servant"; in 1400, a man's servants included his wife, children and domestic help. "His family," goes a report of a 1621 Star Chamber case, "were himself and his wife and daughters, two mayds, and a man." You do not have to be a radical feminist to know that this sense has been lost. The poet John Milton first used family in the sense of "parents and children" in "Paradise Lost" in 1667, with Jesus as the head of the family of Man: "As Father of his Familie he clad/ Thir nakedness."
The family being used as the attributive, or modifying, noun today is the traditional family, by which is usually meant a father and mother (of opposite sexes), legally married, with children under 18 living at home. According to the Census Bureau, 26 percent of American households now meet these criteria.
This group is also known as the nuclear family, a coinage of the anthropologist George P. Murdock in 1949 -- "a married man and woman with their offspring" -- perhaps taken from the 1913 "nucleus-complex" discussed by the psychoanalyst Carl Jung, combining the lust of sons for mothers and lust of daughters for fathers. (How did we get here? Back to politics.) In 1966, Daniel T. Jenkins wrote of "the extended, as distinct from the nuclear, family," and Barbara Bush in 1992 used that term to expand her meaning of family: "When we speak of families, we include extended families. We mean the neighbors, even the community itself."
The earlier term for something similar to family values was social issue, a 1970 coinage by Richard M. Scammon and Ben J. Wattenberg in their seminal work, "The Real Majority." The authors argued that rather than being primarily concerned with the old bread-and-butter issue of economics, the voters were turning their attention to the drug culture, angry dissenters and changing moral standards.
Like the social issue, the term family values calls attention to a cultural rather than an economic interest, as Republicans are especially eager to do this year; the difference is that the use of family values focuses more sharply on abortion, gay rights and the pre- and extramarital activities that go under the name of playing around or hanky-panky. (Another sexual issue, harassment, is not included in most definitions of family values, presumably because it usually takes place at the office and not within plain sight of the family; besides, opposition to sexual harassment is a cause more associated with feminists and libertarians than with traditionalists.)
And now, for etymologists at least, to the jackpot question: Who is the coiner of family values in its current sense? The earliest use of the phrase I can find is in "The Education of Catholic Americans," a 1966 book by the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley and Peter H. Rossi: "Marriage and family values do show some relationship with Catholic education; however, the relationship is in most instances not a strong one." (Greeley, now also a well-known novelist, has just published "Wages of Sin," its title taken from a grammatically disagreeable line in the Book of Romans: "For the wages of sin is death.")
The first official political use of family values was in the 1976 Republican Party platform: "Divorce rates, threatened neighborhoods and schools and public scandal all create a hostile atmosphere that erodes family structures and family values."
Lexicographic Irregulars are invited to submit earlier citations; more to the point, however, is the search for the modern political operative who first sent his principal a memo about how the public can be distracted from slow economic growth by a concentration on family values. Even the most confidential White House interoffice memorandums will be accepted in this purely lexicographic quest.
The campaign theme is powerful, but it can backfire. At the Houston convention, as a score of the members of the Bush family gathered around the President and Barbara Bush to display family values in all their solidarity, the background music inexplicably chosen for this moving moment in the Astrodome was "The Best of Times" from "La Cage aux Folles," a Broadway musical that broke new ground in the straights' acceptance of homosexuality.

 BODY:
Wirth's complaint of too little Senate teamwork and too much time spent raising funds comes as no surprise to non-Beltway residents. But who set that up? Does the Senator forget that he and his party have controlled Congress for a generation? 
 He regrets not getting his environmental legislation passed, saying it is "the most fundamental issue." But could it be that there are more important national problems like education, the economy -- and even "mischievous and misconceived ideas" like balancing the budget?

HEADLINE: LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE

 BODY:
Budris's article raises an important question: Why does the West come to the aid of Russia and ignore the brave Baltic republics -- particularly Lithuania -- who faced Soviet tanks and economic blockades alone and now must contend with their renegade army, some 70,000 strong? Lithuania should be rewarded for the billions saved as a consequence of helping to end the cold war and the arms race; instead, it is being ignored at a time in its history when its hard-won independence is still so precarious. When will the West realize that the interests of these small democracies are our interests as well?

HEADLINE: How the New Charter Affects Land Use

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
DESPITE a dearth of construction in New York City, communities are feeling the impact of land-use review procedures that went into effect two years ago under the 1989 City Charter revision.
The new rules have stirred up greater land-use planning activity at the borough level. And many community board officials say they are better informed now than they were in the past about prospective changes in their neighborhoods. 
 But others complain that, without the Board of Estimate and its calendar of meetings, they can no longer be sure they will find out about important issues in time to prepare a coherent position statement.
For the most part, local leaders who felt that Charter reform would help them keep unwanted city facilities from their neighborhoods have been disappointed.
"The Charter held out false hope to communities," said Rosina K. Abramson, executive director of the Department of City Planning. "They thought they were getting a better balance of power with city government. What they got was lawyer-like amendments that complicated the process."
Under the Charter revision, all comprehensive land-use proposals, as well as changes in the city zoning law or in urban-renewal plans, must go to the City Council after a lengthy public hearing process.
Community boards must be included early in the process, when developers are "scoping out" their proposals with the Department of City Planning.
And there is a process for making the City Council the final arbiter when the City Planning Commission approves a land-use project over the opposition of a community board and a Borough President.
Moreover, the Charter requires each Borough President's office to publish a plan that incorporates the needs of each community. And under its so-called fair-share doctrine, the city government must at least consider whether communities are overburdened or underserved when city facilities are sited.
Still, the new process is in many ways less indulgent of narrow neighborhood interests than the old. Last month, the City Council approved a new incinerator to be built in the former Brooklyn Navy Yard over strong local objections.
In the Bronx, Community Board 8 can't persuade the City Planning Department to let it downzone parts of Riverdale unless it allows higher-density building on Bailey Avenue in Kingsbridge. And in the Douglaston section of Queens, civic associations are suing to overturn zoning variations that were granted to developers.
"It was a lot easier when we could appeal to the Board of Estimate," said Bernard Haber, chairman of Community Board 11, which includes Douglaston.
Land-use officials offer quite different views of the new Charter's impact. "Land use is now a much more central part of what the Borough President's office does," said Marla Simpson, Manhattan's director of land-use planning.
That idea gets a chuckle out of Marilyn Gelber, Ms. Simpson's Brooklyn counterpart, who has the title of executive assistant to the Borough President. "It's the people who favored Charter revision who perpetrate this myth that planning has increased dramatically," she said.
A ZONING squabble in which Ms. Gelber is involved underscores the rivalries that procedural revisions cannot paper over. She and Frederick Gross, the director of planning and development for Queens, have filed diametrically opposed texts for a proposed zoning revision that would restrict where the city can put future garbage-transfer stations.
His would forbid siting any noxious activities -- including garbage-transfer stations -- in any area zoned for light manufacturing. Hers would allow them on a case-by-case basis in most areas, provided they met specific performance standards.
Subsequently, Ms. Gelber withdrew her text in favor of yet a third one, put forth by Bernd Zimmermann, director of the bureau of planning and development in the Bronx. His text also stresses operational rather than locational restrictions.
"Fred's zoning text would effectively ban garbage-transfer stations in Queens and site them squarely in Brooklyn and Bronx," Ms. Gelber insists. Mr. Gross, who recently laid out a plan for making Queens a region-wide railway hub, counters: "Zoning is a development tool. You can't attract clean industry to an area with garbage stations."
Since shelters for the homeless and other often-unwanted facilites have been dropped from the city's construction plans, the practical effect of the new planning rules is seen most vividly in the way the Borough Presidents are setting priorities and spending their new, bigger budgets.
The Bronx, for example, has set up a land-use staff of nine professionals and a salary budget of about $350,000 and is trying to promote more moderate-income housing and viable businesses. Mr. Zimmermann recently got all 12 Bronx boards to petition the Mayor to move the Police Academy to Bronx Center and to approve Melrose Commons, a large-scale housing proposal.
Borough President Fernando Ferrer allocated about a quarter of his capital budget of $18 million in fiscal 1992, which ended last June 30, to subsidize thousands of new housing units, thus making housing affordable to a wider income band of the Bronx population.
The Queens office is operated with eight people and a payroll of $340,000. Queens Borough President Claire Shulman has a capital budget of $32 million this fiscal year, of which $3.25 million is earmarked for housing. Zoning is a primary focus in Queens, where a 40-person task force, with a shifting complement of community members, has been re-examining existing zoning in each neighborhood, with an eye toward lowering allowable densities in many so that their one-family character is preserved.
WITH just two people and a salary budget of about $154,000, Paul Bonfilio, Staten Island's land-use director, can do little more than keep residents apprised of their rights and of relevant projects, and try to snag the occasional lucrative project for his borough. Borough President Guy V. Molinari spent $600,000 of his $8 million capital budget on housing the elderly in fiscal 1992.
Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger has far and away the most imposing planning apparatus, with a staff of 12 and a payroll of $475,000. One of its main priorities is to alert communities early enough so that disputes over land-use projects can be resolved without suits.
The planners recently warned a Central Harlem community about a scheduled auction of six parcels of city-owned land in time for them to get use restrictions put on them. They are helping Community Board 8 on the Upper East Side put together a proposal to restrict the depth of new buildings.
And they helped get a planned shelter for people with AIDS moved from West 44th Street, where theater owners and other prominent Times Square business people opposed it, to 10th Avenue in the 20's, where the community welcomed it.
"In the old days we might not have known about the project until too late to do anything about it," said Paul Libin, producing director for Jujamcyn Theaters, which led the push for alternative siting of the shelter. Warrie L. Price, an official of Community Board 8, added: "I feel the community really gets more help and more of a voice now."
In Brooklyn, Borough President Howard Goldin, who opposed the Charter revision, has hired a land-use director, John Benguiat, and given him an assistant. But because Borough Hall's old system of specialists in education, economic policy and the like remains intact, it is difficult to cite dollars spent specifically for land- use review activities.
But some $10.3 million of the Borough President's $38 million capital budget for fiscal 1993 is allocated to such development projects as refurbishing the waterfront and industrial parks, and $4.6 million is committed to new housing.
Despite her skepticism about the new procedures, Brooklyn's Ms. Gelber is talking about running planning shows on public access stations, and videotaping a master plan for the borough. She also said that, symbolically at least, it was good that hearings on developing the site of Brighton Beach Baths -- a project that was approved in July -- were held at the Borough President's office.
"At least people are now realizing that they no longer have to run to City Hall to be heard," she said.

HEADLINE: Making the Choice: A Co-op or a Condo

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
WHEN they started looking around their Greenwich Village neighborhood for an apartment to buy last spring, Jeffrey and Victoria Connell thought they had a handle on the distinctions between co-ops and condominiums. But early in their search, an apartment they liked and could afford was scratched from their list when they discovered that the co-op had a 40 percent cash requirement.
"We were about to make a bid," said Mr. Connell, "when we found out about the 40 percent down payment requirement. We could have done it, but it would not have left us much cash for other things, like closing costs, the move or improvements in the apartment." 
 If the apartment had been in a condominium, only the Connells' mortgage lender could have dictated the cash portion of their down payment.
But co-op boards have the right to require buyers to put any amount -- even all of the purchase price -- down.
Buyers like the Connells, many of them new to the market, find the choices before them go beyond matters of price and personal taste. Before buying they must grapple with distinctions between co-ops and condominiums on matters involving monthly carrying costs, building finances and the owner's relationship to his neighbors.
While a condominium unit, for example, may carry a higher price tag than the same size co-op apartment, the difference may be illusory. Most co-op buyers take on two debts when they buy -- their own mortgage on the unit and their share of any mortgage the co-op has on its building.
There can be differences in financing the co-op or condominium purchase too. Some co-ops ask high cash payments by buyers, but it is the lender who determines the down payment in a condominium. And the cost of closing on a loan for a condominium is normally higher than for a co-op. Another distinction, which to some buyers is the most significant of all, is the control that co-op boards have over such matters as who buys in the building and whether subletting is allowed. Some co-ops charge shareholders a fee, known as the flip tax, when they sell their apartments. Although this cost, which for most co-ops is between 2 and 4 percent of the sale price, is the seller's responsibility, it does factor into the price. It is a cost most condominium sellers do not pay.
And co-op and condominium apartments in the same size category can vary widely. A two-bedroom co-op in a luxury-level prewar building is often a six-room residence and includes a formal dining room and full foyer. By contrast, only the most luxuriously spacious two-bedroom apartments in new condominium towers have full dining rooms. Many lack full foyers or entry halls.
ROSE EDWARDS, a real estate broker in Manhattan, said the new wave of buyers is carefully scrutinizing the purchase process. While the market's skid has given buyers a break in prices, it has also made for more cautious consumers.
"The difference is that buyers are much more conscious of what they need to know before they buy," said Ms. Edwards, whose real estate brokerage company, Walscott Company, specializes in Greenwich Village, Chelsea and SoHo listings.
"They know that they must buy for the long-term," she said. "They don't have the crutch of being able to sell easily if the financial burden is too great or their apartment is not what they wanted."
Realtors say this is a stark contrast to the mid-80's, when many buyers just wanted to know how much an apartment cost and, if it was in a co-op building, whether the board was going to let them in.
The drop in prices and the market slide of the late 80's, which took some converted co-op buildings to the brink of failure, left an impression on many buyers.
John and Lisa Bendik, for example, said they didn't avoid co-ops but they carefully scrutinized the finances of the buildings they considered.
"I had some ideas about wanting things like lots of windows and a building where I didn't have to depend on an elevator," said Lisa Bendik. "But what was most important to us when we looked at co-ops was the level of risk in the ownership."
The Bendiks said each apartment they considered passed or failed on such matters as the building's tax status, the age and amount of any temporary tax benefits, the condition of the mechanical components and the size of the building's mortgage in proportion to the number of units, and the proportion of shares held by owner-occupants as opposed to non-occupying owners, including the conversion sponsor.
They settled on an East Village co-op that is 100 percent owner-occupied.
"It was important for us that everyone in the building be owners," Mrs. Bendik said. "With only 20 apartments there is not much room for financial problems."
If the Connells do buy an apartment, they will join about 480,000 co-op or 80,000 condominium owners in New York City. Apartment ownership became an option for many of those owners only in the 70's, when large-scale conversion of rental buildings began.
Until then the vast majority of New Yorkers were renters. The few co-op apartment buildings were either luxury-level prewar buildings, mostly on Fifth and Park Avenues, or limited-equity co-ops built for middle-income residents under the state's Mitchell-Lama program or the earlier Section 213 Federal program after World War II.
The co-op movement gathered speed when landlords, weary of the restriction of the rent regulation system, started selling their buildings to the tenants or to conversion specialists. Another boost came in 1971 when the state Legislature allowed banks and other lenders to offer co-op loans.
Before 1982, landlords were required by law to have sales agreements with the tenants in 35 percent of the apartments before a conversion from rental could take place. Under these so-called eviction plans, the sponsors were not required to offer lease renewals to stabilized tenants after the conversion.
In 1982, the co-op and condominium conversion laws were revised and non-eviction plans came into widespread use. They allowed sponsors to convert buildings with as few as 15 percent of the units sold, but nonbuying tenants were assured of the right to a lease renewal under rent stabilization.
The new rules also increased the percentage of required sales for eviction plans to become effective -- to 51 percent of the units in the building from 35 percent. Noneviction plans made the conversion process easier for owners and became the conversion method of choice for most sponsors.
The first high-rise condominium in New York, the St. Tropez at 340 East 64th Street, was built in 1964. For years it stood alone. But at about the same time the conversion movement was taking root, the pace of development of new high-rise residential buildings quickened. By the early 80's, most of the new construction of luxury-level housing was for condominium ownership.
Co-op housing is an arrangement in which members hold shares in a single ownership corporation rather than a deed to an individual unit, as in a condominium. The shares are proportional to the size and other characteristics of their apartment.
The shareholders also hold a proprietary lease from the corporation for the use of their apartment. As the name implies, the co-op was originally looked upon as a cooperative living arrangement, and the original ones were formed by people who had something in common, perhaps membership in a union that set up the corporation and ran the property from the start.
Every owner pays his share of the operating costs for building upkeep, services, staff salaries, management fees, taxes and any mortgage on the building -- through monthly charges known as the maintenance fee. Each apartment owner's monthly maintenance fee is based how many shares are assigned to the apartment he or she occupies.
A large chunk of the expense for many co-ops is the building's mortgage. Co-op shareholders are entitled to take tax deductions for their share of the interest portion of their building's underlying mortgages.
A co-op's business and management chores are handled by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. Co-op boards have the right to reject applicants without giving reasons as long as discrimination is not based on race, creed, color, age, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin or because of a disability. Real estate brokers and boards are reluctant to discuss it, but discrimination in housing is still widely considered to be a factor in the New York City co-op market.
Co-op board members, who are also residents of the building, serve in a voluntary capacity, so all but very small co-ops hire professional management companies to handle the day-to-day responsibilities.
Co-op ownership is a more comfortable fit for owners willing to take on shared responsibility of maintaining their buildings. It is an ownership style that appeals to the Connells.
"I realize that it limits you on things like subletting and what you can do with your own space," said Mr. Connell. "But I like the idea of shared responsibility that comes with owning a co-op. I would rather own in a building where people can't come and go as they please."
While the Connells would prefer to live in a prewar, co-op building, they have broadened their search to include apartments for sale in buildings like 299 west 12th Street, among the few prewar buildings converted to condominium rather than a co-op.
Owners of condominiums have more in common with homeowners than they do with co-op shareholders. Unlike co-op owners, they hold titles to their individual apartments and pay their own real estate taxes.
IN general, a condominium unit owner is free to rent or sell without approval of the board. A board of managers can block a sale only by exercising its right of first refusal to buy the apartment.
While condominium owners have the right to rent out their apartments, condominium managements can charge the owner a fee for the privilege. Sometimes the fees are so high that owners find the right is not worth the economic burden it carries.
Ms. Rothman, of the Council of New York Cooperatives, a 17-year-old nonprofit advocacy organization for co-op and condominium buildings, said that in some respects the lines between co-ops and condominiums are blurring.
"Some people originally chose condominiums over co-ops because of the greater freedom that they offer," said Ms. Rothman. "But in recent years, many condominiums have tightened their rules in order to have more control over the comings and goings of residents.
"At the same time, the tough economic times have made some co-ops re-examine and in some cases liberalize their policies on things like subletting in order to accommodate owners in a difficult market."
Some condominiums have taken a firmer hand in controlling residency in their buildings by screening subtenants.
The common charges for a unit owner covers the cost of building maintenance of common spaces like lobby, corridors and driveways, systems and services and land. Monthly carrying charges can be lower than they are for owners of co-op apartments of comparable size because there is no building mortgage to pay.
But not owning property in common does have its drawbacks. When a condominium building needs cash for repairs, there is no property to borrow against. If the building's reserve fund cannot cover the costs, each unit owner must be assessed for the expense.
Georgia Asher, a broker with Wells & Gay Stribling & Associates, a brokerage company in Manhattan, said that the common charges and fees in some condominium are beginning to catch up to co-op maintenance charges, which in the past were usually higher than condominium fees.
"Some condominiums built in the late 70's and early 80's are beginning to require expensive maintenance work," she said. "These repairs must come out of the pockets of unit owners, because condominiums cannot take out mortgages to cover theses kinds of costs."
Most buyers of brand new condominium apartments got substantial breaks in their taxes in the early years of ownership because of the tax benefits granted to the developers of their buildings. But tax bills on newly built condominiums have increased in the past few years as those benefits have gradually expired.
The condominium's business is handled by a board of managers, also elected by the unit owners. But this body has less control and authority over the individual unit owners than do the boards in co-op buildings.
Even though local lenders have been giving both condominium and co-op loans since 1971, mortgage brokers say most banks would still rather see condominium buyers than applicants seeking co-op loans.
"Condominium loans are viewed as less risky," said Margaret Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services, a mortgage brokerage company based in Manhattan. "They are a more securable asset than co-op shares. Because of the trouble in some buildings a few years ago, some lenders have withdrawn from the co-op market entirely."
Haunted by a wave of financial troubles that washed over some of the city's converted co-op in the late 80's, and uneasy over slow sales at the low end of the market, many lenders are declining to take the risk of writing mortgages on some types of co-op apartments.
Even though widespread default and failures never occurred, lenders have remained timid.
The turnoff for banks remains apartments in co-ops where fewer than 50 or 60 percent of the residents own their apartments as well as small apartments like studios, units in walk-up buildings and residence in buildings with fewer than 10 apartments.
Mrs. Scott said that some banks are getting finicky about the level of investment owners in condominiums.
"It is the same nervousness they have about lending to people who have second homes," said Mrs. Scott. "If the owners of investment properties get into trouble, they usually payoff their own mortgages and let the mortgage on the investment property go. If too many investment owners in a condominium fall behind, it could weaken the value of other owners in the building."
Many co-op have down payment requirements that go well beyond the 20 percent that lenders require. It is not unusual for a co-op to expect buyers to pay 40 to 50 percent of the purchase price in cash. There are some buildings, mostly on the Upper East Side, that require buyers to pay for their new homes in cash.
BUYERS, even those with the resources to pay cash, sometimes circumvent the requirement by taking out personal loans, rather than mortgages. When this is done it is not the co-op shares, but other assets that are used as collateral for the loans.
But while condominium buyers may have an easier time getting a loan, they usually need more cash up front for closing costs.
Co-op buyers escape such closing expenses as the cost of the title search, which insures that an owner has the right to sell a property and that there are no judgments against or liens against the property. In New York City the mortgage recording tax is 2 percent of the loan value. Of that, the buyer pays 87.5 percent and the bank pays the rest.
Rather than paying for a title search, co-op buyers pay what is known as a U.C.C. fee. It refers to the search, required by the Uniform Commercial Code, which validates the ownership of stock certificates. The cost is ususally less than $100.
Another closing cost for condominium buyers can be the prepayment of the property tax that some lenders require.
Both co-op and condominium owners are at risk when a significant number of other owners in their buildings fall behind in maintenance payments or common fees.
"It is even more important that a condominium keep a tight rein on arrearages," said Ms. Rothman of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "Because in a condominium if an owner fails to pay common fees and the mortgage, the bank's rights have priority over the condominium's in any claim to the unit."
In a co-op, a corporation's rights to back maintenance would come before a bank's claim.

HEADLINE: Talking: Parental Aid;
Lenders Relaxing The Rules

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
ALONG with a college education, parents are increasingly providing their children with the down payment, and sometimes the closing costs, on a first home.
A Chicago Title and Trust survey released this year suggests that up to 12 percent of first-time buyers get this benefit, up from 8.8 percent in 1989. Even with the decline in home prices generally, meeting the cash requirements of a purchase is still difficult for many young people. 
 The customary 20 percent down payment on a $100,000 home, plus closing costs, would normally require $26,000 in cash just to get through the door.
So it is hardly surprising that even among families with modest incomes "parents have become a significant factor," said Diane Campbell, director of one-family programs at the New Jersey Housing Finance Agency, which helps first-time buyers. It is not unusual, she said, for parents to put up $30,000.
The lenders themselves have often made it easier for parents to participate. Some find ways to let the children borrow 100 percent of the price by accepting a guarantee from the parent, instead of cash, for the down payment. And they are no longer so concerned when down-payment cash comes from parents rather than the children, the borrowers. Until about two years ago, said Mercy Valles, assistant branch manager at the Hackensack, N.J., headquarters of Globe Mortgage, lenders were more insistent that the buyers contribute some of their personal savings.
The new "Parent Power" program of Merrill Lynch Credit Corporation, available since May in five states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, lets a first-time buyer finance 100 percent of the purchase price if the parents or other close relatives guarantee 30 percent of that amount.
They can do so in two ways. One is to open a brokerage account with any Merrill Lynch office, placing stocks, bonds or mutual funds into the account to equal the 30 percent. A further 30 percent of the 30 percent must also be deposited to allow for fluctuations in the portfolio's value. The total, for example, would be $39,000 on a $100,000 home.
This was the route chosen this spring by Philip and Dorothy Brown, retired educators of Pioneer, Calif., who were eager to help a daughter and son-in-law.
"What I liked was that it wasn't costing me anything," said Mr. Brown. "All I had to do was take a portion of my existing portfolio and put it into a special account. I could still trade. I can even withdraw any profits. And as they've both got good jobs I didn't even see it as much of a risk."
Alternatively, the parents could have collateralized the amount by opening a home equity line of credit and pledging an amount equal to the 30 percent, which would not be drawn upon unless the child defaulted.
But once again, the line of credit would have had to be taken out with Merrill Lynch (although other companies may soon offer the same sort of plans). In addition, a further 10 percent of the 30 percent -- for a grand total of $33,000 for a $100,000 home -- would have been required to provide a cushion against any adverse dip in the home's value. Under the Merrill Lynch plan the parents must also pay an annual maintenance fee of 2 percent on the pledged amount.
The guarantee is lifted when the loan has been paid down to 70 percent of value, upon sale or after seven years if a new appraisal shows the loan then represents no more than 70 percent of current value.
Michael Johnston, chairman of Merrill Lynch Credit Corporation, headquartered in Sarasota, Fla., said the program was devised because the company's securities brokers had been watching with concern as an increasing number of clients like the Browns were being forced to liquidate their assets to provide their children with a down payment, thereby diluting their own asset base.
SINCE late 1990 the Dime Savings Bank of New York and some other banks have let first-time buyers finance 100 percent of the price if a relative or employer puts 20 percent of the total on deposit in a certificate of deposit at any branch.
The amount may not include funds already set aside in a retirement plan, like a Keogh or an I.R.A., because Federal law prohibits such use. And it cannot be removed until the loan has been paid down to 80 percent of value, or a new appraisal shows that the outstanding balance has fallen to under 80 percent.
"I felt better because my parents were not actually giving me the money," recalled Barry Driesman, a 31-year-old lawyer who bought his first home -- a $30,000 studio apartment in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn -- last year, using this formula.
But a word of caution. William Selsberg, a real estate lawyer in Stamford, Conn., says too many parents take the guarantees too lightly. They don't consider, he said, that such a guarantee could limit their own future borrowing. Nor do they truly believe the young people might default or have to get out at a loss, thus having to draw upon the pledged sum.
"Anything can happen in an economy like this," he warned.
A further push to make first-time mortgage loans more parent-friendly has come from the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Government-chartered organization that buys loans from local lenders and sets lending standards.
In April 1991, the agency started what it calls its Community Home Buyers' Program. Serving 13,000 purchasers to date, it lets first-time buyers whose household earnings fall below 115 percent of median area income have an outsider -- not necessarily a relative -- contribute two-fifths of the 5 percent minimum needed for the down payment.
Formerly, anyone using its 5 percent-down program had to provide the full 5 percent himself. And the source of that 5 percent was scrutinized to make sure it was indeed the young person's money.
The fear was that unless the buyers contributed at least some of their own earnings they would be more likely to default, said Bonnie O'Dell, director of consumer information at Fannie Mae. This concern has now given way to a more pressing fear that people in lower income brackets might not otherwise own a home.
Finally, some general tips can be gleaned from walking into any office of Weichert Realtors -- they operate in eight states along the Eastern Seaboard including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- and picking up a free copy of their booklet "How to Help Your Kids Buy a Home."

HEADLINE: Q AND A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Refinancing for a Co-op
Question: My owner-occupied, five-unit brownstone co-op is facing a balloon payment on the mortgage next January. The underlying mortgage is $115,000. We would like to refinance the loan for a 15-year term. 
 Although the building is worth at least 10 times the mortgage amount, we are having a hard time finding a bank willing to finance our mortgage. Are there any institutions that will extend mortgages to buildings like ours? . . . Benjamin Hamilton, Manhattan
 Answer: Yes, but not many. It is often difficult for small co-ops to find lenders willing to refinance their underlying mortgages when they are less than $500,000 because banks do not find them profitable.
The National Cooperative Bank is one lender that will make loans to small co-ops like yours, but it offers only 10-year loans to buildings your size.
According to Paulette Bonanno, vice president of the National Cooperative Bank, its minimum loan for co-op buildings is $100,000, and it will consider mortgages for co-ops with five or more units. Ms. Bonanno said key factors in the consideration of any application would be the co-op's owner-occupancy level, the building's condition and value and the corporation's financial viability.
Ms. Bonanno said that a 15-year loan for a building your size would not only be hard to get, but may also not offer the best flexibility. A 15-year loan would probably come with prepayment prohibitions, Ms. Bonanno said, and a long mortgage commitment could be a problem if the building needed to raise cash for something like a major improvement or repair job.
The number of the National Cooperative Bank's New York office is (212) 08-0880.
 
Co-op Rent Pass-Alongs
 Question: I own a rent-controlled co-op apartment in Manhattan. The rent charged to my tenant has always been within the guidelines established for rent-controlled tenants.
For the last several years, the co-op board has made assessments for building improvements. Can I pass these costs along to my tenant? . . . Michael Drexler Manhattan
Answer: Maybe. There is a mechanism that allows investor-owners of co-op or condominium apartments with rent-regulated tenants to pass the costs of major capital improvements along to the tenants under certain circumstances. According to Joseph D'Agosta, acting deputy commissioner of rent administration for the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, any assessment costs passed on to tenants can only be for improvements that qualify as major capital improvements as determined by his agency. The improvements would have to be for a new installation as opposed to a repair of old equipment or building feature. Among the improvements where an increase would be justified would be a new boiler, roof or windows.
Any increase would have to be approved by the housing agency. You would not be able to make the application on your apartment alone. The application for the M.C.I. increase would have to be made by either by the sponsor or the co-op's board of directors or jointly by the shareholders.
 
Garbage-Truck Noise
Question: I live in a neighborhood that is both residential and commercial. After business hours the neighborhood is very quiet until 10 or 11 P.M., when garbage trucks arrive to collect refuse from private businesses. The noise is disturbingly loud. Do I have any recourse in stopping this nuisance? . . . Joshua Kimerling, Manhattan.
Answer: No. there are no city regulations restricting the time that garbage may be collected. Not all collections are made in the middle of the night. But city sanitation trucks and private carters need to make pickups at times when there is little traffic congestion.
The city does have standards that limit the level of persistent noise, such as loud music or construction equipment. If the garbage collectors play music, yell or toss cans around, you might bring it to the attention of the carting company or the Department of Environmental Protection.

HEADLINE: Education Cutbacks Arouse Barrage of Complaints

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
AS the 1992-93 New Jersey public school term opens this week, the focus is not on the classroom but in the courts and the State Legislature, where the fate of New Jersey's new system of financing public education is being determined.
All across the state, in urban, suburban and rural school districts alike, parents and educators are complaining of cutbacks in educational programs. 
 Lawyers representing 30 of the state's poorest districts went to court in July to seek more funds. Dr. Kenneth Hall, Superintendent of the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District, says that middle-class districts like his "are really in very deep trouble." And 60 mostly wealthy districts have joined in an effort to lobby for funds.
Last month, the Republican leadership of the Legislature added to the uproar by announcing plans to trim increases to urban school districts while adding an extra $200 million for middle-class districts. The Legislature has determined to dismantle the financing system Gov. Jim Florio created in 1990 and replace it with a version of its own by next year.
This is the second year of implementation of the Quality Education Act, the state's financing formula, and neither school districts nor taxpayers who absorbed the largest tax increase in state history to pay for it are very happy.
 
Criticism From the Start
 The law was the Florio administration's answer to a 1990 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that held that spending in poor school districts must be raised to the level of wealthier ones. From the start, there has been a frenzy of criticism from educators who say that the financing formula is not generating enough resources and that they are being squeezed by increasing costs over which they have no control, and from taxpayers outraged by what they perceive to be out-of-control education costs.
Taxpayers point out that New Jersey leads the nation in education spending: an average of $9,940 a student in 1991-92, compared with $5,452 nationally, according to the National Education Association's most recent statistics. This year a record $4.6 billion in state aid -- more than 30 percent of the entire state budget -- is earmarked for education, and 455 of New Jersey's 593 operating school districts will be seeing increases in aid.
But last month, the Center for Government Services at Rutgers University issued a report suggesting that New Jersey could spend much more on education. Based upon its residents' per capita income, the report said, New Jersey ranks 39th among the 50 states.
The lawsuit filed by the 30 urban school districts challenged the Quality Education Act in New Jersey Superior Court, arguing that poor districts will still be hundreds of millions of dollars behind wealthier ones in three years.
In one of the districts, Jersey City, school officials say a $25 million increase in state aid this year will finance expansion of early childhood education and computer programs and the introduction of an accelerated elementary school art and science program, but not two new school buildings, a summer school program or a reduction in elementary school class size, as had been hoped. Elementary classes now average 25 students.
Trenton's $17 million increase will permit the district to begin an after-school program for disruptive students, but plans for a separate school building for them have been at least temporarily scrapped, and a program to place experienced teachers in each of its 18 elementary schools to serve as mentors for other teachers has been scaled back. Instead, six teachers will rotate among the schools.
The education act was intended to go beyond the Supreme Court mandate by increasing state aid to middle-class communities as well. But a number of these districts have found that they are coming up short this year.
"Three years ago, 42 percent of the money to support our schools came from the state," said Dr. Hall of the Matawan-Aberdeen district. "Next year it will be less than 20 percent. That's a tremendous shift in burden."
With a property tax rate that is now 63 percent above the state average, Matawan-Aberdeen has still had to cut its staff by more than 10 percent, increase class sizes and eliminate one-quarter of its high school's electives in the last two years, Dr. Hall said.
 
Bill Is Introduced
 A legislative bill has been introduced to increase school aid to high-taxing middle-class districts, but Dr. Hall said it was "highly unlikely" any help would come before next year.
"These districts are really in very deep trouble," he said. "A lot of them had to reduce budgets, cut staff and budget under their cap for spending, which means they are going to be hurt next year by a reduction in cap. Next year will be a disaster."
As part of the education act, the state has imposed local school budget caps to control the growth of education costs in an effort to limit local property tax increases. The law also calls for the phase-out of state support for regular education programs in wealthy districts over four years beginning this year.
More so than the loss of this aid, though, it is the budget caps that are causing problems for school officials in these areas. Districts can receive waivers on caps, but voters have to approve the action first, and they often view such expenditures as excessive. In April, more than half of the requests for cap waivers were rejected.
 
Cuts Made in Madison Programs Eliminated
 In wealthy Madison, a 5.6 percent cap on budget growth, in addition to the gradual elimination of $300,000 yearly in state aid, has forced school officials to cut staff positions, increase class sizes and eliminate home economics and behind-the-wheel driver's education.
"It's the first time in anyone's memory that we've had to cut programs within the Madison schools," said Dr. Lawrence Feinsod, the Superintendent. "You may say, well, inflation is 4.5 percent, but then I'll say to you, do something about special education costs that are going up about 10 percent a year, and insurance costs that are going up 18 percent a year, and a whole lot of other areas over which we have no control."
Once largely above the political fray, New Jersey's wealthy school districts are beginning to lobby, both collectively and individually, for changes in the act. In one such effort, 60 mostly wealthy districts have formed the Garden State Coalition of Schools and are paying $500 dues for an administrator who will also serve as a lobbyist.
"This is my 18th year as a Superintendent, and I've never seen my colleagues so involved in the political arena," Dr. Feinsod said. "We believe that equity should be achieved by improving poor education and not by diminishing quality educational opportunities for kids by eliminating programs."
 
Spending Tied to Programs
 The Quality Education Act was signed into law by Governor Florio within 20 days of its introduction in the spring of 1990. This month Republican legislative leaders are expected to reveal the specifics of a new plan that would distribute more of the aid on the basis of programs, rather than in lump sums of money for school districts to spend as they see fit.
Under that plan, aid to urban school districts would be reduced while middle-class districts would see a $200 million increase.
"We can't keep in place the present formula because it will bankrupt the schools first, and then eventually the state," said State Senator John H. Ewing, Republican of Bedminster and chairman of the Senate Education Committee. "It's never been proven that money does the job, and therefore to say parity in funding is just not right. There should be parity in terms of what is offered to the child."
It was to get around the Supreme Court mandate of equal spending that Mr. Ewing co-sponsored legislation last spring that would remove language from the State Constitution that formed the foundation of the court's opinion. The possible elimination of the constitutional guarantee of a "thorough and efficient" education for all New Jersey schoolchildren, in place for more than 100 years, ran into such fierce opposition from educational organizations that the bill has been dropped, although Mr. Ewing said it might be reintroduced with some changes later this year.
"People seem to be yelling and screaming and kicking their feet about the words 'thorough' and 'efficient,' " he said, "although no one has ever defined it, and I don't think any one of the judges could define it."
 
Teacher Pension Costs
 Republican legislators have also promised amendments to overturn a provision in the education act that would shift teacher pension and Social Security costs from the state to local districts. As the law stands now, districts will start having to assume the $693 million responsibility for the next school year.
But that possibility seems to be increasingly remote, as support for the transfer erodes. In a significant defection, Marilyn Morheuser, lawyer for the 30 districts that are challenging the education act in court, said in July that she was dropping the contention that state payment of pension costs was unconstitutional since wealthy districts received more aid than poorer ones in that they had more teachers and higher salaries. In explaining her change of mind, she said it was more important for various education interest groups, most of whom oppose the switch, to stay united.
Proponents of a locally based pension system say school boards would have more incentive to keep salary increases to a minimum. The weak economy may be doing that anyway, as recent salary increases have been averaging less than 7 percent, down from a high of more than 9 percent in the 1980's.
 
Issue of Regionalization
 In another effort to ward off judicial interference in school affairs, State Senator Gerald Cardinale, Republican of Demarest, has introduced a constitutional amendment that would prohibit forced regionalization under any circumstance, including a court order. The bill, which has been attacked by civil rights groups as racist, is in response to a recent effort by the Englewood Board of Education to merge its predominantly black Dwight Morrow High School with Tenafly High School, where 2 percent of the students are black or Hispanic.
There are other calls to consolidate New Jersey's 593 school districts as a way to cut down on administrative costs and strengthen educational programs. In February, the Quality Education Commission, a group appointed by Governor Florio to study the education act, recommended that there be fewer than 100 school districts by the year 2000, a move that is considered unlikely given New Jersey's strong allegiance to home rule. The chief targets would be the 65 percent of the state's school districts without a kindergarten to 12th grade curriculum, or those enrolling fewer than 2,500 students.
In more moderate positions, the State Department of Education and the Assembly minority leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr., Democrat of Bayonne, are each proposing to encourage voluntary regionalization through financial incentives. Despite decades of discussion on the advantages of regionalization and dozens of studies commissioned by school districts to consolidate, only two, Chatham Township and Chatham Borough, have merged in the last 10 years.
 
Teacher Tenure
 In another area, there are signs that teachers' staunch resistance to changes in the tenure laws may be softening. While the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union, refuses to endorse any specific proposal at this point, association officials concede that their attitude is more open.
"Yes, it probably is," said Karen Joseph, spokeswoman for the union. "So much has changed. It doesn't mean that we'll come out in agreement when all is said and done, but we're open to discussions."
It is unlikely, though, that the union would go so far as to embrace the elimination of tenure altogether and substitution of renewable contracts in much the same way superintendents are now hired, as the New Jersey School Boards Association is advocating.
 
Commissioner's Agenda
 Last year the State Commissioner of Education, Dr. John Ellis, was calling for a longer school year and tougher curriculums, but there is little talk of such things these days in the midst of New Jersey's preoccupation with revision of the education act.
Dr. Ellis said he, too, would like to modify the act, particularly to end districts' uncertainty as to how much aid they receive, and also to see that the law doesn't diminish the quality of education in wealthier districts. As a start, he said, he would like to stretch out the time that general education aid to these districts is phased out, and also to expand what is known as categorical aid, which is distributed on a per-pupil basis regardless of a district's wealth.
"We can do some small changes that will be helpful," he said, "but it's going to take a year or more of thorough study and involvement with the Legislature to really rework the formula to be politically acceptable and pass muster with the courts."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: Eugene M. Haring;
How the Practice of Law Has Changed

 BODY:
IN his small 14th-floor office in the Gateway Center, behind a barren, polished leather-topped desk, sat Eugene M. Haring, 65 years old, looking more like a mischievous, crackly-eyed grandfather than the senior partner of New Jersey's oldest and largest law firm.
Mr. Haring has silver hair, a deep, soothing voice and a genial smile that seems to involve nearly every line and muscle in his face. He has worked for the Newark law firm of McCarter & English since 1953, when he was hired as a summer clerk. 
 The firm had 15 lawyers at the time. It now has 200 lawyers and 300 administrative employees.
 Mr. Haring grew up in Summit. After serving in the Marines just after World War II, he attended Princeton University, graduating summa cum laude, in 1949, and went on to the Harvard Law School. McCarter & English was his first job thereafter, and he has never looked back.
Mr. Haring lives in Princeton with his wife, Janet.
In an interview, he discussed the changes that have swept through the practice of law over the last four decades, not all of which have been to his liking.
Q. Why doesn't the senior partner of the state's largest law firm have a bigger office? And how come your desk is so clean?
A. When we moved here four years ago, we decided we didn't need any offices bigger than this. Lawyers don't really need big offices. But we do have lots and lots of conference rooms.
My desk is clean because I like a clean desk. And because I knew you were coming.
Q. Why did you take a job with McCarter & English when they were only paying $50 a month?
A. To be paid $50 a month as a clerk was good -- a lot of firms weren't paying anything. And I was impressed with the firm because even though I only wanted a job as a summer law clerk, every partner interviewed me. When I got out of law school, they started me at $4,000 a year.
Q. What do the highest-paid partners at the firm now get paid for their time?
A. Around $285 to $300 an hour.
Q. Has the recession hurt your firm?
A. Not really. Our practice is very diverse and spread over a spectrum of different kinds of problems and different kinds of clients. Our clients are not only from New Jersey, they're from all over the country, and with that kind of diversity we have not felt the effects of the recession all that much. Actually, it increases your bankruptcy work.
Q. What do you do as senior partner?
A. What I do is preside at meetings of the executive committee, which occur once a week, and I preside at meetings of the firm. I deal with our administrative people and with the other partners.
Q. Do you do any lawyering?
A. Yes, but not to the degree I used to. If there's a case that I'm expected to argue in court or on appeal, I'm involved in it day to day. But most times I'm only involved at points in a case when decisions have to be made.
Q. What about paralegals?
A. In the 60's we had maybe one or two; now we have 40 or 50. Paralegals do work that requires intelligence and some expertise but that does not require a law degree or experience in the courtroom. We also have other professionals such as nurses and a psychologist on staff.
Q. How do they fit into a law firm?
A. They analyze the vast amount of evidence and documents that are used in some of the cases we have -- like the mass toxic tort cases involving asbestos or pharmaceuticals.
Q. What is the biggest difference you've seen in the practice of law since you started?
A. When I started, most lawyers were generalists. In fact, the one test of whether we wanted to make somebody a partner or not was whether they could handle just about any kind of legal problem that came along. Since then we've become more a profession of specialists than we were 35 years ago.
Q. Anything else?
A. Yes, cases are more complicated now; they're more document-intensive than they used to be. A lot of what we do now requires an elaborate computer infrastructure and a huge administrative staff.
Q. Has the practice of law itself become more of a business?
A. It was easier 35 or 40 years ago to keep the practice of law as a profession than it is today, when there are more business considerations. A profession is a calling which a person practices in order to perform a service; the monetary rewards are incidental. The primary object of a business, though, is to make money. And the moment a law firm becomes a business, it will become less effective as a law firm.
Q. Have your feelings changed about being a lawyer?
A. Well, in some respects it was more fun 35 years ago. It was less pressured then, a little more relaxed. When you went to court, you knew everybody. Now, you don't have as much contact with other lawyers.
Q. Why is that important?
A. Because a lot of what a lawyer does is assist in resolving disputes. Years ago, lawyers knew each other and treated each other pretty well. And to the extent that lawyers know each other and get along with each other, it is easier to resolve disputes more effectively and you can better serve your client that way.
Q. We hear that the courts are terribly crowded. Have we become more a more litigious society?
A. I think so, yes.
Q. Is it because there are more lawyers?
A. I'm not sure. After all, there have to be clients to ask lawyers to bring lawsuits. I think part of it may be that there are more people; this is a densely populated state. Frankly, it may also be that there is a general feeling that somebody else ought to be responsible for paying for some of the misfortunes that occur to us.
Q. Aren't people suing for the same things they were suing for in the past?
A. No, because 30 years ago you didn't have products liability suits the way we do today. You didn't have the mass tort cases like the asbestos cases or the breast implant cases or the pharmaceutical cases. And you didn't have any environmental litigation to speak of.
Q. How do you feel about lawyers advertising?
A. That's a hard thing. Obviously it reflects an increased competitiveness in the field. You're almost forced to do a little bit of advertising given today's practices. It's contrary to what we would have done 35 years ago. I probably find it a little less attractive than my younger partners do.
Q. Does your firm advertise?
A. Very modestly: small "tombstone" ads in the New Jersey Symphony program and things like that.
Q. What about "pro bono" work -- providing free legal services for people who can't afford lawyers?
A. We're often asked to take on a case or a series of cases by the courts, in which case we always do. Recently, we handled a case of sex discrimination in the state's prisons. The male prisoners were suing the state because they were being watched in the showers by female guards, and the female guards were countersuing, saying that if they weren't allowed to watch the male prisoners, that took away their job opportunities. The case was settled when prison officials agreed to put up modesty screens in the showers. Our best estimate last year was that we spent 4,800 hours on pro bono stuff.
Q. So if lawyers provide services people need, why does it seem that many people just don't like lawyers?
A. I think that over the ages, at least since Shakespeare, lawyers have been fairly unpopular. In many cases, when people need lawyers, they are not in a happy situation to begin with. So as a class, I guess, lawyers are not among the most popular people around. But then again, neither are journalists.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Boom and Bluster at the Merc

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
BIG shots at the nation's trading exchanges love nothing more than to flex their muscles over the latest record-breaker. Little wonder, then, that they are hooting and hollering out in Chicago.
The price of a membership, or "seat," on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has been hitting record highs this summer nearly as often as the U.S. dollar has been hitting record lows. Meanwhile, seats on its arch-rival New York Stock Exchange are a shadow of the record $1.15 million set in the headier days of 1987. 
 To hear Chicago advocates tell it, the record $585,000 seat sale on August 17 was yet another example of the Merc's cutting-edge innovation, unmatched liquidity and positively unbeatable marketing of the futures and options that are its bread and butter. If the Merc has a notable institutional shortcoming, it is that it has all the humility of an investment banker circa 1987 -- before the stock market crash.
"I want to say it nicely and not denigrate any other exchange," said Jack Sandner, chairman of the booming Chicago Merc. "If you compare the various institutions and make an objective membership decision, you would probably decide on the Merc."
No doubt the bidders who are paying up for the privilege of trading on the Merc may be getting their money's worth. While the NYSE suffers a slow erosion of market share in its mainstay stock-trading business, the Merc offers all the lure of volume growth that a big trader or investment house salivates for. Volume is up, new Merc derivative products are enjoying instant worldwide popularity, and open interest -- trading positions that are held overnight -- is at an all-time high of 4.1 million contracts.
It doesn't hurt, either, that the Merc twisted arms starting in April 1991 to get leasers to buy seats. It slashed fees from 25 cents a trade to 7 cents for owners of seats, simultaneously hiking charges from 25 cents to 30 cents for anyone who rented.
"One of my friends says it saves him $70,000 a year," said Joel Leonard, a member of the nearby Chicago Board of Trade. "The Merc is very aggressive about getting its seat prices up."
Most important to the Merc's boom, though, are the nail-biting political and financial environments. Merc products such as Eurodollar, interest rate and stock market futures are a tonic to nervous investors looking to hedge in uncertain times, particularly in presidential election years. Mr. Sandner said the increasingly global markets are a boon, too, since "the more global the world gets, the more uncertain it will be."
The Merc also cashes in on the rush by financial institutions to deal in "swaps," the complicated hedging technique in which Bank A cuts a deal to exchange a payment obligation -- say, floating-rate interest payments -- to Bank B. As the number of financial institutions involved in a swap increases, so, too, does the likelihood that one of them will use the Merc to hedge the risk.
(Critics have lambasted the swaps market for its potential to set off a chain reaction of financial disasters if a player in a chain of swaps were to default on an obligation. Mr. Sandner, who said his only sleepless nights come from fear of over-regulation, said he never loses a wink of sleep over swaps. They are "commuter railroads bringing people to our main terminals," he said.)
Worrywarts fret that the flood of money going to the Merc's derivative products could be taking capital away from so-called "primary" markets like the NYSE. If market players are indeed putting money into derivatives that would otherwise have gone to owning old-fashioned stocks, it could result in less liquidity and less reliable pricing of stocks, they say. Sanford Grossman, finance professor at The Wharton School, scoffs at that idea, arguing instead that the proliferation of derivative products brings more money to stocks. Investors have a greater comfort level buying stocks when they know they can hedge in Chicago, he said.
At the New York Stock Exchange, executives make the case that they shouldn't be compared with the Merc because the two exchanges are simply in different businesses. Lewis Horowitz, executive vice president at the NYSE, said Chicago is a "transfer of risk" operation. "Here we are a capital-raising institution," he said of the NYSE.
That's little more than hocus-pocus marketing talk to market-watchers like Mr. Grossman, who said that very little of the NYSE's business derives from the initial public offerings that raise capital. "The NYSE is a place where people trade individual equity risk, and in that sense, it's no different from what's going on in Chicago."
If the two exchanges have anything in common, it is that their executives are given to boast that their market is the biggest, the best and the most liquid. Seat prices at the Merc may be higher than those at the NYSE, where Mr. Horowitz points out that 1,366 members own seats worth $6.3 million in all, surpassing the $3.6 million in current market value of the 625 Merc seats.
"It's tough being No. 1," sniffs Mr. Horowitz. "It's tougher to stay in first place than to get there."
While the debate goes on as to which market is better, bigger or safer, investors increasingly are spending money to buy the security of a hedged position through the Merc. To talk with some, the financial insurance products available today offer such a perfect hedge that no player need ever lose money -- a suspect claim in a trading world that is meant to have risks.
Riskiest of all, though, could be the confidence of Chicago's advocates that, amid the rush of new financial products being introduced, absolutely nothing can go wrong.
But short of the doomsday scenario where a major bank collapse brings the entire financial system down, Mr. Sandner says, "I don't see anything happening," he said. "I just worry about losing product lines to offshore trading."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Jobs Are In Government, Not Industry

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
YOU can't sell it if you don't have it, even if you are willing to cut the price. And when it comes to manufactured goods, you have to make them to sell them.
The employment report for August was a disaster from every perspective save that of the bond traders, who figured that the Federal Reserve would push interest rates lower, as it promptly did . Much will be made of the fact that the private sector has 38,000 fewer employees now than in January 1989, when President Bush took office. 
 But it is in manufacturing jobs that the sad story of America's slide as an industrial giant has been written. The number of such jobs has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band for the past two decades. In recessions, lots get laid off. In recoveries, a few get rehired.
Back in 1979, a record 21 million people worked in manufacturing in this country. By the end of 1982, recession had cut that figure to 18 million. During the much vaunted recovery of the 1980's, it was never to get back above 19.5 million. Now it is at 18.15 million, just a couple of ticks from setting a 27-year low.
In his speech to the Republican National Convention, President Bush vowed that the United States would be an "export superpower," but the Administration's strategy, if it has one, is not very clear. It did boost subsidized agricultural exports last week, but in manufactured goods the plan seems to be to let the dollar slide far enough to make prices competitive.
That's where the catch comes in. The low dollar has made it prohibitively expensive for Americans to travel overseas, and it has aided exports for those companies that make internationally traded products. But the worry is that the manufacturing base in this country has shrunken so much that exports can never rise to the levels needed to offset the current levels of imports.
The decline of manufacturing as an employer helps to explain the rise in poverty in this country. Historically, manufacturing offered reasonably good jobs to relatively uneducated workers. Now, a generation has grown up with no expansion in the manufacturing sector.
In sum, the bad news in the employment report is not just cyclical, that the recovery from the recession is hard to find. There is also a secular trend, in which service jobs have increased, particularly in government employment. When President Reagan took office, there were 25 percent more Americans working in manufacturing than in civilian government jobs. Last October, for the first time ever, government employment outstripped manufacturing, and now there are 554,000 more people working for governments.
In this season, of course, much of the world is focused on the political implications. For George Bush, the good news may be that job-creation historically has not been very important to most voters. This Administration has been the worst in recent history in producing private-sector jobs, but the best was Jimmy Carter's. And that fact did not save his job.

When Pravda was founded in Moscow by Vladimir Lenin in 1912 as the official organ of the Soviet Communist Party, its purpose was to be the party's "agitator and organizer." But with the Soviet Union dissolved and the Communist Party having fallen on hard times, Pravda has seen its circulation shrink from 10 million in 1987, to less than 1.4 million. And more than once it has found itself on the wrong side of history: when it supported last year's failed coup and when it opposed many of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms. Pravda -- it means truth -- also saw its revenues decline. Last March it was forced to shut down for three weeks while it arranged emergency bank loans. Last week, Pravda's editor-in-chief, Gennady Seleznyov, announced he had found a savior for the paper -- and he's certainly no Lenin. For an undisclosed amount, Greek businessman Yannis Yannikos will buy a 55 percent interest in Pravda.
 
The Rights to Fly
Countries guard their airlines jealously against too much competition. But last week, the United States and the Netherlands agreed on broad new aviation pact that could change all that. The agreement will allow airlines in each country the rights to fly anywhere in the other country. "This is a very significant event in international aviation," said Secretary of Transporation Andrew E. Card Jr. "Not only does it cement an extremely close relationship, but it will provide a mood for market-oriented aviation agreements with other countries." The immediate impact of the agreement is to allow KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which owns 49 percent of Northwest Airlines, and Northwest to operate as a single airline, with antitrust immunity. Previous treaties had prohibited the two airlines from coordinating their pricing, routes and flight schedules. The Department of Transportaton is though to be putting pressure on Britain to negotiate a similar aviation treaty.
 
Cost-Cutting, Japanese Style
Dai Ichi Kangyo, the world's largest bank, is cutting costs Japanese style. Rather than laying off low-level clerks, it is asking its 41 top executives to take 5 percent pay cuts and has asked them to trim 20 percent off their expense accounts. Those executives must certainly do a lot of entertaining. According to Yoshihide Akazawa, a spokesman for the company, the cuts -- along with a few others -- are expected to save an estimated $40 million a year.
 
ECONOMY
 
Politician Bush Has a Little Something for Taiwan and U.S. Farmers
President Bush has been loathe to anger China. He opposed sanctions after the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square and fought hard for China to keep its most-favored-nation trade status. But this is an election year and last week -- at a General Dynamics Corporation plant in Fort Worth -- Mr. Bush said he had approved the sale of 150 of the company's F-16 fighters to Taiwan, China's long-time foe. The sale could be worth $6 billion over 10 years to American companies in Texas, California and Connecticut. The same day, in South Dakota, Mr. Bush -- a staunch foe of agricultural subsidies in this year's trade negotiations with Europe -- said he had approved $1 billion to subsidize American wheat sales abroad and another $755 million to aid farmers whose crops were damaged by Hurricane Andrew. "This is pure pork-barrel politics," said Dee Dee Myers, a spokeswoman for Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger.
 
Outlook: Stagnant to Grim
Behind every President there are economists. But George Bush's economic mavens must be feeling a little uneasy. Last week's report from the Commerce Department on the Index of Leading Economic Indicators showed the pace of growth at just 0.1 percent in July after a 0.3 percent decline the month before. The index, which forecasts economic activity six to nine months hence, suggests a slower economy in first quarter of next year. "The economy is essentially dead," said Lawrence Chimerine, of DRI-McGraw Hill Inc.
 
More Poverty for All
Sluggish economic growth? How about plain poverty? The Census Bureau said last week that the number of Americans living in poverty increased by 2.1 million last year to a total of 35.7 million or 14.2 percent of the population. It was the second consecutive annual increase in the poverty rate. What's more, there are now more people living in poverty in America than at any time since 1964. The purchasing power of the average household also shrank last year by $1,100, the bureau said. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater blamed the increase in the poverty rate on Congress's inability to pass the Administration's economic proposals. Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger, blamed it on the Administration saying it has the "worst economic record in 50 years."
 
Handling Hurricane Andrew
Tallying up the damage from a disaster as vast as Hurricane Andrew is no mean feat. But last week estimates began to trickle in. The American Insurance Services Group, a nonprofit research organization, figures Andrew will cost insurance companies about $7.3 billion. But those estimates do not include uninsured losses, losses in Louisiana, damage to the infrastructure and damage to Government-owned installations. Though Andrew is the costliest natural disaster ever, analysts believe the insurance industry -- with $160 billion in capital -- will be able to take the hit. "The one thing this industry is very effective at is spreading risk," said G. Alan Zimermann, an analyst with Prudential Securities.
 
No Glee in Purchasing
If the nation's purchasing managers are the economy's weathervane, they are saying there's hardly a breeze. Last week, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its Purchasing Mangers Index fell to 53.7 from 54.2. A reading above 50 indicates economy is growing, below 50 indicates it is contracting.
 
Fed Acts on Jobless Numbers
Though unemployment fell to 7.6 percent in August, from 7.7 percent in July, it was accompanied by an alarming loss of 83,000 jobs from the nation's nonfarm payrolls and -- if government employment is excluded from the picture -- an even gloomier loss of 167,000 jobs from the nation's private payrolls. The unemployment numbers show "a dramatic deterioration in the job market," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. Most of the job losses were concentrated in the transportation, instruments and electronics sectors of the economy. "This news will not be well received in the White House," Mr. Robertson said. In response to the figures, the Federal Reserve lowered its Federal funds rate to 3.0 percent from 3.25 percent, the lowest level since 1963. The move is designed to make it easier for banks to borrow money.
 
COMPANIES
 
Bad Season for Citicorp
It hasn't been the best of summers for Citicorp. First the banking examiners identified problems that forced it to revise downward its second-quarter earnings by $28 million, to $143 million. Then a document leaked out from the Comptroller of the Currency's office that criticized the nation's No. 1 bank for the shoddy way it has run its mortgage subsidiary. The report said Citicorp overcharged customers and exposed the bank to undue risks. It did such a poor job at screening out unqualified mortgage applicants that it was unable to sell its mortgages to other institutions. The report also said Citicorp executives "have neglected their responsibilities to correct identified problems," some of which were first pinpointed in 1988. Citicorp said it could not legally comment on the report but that not everything in it was necessarily true.
 
General Mills's Shredded Wheat
Last week, General Mills, the nation's No. 2 cereal maker after Kellogg, said it planned to add RJR Nabisco's ready-to-eat cereal business to its Wheaties-led lineup. For $450 million, (no boxtops please) General Mills will get mostly shredded wheat -- in the form of Shreddies, Spoon-Sized Shredded Wheat, Frosted Shredded Wheat and the original, 100-year-old Shredded Wheat. The proceeds from the sale will help RJR pay off the $13.6 billion debt remaining from the $25 billion it borrowed in 1988 to finance a leveraged buyout. RJR's market share in cereals has slipped to 3 percent from 5 percent. "Nabisco had been on the slide for a long period of time," said William Leach, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Because of the increasing concentration in the food business, the deal is expected to be scrutinized by the Government for antitrust violations.
 
Whither Letterman?
It's no secret that late-night TV host David Letterman wanted Johnny Carson's old job. He's said so himself. But NBC replaced Mr. Carson with Jay Leno. If last week's reports in Advertising Age are correct, however, Mr. Letterman is determined to leave the network. Though his contract does not allow him to negotiate with anyone until after he has completed talks with NBC, other suitors -- including syndication companies -- have made "presentations," to Mr. Letterman's agents at the Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles. A syndicated show could be far more lucrative -- but riskier -- than staying with a network. NBC said in a statement that Mr. Letterman has been "a valuable member of the NBC family for the past 10 years," and that it wants to keep him right where he is. Mr. Letterman has remained silent.
 
Labor Strife at G.M.
The strike at General Motors Corporation's Lordstown complex has spread from a single metal shop to include 30,000 workers, forcing production at its Saturn division to be halted. But this strike is not over wages. Members of the United Automobiles Workers union walked out to protest the replacement of some of G.M.'s tool and die makers with a plan to buy from the outside. To become more competitive, G.M. wants to do more outsourcing; it currently produces 70 percent of all the parts it uses, versus about 40 percent at Toyota. Last week union and management teams met for talks. "G.M. is in a tough economic position," said Harry Katz, professor of labor relations at Cornell University. Both sides are "looking for bargaining leverage.
 
Now It's Canon-I.B.M.
Is there any high-tech company anywhere that hasn't entered an alliance with I.B.M.? Last week the International Business Machines Corporation joined with Canon Inc. to develop a new notebook computer.

One View Fits All

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
My oldest kid invited the jock home the other day. The jock's name is, of course, Kyle. He is a nice kid with an awesome arm, the kind who can choose a tree halfway down the road, pick up a stone and -- bing! -- nail it while my son stands open-mouthed.
This is one of the great rituals of growing up, trying to puzzle out who you are by discovering who you are not. Our children bring home familiar strangers, archetypes who will, by contrast, teach them what they're made of. There is something bittersweet about watching this, something that makes you want to give them simple answers instead of time and space. But figuring out who you are is the whole point of the human experience. So we let them be. 
 I couldn't help thinking of this when Pat Buchanan gave his hateful speech at the Republican Convention. You figure when you go on vacation certain events will pass you by. But the Buchanan speech has stayed with me because it was so insulting to the American people and so contrary to everything we value.
The election, he said, "is about more than who gets what. It is about who we are." Here's the catch -- who you are is who Pat Buchanan says you should be. Distrust differences. Revile people who are gay. Dismiss the aspirations of women. Reduce the answers to the problems of our cities to "force, rooted in justice, and backed by moral courage." Let your fears and hatreds be your guide. Invoke God to justify them.
"There is a religious war going on in this country for the soul of America," Mr. Buchanan said. And if you agree with him you are blessed. And if you do not you are damned.
Thus did we learn of a simpler life, life without thought.
Some Republicans were distressed by the us/them tone of Mr. Buchanan's speech. But his hyperpitch does not stand alone. Pat Robertson, who also spoke at the convention, says that the equal rights amendment "encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians." (What? No cannibalism?)
Marilyn Quayle, questioned about the wisdom of asking Mr. Buchanan to speak, said tight-lipped that he was the one who had done the asking. But Mrs. Quayle did some polarizing, too, saying liberals were "disappointed because more women do not wish to
be liberated from their essential natures as women."
I don't know what Mrs. Quayle defines as my essential nature; luckily, I worked that one out for myself a long time ago. I know it will probably take my daughter some time and some pain to figure out what being female means to her. Guide her with my beliefs and experiences, sure, but I will not garrote her with them. Maybe it would be a lot less difficult if she followed some all-purpose formula. But then she'd be a lot less human.
In the weeks since the convention the Republicans have figured out what the rest of us were thinking as we sat in front of our televisions. They flogged this package they called family values. And you could almost hear millions of folks saying, "Guys, we'll take care of our values if you take care of the economy."
And that is the point: we do take care of our own values, and it is an insult to have some pol stand up and tell us he has a handy-dandy all-purpose values package, one size fits all. The Republicans have now abandoned this campaign cul-de-sac. It would be nice if this was because they realized it was wrong. The truth is it just didn't play.
The Buchanan speech played least of all. Conscience is not simple; prejudices are not ennobling. The problems of L.A. require much more than automatic weapons. Good people disagree about abortion. Knowledge comes from discussion, not conclusion and exclusion.
It is painful to watch our kids struggle to find themselves in a complicated world. But it would be more painful still to have that growth stunted by the kind of exclusionary and conclusory catechism offered by Mr. Buchanan. He calls himself a traditionalist. I am a traditionalist too. The tradition I cherish is the ideal this country was built upon, the concept of religious pluralism, of a plethora of opinions, of tolerance and not the jihad. Religious war, pooh. The war is between those who trust us to think and those who believe we must merely be led. Demagoguery vs. democracy.

HEADLINE: Ducking the Environment

 BODY:
Senator Al Gore says George Bush has "turned his back" on the environment. The influential Sierra Club says the President has compiled an "anti-environment record that is the equal of Ronald Reagan's." Meanwhile, Republican spokesmen describe Mr. Gore as an extremist whose "hysterical" views would strangle the country in regulation and cost thousands of jobs.
These are caricatures. Mr. Bush's record is mixed, but his efforts to clean the air, protect the ozone layer and preserve Antarctica suggest a level of concern far higher than Mr. Reagan's indifference. 
 For his part, Mr. Gore is capable of hyperventilating on almost any ecological subject. Still, he discovered these issues before they became fashionable and has spent more time worrying about the trade-offs between jobs and a cleaner planet than almost anyone in government.
If the debate stays at this silly level, Election Day will arrive without either party addressing important questions or educating the public on tough choices. The winner will emerge with neither an environmental agenda nor a mandate.
This is not, of course, a convenient time for any politician to talk about the environment. Back in 1988, flush times, Mr. Bush could grandly promise to be the "environment President." No more.
Reeling from recession, and using Vice President Quayle as his point man, Mr. Bush has remade himself into a champion of environmental deregulation -- all in the name of jobs. Republicans accuse the Democrats of caring more about the spotted owl than unemployed loggers, more about fuel efficiency than auto workers.
Even Mr. Gore is feeling the heat. The Tennessee Democrat has long argued that the nation doesn't inevitably have to choose between jobs and a cleaner environment, and in many cases he's right. There's no reason, for example, why the richest country on earth cannot save its old-growth forests and retrain the relatively small number of workers who would lose their jobs.
Yet Bill Clinton's strategists have reportedly asked Mr. Gore to talk less about trees and more about the economy -- another sign that issues badly in need of intelligent discussion won't get it.
What would the candidates do, for example, to reconcile energy needs with environmental protection? Surely a vigorous commitment to energy efficiency could reduce pollution and serve as a hedge against global warming while improving the long-term competitiveness of American industry. The only issues are cost, and how best to do it.
The Democratic platform spends one sentence on the subject; the G.O.P. platform, none.
Nor is there much discussion of problems that are global in nature -- greenhouse warming, for example, or the exploitation of valuable rain forests. The loudest single message from the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was that the third world wants the West to help pay for the environmental costs of its industrialization.
This is the sort of issue that Mr. Gore and William Reilly, Mr. Bush's environmental chief, think about all the time. But it does not fit conveniently into sound bites.
The electorate needs to know how the candidates would handle a wide range of environmental questions. Yet the recession has both parties running away -- the Republicans from their early achievements, the Democrats from their promise of an even better policy.

HEADLINE: Abolish the Disaster Agency

BYLINE: By Lawrence J. Korb and Robert H. Kupperman; Lawrence J. Korb and Robert H. Kupperman have both served on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's advisory board.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency's lackluster response to Hurricane Andrew makes it painfully clear that the agency should be abolished.
In theory, the management agency is responsible for coordinating the Government's response to domestic emergencies. In reality, it has little practical authority to carry out Presidential priorities -- particularly when it tries to coordinate with much larger entities, like the Pentagon or the Department of Transportation. Moreover, the agency has become a dumping ground for mediocre political appointees with little background or interest in disaster relief. In fact, its ratio of political appointees to career professionals is the highest in the Government. 
 The U.S. used to have an effective crisis-management organization. The Office of Emergency Preparedness was in the White House. Its director, a member of the National Security Council, reported directly to the President. The office handled domestic disasters, as well as national security emergencies (like industrial sabotage) and economic crises (like carrying out a wage and price freeze).
But in 1973 the office was abolished, a victim of a political skirmish in the Nixon Administration. Its national security functions were moved to the General Services Administration, while its disaster management responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In 1978, Jimmy Carter put crisis-management responsibilities back under one roof when he created the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the agency's record has been less than inspiring. Delays plagued its responses to recent disasters -- the San Francisco earthquake in 1989, Hurricane Hugo the same year and Hurricane Bob in 1991. Worse, the rest of the Government doesn't take the agency seriously. Wallace Stickney, its director, was effectively cut out of the decision-making process during Hurricane Andrew.
The emergency agency should be scrapped and replaced with a smaller, highly professional office. The new agency must operate from the White House, and its director must be of Cabinet rank to carry the necessary authority. About 500 professionals (100 in Washington and 400 in the field) would constitute its nucleus, replacing the current staff of 2,600.
Moreover, the military should be given responsibility for planning and logistics, coordinating simulations of disaster conditions much as it conducts military exercises. Bases across the country would serve as centers for water, food and medical supplies and as temporary shelters. A military official of lieutenant general rank should be made director of operations for the agency to strengthen ties with the Pentagon.
During the cold war, it did not make much sense for the military to take on domestic disasters. The Pentagon could not afford to have Army divisions tied down in Florida if the Soviet Union tried to break through NATO defenses in Germany.
But now fewer troops need to be stationed abroad. Giving the military responsibility for disaster relief would not only be good for the country, it would be good for the troops, giving them a meaningful mission to maintain their cutting edge. Our armed forces know how to deal with disasters, as they demonstrated in Somalia and Bangladesh. And they would be particularly adept at responding to the man-made disasters of the future: techno-terrorist attacks that could paralyze the entire country.
If the Administration is really serious about reducing the size of Government, it would replace the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a streamlined crisis-management organization agile enough to provide disaster relief immediately -- and not a few days later.

HEADLINE: 'Business as Usual Won't Work'

 BODY:
Articles in the Sunday, Aug. 2 issue ["New Fields Opening Up, Offering Hope for Jobs" and "Retraining Classes Inundated") underscore the reality that business as usual won't work, recent changes seem permanent and our economy will never again be what it was. For high school students close to graduation, for seasoned workers facing a bleak job picture and for the broad community of counseling and educational professionals the challenge is great.
Counselors in L.I. high schools have the task of refocusing students' expectations and goals, helping to guide them into marketable fields of interest and to schools that can meet their needs. Sometimes, that choice is a two-year college first, to help move them more quickly into the job market. At Briarcliffe, more than a third of our graduates eventually go on to a four-year institution (usually on Long Island) to complete a bachelor's degree. Many go for graduate work. 
 As Dr. Pearl Kramer notes, a whole array of new technologies is coming on board and education and retraining is critical. For our experienced work force, many technical skills are transferable, with some updating and focussed effort on new programs and new advances in the high-tech fields. There are student services, including counseling, job preparation and placement, that can make the difference between failure and success.
Finally, the articles clearly mark the need for increased co-operation and partnerships between education and business to give our economy the jump-start and consistent energy it needs to recover and remain strong.

HEADLINE: Bush Takes Economics Out Beyond Voodoo

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One of the notable features of the Reagan Administration was its reliance on voodoo economics, the dubious benefits of which are presumably still with us. President Reagan's program was coherent but wrong. President Bush, with the two major tax proposals in his acceptance speech, has given up on coherence as well. 
 The first proposal is that he will cut income taxes by an unspecified amount to the extent that he can find unspecified expenditures to cut. This promise is empty as it stands and incoherent in principle. Even if the spending cuts could be found, as Herbert Stein has pointed out, the President could not afford to reduce taxes if he really supports a balanced budget amendment (or simply a balanced budget), as he says. Balancing the budget requires that any saving in the cost of government be applied to reduce the deficit, not taxes.
The second proposal is to give each taxpayer the option of allocating a fraction of his or her taxes to defraying the cost of government, the rest being used to reduce the deficit or debt. Again, the President would insist on matching, but unspecified, spending cuts. This would be an astonishing way to run a railroad, let alone a government. The standard procedure in a democratic society is for Congress and the executive to assess the needs of the country and its capacity to bear taxes, and to reach a compromise. The Bush proposal would let the public decide how much should be spent, regardless of need. Public finance textbooks will be agog at this innovation.
Leave that aside. The President has committed himself to reducing the deficit some $200 billion over the next five years. The checkoff for debt reduction could, if fully taken up, reduce spendable revenue by about $280 billion over that period, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. It is hard to price out an unspecified, across-the-board tax reduction, but cutting rates by 2 percent would cost $250 billion over five years.
Throw in a few of the President's other recommendations, and you are soon close to a trillion dollars. Where could the spending reductions possibly come from, with Social Security exempt as promised? The charitable explanation is that Mr. Bush does not mean a word of it. His program might well be described as out beyond voodoo.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For Victims Of Hurricane, The Crisis Is Here to Stay

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
More than just the landscape was irremediably altered two weeks ago when Hurricane Andrew smashed and swirled its way across southern Florida, blowing down thousands of houses, stores and offices and leaving 38 people dead. Hundreds of thousands of people have had their lives shattered, and as they labor wearily in the ruins left by the biggest natural disaster in American history, one question looms above all others: how much longer before things return to normal?
The signs are not encouraging. Even for those lucky enough not to be included in the estimated 250,000 homeless, the initial elation that came with survival and the discovery of a home that was merely damaged, not destroyed, has faded into a primitive and numbing routine. By Friday, an estimated 350,000 residents of Miami's southern suburbs remained without electricity and potable water, forced to cook their meals and boil their water over propane stoves or open fires. There are also generators to be filled, mosquitoes to be fought off, and roofing material, glass and plywood to be sought. 
 Army troops and utility repair crews seem to be everywhere, working around the clock, which in an odd way only adds to the frustration and impatience surging throughout the disaster zone. Compared with the great leaps forward in the first days after the storm, progress now seems to come in smaller and smaller increments, and impatience is growing. "The aftermath is the real test," cautioned Kate Hale, Dade County's Director of Emergency Management. "It's going to take a very, very long time to sort this out and clean it up."
Some elements of normal life, of course, have been restored or will be in the next few days. Grocery stores that have reopened are selling fresh meat and fruits as well as the canned goods that were the only source of sustenance in the first days after the storm. The school year is to begin Sept. 14, two weeks later than originally scheduled, and a primary election is even to be held Tuesday, after a court-ordered delay of one week.
Beyond the immediate problems of food and shelter, however, there are concerns about what kind of place Miami will be after the last bit of debris has been carted away and the lights turned back on. In the 1980's, Miami came to be seen as glamorous, cosmopolitan and polyglot -- the kind of place where it was possible to enjoy diving and sailing by day and nightclubs and exotic cuisines by night. Granted, the trend setters have been quick to return to Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, despite a county-wide curfew that remains in effect. But if the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew exceeds $20 billion, and insurance companies anticipate having to pay out $7.3 billion, where is the difference going to come from? President Bush has pledged that the Federal Government will pay virtually all the costs of rebuilding public property and services in Florida, but Federal officials say it will be weeks before they can even estimate the amount of aid that will be needed to fulfill that promise. Already, local officials are talking of tax increases, which, when paired with an abrupt shortage of cheap housing, means a certain loss of allure.
"The fantastic cost that is going to be involved in reconstruction here is far beyond the capabilities of any local or county or state government," Representative Dante B. Fascell, who represents south Dade County in Washington, said last week after touring the disaster zone. "The devastation is just unbelievable."
Spurred by President Bush's visit Tuesday and his televised appeal that night for assistance, people around the country have been sending supplies to the area, some driving from as far away as California and New England to help. But what appears to be lacking is an overall sense of the recovery's direction. Local officials and business leaders have been so overwhelmed with day-to-day details that they have not had time to address long-term needs like jobs and housing.
In addition, a gulf seems to be emerging between those who suffered in the storm and those who did not. Residents north of the disaster zone have begun to complain of round-the-clock local radio and television coverage of the storm's aftermath, wondering when they will again be able to watch their favorite prime-time programs instead of scenes of devastation. People living in devastated areas like Perrine and Richmond Heights, most of them black and many of them poor, are questioning why more affluent neighborhoods got more press attention and, at least initially, more relief supplies.
 
'The City Invincible' Stumbles
 "What took so long?" Caroline Sumpter asked while in line for food in Perrine. "Is it because we are black?"
Some older residents have been wondering aloud if Hurricane Andrew might not be as much a turning point in Miami history as the storm that struck "The City Invincible" in September 1926. That hurricane destroyed thousands of homes and caused huge financial losses. Its greatest impact, however, was on public confidence and the city's image, both of which took a severe beating. Not until the end of World War II did the region's economy really begin to take off again.
Southern Florida today is much larger and its economy much more diversified than it was during that first boom period in the 1920's. But Hurricane Andrew has inflicted damage that will require more than gestures like President Bush's announcement that he wants to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base. The scenes of devastation broadcast around the world can only tarnish Miami's luster as a tourist destination, even though other Florida cities tried to distance themselves from that problem with an advertising campaign reminding people that most of the state was untouched.
 
A Breadbasket Uprooted
 With no significant industries, the Miami area relies heavily on commerce and services, both of which are now severely damaged, as sources of employment. Local business leaders estimate that up to 7,800 small companies employing more that 50,000 workers are in danger of going out of business. Agriculture, already reeling from the impact of the free-trade agreement with Mexico, is another victim. The area around Homestead is one of the prime sources of winter vegetables and tropical fruits for the United States, and many farmers who lost crops say they may have to go out of business.
Some people are wondering, in fact, if it is worth the effort to stay on and try to rebuild. "We were very, very fortunate to survive," Joyce Conjurski, manager of a trailer park in Homestead, said as she and her husband cleared rubble last week. "But everything here is gone, and our friends have all been scattered to the wind. You have to ask yourself if maybe it isn't time to move on."

HEADLINE: As Washington Lives on Credit, States Live on Gruel

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
While President Bush politicked across the Great Plains early last week, handing farmers some $1.8 billion in Federal largess, Gretchen Tegeler was poring over the Iowa state budget in her Des Moines office, looking for ways to make ends meet. It is a stretch.
Spending on major items like prisons and the state payroll is ballooning. Medicaid alone already consumes one of every 10 state dollars and is pegged to rise by more than 20 percent as far as the eye can see. State revenues, meanwhile, are projected to grow by about 4 percent a year, or barely enough to beat inflation. Ms. Tegeler, the state's top fiscal officer, figures she has about two years before the two lines converge and cross. 
 "It's a difficult time to be governing," she said.
It is, at least in most states. In the latest and most sobering example of belt-tightening, California's government enacted a $57.4 billion budget last week that sharply cuts welfare, higher education and aid to local government, and imposes new restrictions on health-care programs for the poor. Across the country, tax hikes and spending cuts are more the rule than the exception.
But somehow, the message of hard times hasn't stuck in Washington. Last week alone, Mr. Bush pledged billions for disaster relief in hurricane-stricken Florida and to rebuild a wrecked Air Force base that had been, until the storm, a strong candidate for permanent closing. He gave $1 billion in subsidies to wheat farmers locked in a trade war with Europe, and dispensed close to $1 billion more in disaster aid to farms and communities from Arizona to Ohio and beyond. His Democratic rival, Gov. Bill Clinton, has no treasury to dip into, but promptly flew to Florida and matched Mr. Bush's offer of assistance anyway.
 
Spending, the New Virtue
 This is not out of form for either candidate. Mr. Bush claims to be an apostle of small government. But like a lot of politicians, he has turned the ugly necessity of Federal spending into a virtue at election time. He pledged in August to develop the M-1A1 tank, a jobs-creating project for the politically shaky states of Michigan and Ohio that, only months ago, the Pentagon had derided as a huge waste. He has also reversed field to pump foreign money into the economy, changing a decade-old policy last week to allow Taiwan to buy $6 billion in F-16 jets -- and keep a Texas aircraft plant operating.
Mr. Clinton is not to be outdone. In the primaries, he urged building Seawolf nuclear submarines that even Mr. Bush wanted to pinch, and his somewhat sketchy economic platform advocates $220 billion in added "investment" -- once called spending -- in part on such laudable programs as high-tech research, communications, education and roads. The Clinton campaign contends its plans are revenue-neutral, financed by cuts and streamlining elsewhere, but many experts find that claim dubious at best.
Is helping storm victims and factory workers wrong? Hardly; Mr. Clinton and the Democratic Congress, which allotted much of the money Mr. Bush is handing out, seem to agree that it is generally not. So do most voters. The real question, which only is starting to dawn as a political issue, is how long they can keep it up.
Iowa and other states have to balance their books, but the revenue and spending lines for the Federal bureaucracy crossed paths long ago and are now diverging at the rate of $332 billion a year. Among state leaders there is a growing fear that the Federal deficit is not just an abstract number but a genuine threat to their own fiscal health, prolonging economic downturns and gobbling up Federal revenues to which they might otherwise lay claim. (Interest on the national debt, at 14 percent of the budget, this year surpasses the 13 percent allotted to various grants to state and local governments.) There is also is a sense that if Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton and their Congress do not find a way to control their spending, the painful choices legislatures and governors are making this summer, more than likely, are trial runs for those that Washington soon will be unable to avoid.
What kinds of choices? An April survey of state budget offices concluded that 23 states were proposing cuts in employee benefits in their fiscal 1993 budgets, and state employment would drop by 180,000 full-time positions. Nineteen states wanted to cut Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or both. Fully 36 states are considering a bureaucratic restructuring to cut expenses and deliver services more efficiently.
Nine states have proposed personal income-tax hikes this year, and 14 want to raise sales or corporate income taxes. States raised taxes and fees by a record $25.3 billion in 1991 and 1992, and have raised them another $5.1 billion for fiscal 1993.
"We're trying to communicate that tough choices must be made," said Oregon's budget director, Mike Marsh, who also is busily plotting huge cutbacks in state spending. "There's a perspective out there that you can continue to do more for less ad infinitum. And at some point, there has to be some recognition that that stops, and you have an impact on services."
 
A Shot Across the Bow
 Mr. Marsh was talking in part about citizens, but mostly about politicians who, he said, shy from what he believes is the real task: curbing the public's appetite for more government. The 50 governors fired a shot across the Federal bow on that issue in February when, at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, they grilled both President Bush and his budget director, Richard Darman, on their plans to reduce the deficit. More recently, Oregon has prepared the public for budget cuts by beaming its Governor by satellite to 20 town meetings for discussions of state spending and taxes. In Iowa, Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, held the Legislature through two special sessions until it agreed to pass a package of spending cuts and enact a one-cent sales tax.
Even if it wanted to, the Federal Government is hindered in making similarly large changes in the budget anytime soon, because a drastic reduction in spending or a tax increase now would risk turning a slow recovery into a steep recession. On the other hand, says Alice M. Rivlin, a leading expert on Federal spending at the Brookings Institution, some things can be done: "The Federal deficit could be reduced with less agony than the states are going through if the economy revives, and if a new President and a new Congress work out a plan for reducing it over the next five or six years."
None of that seems especially likely today. Ms. Rivlin said she sees no sign of anything but a tepid recovery. Mr. Bush is running on a platform of tax cuts and spending cuts, and Mr. Clinton on a proposal to shift taxes from average people to the rich and big business. In general Mr. Bush proposes to shrink the Government out of the deficit and Mr. Clinton to grow his way out. But neither has a specific proposal to reduce the deficit. "Whoever wins," Ms. Rivlin said, "is going to be in a very tough spot."

HEADLINE: LOOKING FOR WORK;
America Isn't Creating Enough Jobs, And No One Seems to Know Why

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
This is a joyless Labor Day for many people. It is like a May Day without a Maypole or Christmas without gift-giving. It is hard to remember a time when so much was going wrong for the American worker.
Labor Day used to be a celebration of the nation's wage earners -- 20-year employees in factory and office jobs with rising incomes that made tens of millions of Americans, by the early 1970's, solidly middle class. Rarely, if ever, had prosperity been so widely spread through a population. "You could train a person on the job and it was like he had been born into a rich family," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist. 
 But now the jobs that were the foundation of the American prosperity are dying out, or paying less, or being lost to countries where labor is cheaper.
How to get back to the rich days? People are being told that the route is through education. They must be better at reading and math. Get a college degree. No one explicitly says so, but the message is that corporate America somehow stands ready to generate well-paying jobs for a better-educated, more skilled work force.
But Americans already are highly educated. Nearly 22 percent of the work force has college degrees, almost double the percentage 20 years ago. And 23 percent is going beyond high school today, taking some college courses in their pursuit of the elusive better jobs. The Germans and the Japanese, those benchmarks of industrial prowess and steady jobs, just match the American achievement in higher education.
 
Educated and Frustrated
 The problem, it is turning out, is not so much the lack of education, although clearly many Americans don't read or add as well as they should. The problem is a shortage of good jobs, even for the educated. Across the country, one major industry, health care, is scrambling for skilled workers. Nearly everyone else has applications piling up, particularly if the pay is $8 an hour or more. And increasingly, the Labor Department reports, college graduates are taking lesser jobs -- as sales clerks, for example -- that don't require a college education.
Indeed, on this Labor Day, it is worth considering the paradox that companies in the forefront of the campaign for better public school education to solve the skills problem -- companies like General Motors, Kodak and Xerox -- have nevertheless shed skilled workers by the tens of thousands. Corporate America, in the name of efficiency and survival, has chosen to permanently shrink its employment rolls, and the shrinking process is not over yet.
 
More Bad News
 "The economy is failing nearly every American," Lawrence Mishel, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group, told Congress's Joint Economic Committee on Friday. Drawing on recently published Government data, Mr. Mishel calculates that even the wealthiest Americans, the 20 percent of the households with $80,000 a year or more in annual income, have been losing ground to inflation since 1989. Until 1989, they had been the one group bucking the trend toward shrinking real incomes.
Some say that Labor Day 1993 will be happier. By then, they predict, the recession will be over, along with the weak economic growth that has held down the nation for more than three years. The economy will be growing smartly again, these optimists say, and while big corporations might not rehire many workers, new companies will form to hire more workers, and the job machine will once again generate more than 200,000 new jobs a month, the minimum considered necessary to absorb a growing labor force. How far distant this goal is was illustrated on Friday, when the Labor Department reported that 167,000 private sector jobs disappeared in August. The latest unemployment rate is a still very high 7.6 percent.
Such unsettling data, coming week after week, are thinning the ranks of the optimists. Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist, is a recent convert to pessimism. "It is a very glum Labor Day," he says. "We have been unable to recover from recession and no one knows the reason why."
Nevertheless, explanations are emerging. Many are still based more on suspicion than solid evidence. But among other messages, they seem to say that radical, long-term changes in American labor practices and trends are limiting job opportunities and wages -- perhaps helping to cause the weak economic growth, rather than being its result.
"It is hard to establish what is recession and what is trend apart from recession," said Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Full knowledge will come only in hindsight, he said.
The Presidential candidates, George Bush and Bill Clinton, offer planks to redress labor's decline -- but like corporate leaders, they stress job training more than job creation. More than in his first term, Mr. Bush would focus on Federal grants to retrain job-losers -- for example, auto workers whose operations were moved to Mexico. Mr. Clinton would require companies with 50 or more employees to spend 1.5 percent of their payrolls in constant worker training.
In the Clinton camp, one hope is that the investment will commit companies to their workers, as Germany does through its national apprenticeships for young people not going to college, and large Japanese corporations do with extensive on-the-job training. Another hope, in both camps, is that American companies will somehow immerse themselves, en masse, in new technologies and work practices not easily transferred to other, lower-paid countries. That inclination has not shown itself yet.
"A lot of the skill training can and should be done on the job, and the question is who is going to pay for it," said Paul Ostermann, an expert in job training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "If you ask companies, many say they are unable to cover the cost."
 
Income Declining
 Whatever the solutions, the problems are piling up. Take household income. Through much of the 1970's and 1980's, more and more household members went to work. But women are no longer entering the labor force in rising numbers, and young people are also having more trouble finding jobs. The result: the wage stagnation among individuals has spread to household income. The Census Bureau, reflecting the trend, reported last week that median household income, adjusted for inflation, had fallen to $30,126 in 1991 from $31,750 in 1989 -- after having risen for six years.
"It is primarily the recession that is doing this, but there are other factors as well," said Daniel Weinberg, a Census Bureau official.
It is mainly the recession that has driven up the number of Americans living in poverty to 14.2 percent of the population, roughly matching the level during the 1981-1982 recession, the Census Bureau reported last week. But other problems are not just a result of the recession and weak economic growth.
Forty percent of the layoffs last year were white-collar workers, double the level in earlier recessions, as manufacturers are not the only ones shrinking staff. Millions of Americans who still hold jobs tell stories of friends or relatives who have lost theirs, or have been forced into lower-paying work, often at smaller companies. Job insecurity has been woven into daily life, making millions of Americans who are burdened with debt from the 1980's reluctant to spend freely again as they work down their debts.
The hardships continue. Layoffs and attrition in the defense industry, shrinking in the post-Cold War era, have accounted for at least 15 percent of the job losses since mid-1990, and these seem permanent. The number of workers without company-sponsored health insurance or pensions, or both, is rising. People on layoff are remaining out of work for longer periods than in the past, suggesting that even companies with rising sales are reluctant to take back employees -- a reluctance that corporate executives often confirm and justify as necessary for efficiency.
Some 6.3 million people who work part-time really want to work full-time, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, and one million others, listed as neither employed nor unemployed, appear in bureau statistics as wanting to work but too discouraged to go out and look for jobs.
Both figures are rising, and Mr. Mishel, in his Congressional testimony Friday, declared that if one adds up the unemployed, the underemployed and the discouraged, more than 13 percent of the labor force is clearly in pain.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
From Soviet Warheads to U.S. Reactor Fuel

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Last week a new kind of unthinkable came to pass, marking a milestone in the transformation of nuclear swords into plowshares. The Bush Administration announced it had quietly cut a deal with Russia to buy much of its highly enriched uranium -- the very stuff that for decades was the explosive core of Soviet warheads, prompting Americans to build fallout shelters and a costly military-industrial complex. The agreement marks the first time in the atomic age that large amounts of military uranium are to be diluted into fuel for civilian power plants.
The deal, particulars of which must be ironed out and approved by the two Governments, calls for the United States to buy at least 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium over 20 years. That amount of material is valued at several billion dollars. The Administration's aim is to bolster the shaky Russian economy, to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents and theft and, less explicitly, to expedite the disarmament of a former foe. 
 Even Federal officials privy to the secretive negotiations said they could hardly believe what had been wrought.
"Instead of lighting up mushroom clouds, this stuff is going to light up homes in the United States with electricity," said Philip G. Sewell, a Department of Energy official who took part in the uranium talks. "It's kind of incredible."
Not all experts were overjoyed. Paul Leventhal, director of the Nuclear Control Institute, a private group based in Washington, worried that the transport of highly enriched uranium to the United States for processing could prove risky. Instead, he said, it should be diluted into harmless reactor fuel in Russia before being shipped. The 500 metric tons of uranium is enough to build more than 30,000 bombs as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima.
"We've never moved H.E.U. in those quantities," Mr. Leventhal said, referring to highly enriched uranium. "You have the potential for theft and diversion, which even in relatively small amounts has tremendous potential for blackmail and destruction."
The Administration has pledged that transport of the material will be protected from accidents and theft, and has agreed to buy bomb uranium that has already been diluted from Moscow, if it can produce such material.
Highly enriched uranium is never stockpiled to run civilian reactors, which use a less concentrated material known as low enriched uranium. Traditionally, the two worlds of uranium have been kept far apart since they are so contrary, for peace or war.
After purchase by the Federal Department of Energy, bomb-grade uranium is to be diluted into commercial reactor fuel. Industry experts say the fuel would cover a football field in a 1.5-foot-thick layer and run the 110 nuclear reactors now operating in the United States for a decade or more.
 
A Fraction of Normal Demand
 The Department of Energy is the world's largest enricher of uranium for civil reactors, selling fuel to utilities around the world and the country. Nuclear reactors must be at least partly refueled with fresh uranium every 12 to 18 months. The department plans to use diluted Russian material to meet some fraction of its normal customer demand.
Mr. Sewell of the Energy Department said the agency expects to save up to $200 million a year on its own uranium enrichment operations, freeing that money for Russian purchases and making the deal "budget neutral."
Uranium miners who supply the department have voiced few complaints about the Russian agreement, saying that if it is managed carefully it will have little impact on their business. After all, raw uranium ore will be used to dilute the bomb fuel. "Besides," noted Robert E. Moyer, an official of the Uranium Producers of America, a trade group, "the fundamental idea is of benefit to everybody."
A godfather of the deal was Dr. Thomas L. Neff, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who argued that the dismantlement of Soviet warheads offered an economic bonanza that could aid Russia's transition to a market economy while helping avoid nuclear misuse and proliferation. His ideas, outlined in an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times last Oct. 24, were reviewed favorably in the State Department and other Federal agencies even as the Russians, increasingly desperate for hard currency, became nuclear salesmen.
 
U.S. Companies Saw Potential First
 The Government was also prodded by several American companies, including Allied-Signal Inc., an aerospace and chemicals giant based in Morristown, N.J., that saw the potential for big profits in the resale of Russian bomb fuel and wanted to do the deal themselves. Instead, the Government took the lead.
Months of secret talks culminated in Moscow on Aug. 28 with the initialing of a 20-year agreement. It calls for the Energy Department to buy no less than 10 metric tons annually for the first five years, and no less than 30 metric tons annually for the next 15 years, Federal officials said. A final contract is to be signed within a year. Methods of processing and transport have yet to be determined.
The 500 metric tons is what many experts once considered to be the total Russian inventory, so they are now raising their estimates because it seems unlikely that a nuclear superpower would sell its entire supply.
"This is a pretty significant event in the history of the 20th century," said Marvin S. Fertel, vice president of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the communications arm of the nuclear power industry. Even so, the White House downplayed the deal.
Rather than being presented at the regular noon briefing, where it might have made a splash, the news dribbled out late Monday. A confusing fact sheet seemed to suggest that the deal was for 80 metric tons, which understated it considerably, and gave no time period for the transaction. Late Monday night, a White House spokesman said he knew no details of the accord and was unaware that President Bush had hailed it earlier that day.
A State Department official said the news was downplayed out of concern that it might embarrass the Russian military, elements of which feel betrayed by the dulling of Russia's nuclear edge.
But Mr. Fertel suggested that the deal was slighted because of general White House bumbling and foreign-policy defensiveness during an election year in which domestic issues have so far reigned supreme.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Poland Sets Rough Path In Market Restructuring

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG

 BODY:
Communism left its mark on Eastern Europe, from the polluted landscape to the acres of dilapidated concrete apartment blocks. But perhaps the most politically significant legacy was a human one: the millions of workers who run the heavy industries and were used to being taken care of, after a fashion, by their government.
It is a proletariat fired by an incendiary mixture of anger about the past and fears about the future. 
 In what was once East Germany, the Government has tried, with mixed success, to buy them off with social programs and retraining. In Poland, the more apt model for the impoverished nations of the former Eastern bloc, the Government has recently launched a riskier strategy. It is confronting its own recalcitrant workers, and even threatening to replace strikers from the most radical unions.
Last week, on the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Solidarity movement, dismissal notices were sent to strikers -- a move that neither the last three democratically elected prime ministers or Poland's Communist Governments had dared make.
If this approach succeeds, it is likely to be emulated by other former Soviet bloc countries, all of which have restive workers employed in economically inefficient heavy industries awaiting restructuring.
The conflict between the workers and the expiring free market government is particularly acute in Poland, where the largest state-owned steel mills and shipyards were strongholds of the Solidarity movement.
Because of their size and poor management, most of these factories have been the least able to adapt to the rigors of competition. With wages stagnant and bankruptcy often looming, the employees of these companies find themselves among the losers in the new market economy they helped create.
Still, economists agree that these factories will have to be broken up, their bloated work forces trimmed, and the companies turned private if Poland and other former Communist nations are to revise their economies.
Poles frequently point out that Western governments have found it impossible to administer such bitter medicine in their own countries, and they take note of the European Community's massive farm subsidies and the persistent budget deficits in the United States.
But because their national world is so much smaller, the weak democracies of Eastern Europe paradoxically have less room to maneuver. Their circumstances, and the need to forge agreements with the International Monetary Fund, force them toward hard decisions.
 
Ex-Trailblazer
 Poland's Governments in the last year have managed to postpone tough economic choices, but at a price. Its agreement with the I.M.F. has been suspended since September 1991 and its reputation among Western investors has slipped badly.
From 1990 to 1991, Poland was a trailblazer in the region, and its shock-therapy reforms showed how a Communist-style economy could eliminate shortages virtually overnight by trimming government subsidies and allowing prices to jump to world levels. Leaders of the economic reforms were praised for their courage.
Then politics reared its head. The next step that was planned, the massive restructuring of industries and the closing of inefficient mines and factories, coincided with presidential and then parliamentary elections. Poland found itself with a fragmented Parliament whose members had campaigned on vague popular promises of a better life.
Jan Olszewski, a lawyer with no background in economics, became Prime Minister last December, ushering in six months of gridlock. His Government did manage to produce a slimmer budget but it also effectively froze privatization and seemed to deliberately erect roadblocks to Western investment.
After a Parliamentary vote of no confidence, an interim Prime Minister, Hanna Suchocka (pronounced sue-HOTZ-kuh), emerged in July to head a coalition Government. Immediately she was confronted by strikes, including a wildcat walkout at a car parts factory in the southern Poland city of Tychy.
Although Ms. Suchocka had not provoked this test of wills, her aides quickly saw the possibilities. While many strikes under way stem from legitimate workers' frustrations with bad management or, in the case of the Ursus Tractor Factory near Warsaw, previous Governments' ineptitude in carrying out restructuring plans, the strike at Tychy appeared different -- even one that the Government might win.
It was egregiously ill-timed, and unlikely to generate public sympathy. The factory is part of a nearly $2 billion investment in Poland by Fiat, the Italian auto giant, which meant its success or failure would send an important symbolic signal to other investors.
 
Solidarity Splinter Group
 The union argued that the deal, renegotiated by successive governments, had been overly generous, and said Fiat should have been squeezed harder. In fact, Fiat had already promised stepped wage increases over the next year if the deal was signed.
Nonetheless, even before the final papers were agreed to, workers at Tychy struck, demanding that they be paid 10 percent of the value of the car they were making, the subcompact Cinquecento. Also perhaps helping the Government's public relations position, the strike was led by Solidarity 80, a radical splinter group from the original Solidarity union. Solidarity 80 is now part of an alliance of angry farmers, former Communists and unions that oppose the economic reforms.
After negotiations proved fruitless, strikers began to receive dismissal notices. Late last week, in response, they halved their wage demands and returned to the bargaining table, prompting local managers to suspend the dismissals as a gesture of good faith. But the point had been made, both inside the country and to the foreign investors, and the betting in Warsaw was that Ms. Suchocka would eventually prevail in this strike and several others now under way.
Ms. Suchocka said she was trying to change a mentality that has been rooted in decades of Communist rule. "There exists in society a certain barrier in social consciousness -- society is somehow unable to free itself from the previous way of thinking," she said in an interview last week. "So far, they believe that the losing of a badly paid job in some state company or government office is a defeat for them, instead of realizing that it is a certain challenge to begin new work which will be more satisfying and better paid."

HEADLINE: The World Has a Few Too Many Russian Vodkas

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Selling vodka in the New World Order has not proved a simple matter.
Ask Kenneth L. Onish. Several years ago, the Connecticut businessman began laying the groundwork to import Soviet vodka to the United States. He hit on the perfect name, one that captured the excitement of the changes in the Communist bloc, and had thousands of labels printed. 
 But by the time Mr. Onish's vodka hit the shelves of American liquor stores this summer, history had marched on, trampling his marketing plan. The vodka was named Raissa, after Raisa Gorbachev. Its advertisements read: "They've Tasted Freedom. Now You Can Too! Raissa, The Taste of Glasnost" and conclude with the curious catch-phrase: "Our thanks to George, Gorby, Boris and CNN."
Raissa vodka has failed to find its way into many gimlets.
While many liquor industry executives and trade experts expected a swarm of imported Eastern bloc vodkas to follow improving international relations, that has not happened. "There is a certain vaguely tacky quality" to the few recent imports that have crossed the Atlantic, said S. Frederick Starr, a Russian scholar who is president of Oberlin College. The exception, he said, is Stolichnaya Cristal, a $26-a-fifth vodka (brand-name American vodkas run $12 and up) that Mr. Starr said has replaced satellites as the new symbol of Russia's ability to make at least one high-quality product.
But even regular Stolichnaya, which at $19 a fifth is by far the most popular Russian vodka in the United States, is encountering problems instead of the huge profits it had expected with the collapse of the Communist bureaucracy. Pepsico Inc., which has the contract to import Stolichnaya in return for cola syrup, is struggling just to get basic supplies. Even bottles are in short supply, forcing Pepsi to import them from other parts of Europe. As a result, Soviet shortages are showing up in American liquor stores.
The disintegration of the Russian economy is also posing uncomfortable marketing problems. Vodka sellers usually rely on photographs of glaciers and icy mountain streams to convey images of purity, but shots of bread lines, dingy factories and outdated nuclear reactors on the evening news project a far different image.
"Until things stabilize, it is hard to believe that informed American consumers are going to pay upscale prices for anything from the Soviet Union that you have to put in your mouth," said Edward Keenan, a professor of history at Harvard University.
Struggling vodka importers admit people seem edgy. "A lot of people are asking about quality," said Everard Marks of Euro Trade Inc. "What they are really asking is: "Is it made in somebody's barn?' "
It could get worse -- and it does. The brew that Euro Trade imports, Tarkhuna, is a "flavored vodka." And it is flavored not with lemon or pepper -- which Americans are just now getting used to -- but with tarragon. It has a pale green tinge and a label of vaguely Stalinist design, but is from the now-independent Soviet republic of Georgia. Its ads read: "Georgia On My Mind."
That may only confuse consumers more. Those who perceive that it is not a peach liqueur from suburban Savannah probably have only one other Georgian image on their minds, thanks to American advertising: a heavily mustachioed people in fur hats who attribute their longevity to yogurt.
Besides, even though vodka is the best-selling liquor in the United States, it's a shrinking market; alcohol sales fell 7 percent last year. "There is no crying need for another imported vodka," said Nicolas Furlotte, editorial director of the Jobson Corporation's annual survey of the liquor industry. He was recently approached by a Czech company eager to export its vodka. "We told them, 'Who needs it?' " he said.
The irony of all this is that Stolichnaya created the "premium vodka" category with its made-in-the-land-that-invented-it image. But because it was a state monopoly, no other Soviet vodkas were exported. So the Swedes, Finns and even the British jumped into the category with Absolut, Finlandia and Tanqueray Sterling and ate up Stolichnaya's market share.
Absolut alone has triple the sales and triple the advertising budget of Stolichnaya. Now a newcomer has to advertise heavily to get into that category -- and those magazine pages and billboards can't be bought with, say, Ukrainian ruble coupons.
 
Invading Afghanistan Hurts Sales
 For Pepsi, supply problems and new competition are simply more hurdles in what has always been a difficult relationship. Stolichnaya's "real Russian" heritage has always proved something of a two-edged sword.
After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Americans hunting for a way to protest it seized upon dumping bottles of Stoly. Sales dropped 40 percent. They climbed back up, only to plunge again after Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Russian fighter in 1983.
"Our sales curve has been a barometer of East-West relations," said John Swanhaus, president of Pepsico Wines and Spirits International.
Still, even though history is hardly cooperating with capitalist plans, importers like Mr. Onish are pressing bravely on. He still even defends his appropriation of Mrs. Gorbachev's name (to which he added the extra "s" in case the Gorbachevs objected to the scheme).
"This is the year of the woman," he said. Then he began improvising further: "You know what I like about the name? If you look at 'Raissa' real fast, it looks like 'Russia.' "

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
SNARL OF RED TAPE KEEPS U.S. CHECKS FROM STORM AREAS

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Government's lifeline to people caught in disasters, is so understaffed and consumed by paperwork that tens of thousands of victims of Hurricane Andrew are unlikely to get immediate financial help when they need it most.
Few have seen a check yet, and many others have been told that it will be weeks more before they can even apply for aid.
The main problem seems to be red tape that keeps even the most dedicated agency workers from doing more than helping the hurricane victims fill out forms.
 
16 Centers for Thousands
 Of scores of people interviewed over the last week, not one had yet received a Government check, and many others were still trying to apply for one. A major Homestead bank that has been operating since the day after the storm hit on Aug. 24 said it had seen numerous checks from insurance companies but no Federal relief checks.
The emergency management agency has set up 16 temporary Disaster Assistance Centers in Dade County, most in tents, where several hundred registrars help people fill out forms for subsistence and home-repair grants. The registrars also steer people to other workers at the centers who can help, including counselors from the Small Business Administration, which provides loans to qualified businesses and homeowners, and the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
The management agency also takes information for grant applications by telephone, although working telephones are hard to find in badly battered communities like Homestead, Florida City and Cutler Ridge. And some centers have begun dispatching bilingual aides into neighborhoods where people are clinging to the ruins of their homes.
But many of the estimated 200,000 people left homeless have still not been reached, and when lines build up at the assistance centers, the storm victims are given appointments to come back days and even weeks later.
"What do we do in the meantime?" Juanita Mosely said after she was told to come back between 10 A.M. and noon on Sept. 26.
The agency said that by Wednesday it had paid out $500,000 in several hundred checks to grant applicants in Florida, for an average payment of less than $2,000. The five disaster centers in Louisiana, a state that took less of a hurricane blow than Florida, had dispatched 169 checks totaling $228,000.
"We are writing checks faster than in any other disaster," said Andrea Booher, a spokeswoman for the emergency management agency.
As he rushed off from a quick inspection of an assistance center in Homestead, Antonio Perez, an associate director of the agency, said, "F.E.M.A.'s doing just great despite what your newspaper is reporting."
 
No Checks at a Bank
 Whatever the amounts, it is almost impossible to find anyone who has received a check from either the emergency management agency or the Small Business Administration. Likely people to come across the checks are cashiers at the First National Bank of Homestead, whose main office reopened the day after the storm. Through a week when nearly all other banks remained out of commission, First National cashed checks and took deposits for all comers, customers or not.
"We are not seeing any Government checks," Bob Jensen, a First National vice president, said late this week.
Mr. Jensen said that he was seeing checks only from insurance companies to policyholders and that the first of those to show up were for immediate living expenses, typically $2,500 to $5,000. Lately, he said, he was seeing much larger amounts for the full value of homes that were destroyed.
One day this week, Juanita Mosley, whose Southern Gentleman barber shop in Cutler Ridge is shut down and strewn with the debris of a collapsed ceiling, joined the line of 20 people at the assistance center in the parking lot of Cutler Ridge Mall. Ms. Mosley, who has owned the shop for 22 years, said she could not find her landlord to ask if he would rebuild the barber shop space. She had recently let her insurance expire while she looked at other policies.
"I don't have a business," Ms. Mosley said. "I don't have a home. I don't have an income."
Many people here do not buy insurance other than personal liability coverage for their cars. This is a low-wage economy of clerks and farm workers who typically do not own much personal property or have the disposable income to pay for insurance.
At the center, operating from folding tables and chairs under two candy-cane-striped canopies, 10 counselors worked patiently, most straight through lunch in 90-degree heat filling out the emergency agency's 29-question Disaster Assistance Registration/ Application forms. One of the smaller centers, it is also the most productive in putting through applications quickly, agency figures show.
 
'Mass of People' in Need
 "I'm finding that we have a mass of people that need help now," said Jimmy Wheeler, the center's manager, who stood at his post all day greeting people. "We try to find out what type of assistance they need."
But there is little the counselors can actually do. The center cannot approve applications or shed light on how much money applicants might get, when they will get it or whether they will get any at all.
There was still less the center could do for Ms. Mosley. When she came to the front of the line after a 20-minute wait, Mr. Wheeler gave her an Appointment Information form inviting her back on Sept. 26.
Yet Ms. Mosley was luckier than people who came later. By mid-afternoon, when Margaret McBean, 37, got in line, appointments were backing up, and she was asked to come back on Oct. 2.
"Four kids and they put you on hold," said Ms. McBean, a medical secretary who is separated from her husband.
"I can't go to work," she added. "My car's windshield is broke. We don't have no electricity or water. I need to move somewhere. I don't have savings. I live from paycheck to paycheck, like everybody else.
"You listen to the radio saying the Government is going to help you. Where do they help you? 'Go fill out this application and wait.' I can't wait one month, two months."
Ms. Mosley and Ms. McBean might have been immediately served if they had gone to one of the centers that, because of their remote locations, have been getting little business.
"They're not limited to going to that center in their neighborhood," said Jim Aguirre, a spokesman for the emergency management agency. But at the Cutler Ridge center, no one advised people to try elsewhere.
In general, information of the centers is spread by word of mouth and by radio. But most of the centers are so poorly marked that a person could pass by without realizing they are there. There is little uniformity in appearance or organization.
In addition to location, luck is a factor in getting processed. On a recent day, the counselors at Mr. Wheeler's center were told that if long lines formed appointments were to be given for Oct. 7, but rain cut down on the number of visitors to the center, allowing counselors to meet with all comers.
 
Bureaucratic Caution
 What seems to be involved here is a conflict between compassion and caution, with the emphasis on caution. The emergency management agency and the Small Business Administration want to be alert to fraud and the criticism of taxpayers and Congressmen. "We don't have someone willy-nilly writing checks," Mr. Aguirre said.
But because of the scrutiny given to applications, the agency can violate another of its missions: helping people quickly and making sure that, as an agency flier puts it, "people have a safe place to live until their homes can be prepared."
Both agencies are also under budget constraints that prevent them from sending enough counselors and investigators into the area to speed the work. And as big organizations, they can be slow in responding to the ever-changing needs of people here.
Although F.E.M.A. has dealt with scores of disasters in the 13 years since President Jimmy Carter established it, the agency is learning as it goes in confronting what is proving to be the costliest natural disaster in the nation's history. On Thursday, for example, the agency told its registrars to disregard 14 of the 29 questions on the assistance form.
 
Adapting to Needs
 Typically at the centers here, a hurricane victim approaches the manager, who makes a quick assessment of the person's needs and assigns him to a registrar. If the registrars are backed up, the manager sets up an appointment to return.
The registrar first helps fill out the disaster application form and tries to see if the applicant has enough income to carry an Small Business Administration loan for up to $100,000 for home repairs or up to $500,000 to re-establish his business. If the applicant qualifies, he is sent home with a big manila envelope, addressed to the S.B.A., that contains other forms and requests for documents like tax returns, even though for many people such records blew away with their roofs.
People with little or no income and little insurance can apply for grants of up to $11,500 to repair their homes. And every person with a damaged home, whatever his or her income, can apply for a grant to pay for three or four months rent, based on rental costs in the area and the emergency management agency's determination of the family's housing needs.
Each grant seeker is told that in 8 to 10 days an inspector will contact him to set up a time to visit and verify his claims. The applicant is also given an (800) telephone number with which he can track his application's progress or report a new address. Once an applicant finds a working a phone, however, the (800) number is often busy.
 
Paper, but No Money
 A few people seem fed up with their visits to the assistance centers. An unshaven man who appeared to be in his late 50's bolted from the big center in Homestead, saying, "Yeah, I got help. A lot of paper but no money.
Another man, Jerry Beard, who wanted a small-business loan to replace lost equipment, seemed befuddled by the paper chase the Homestead center was sending him on. "I was here 40 minutes, and I've got enough stuff to keep me busy for a month," said Mr. Beard, who owns Jerry's Pest Control.
David Banks stopped at a center, waited in line for an hour, gave up and then came upon another, in the parking lot of the Naranja Park Baptist Church. That center is one of the more remote ones, and with no one in line, Mr. Banks was able to sit down with a registrar immediately.
Like many people here, Mr. Banks lost both his home and his business, a auto-repair business in which he went to people who would call him or send him a fax. He still has his truck but his home was demolished. He has moved to an apartment in Miami but has not been able to get his phone numbers transferred and so cannot get work. In addition, he said, he has lost a lot of his tools.
Mr. Banks's house was insured, and the insurance company has given him $2,000 in living expenses. He used all but $132 of that to get his temporary apartment -- $619 for a month's rent and the rest for security and a deposit.
The registrar chided him for spending so much of the money, Mr. Banks said, adding, "They know nothing about rents around here. That just got me four walls to live in."
The registrar gave Mr. Banks forms and told him to come back when the insurance company contacted about reimbursing him for the loss of his home. "Then another guy here said, 'Forget that. Come back tomorrow,' " Mr. Banks said. "I'm coming back tomorrow."
"What angers me most," he continued, "is that their favorite answers are, 'Wait a minute,' and 'I don't know.' Nobody has any idea of when the money is going to be available. One guy says seven days. Another guy says two weeks. I expect it to be a long, long time."
 
Getting On With Life
 With the immediate trauma of the hurricane over, many people applying for aid seem worn down but working to reassemble the order of their lives, and many say they get sympathetic hearings at the assistance centers.
"We don't have a check, but at least we have a number now," said Frances Blackwelder, whose home and furniture store were destroyed.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Strategy;
Recasting Bush Isn't Easy, Baker and Aides Discover

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD with THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
From their State Department perch six blocks west of the West Wing, the Baker team had scoffed and raged for two years about the clumsy attempts of Bush officials to deal with politics and domestic affairs. The foreign affairs "whiz kids," as they liked to think of themselves, could not always hide their contempt for what they saw as a slapstick, slapdash White House operation.
When the country turned inward after the Persian Gulf war, when Los Angeles burned, when Ross Perot tapped into voter disgust, James A. Baker 3d and his band of fortysome thing aides looked over at the White House in wonder. What they saw was President Bush and his advisers squandering record-high approval ratings through their failure to understand the anxiety of Americans in economic pain and to offer a convincing plan to solve their problems.
 
Fixing the Mechanics
 But now that they have commandeered the White House, members of the Baker SWAT team confide that they are coming to grips with the fact that it is not so easy to ride to the rescue. They are, after all, operating within the constraints of a Reagan-Bush legacy that has dismantled important levers of government, especially in the domestic agencies. They are also working with a President who had wasted political capital for four years by scorning the idea that he needed to communicate, or even develop, a coherent theme and long-range strategy for his Presidency. 
 Their initial steps have been largely mechanical: brisker, more focused daily White House meetings; more substantive Presidential speeches tied to specific initiatives and a fresh cordon of trusted aides to manage the President on the road.
 
So Much to Do; So Little Time
 This may be the first Administration in history that is scrambling for its first-100-days plan in its last 60 days before facing the voters. With Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas still leading in the polls and with more bad news in the latest economic figures, the Baker team quickly has to get beyond long-overdue, elementary improvements in organization to a fundamental recasting of the Bush persona and campaign.
One of the reasons George Bush is in trouble is that his image now is of wanting to be President more than of wanting to accomplish things as President. A key to Ronald Reagan's success was that he always managed to convey the impression that he would rather be back in California riding a horse but had to stay in Washington to enact his ideas. Now Mr. Baker and his aides are expected to come up instantly with the ideas that will justify Mr. Bush's urgent desire to stay in Washington.
Like students cramming the night before an exam, the Baker aides are closeted in their offices, steeped in paper, coffee and Diet Cokes, working late into the night to come up with campaign themes and attack lines, driving everyone at the campaign headquarters crazy by calling every few minutes to find out Bill Clinton's position on one thing or another. The group who knew a lot more about the inner workings of the Russian economy is frantically working out economic recovery ideas for America -- which they expect to unveil shortly.
Even as Janet G. Mullins, the new Bush campaign liaison, was still trying to figure out where the White House ladies' room was, and Margaret D. Tutwiler, the new White House communications director, was still asking officials down the hall, "Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but who are you and what do you do?" they were hit with Hurricane Andrew, the sour aftertaste of the Republican National Convention and the pungent reality of the mess they had inherited.
 
Mood of Desperados
 While he enjoys polishing his image as a wily court magician, Mr. Baker knows he will be lucky to get out this time with his cape and rabbits intact.
It is one more fascinating twist to the 35-year friendship and rivalry of the Tex-prep friends that, in some ways, the better Mr. Baker does, the worse Mr. Bush will look, because it will underscore the President's Zelig-like tendency to be as clever as his nearest adviser. "If Baker is the great pooh-bah and savior, it makes George Bush look weak, doesn't it?" noted Lyn Nofziger, the White House political director under President Reagan, who regards Mr. Baker as an overrated self-promoter who has put his own interests ahead of those of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush.
The mood of the Baker team is a mix of anger at having to move in at this late stage, terror at the prospect of being labeled failures and thrill at the thought of beating the odds. They have been swamped trying to simultaneously figure out everything from who runs the White House fax machines to who can be relied on to get things done in the government agencies.
When they were at the State Department, "We knew who you talk to, how you move things, who you can trust, if you want to establish a no-fly zone over southern Iraq," one Baker aide said privately, because they are all trying to keep low profiles. "But we had to learn about southern Florida. So you go ask people questions, but you don't know who really knows, so you don't know whose answers you can trust. In the State Department, you pull a lever and you have a pretty good idea what is going to happen on the other end, and if it doesn't happen you know just where to kick or jiggle."
Mr. Baker had made it clear over the years that he agreed with critics who charged that the autocratic former chief of staff, John H. Sununu, had surrounded himself with a second-rate staff. But the officials brought in by Mr. Sununu and those brought in by his successor, Samuel K. Skinner -- layers that curl outside Mr. Baker's inner circle like rings on a tree trunk -- seem sincerely relieved at the arrival of the C-Street cleanup crew, even though some were evicted from their coveted West Wing offices.
The only antidote to the ingrained Washington instincts for envy, turf-fighting and backstabbing, it would seem, is the fear of humiliating defeat. As one top Bush campaign official sees it: "At some point the prospect of being hanged in a fortnight focuses you on avoiding the noose. You can worry about the location of your cell later."
It is a measure of the chaos that Bush officials talk gratefully about how James Baker has stripped them of titles and power. They describe themselves as a sort of dysfunctional family craving an authority figure -- a role that the genial Mr. Bush did not want to play or even delegate.
Under Mr. Skinner, officials said, meetings meandered without a clear agenda or a sense of who was responsible for what. "There was no centralized authority or forward motion," said one top White House official. "If you wanted a decision overturned, all you needed to do was wait 30 minutes or call another meeting. Now people play the roles they are designed to play."
 
Genius, in Comparison
 It has not gone unnoticed that Richard G. Darman, the budget director, does not try to use his sharp elbows on Mr. Baker, his former boss in the Reagan White House, and instead goes along tamely. Mr. Baker has also reclaimed White House control over the campaign schedule of Vice President Dan Quayle, a potential rival for the 1996 nomination should both men's careers survive this election.
Although there have been plenty of "White House in disarray" headlines over the past few years, the extent of drift is vividly underlined by the way veteran White House officials rave about some of the basic administrative changes instituted by Mr. Baker. What would look like standard operating procedure is hailed as another example of Mr. Baker's administrative "genius."
For instance, one senior Bush aide gushed over the way Mr. Baker has made sure that the President's speeches "deal with real issues now," have only one theme and are no longer written on Air Force One at the last minute. Speech writers no longer have to come on each trip to cut and paste because speeches are prepared in advance under the direction of Robert B. Zoellick, the brainy deputy chief of staff who makes even the buttoned-down Mr. Baker look like a blithe spirit.
Other proferred examples of Mr. Baker's skill: If someone rambles off the subject at a meeting, the new chief of staff steers him back to the subject at hand, and each meeting is expected to produce solutions.
 
Taming the Meetings
 Mr. Baker and his aides know that this is not rocket science, and they privately reflect some resentment about having to leave the State Department to inject the sort of order and substance that Mr. Bush might easily have had all along.
Before he meets with the President at 8 A.M., Mr. Baker holds a 7:30 meeting, which is attended by the core group that has moved from State -- Mr. Zoellick and his equally well-organized colleagues, Miss Tutwiler, Ms. Mullins and Dennis Ross, the policy planning chief -- as well as Mr. Darman; Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman; Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and the downsized campaign directors, Frederic V. Malek and Robert M. Teeter. The same group meets at 6 P.M. to see where things stand.
"We had one meeting that lasted 45 minutes," an aide said. "I came out and said to Scowcroft: 'God, that took a long time. Why did it have to take that long?' And he said: "Long? We would have spent four hours on that before.' "
 
Next, the Vision Thing
 Once again, Mr. Baker is directing the campaign from Washington and giving the often unfocused Mr. Bush clear guidance by surrounding him with a trio of aides on the campaign plane: Mr. Fitzwater, who deals with the press; David Q. Bates, a former Bush aide and tennis partner who has returned to keep track of local politics and make certain that Mr. Bush shakes all the right hands and knows the mayor from the governor, and Phillip D. Brady, who makes certain the President stays abreast of his daily duties as chief executive.
But everyone agrees that discipline will only go so far; the content of the President's message must be improved.
Baker aides say privately that, while the convention may have helped consolidate the Republican base, it was in many ways "a wasted opportunity." Mr. Clinton went into the Democratic convention with a major issue hanging over his head -- the "character question." He tried to resolve it as best he could and reaped the benefits in the polls.
Mr. Bush went into his convention with a major issue hanging over his head -- the need to convey that he had an economic plan to deal with restructuring the military industry, jobs, competitiveness, productivity. He did not address it and did not get the kick in the polls.
The Baker aides, insisting that "we get it," say they are drawing up a trellis of speeches, appearances, sound bites and Government initiatives intended to persuade a skeptical public that Mr. Bush actually has a domestic policy.
 
A One-Two-Three Punch
 The President's appearances last Wednesday, one official said, previewed a blueprint for the new three-pronged approach: Speech. Action. Attack.
The President met with farmers in South Dakota and aircraft workers in Texas, and the theme of his remarks was "economic security." The related concrete action was his announcement of disaster relief and $1 billion in export assistance for wheat farmers, as well as the sale of 150 F-16's to Taiwan that would provide jobs for 6,000 Texas aircraft workers. The companion attack on Mr. Clinton charged that he had a wishy-washy position on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But even some of the most devoted Administration advocates wonder whether it is too late for Mr. Bush to transform himself into the Domestic President.
"The more they come up with now, the more people will ask, 'Where were you before?' " said one old friend of Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker.
Mr. Baker, who spent a generous portion of his time as Mr. Reagan's chief of staff schmoozing with the press, has refused so far to see any reporters since moving to the White House. Disappointed at having to give up his statesman's mantle, disdainful of his "handler" moniker, knowing that this is going to be an ugly race, Mr. Baker is keeping his head down.
The President, by contrast, has a new bounce in his step. As one aide notes, "He likes the new sense of stability."

HEADLINE: Auto Workers End Walkout Against G.M.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Striking workers at a General Motors parts plant in Lordstown, Ohio, overwhelmingly approved an agreement today to end the nine-day strike that had shut much of the auto maker's domestic production and idled more than 40,000 workers nationwide.
At a meeting in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, 98 percent of the workers voting approved the deal, officials of the United Automobile Workers union said. Union and company spokesmen said they expected workers to begin returning to their jobs tonight. 
 "We've got a skeleton crew in there now getting the plant ready, and we'll be up and running by this evening," David Kimmel, the president of U.A.W. local 1714, told Reuters.
An important issue in the dispute was the General Motors plan to close a tool-and-die shop at the Lordstown plant that employed 240 workers. Under the compromise reached today, G.M. agreed to keep the shop open at least through January 1994. After then, it will be free to close the operation.
Linda Cook, a General Motors spokeswoman, said this schedule was "slower, but not a great deal slower" than what the company had sought. She said G.M. would continue to move tool-and-die work from Lordstown to some of its other 10 shops in four states and Canada, while the workers in the Lordstown shop would have the option of retraining, transfer or early retirement.
General Motors also agreed to shift to the Lordstown plant additional stamping work on the company's 1995 model-year replacement for the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird cars. That work, previously planned for other plants, will add about 140 jobs at the plant.
"You never get everything you want, but we feel it's a good agreement," Mr. Kimmel said. "We feel we will be able to offer any one of our members affected by the tool-and-die shop closing the opportunity to stay at Lordstown."
 
Effort to Cut Costs
 G.M., which lost $4.5 billion last year, has embarked on a campaign of shutting plants and trimming 74,000 jobs from its payroll to reduce costs and turn itself into a leaner, more competitive company.
While both sides said they were happy with the agreement, the first reaction from Wall Street was that G.M. is still moving too slowly to cut costs.
"I would certainly characterize this as a victory for the union and a defeat for G.M.," John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim, Schroeder & Company, told Reuters. "The market feels that G.M. must downsize as quickly as possible, and these types of settlements are slowing down the process."
The 240 jobs in Lordstown that the company proposed to eliminate thus became a symbol of far broader plans, and the negotiations themselves presaged the talks between G.M. and the auto workers next year over a contract for all the assembly plants.
Parts shipments to G.M. assembly plants across the country could be resumed during the holiday weekend, union and company officials said, and Ms. Cook said some but not all of the nine G.M. assembly plants closed by the strike could open on Tuesday,
Labor relations experts, G.M.'s competitors and industry analysts are certain to analyze the dispute to see how resolute G.M.'s new president, John F. Smith Jr., is about reducing costs.
The dispute is also a key test of leadership for Stephen Yokich, vice president of the union's G.M. department, and the leading candidate to succeed Owen Bieber as president three years from now. Mr. Yokich and the union have made job security the union's top priority, but not everyone in the union is sure about his tactics.
Michael Bennett, the head of the U.A.W.'s local at G.M.'s Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., had publicly questioned the wisdom of crippling the auto maker's overall production for the sake of an issue that affects one plant and relatively few workers. The Saturn plant, whose car models are in great demand, was forced to shut because it lacked parts produced at Lordstown.
 
Fight Over Tool-and-Die Shop
 G.M. had told the union it wished to consolidate tool-and-die operations elsewhere, closing the Lordstown shop. The union countered that G.M. was trying to give tool-and-die work to nonunion suppliers.
Candace Howes, an assistant professor of economics at University of Notre Dame and a former researcher for the auto workers' union, said G.M.'s strategy of reducing labor costs "doesn't gain you much and undermines any opportunity for real cooperation."
Although the union has not said so explicitly, its decision to strike almost certainly was motivated by the campaign to lower G.M.'s costs that is being carried out by J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a Spanish engineer who was named G.M.'s vice president of worldwide purchasing four months ago by Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith was named president only a month before that after G.M. directors became impatient with the slowness of change under G.M.'s former president, Lloyd E. Reuss, who was demoted.
Only a few months earlier, G.M. management had announced it would close 21 plants and eliminate 74,000 jobs through the mid-1990's.
The shakeup in G.M.'s management ranks and Mr. Lopez's cost-cutting edicts to suppliers have made the union fearful that they soon may be asked to forgo job security, wage and medical benefits, which are the most extensive and costly in American industry.
The strike at Lordstown signaled the U.A.W.'s determination that it would not give up jobs or benefits without a fight. The length of the strike signaled Mr. Smith's determination not to cave in to the union too quickly.
The strike at the metal-stamping plant had halted production of parts needed for 14 G.M. models and idled more than 32,500 workers at seven plants by Friday morning. Two more assembly plants, in Wilmington, Del., and Lansing, Mich., were closed late Friday night because of a lack of parts.
The other affected plants were in Oklahoma City; Wentzville, Mo.; Flint, Mich.; Baltimore; Orion Township, Mich.; Spring Hill, Tenn., and a plant adjacent to the parts plant in Lordstown.
G.M. and the union's Local 1112 settled similar grievances at a second Lordstown operation on Thursday.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Farm Policy;
NO ADDED MONEY IN FARM AID PLAN

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Wheat farmers who were promised $1 billion in export subsidies by President Bush on Wednesday will find that sum more than offset by reductions in domestic programs that help them, Bush Administration officials now acknowledge.
The Administration is counting on the increase in exports to result in slightly higher domestic wheat prices. The higher prices in turn would reduce Government payments to farmers under domestic programs by $1.7 billion. 
 The farmers will still come out slightly ahead because of the higher prices. A third of their crop is not covered by Federal price guarantees and farmers actually receive the market price for this wheat. But the largesse will be far less than the impression created by the President.
The net gain for Federal coffers is not just budgetary alchemy. The calculations assume that foreign wheat producers will make up the difference by giving up a part of their share of the international market to American farmers.
 
Communications Breakdown
 Public statements from the Agriculture Department and the White House on Wednesday did not spell out how the Federal Government would pay for the subsidies, and Administration officials did little to counteract the impression this week that the subsidies represented a new bonanza for wheat farmers.
Robert E. Grady, the executive associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and the White House's top expert on export finance, said that the Administration had not tried to mislead anyone and that few journalists had asked him about the budget consequences of the program.
But he added that the Administration's explanations of the program might have been inadequate. "That may be part of our broader communications failure," Mr. Grady said.
Some export subsidies announced by President Bush represent the renewal of dozens of existing programs for foreign countries. These programs have been announced separately each year by the Agriculture Department since the export program began seven years ago, said Stephen L. Censky, the acting administrator of the Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
When told of the Bush Administration's budget calculations for the export subsidies, Gene B. Sperling, the economic director for Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential candidate, said similar calculations of savings could be made for many programs but were often not justifiable.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Trade, said the Administration should have fully disclosed the domestic spending cuts when it announced the export program. "This has been the problem with the Administration's job-training program, the aid to hurricane victims in Florida and now the wheat exports -- they don't tell you where the revenues are coming from," he said.
Mr. Matsui, who was asked to comment, added that he was skeptical of the Administration's planned savings on domestic farm programs and worried that the export subsidies might add to the deficit.
As more American wheat is sold abroad, overseas prices fall. So the main effect of President Bush's spending change is to take away other countries' share of the international wheat market.
Foreign grain-producing countries are predictably furious. The most angry are countries like Australia, which has have few subsidy programs and whose farmers will directly feel the brunt of President Bush's decision.
"We deeply regret that domestic political pressures have overridden a U.S. commitment to the pursuit of a less corrupted international trading environment for farm products," said Prime Minister P. J. Keating of Australia in a statement on Wednesday.
The United States will now subsidize sales in Asian markets where wheat sells for about $3.50 a bushel, compared with $2.90 a bushel in markets where the United States and the European Community are subsidizing exports. For example, President Bush is nearly doubling the tonnage of subsidized sales to China, to 250 million bushels, and is adding India and Pakistan to the program.
With the spread of subsidies to Asian markets, Australian farmers may be forced to lower their export prices.
While the wheat export subsidy program announced by President Bush will cost close to $1 billion, it will save the Federal Government as much as $1.69 billion in domestic spending on wheat farmer assistance, said Mr. Censky of the Agriculture Department.
Under a program that currently covers two-thirds of the nation's two-billion-bushel wheat crop, the Federal Government guarantees farmers a price of at least $4 a bushel for their wheat. Wheat has been selling in the last week for $3.20 to $3.34 a bushel, making farmers eligible for Government payments of 66 to 80 cents a bushel.
By encouraging wheat exports and raising domestic prices, the subsidies announced by President Bush will mean that the deficiency payments will be smaller.
 
Plan Called Budget Neutral
 As a result, the export-subsidy program, "has always been scored by O.M.B. as budget neutral and still is," Mr. Grady said. "By driving the price up, you reduce the cost of our domestic programs."
Mr. Grady and Mr. Censky said the main benefit for farmers would come on the one-third of wheat production that is not eligible for price supports and for which farmers actually receive the prevailing price in the United States. The price of wheat for September delivery rose 5.5 cents to $3.2525 a bushel on Tuesday, when rumors of the export subsidies reached many traders, and climbed another 8.75 cents on Wednesday. On Friday they closed at $3.30.
Wheat can be ineligible for the price support program either because farmers choose not to meet the program's paperwork requirements or because a farmer produces more wheat per acre than the Federal Government allows in its payments program.
The United States subsidized the export of 680 million bushels of wheat during the crop year ended on June 30, 1992, and will subsidize the export of up to 1.1 billion bushels by the end of next June under President Bush's plan.
 
If Other Countries Retaliate
 But private experts cautioned that not all the new subsidies might be used if exports fall short of that level, which could happen if other countries step up their subsidies to avoid losing their shares of the world market to the United States.
The effect of the export subsidies on consumers will be too small to notice, because wheat is mainly used as an ingredient in processed foods and as animal feed, said Daniel A. Sumner, the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Economics. He pointed out that wheat accounts for only 2 cents of the cost of a loaf of bread.
"Any consumer effect is very small -- if it's measurable at all, it's negligible," Mr. Sumner said today.

HEADLINE: EUROPEANS RETAIN CURRENCY VALUES

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Faced with the possibility of a major setback to European unification if French voters reject the union treaty, the 12 European Community nations sought today to ease growing economic strains but ended up again confronting their conflicting domestic priorities.
European finance ministers, meeting in Bath, England, amid turmoil in monetary markets, reiterated their commitment to the current European Monetary System, under which their nations have agreed to keep their currencies linked in value within a relatively narrow range. 
 They also discussed how they might respond if a French referendum on Sept. 20 goes against the next stage of European unification. Uncertainty over the outcome of the vote has widened the disparity in the values of key European currencies.
Investors -- nervous about the outlook for economic growth in Europe if the process of unification is slowed or stopped -- have been putting their money into the German mark, which is widely seen as the world's most stable major currency.
But as the value of the mark has gained in relation to other currencies, officials and economists have raised questions about the willingness and ability of nations to maintain even their current level of monetary coordination.
 
Germans Prove Unwilling
 The finance ministers failed to elicit what they most wanted, a signal from Germany that it would cut its interest rates. Instead, they said Germany had indicated only that it would not raise interest rates further under current economic conditions.
High German rates have contributed to the mark's surge, and to a corresponding drop in the value of some other European currencies and of the dollar as investors seeking higher returns put their money in mark-denominated accounts.
Bonn's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, offered little hope of changes at a news conference today. "Everybody knows that lower interest rates have to be earned," he said, "and can't be ordered at the stroke of a pen."
The turmoil in the monetary markets and the uncertainty over the outcome of the French referendum have emerged as the clearest tests yet of the willingness of European governments to maintain their coordinated approach to economic policy in the face of growing domestic economic pressures.
In Britain, for example, some members of the governing Conservative Party have challenged their leaders to explain why they should remain committed to a European policy rather than concentrating on what is best for the British economy.
 
Accepting Short-Term Pain
 Despite doubts in the currency and stock markets and among some economists and government officials, the finance ministers have repeatedly restated their commitment to coordinate their currency values.
In Britain and Italy, the nations whose money has been most weakened, they have done so in part by taking actions that carry a short-term cost to their domestic economies. These moves include raising or threatening to raise interest rates in hope of reaping long-term benefits like lower inflation. The pain is borne by would-be homeowners seeking mortgages or entrepreneuurs in need of loans.
Italy, for example, raised its benchmark discount rate sharply on Friday -- to 15 percent from 13.25 percent, in an attempt to halt a rapid erosion in the value of the lira. The Government made the decision to increase rates despite a deep recession, suggesting its willingness to risk a domestic political backlash to reap the longer-range benefits of a more stable currency.
Norman Lamont, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, said today that Britain, too, stood ready to raise rates if necessary. On Thursday, Mr. Lamont said Britain would begin an innovative program to borrow $14.5 billion worth of foreign currencies and use the proceeds to buy sterling in the hopes of bolstering the pound's value.
 
No Revaluation Now
 Mr. Lamont, as the chairman of today's meeting of the finance ministers, said the European Community nations had again rejected the possibility of revaluing their currencies. A revaluation would remove the need for higher interest rates or heavy central bank intervention in those nations with weak currencies. But it could lead to higher inflation and perhaps higher interest rates in the long run.
"We are not in favor of altering exchange-rate parities," the Chancellor said after the meeting, "and it is a very important part of the process of monetary coordination that we see greater stability within the European Monetary System."
But economists and officials question whether the European governments will be able to maintain their resolve if the French vote no on union and other currencies drop further against the mark. They said that ultimately the British pound, the lira and perhaps the French franc might have to be devalued to avoid domestic economic pain, especially if Germany holds its ground on high interest rates.
"I think the probability of the European Monetary System sticking together even in the event of a no vote remains very high," said Peter Spencer, chief economist for Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. "But I think it's also very likely that it will revert to something closer to what it was in the early 80's, when countries under pressure were allowed to devalue."

HEADLINE: Chamorro Dismisses Her Police Chief, a Sandinista

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 5

 BODY:
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro removed her Sandinista police chief and 11 of his closest aides today, but the changes may not have met Bush Administration conditions for the renewal of economic aid.
Mrs. Chamorro, trying to juggle the pressures of the United States with the resistance of the opposition Sandinista Front, replaced the police chief, Rene Vivas, with another Sandinista, though of much lower profile. 
 The State Department, in part pressured by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, was believed to have urged Mrs. Chamorro in recent days to replace both the police and the army leadership with non-Sandinistas. When she defeated the Sandinistas in elections in February 1990, she promised to keep them in those roles.
Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista leader Mrs. Chamorro defeated, said he and other top Sandinistas met with aides to Mrs. Chamorro earlier this week and warned that the country would suffer a profound crisis if the Government bent to American pressure.
In a letter to President Bush published today in the Sandinista newspaper Barricada, Mr. Ortega said Washington was "promoting a witch hunt against those citizens who maintain their adhesion to Sandinista thinking."
When President Chamorro swore in her new police leader, Fernando Caldera Azmitia, she made no reference to the United States and insisted that the changes were part of an effort to create a professional civilian police force.
She also swore in a new vice minister for public security, a civilian, who will have direct authority over the police, serving under the Minister of Government, Alfredo Mendieta. The new vice minister, Ronald Aviles, is a cattleman and businessman.
Mr. Mendieta made the only reference to the United States during the announcements, saying in answer to a reporter's question that "we have excellent relations with the United States Government."
When Mrs. Chamorro was elected the United States accepted her reasoning that the Sandinistas might interfere with her Government and that retaining Sandinista leaders was necessary to preserve peace after the civil war.
However, for more than a year, leaders of Mrs. Chamorro's own electoral coalition have been saying it is time to remove the Sandinistas.
Mr. Vivas and a number of regional police chiefs have also been accused of abusive and repressive policies against demobilized members of the Nicaraguan Resistance, or contras, the American-backed force that fought the Sandinistas for a decade.
The Bush Administration, after long, quiet criticism of the Sandinista role, recently made its concerns public. Last spring, at the request of Senator Helms, it suspended the $104 million that remains of a $731-million two-year aid package approved after Mrs. Chamorro's election.
 
Aid Tied to Stabilization
 This week, a State Department delegation led by a deputy assistant secretary, John F. Maisto, met with top officials in Nicaragua, but neither side would release information on the talks.
Nicaragua desperately needs the aid at this point if it is to continue its largely successful currency stabilization program.
There is also concern that the United States might try to block financing from international agencies.
Mr. Caldera, whose title is director-general of police, has been accused in the anti-Sandinista press of repressive actions. Mr. Mendieta blamed the accusations on wartime conditions that were beyond the control of individual police chiefs.
Mr. Caldera, declaring that his conscience was clear, said he considered his responsibility to the Government to take precedence over his political affiliation as a Sandinista.
American diplomats said $5 million in emergency aid granted to Nicaragua this week after giant waves caused destruction along its Pacific coast did not come out of the $104 million in suspended aid but was a separate part of the package, marked for creating jobs, that had been held up by a decision of aid officials.

HEADLINE: Brazilian President Courts His Bureaucracy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Sept. 2

 BODY:
In one sunlit office of the marble and glass Presidential Palace here, an aide talked confidently today of President Fernando Collor de Mello's battle against impeachment and plans for a visit this month to the United States.
Two flights up, one corridor over, another presidential aide brusquely cut off a visitor who cautiously mentioned Brazil's Vice President. 
 "Not the Vice President -- the future President," the aide snapped, flaunting his hope that Vice President Itamar Franco would soon replace Mr. Collor, whose future has been clouded by an influence-peddling scandal.
Unable to control the loyalty of aides working within yards of his corner office, President Collor faces the larger problem of losing control of Brazil's huge federal bureaucracy. The cooperation of the bureaucracy will be crucial in coming weeks if the President is to succeed with his plan to win congressional loyalties through political patronage.
With an impeachment vote expected for October, the President must win the support of 168 lawmakers in the 502-member Chamber of Deputies. According to one newspaper poll, 31 deputies plan now to vote against impeachment. Using the federal budget, the President must win converts among the 117 listed as undecided or the 354 listed as favoring impeachment.
Complaining of what he called "Trojan horses" in his administration, the President is reportedly planning to shuffle his cabinet next week in three key areas: economy, justice and congressional liaison.
The Economy Minister, Marcilio Marques Moreira, has refused to print and to spend money for the pet projects of congressmen.
The Justice Minister, Celio Borja, has allowed the federal police to continue wide investigations into allegations of multimillion-dollar misappropriations by the Collor family.
The Minister of State, Jorge Bornhausen, has announced that he will not get into "a vote-buying game" with Congress.
But by replacing this group of ministers, called the Eticos, or the ethical ones, by the press, it is not clear that Brazil's President will be able to make the bureaucracy do his bidding.
"The congressmen are going to want the money up front -- they won't go for promises," said Antonio Martins, an aide in the congressional liaison office. "As it is now, the President can't even get a vice minister of economy to return his telephone call."
Indeed, resistance to Mr. Collor's strategy of trying to save his presidency at any cost is believed to be spreading among upper-level bureaucrats.
On the lower levels, the opposition Workers Party controls many public service unions, including the unions of bank employees and accountants. In the 1989 presidential election runoff, Brasilia was one of only a few major cities won by Luis Inacio da Silva, the Workers Party candidate.
Today, the president of Banco du Brasil, Lafaiete Coutinho, is reported to be active in channeling patronage from the federally administered bank to congressmen. But at one bank agency here this week, each worker's desk was decorated with yellow and blue anti-Collor signs saying, "Resign Now."
Just as bank employees cooperated with a congressional corruption inquiry, they are expected to drag their feet in carrying out a congressional vote-buying campaign.
Some may also blow whistles. During the congressional inquiry, depositions by an office secretary and a chauffeur at the presidential palace were crucial in unraveling the multimillion-dollar influence-trafficking ring.
Much of this city's hostility toward Mr. Collor date from his first weeks in office, when he started deriding civil servants and slashing their benefits. Anger deepened in recent months when it became clear that the President was not matching his comments with his own lifestyle.
Testimony and canceled checks indicated that while her husband was introducing a national policy of austerity, Rosane Collor de Mello was receiving a $20,000 monthly spending allowance from the influence-trafficking ring.

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Sanctions Taking High Toll

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAR, Yugoslavia, Sept. 3

 BODY:
With its vast but vacant wharfs, idle cranes and empty warehouses, the largest port in the truncated state of Yugoslavia presents a poignant image of the economic paralysis that is gripping the country and leaves no doubt that United Nations sanctions are causing widespread suffering.
Although port officials and people living close to the nearby Albanian border say some smuggling of cigarettes, liquor and fruit has occurred since the imposition of sanctions three months ago, they describe the quantities as small and portray the overall effect of the United Nations embargo as disastrous. 
 "Largely nothing has come in during the past three months, apart from one or two small boats bringing bananas and other fruit," said Budimir Vukcevic, the deputy director of the port. Gazing out to the Adriatic, where only a solitary vessel with a Greek flag broke a placid view of empty seas, he added, "Usually we would be unloading 15 to 20 boats and have another 15 vessels waiting to come in."
Photographs in the entrance to the port provide an image of such happier times. They showed timber, steel, grain and Yugo automobiles waiting to be loaded for export. Now there is nothing to be seen.
 
U.S. Officials Describe Evasion
 Such desolation contrasts with the measured accounts of the effects of the embargo given by Western diplomats in Belgrade. They described evasion of the sanctions as common and many of Yugoslavia's borders as extremely porous. United States officials, citing the frequent use of the transshipment ruse of labeling goods for delivery to Bosnia and Herzegovina that were actually sent to Serbia, say they favor tightening sanctions on Yugoslavia to bring an end to the war in Bosnia.
"The only alternative to the use of force is the tightening of sanctions," said one United States official in Belgrade, arguing for what he called a "check in, check out" system that would insure that any goods labeled for Bosnia really ended up there. He added that the current price of bribing Albanian border guards to allow merchandise through was 500 German marks, or about $360.
Along the Albanian border, however, a different picture emerges. Some people show off cigarettes that had been smuggled in, and say small items like candy and school notebooks are also entering Yugoslavia. But, said Rizo Muslijevic, a trader from Titograd, "these are not large amounts, just what people can carry."
At the port of Bar -- whose importance for Belgrade has grown since other major ports were lost to the now-independent states of Croatia and Slovenia -- there is no question that activity has ground to a halt. Virtually all the 2,000 workers have been laid off. While many of them could be employed early in the embargo on maintenance and construction, such work has been exhausted.
 
Money Runing Out
 Moreover, while all workers have been receiving a substantial proportion of their wages up to now, money is beginning to run out. "I think for September we may not be able to pay anything," Mr. Vukcevic said.
The problems of this port are widely shared. Crippled by sanctions and also by the dislocating effect of the breakup of Yugoslavia, most major industries have sent their workers home. United States officials estimate that by the end of this month, 50 to 80 percent of workers will be idle.
But up to now the social impact of this disaster has been diluted by the summer vacation period -- when many plants would be closed anyway -- and by the continued payment of wages.
The vacation period is now ending. Although the Serbian Government of the hard-line leader Slobodan Milosevic has promised companies emergency funds for their employees, industrialists say that the amounts are insufficient and that anger and anxiety among workers is certain to grow as they realize there will be no return to work.
Western officials hope that this anger will be channeled into powerful protests against Mr. Milosevic, which will in turn put pressure on him to end to the fighting in Bosnia. While that may happen, the bulk of the anger here does not now appear to be directed against the government.

HEADLINE: Chinese Seem to Be Risking More Open Protests

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The campaign by Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders for faster economic change seems to be having an unintended effect: Dissidents and ordinary citizens are becoming a bit bolder in challenging the authorities.
Partly because the hard-liners appear to be losing ground as the airwaves fill with calls for reform, many Chinese say they find the atmosphere looser and less ominous. Some say that the fear that has gripped the country for the last three years, since the Tiananmen Square crackdown of June 1989, is gradually easing. 
 Consequently, some dissidents are no longer hiding their activities. They now openly meet with foreign reporters, write for foreign publications and denounce human rights abuses in their country.
 
Overseas Publication
 Zhang Weiguo, a Shanghai journalist whose newspaper, The World Economic Herald, was closed during the Tiananmen democracy movement, is one of several democracy advocates who seem less afraid of the leadership than it is of him.
"I'm writing more articles now than when I was at The Herald," Mr. Zhang said in a recent interview in Shanghai. Since his articles cannot be published in China, he writes about China for leading newspapers in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and he has given telephone interviews to the BBC's Chinese-language service.
The security apparatus is clearly alarmed about such growing boldness, but it seems at a loss how to react. So the authorities settle for harassing Mr. Zhang, summoning him periodically for interrogation, as well as threatening him and refusing to allow him to leave Shanghai. But Mr. Zhang, who spent more than 20 months in prison after the 1989 crackdown, continues to speak.
Perhaps the only effective way to silence someone so fearless would be to re-arrest him and sentence him to a long prison term. But this might provoke a furor abroad, reinforce the image of China as a brutal and repressive place and increase the chance of American trade sanctions.
 
Order vs. Freedom
 The treatment of Mr. Zhang is relatively lenient compared with the repression of a few years ago -- in 1989, for example, a marine biology student named Chen Lantao was sentenced to 18 years simply for speaking against the Government.
As fear diminishes, China may be becoming a more open country -- but perhaps also a less stable one. For the three years after the army's crackdown, in which hundreds were killed, thousands hurt and many more imprisoned, the peace was preserved through a balance of terror: The people were afraid of the Government and the Government was afraid of the people.
Some of that fear lingers on both sides, but less than before. Some in the Government acknowledge their apprehension that people could eventually take to the streets and overthrow the Communists, but there is a clear division within the leadership about the nature of the threat.
Hard-liners say the risk comes primarily from the dissidents and from contact with the West, and so they favor harsh repression. But others -- including Mr. Deng, the 88-year-old senior leader -- suggest that dissidents will get nowhere as long as the economy is booming, and so the leaders fear trade sanctions perhaps more than outspoken critics.
Still, there are several indications that the greater boldness has affected not only dissidents but also ordinary Chinese, although in ways that are not overtly political.
When application forms to buy stock ran out in the southern city of Shenzhen last month, some 50,000 would-be investors accused the Government of corruption and rampaged on the streets.
"That rioting would never have occurred in the immediate aftermath of the Tiananmen crackdown," said a Chinese journalist in Beijing. "But this year, with all the new talk about reform, people are feeling more hopeful and braver than before."
The journalist added, however, that most people are still afraid of openly criticizing the Government. For now, a repeat of large-scale pro-democracy demonstrations is impossible, he said.
"Lots of people are willing to be followers," he said. "But no one wants to be the first to say anything. There's a saying: the first bird in the flock is the one that gets shot. So there are plenty of birds that want to fly, but not in front."
The greater public boldness reached Beijing late last month, when China's normally docile soccer fans stormed out of Workers Stadium in Beijing after a loss to South Korea and marched angrily down the middle of the street. They shouted curses at the Chinese team, the head coach and the police.
It was the third outburst in a week from soccer fans, and the authorities were quick to arrest a few people and denounce the behavior.
The official Beijing Daily wrote, "These riotous acts, totally alien to China's long-noted politeness and courtesy, smeared the image of Beijing as well as our country."
Chinese soccer hooligans may seem like paragons of obedience compared to the more violent British soccer rioters, but in one sense the disruptions here are much more significant than in Britain.
The glue that keeps most Western governments together is public support for the system; in China, according to many foreign diplomats and Chinese, the adhesive is fear. So if Chinese soccer fans dare to march on the streets because of dissatisfaction with a sports competition, there is at least some chance that they may dare to protest the form of government.
 
Pitfalls in Leniency
 Recent history also suggests that a diminishing fear of the authorities might eventually lead to political protest.
Throughout the last four decades, the times when Chinese have protested against the Government have not generally been the periods of greatest discontent. Rather, they have occurred when people perceived -- usually incorrectly -- that the atmosphere was sufficiently lenient that they could get away with it.
To be sure, the authorities do their best to let people know that they will not get away with it. Some democracy campaigners, though not the most prominent ones, reportedly were quietly arrested over the last few months, and political prisoners in northeastern China recently smuggled out a letter complaining of continued beatings in their jail cells.
The latest police move occurred today, when the authorities detained Shen Tong, a democracy advocate who had returned from exile in the United States, as he prepared to hold a news conference. If Mr. Shen's return was a sign of the dissidents' new boldness, his detention was a signal that the authorities are willing to fight back.
So far, however, the Government has not reacted to another recent development that may cause security officials to furrow their brows. Three prominent independent-minded Chinese openly joined the board of a New York-based organization, Human Rights in China, that is often critical of the Beijing authorities. While the Government has not punished the three, it is not clear that it will allow them to leave China to attend a board meeting in the fall.
This relative restraint is having an unintended effect: It is skewing the incentive structure for dissidents. A few years ago, any Chinese knew that denouncing the Government would mean immediate dismissal, arrest and incarceration. But now, some critics suffer only harassment, and they achieve international renown and invitations to be visiting scholars at foreign universities.
Likewise, relatives of political prisoners used to believe that they were best off keeping quiet so as not to offend the authorities. But in several recent cases, family members have concluded that they are better off causing a fuss or at least speaking to the foreign press. In part they believe that attention in the West may result in shorter sentences for their loved ones, and in part they seem to feel more daring and assertive than they used to.
"With all the talk about reform, the Government has been telling us to be bolder in our actions," said a worker in his 20's, flashing a mischievous grin. "And so that's what's happening. We're bolder."

HEADLINE: Harold Curtis Fleming Dies at 70; Tirelessly Fought for Civil Rights

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Harold Curtis Fleming, a white Southerner who became an early leader in the struggle for racial justice in a "new South," died Friday at his home in Washington. He was 70 years old.
Friends said he died suddenly after a brief illness.
As executive director of the Southern Regional Council, an organization formed in 1944 to promote equal opportunity for Southerners, Mr. Fleming joined the civil-rights cause well before it became fashionable. And long after others had lost their fervor, he continued to work for that cause as head of the Potomac Institute in Washington. 
 Born on July 27, 1922, in Atlanta, he spent his formative years there and on a farm in the red clay hills of northeast Georgia. After attending Boy's High School in Atlanta, he accepted a scholarship to Harvard University, where he worked on The Crimson, the college's newspaper, and The Advocate, Harvard's literary magazine.
 
Commanded Black Company
 When the United States entered World War II, he enlisted as an officer in the Army. Through "a quirk of fate," as he put it, he wound up on Okinawa as the captain of an all-black quartermaster company. He described himself later as being "shocked, traumatized" by the experience.
"I really came as close as anyone to realizing what it was like to be black in those days," he recalled in a newspaper interview 20 years later, "because I was intimately involved in these men and their treatment and on the receiving end in a sense myself. It amounted to being a straw boss in a very ugly, discriminatory system, which is rarely remembered today."
After the war, he finished his studies at Harvard and, returning to Atlanta, took a "temporary" job with the Southern Regional Council. It lasted 14 years. The council was a fairly timid organization until he transformed it into a militant agent of racial equality.
He led creation of the council's Voter Education Project aimed at getting black citizens to register en masse. As it kept tabs of voter data, the council became the sole repository for black voter-registration statistics in the South, a treasure trove of numerical evidence used in hundreds of voting-rights lawsuits.
 
Envisioned Long Struggle
 Mr. Fleming moved to Washington in 1962 to head the Potomac Institute, a not-for-profit agency that provided counseling in race relations to public agencies and the private sector.
In the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, he served as deputy director of the United States Community Relations Service. He was also a founder of the National Urban Coalition, and for more than a decade he served as chairman of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing.
In 1956, 11 years after joining the Southern Regional Council and two years after the Supreme Court decision that outlawed school segregation, Mr. Fleming co-wrote the book "Integration: North and South," in which he optimistically reported "extensive progress" in reducing discrimination.
But 29 years later, the goal seemed as elusive as ever. The more he and other civil rights advocates overcame rudimentary problems of racism, he observed in a 1985 interview, the more complex became the problems that remained. The struggle against discrimination, he said, had merely shifted from leaping simple political and judicial hurdles to curing stubborn economic and social ills.
And he observed: "There is a tiredness at the moment. We get tired very easily." Yet he counseled persistence, adding: "I think the things that are achieved in a field as complicated as this are achieved by people who stay with it."
Although Mr. Fleming retired from the Potomac Institute about two years ago, he continued to write and consult about civil rights issues and affirmative action.
"The theme of Hal Fleming's whole life is summed up in the title of that Protestant hymn, 'Let Us Together Sweetly Live,' " said Claude Sitton, retired editor of The News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C., who was chief Southern correspondent for The New York Times from 1958 to 1964. "A brilliant, effective, indefatigable worker for an integrated America in which blacks and whites could prosper alongside one another."
Mr. Fleming's survivors include his second wife, Jenna, and two sons, Gary and Tony.

HEADLINE: Where 2 House Candidates Are as Far Apart as Voters

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOZEMAN, Mont., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Voters in this state have no excuse for complaining that all politicians are alike. Ideological differences as vast as Montana's mountains and prairies make the race for its only seat in the House of Representatives a classic political contest.
The two opponents -- each a popular incumbent, one a liberal Democrat, one a conservative Republican -- disagree about almost everything. 
 Representatives Ron Marlenee, the Republican, and Pat Williams, the Democrat, were forced into a face-off when the House was reapportioned after the 1990 census. Montana's population grew only 2 percent in the 1980's, much more slowly than the nation, so the state lost the second House seat it had had since 1913. Because the number of House seats has been fixed at 435 since the 1910 census, states with stagnant or falling populations lose representatives while growing states gain them.
 
A Vast, Expensive Campaign
 Now Montana has the most populous Congressional district ever created, with 799,065 people, and the largest in area after Alaska's. The area's vastness has kept the two candidates campaigning nonstop by car, plane, helicopter and horseback.
Unlike many other contests between incumbents, this race pits two veterans who have strong out-of-state allies. So Mr. Marlenee (pronounced MAR-li-nay) and Mr. Williams are both confident they can raise the $1 million each has said he plans to spend.
With two months to go, public and private polls show the race just about even, with each candidate running strongly in his former district: Mr. Marlenee in the agricultural east he has represented for 16 years; Mr. Williams in the mountainous west he has represented since 1979, from the union town of Butte to academic Missoula.
 
Strongly Conservative Views
 Mr. Marlenee's message is part classic Western conservatism that asks government only to go away and part traditional constituency concern; as the second ranking Republican on the House Agriculture Committee, he has won higher farm subsidies.
He told small businessmen in Great Falls last week that "well-intentioned" measures like the Americans with Disabilities Act, workers' compensation laws, various civil rights statutes and the pending family-leave bill forced employers to mechanize because machines neither complained nor filed lawsuits.
The bluff 57-year-old rancher says such laws "give people a headache" and are putting others out of work. Asked by reporters if his analysis was supported by economists or research, he replied, "No economists." He said, however, that the idea had been around for a while.
Later, at a combative meeting with elderly voters, one man pressed him about the family-leave bill, which would require employers to give as many as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for family medical emergencies. Mr. Williams is a chief sponsor. If his son could get an unpaid leave from work to care for him, the man asked, "that's a family value, isn't it?"
Mr. Marlenee said the bill, which the House is expected to send to President Bush for a likely veto in a week or two, was unnecessary. Instead of a new law, he suggested, "if you're working for a jerk who won't give you medical leave to take care of your family, quit your job and find another."
 
'Noon and Midnight'
 Mr. Williams, a carefully spoken 54-year-old labor advocate in the House, disagreed and predicted that the family-leave issue would help him. Finding another job is not much of an option in a state where the economy has been sluggish for several years -- where a new Wal-Mart recently had 1,700 applicants for 175 jobs that pay $6 an hour. Young people have been leaving the state in large numbers to look for work.
Mr. Williams says this disagreement reflects the "difference between noon and midnight" that measures the political chasm between two candidates who share little more than an opposition to handgun control.
Ratings by interest groups capture that gap. Since 1981 the American Conservative Union's average rating of key House votes gave Mr. Marlenee 90 percent and Mr. Williams 9 percent. The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave Mr. Williams 87 percent and Mr. Marlenee 7 percent.
In Washington, Mr. Marlenee is influential only on agriculture while Mr. Williams cuts a broader swath. In 1990 he led the House fight to preserve the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts.
The eventual law banned grants for obscene materials or performances, but blocked Congressional efforts to specify what kinds of art were too vulgar for the Federal Government to finanace. That stand brought efforts by the Rev. Pat Robertson, head of the Christian Coalition in Virginia Beach, Va., to defeat the lawmaker he calls "Porno Pat."
 
Contrasting Campaign Styles
 The rhetoric of the campaign also mirrors the candidates' differences. Mr. Marlenee attacks his foe as part of a "politically corrupt" House leadership. Mr. Williams can match him with attacks on Republican "trickle-down economics" but is uncomfortable with hitting back personally and directly.
Mr. Williams, a former school teacher, prefers more elevated themes. He calls this election a referendum on the future of Montana, which, he said last weekend at a fund-raising lunch in Missoula, was the last state "in the lower 48 to have an opportunity to set our destiny in major and meaningful ways."
He explained later in an interview: "Montana is the brow of America's last hill. Montana is what America started out to be. Now we face the challenge of figuring out of how to manage the economy with the environment in a way that secures jobs." The state also needs to manage the growth that is coming suddenly to places like Missoula and the Flathead Valley, he said.
He is trying in the last days of the Congressional session to pass a bill that would open some of Montana's wilderness to logging while preserving other sections. Mr. Marlenee effectively blocked the last version of that bill in 1988 as too tough on development and logging.
 
Spats Smother Issues
 While Mr. Williams does not always please environmentalists, Mr. Marlenee almost never does. Since 1981 Mr. Marlenee has averaged a 13 percent rating from the League of Conservation voters, Mr. Williams 63 percent.
These differences come through in debates and personal appearances, but many Montana voters may miss them. The local news media concentrate on reporting small spats, like Mr. Marlenee's complaint of political "vandalism" when a bumper sticker on a supporter's car was ripped off and replaced by one saying "No Mo Ron."
But Montana voters may be spared squabbling over the House bank. Neither incumbent avoided problems. Mr. Williams had 66 overdrafts but Mr. Marlenee had 20.
Whoever wins will have a big job just representing this vast state. In addition to a record number of constituents, there is an immense area to cover. Montana's 147,046 square miles are 1,505 more than the combined total areas of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey and Connecticut, which will have 90 representatives among them.

HEADLINE: Indians Become Foes In Bid for Tribal Rights

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANACORTES, Wash., Sept. 2

 BODY:
In a windowless room off the main street in this small port city, a handful of American Indians are waging a campaign to bring their tribe back from extinction. A few blocks away, another tribe, working out of a trailer, is making a similar effort to gain recognition by the Federal Government.
Such campaigns are not all that unusual. Like others who lost their tribal status in the last century, the Samish and Snohomish Indians of Puget Sound are basically invisible without the Government's recognition of their sovereign status or their claims to Federal rights and benefits. 
 But what makes this fight particularly hard for the tribes involved is that their worst adversaries are other Indians. Their most powerful opponent is the Tulalip tribe just south of here, who say the efforts by the Samish and Snohomish Indians could put at risk one of the strongest court rulings in the history of Indian affairs.
 
Half the Salmon Catch
 The focus of the dispute is a deceased jurist whose name has become a household word among Indians: George H. Boldt, a Federal District Court Judge who died in 1984. In a landmark 1975 decision, Judge Boldt awarded half the annual catch of salmon in Puget Sound, worth tens of millions of dollars a year, to Indians who could prove that their tribes had signed an 1855 treaty with the Federal Government.
That ruling is to the fishing economy of the Pacific Northwest Indians what Brown v. Board of Education was to the integration of public schools.
But four years later, Judge Boldt ruled that the Samish, the Snohomish and three other tribes did not have access to the fishing bounty because they were not formally recognized by the Government.
Now, after having virtually given up hope of regaining their tribal status, the Samish Indians have discovered that Judge Boldt's death certificate lists Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor. According to the death certificate, the disease first afflicted the judge in 1978, a year before he ruled against the five tribes.
The Samish are appealing the decision, claiming that the judge was mentally debilitated when he uncharacteristically accepted the Government's position without comment in 1979.
But other Indians fear that challenging Judge Boldt's 1979 decision could unfavorably affect his ruling in the landmark 1975 case. They argue that expert medical testimony might indicate that the judge had the disease when he ruled to give Indians half the salmon catch. Thus, the Samish and Snohomish find themselves isolated in the Indian community.
Mary Hanson, a Samish working to win recognition, said it "is ignorant and inflammatory" for other tribes to insinuate that the Samish may want to open the original Boldt case. If the Alzheimer's began in 1978, it could not be used against the judge's 1975 ruling, she said.
Margaret Greene, the chairwoman of the Samish Tribe, which claims about 1,000 members, also finds opponents' argument suspicious. "It's just greed that makes some of the other tribes oppose us," she said.
 
Allotting Scarce Resources
 In the quincentennial year of Columbus's arrival in the Americas -- declared the Year of the American Indian by President Bush -- Indians increasingly find themselves pitted against other Indians over a shrinking pie of Government benefits. Those resources have become so small that allowing any new tribes to be recognized would only cause further hardship for other Indians, the opponents of the Samish and Snohomish argue.
"It boils down to trying to protect tribal fisheries from groups which the Tulalips view as not genuine Indians," said James Jones, a lawyer for the Tulalips.
Nationwide, 126 tribes are actively seeking acknowledgement. In the last 12 years, eight tribes have made it through the process, which requires them to pass seven tests to show that they have had "continuous existence" as a separate band of people since the days of their first contact with whites.
 
Growing Indian Identity
 "What we're trying to do is to protect the integrity of being an Indian tribe," said Bob Walker, a spokesman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. "It's very fashionable now to try and be an Indian."
Administration officials say one problem with tribal recognition is that there has been a huge increase in the number of Americans calling themselves Indians. The 1990 census registered 1.9 million Indians -- 37 percent more than in 1980. It is unknown whether this increase represents an actual expansion of the Indian population or a decision by more people to declare themselves Indians on census forms.
But Mr. Kidder, for one, becomes furious when he hears his claim lumped with those he considers marginal. He can point to six ancestors whose names are on the 1855 treaty that ceded most of the Puget Sound country to the Government. Ms. Greene's ancestors from the Samish tribe also signed the treaty. Yet treaty status is not enough to gain formal recognition as a tribe, the Government says.
 
Fishing Rights Denied
 Among other things, the tribes must show that have lived as a community from the days of the initial encounter with whites, that they have a written constitution, and that they can prove to the satisfaction of genealogists that tribal members are descendants of the band that signed a treaty. In the 1970's, the Government decided that the Samish and Snohomish could not pass those tests. The Government pointed out that some of their members had joined the Tulalips, an entity created as part of a 1935 act that reorganized Indian tribes.
Judge Boldt, Ms. Greene argues, would not have concurred with that finding had he not been debilitated by Alzheimer's. "I knew something was wrong with him," she said. "After the first Boldt case, he asked me if there was anything he could do for me. I said, 'I would like to fish again.' He said, 'You will.' "
The Tulalips, who fish for the Fraser River sockeye salmon that once were netted by the Samish and Snohomish, have hired a Washington, D.C., lobbyist to fight the recognition attempt of the smaller Puget Sound tribes.
It could take 10 years or more before the tribes get to the end of the recognition process. But a decade is an eye blink in the history of the Samish, whose name means "first water people," in the dialect of the coastal Salish group of native tribes.
"Our Samish people have survived," said Ms. Greene. "We have conquered the urban area. We have people working at Boeing. We have teachers. We have pilots. But we still want our Indian identity."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Tries a Personal Touch In Weekend Campaign Blitz

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: HENDERSONVILLE, N.C., Sept. 5

 BODY:
President Bush embarked today on a six-state Labor Day weekend blitz of ethnic festivals, folksy fairs and private homes in an effort to lend a more personal touch to his own re-election bid and tarnish the warm and caring image that Gov. Bill Clinton has tried to create.
In Asheville, N.C., he ate lunch at the home of Roy Harris, a Democrat who had challenged the President on live television to come down and tell his children exactly what the Bush Administration had done for them. Then he attended an apple harvest celebration here to denounce Mr. Clinton's policies across the board. 
And at a German-American fair 25 miles east of Cleveland, Mr. Bush tried to appropriate a central plank of Mr. Clinton's platform of change -- health care -- by accusing the Arkansas Governor of poorly managing his state's insurance system.
"My opponent just isn't up to the mark on health care," Mr. Bush said, asserting that after 12 years under Mr. Clinton, one in four people in Arkansas does not have health insurance.
"Bill Clinton has promised he'll do for America what he's done for Arkansas," Mr. Bush told an enthusiastic crowd packed into a steaming tent at Steve Bencic's Original American Oktoberfest. "And my question is: Why would we let him?"
The speech opened a campaign swing from the early-September Oktoberfest in Painesville, Ohio, to the apple harvest celebration here, Polish-American festivals in Chicago and Hamtramck, Mich., a Sunday morning baseball game in Louisville and a Labor Day morning trek across the Mackinac Bridge that links the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan.
It produced a tour of two regions where Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton are fighting for the votes of conservative Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan and other blue-collar Midwesterners and Southerners whose election-year concerns seem focused almost exclusively on economic issues.
Mr. Bush went out of his way to welcome the Democrats who attended his speech in Ohio this morning. But The Cleveland Plain Dealer greeted him this morning with the headline "Mired in an Economic Rut" and articles about how the recession has hurt his campaign. Another front-page article quoted blacks who castigated Mr. Bush for not inviting them to his event today.
In that atmosphere, Mr. Bush seemed bent on furthering two central aims of his campaign: to strike a connection with voters by demonstrating concern about issues like health care and to elevate voters' fears about the Democratic nominee.
On the warm-and-fuzzy front, Mr. Bush ate lunch here with the family of Mr. Harris, who was one of about 200 people who questioned Mr. Bush in a breakfast-television broadcast from the Rose Garden on July 1. Mr. Harris asked Mr. Bush if he would consider "having lunch with my 7-year-old and my 5-year-old and telling them what you've done for them."
 
Visiting With Common Folk
 Mr. Bush demurred at the time, but his political staff later saw it as a chance for Mr. Bush, who has been battling the image of an aloof and unconnected President, to be seen with just plain folks.
At the same time, Mr. Bush tried to cast doubts on Mr. Clinton's record on health insurance. "My opponent backs a plan that goes by a different name, but in the end, it takes you to the same place: national health care," Mr. Bush said. "According to some studies, nationalized health care would mean a whopping $250 billion to $500 billion a year in new taxes," Mr. Bush said.
Presidential aides said those figures were derived by taking money now spent by individuals on medical care and transferring it to the Federal budget. Mr. Clinton does not advocate nationalized medicine. He has called for companies above a certain size to provide health insurance or pay into a Federal fund that would do so.
The President accused the Governor of paying only "occasional" attention to the issue, although Mr. Bush himself has not made a substantive speech on the subject for several weeks and has yet to send to Congress the proposed tax credits that are the centerpiece of his own health care plan.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
'HOUSE FOR RENT' BECOMES A RARITY

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 4

 BODY:
When Ofelia Centeno's house near Miami's Metrozoo was wrecked by Hurricane Andrew, her frantic search for temporary housing turned up nothing until the other day, when her brother found a small apartment that was still available in his neighborhood near the airport.
As thousands of others desperate for temporary shelter are doing, Mrs. Centeno scraped together the $820 rent plus security deposit, paying it without question so that she could relocate to the two-bedroom apartment with her parents, a sister and two children. 
Later, Mrs. Centeno found out that only two weeks earlier, rents for apartments like hers were only $600. Still, with rental housing almost impossible to find as displaced residents of southern Florida seek a temporary place to live while they patch up their battered homes, she felt a measure of luck.
"They raised the rent over $200, but what can you do," Mrs. Centeno, a 30-year-old bank employee, said as she stood in line at the Federal Emergency Management Authority relief center in Kendall. "We had to get out before we could repair our house, and while we were looking around it seemed like there were no more vacant properties in all of Dade County."
 
A 'Big Joke'
 Displaced homeowners and real estate agents throughout the area say that Hurricane Andrew overnight turned what had been a soft housing market and the slowest time of the year for many realtors into the tightest market any had seen, making life yet more difficult for victims of the storm.
"The big joke among realtors when they come across each other is: 'Hey, have you got any rentals,' " said Carol M. Klock, a realtor at Coldwell Banker in Coral Gables, one of the areas where the hunt for temporary housing has been most intense. "The inventory of rental properties was zapped up already by the middle of last week. Now we are begging home owners who have even half their house vacant to open it up for rental."
Many people in badly hit areas used the first few days after the hurricane to take stock of their situation, recoup emotionally, visit insurance offices and clear debris from their homes rather than search for new housing, several realtors said.
Now that relocation checks are being issued by many insurers, almost all the available housing has already been snatched up by those who moved fastest.
"The people you see looking are pretty much in a state of shock," Ms. Klock said. "Everyone wants a three-bedroom for six months, but what they will find will be smaller, and most of the time they will be there as long as a year while their homes are being fixed. It's hard to tell them that."
 
Few Controls on Profiteering
 Many real estate agents said they had heard stories of owners demanding heavily inflated rents after the storm, but the agents asserted that most professionals in their industry were working with the renters to keep a lid on prices.
"I had an owner of a piece of property approach me and say that another broker told him he could get $1,200 for a $900 apartment," said Carolyn Cope, a broker at Coconut Grove Realty. "The argument that some will give is that it is a short-term lease and therefore should cost more, but I wouldn't touch it. In these conditions, that just doesn't wash."
Nevertheless, stories of gouging abound among displaced homeowners.
At a U-Haul trailer rental outlet on U.S. Route 1 in South Miami, a woman flew into a tearful rage when approached by a reporter, saying that she had found a house to move into by working the telephone for days only to find that someone had topped her $1,800 rent offer by $300.
"I've been looking for eight days in this town, and that was the first place we could find," said the woman, too distraught to give her name. "I've got no roof. What am I supposed to do now?"
 
Watching the Ceiling Leak
 Because of the tightness of the housing market and the rising prices, many are deciding to stay where they are, ceiling cracks and all, while they await repairs.
"Most of the people in our building are already moving out, but we've just got nowhere to go," said Susan Oneal, a 26-year-old student at Florida International University, whose second-story South Miami apartment leaks badly in the intermittent rains that have afflicted the city in the last week. "Everywhere there are places for rent, the prices are sky high. The management has promised us that a crew is on its way to do the repairs, and as long as they fulfill that promise we figure we'd be better off staying, even through the rain."
Another person who was staying despite considerable discomfort was Rigoberto Hernandez, a 41-year-old unemployed man who said he sits in his apartment, shared with his wife and daughter, "just watching the drops fall from the ceiling when it rains."
"I don't want to lose faith, because that is all I have left, but there are no more places a guy like myself can afford to rent in Miami," said Mr. Hernandez, speaking in Spanish. "When you can find a vacancy, the landlords want a fortune, even if it's a one-room shack."

HEADLINE: Georgia Newspaper Publishes Its Last Issue

 BODY:
The Daily News of Gwinnett County, Ga., published its last issue today.
The newspaper's owner, The New York Times Company, announced last month that it was closing the suburban Atlanta paper, which it acquired five years ago.
The printing plant and other assets of The Daily News, which has a weekday circulation of 50,000 copies and a Sunday circulation of 44,000, are being acquired by Cox Enterprises Inc., publisher of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution. The paper has 290 employees, some of whom have accepted transfers to other newspapers owned by the Times Company. 
 The Gwinnett Daily News was established in 1965 from a small weekly, the Gwinnett News-Herald, which was founded in 1898. The Times Company acquired the paper in July 1987 and moved its operations to a new color printing plant in 1990. "Despite these and other investments -- and an increase in circulation by almost twofold since 1987 -- the newspaper lost money each year since its acquisition," a Times Company news release said.
The Daily News was acquired "at a time when Gwinnett County was among the fastest growing in the nation," the release continued. "Readers were enthusiastic, but advertising revenues lagged as the national and local economies were hit by recession."

HEADLINE: Bush Takes Economics Out Beyond Voodoo;
No to Consumption Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Aid for the Rich, Not the Economy" (editorial, Aug. 22) calls for a bolder plan of tax reform than President Bush seems willing to propose. As an example, you suggest we scrap our income tax code -- you say it discourages saving and investment -- and adopt instead a national consumption tax, which favors them. "That would be worth fighting for," you say, because it is "pro-growth and fair." 
 Actually, it is neither. A consumption tax (which is just another name for a sales tax) differs from our income tax in one major respect. Whereas our income tax applies to income from capital investment -- interest, dividends, rents and capital gains -- as well as to salaries and wages, a consumption tax really applies to salaries and wages alone and eliminates so-called capital income from the tax base.
In effect, while personal-service income would be taxed in full under a consumption tax, investment income would be "taxed" at zero. Even with an exemption for low-wage taxpayers, the system would inevitably favor upper-income people, who receive much more of their income as investment return than any other group. Why you regard that result as "fair" I can't imagine.
But what about "growth"? As you point out, the sharp reduction in marginal tax rates that took place under Ronald Reagan in the early 1980's not only failed to increase the national saving rate, but also "led to a consumption binge" for which our economy is paying a heavy price.
Why should we suppose things would get better if we reduced the tax on investment income to zero? They wouldn't. While exempting investment income from tax would be favorable to investors, every recent empirical study on the subject suggests no positive correlation between saving and the after-tax rate of return on investment. As in the recent past, the effect could be negative.
Other factors -- chief among them the Federal budget deficit -- are simply overwhelming as far as the domestic saving rate is concerned.
Substituting a consumption tax for our present income tax might be a good idea if it were coupled with a periodic wealth tax. The system would then at least be "fair" to those whose income consists of salaries and wages, and whose "wealth" is likely to be modest.
Your criticism of the Bush tax plan is correct, but your own proposal is no better.

HEADLINE: The Lilting Sound and Soul of Immigration

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
The laugh of the Mighty Sparrow these days is one of deep delight.
As he sits in a T-shirt and shorts at Jenille's Jamaican restaurant in Queens, the reigning "Calypso King of the World" dips his spoon into a bowl of red pea soup and then breaks into a rich laugh, slapping out a fast calypso rhythm on his seat cushion. 
 Such exuberance is nothing new for the Sparrow, the acknowledged father of modern calypso. But this year is special. Not only has the Granadan-born singer returned from a 17-year absence to recapture his crown as the world's best calypso performer, but he is also the star of the West Indian-American Day carnival and parade tomorrow in Brooklyn, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary in the borough.
"I want to be part of this parade until I can't do it no more," said the 57-year-old Sparrow, whose given name is Slinger Francisco. "In life, there are some things you just enjoy. At the parade, everything seems to come alive."
Alive is, perhaps, an understatement.
 
Second Only to Trinidad
 For the Mighty Sparrow and for West Indians throughout the nation, Labor Day in Brooklyn has become second only to Trinidad's Carnival in importance. It is a holiday that caps a five-day festival of West Indian concerts, parades, dancing and parties.
For New York City, it has become a defining cultural exposition for an immigrant group that at nearly two million people -- counting both English-speaking West Indians and their Spanish-, French- and Creole-speaking neighbors from the Caribbean -- makes up more than half of the city's newcomers each year and almost one in three residents in Brooklyn.
And by all accounts, including that of Mr. Sparrow, the Brooklyn carnival serves as a reminder of the growing social, economic and political influence of all of the immigrants from "the islands" -- including Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago -- who speak deeply accented English, who often wear colorful head wraps and three-fold skirts and who favor the rhythms of reggae and calypso, salsa and merengue to American rock.
Since its early incarnation in the 1940's as a modest weekend dance in Harlem (held in February just before Lent), the festival has followed New York's West Indians from Manhattan to Brooklyn. Now celebrated on Labor Day, this year's festival is expected to draw more than three million participants and spectators from around the country, including pan (steel drum) orchestras, soca (soul-calypso) ensembles and at least 50 "mas" (masquerade) bands -- groups of people in elaborate costumes who dance down Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn in sequins and feathers and huge hoop skirts.
The festival parade is scheduled for 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. tomorrow, moving west along Eastern Parkway starting at Utica Avenue. Along the route, food vendors will offer roti (dough rolled around barbecued goat, chicken or beef), beef patties, rice and peas, callaloo and crab, fish cakes, Trinidadian coconut bread, Jamaican jerk pork and chicken, and drinks like ginger beer and sassafras-like mauby.
 
Signs of Growing Power
 Like many who have participated in the carnival since the 1960's, the Sparrow has seen the carnival, as well as its music, take on cultural and political significance for the larger community.
"In the beginning, when we were up in Harlem, it wasn't really a big thing," said the Sparrow, who got his name not because of his looks (he is a sturdy six-footer) but after his first public performance in Trinidad in the 1950's, when an older calypsonian chided him for "hopping around the stage like a damned sparrow."
When the name stuck, he added the "Mighty" because he admired the bolder monikers of other calypso singers, like "Lion" and "Spoiler."
Now, besides the fast-growing corps of Caribbean-American public officials and the increasing number of immigrants who have become citizens who participate in the festivities, both Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo are planning to march tomorrow too. A portion of Eastern Parkway near the Brooklyn Museum has been temporarily renamed Caribbean Parkway -- a change that Una Clarke, a City Council member who emigrated from Jamaica as a student in 1958, is seeking to make permanent.
And in response to a request by Caribbean community leaders, Governor Cuomo is scheduled to announce the opening of a state-supported Caribbean-American Community Cultural Center on Eastern Parkway that will help community members find out about and receive state services.
 
Crown Heights Commentary
 The Sparrow, whose rhyming lyrics are laced with social commentary on issues as diverse as the coup in Trinidad ("Abu-Bakr") to the scandals of England's Royal Family ("London Bridge Is Falling Down,") has added his voice to New York's political scene as well with a song titled "Crown Heights."
The song, to be performed tonight, speaks to the racial violence that shook the Brooklyn neighborhood last August when a 7-year-old boy from Guyana was struck and killed by a car driven by a Hasidic Jew. Hours later, the police said, a rabbinical student was stabbed to death by a group of black youths, apparently in retaliation. Tensions between the two communities continue to simmer.
Preacher man, rabbi or priest
We must learn to live in peace, live in peace.
Both of us suffered loss -- history will show
From slavery to Holocaust, the whole world know.
So we have to live in peace
No reason to fight like beasts.
Live in peace
Calypso, a buoyant rhythmic music that that traces its roots back to Africa, began as a mode of communication for slaves.
"It was used to make fun of the masters, to relieve oppression and bring the news of the day," said the Sparrow. "It finally emerged as the mouthpiece for the underprivileged."
When not performing, the Sparrow, father of nine and grandfather of two, spends his time shuttling between his apartment in Jamaica, Queens, and a home in Trinidad.
Since his first successes in his 20's, the Sparrow's fame has been built more around his charismatic abilities as a performer and his prolificacy (he has recorded 58 albums, averaging about two a year) than record sales. Though he is popular in Europe and Asia and won the "Calypso King" crown now 10 times, the bulk of his records are sold in the Caribbean. In the United States, he says, he has sold a grand total of 15,000 records, tapes and compact disks.
That is in part, he said, why after 17 years of staying out of the calypso contest, he re-entered the competition earlier this year in Trinidad. Now that he recaptured the title, he says, requests for singing engagements have been plenty, filling his calendar through the middle of next year.
But true to the West Indian culture, the festival and the Sparrow's music are not intended primarily for political or even commercial purposes, but for fun.
The Sparrow tilts his head to the side, somewhat whimsically, when asked if the carnival is meant to convey a message.
"In my music I try to express the life style in our part of the world -- how easy life can be even if things aren't so bountiful," he says. "If there is a message, it is that we want to show people how to have fun."

HEADLINE: On Queens Strip, Response to Neighbors' Protests

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Concerned about notoriety and a sharp drop in business after two highly publicized killings, bar and restaurant owners on a strip studded with nightspots in Queens have organized to respond to longstanding community protests about rowdiness and violence in the area.
About 30 businesses on Bell Boulevard in Bayside, the site of the recent slaying of an off-duty Housing Authority police officer and another man, have formed a coalition to change the atmosphere that many in the neighborhood say led to the kinds of brawls that prompted the slayings. 
 Before the killings, local civic leaders and residents held that the business owners were often indifferent to their longstanding complaints about drug use, assaults, noisy congestion and vandalism on a milelong strip of Bell Boulevard that, in recent years, has become increasingly popular with young crowds.
The noisy revelry on the street's growing number of bars and eating places contrasts sharply with the rest of quiet, middle-class Bayside.
The killings and the complaints about the strip "precipitated the coalition to be formed," the new group's coordinator, Thomas A. Croce, said on Friday. He said the coalition was formed late last month. The killings occurred early on July 18.
 
Resolving Complaints
 "There's been about a 40 percent falling-off of business since the shooting," he said of the bars and restaurants on the strip, between Northern Boulevard and 35th Avenue.
The men who were slain were the off-duty Housing Authority police officer, Paul Heidelberger, and John Camarda. A third man, Steven Moran, was wounded. An employee at one of the bars on the strip, Patrick Bannon, has been charged with murder and other crimes in the case.
Mr. Croce, a lawyer and Bayside resident, did not say why he thought the drop in business followed the killings, but others have attributed it to negative publicity combined with more intensive police activity that has included closer surveillance of the bars and orders that people congregating on the sidewalks disperse.
Mr. Croce said his coalition would work to "restore, if not enhance, Bell Boulevard's fine reputation in leisure-time activities."
He said one of the group's chief tasks would be to resolve complaints about problems around the nightspots like noise and litter. The group will also seek better cooperation with the police.
The coalition "would never be if not for the shooting," said Thomas Virgilio, president of the Bayside Chamber of Commerce. He said that in the past it was "very tough" to get the bar and restaurant owners "in the same room and to agree on anything because they're all competitors."
"Now they realize what a bad rap they can get if they don't make nice-nice to the community," he said.

HEADLINE: Ripple of Layoffs Upsets State Workers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 3

 BODY:
For the 75,000 men and women who draw their paychecks from the State of New Jersey, one of life's certainties used to be the security of a government job. But now there is mass uncertainty and insecurity as state workers face the elimination of at least 2,000 jobs by Oct. 2, as well as a chaotic game of falling dominoes in which workers with seniority can knock more recent employees into lower-paying or less desirable jobs.
For every worker eventually forced out the door by the state's recent budget cuts, Anthony J. Cimino, New Jersey's Commissioner of Personnel, estimates that four or five more will work their way through the process that allows those with more seniority to displace or "bump" those with less.
 
'Terrible Way to Live'
 "It's a terrible way to live," said Kathleen Den Bleyker, whose co-workers at the Division of Coastal Resources office in Toms River call her Kim. "Even if I finally end up keeping my job, I'll probably end up somewhere else doing a new job that I'll have to be retrained for, or driving two hours to a new location." 
 "My husband and I were hoping to start a family in January, or at least start trying, but now I don't know if we can afford it," Mrs. Den Bleyker, 26 years old, continued. "I could end up going through this all over again in six months."
Mrs. Den Bleyker's $32,000-a-year job enforcing the state's coastal development rules will probably be claimed by someone with more than her three years' seniority. Like so many others, she will then have the option of picking a lower-paying job with unfamiliar duties or keeping a job at the same level but in a distant part of the state.
Those who go through this process will have to work with and perhaps retrain newcomers who displaced friends and colleagues, or they themselves may transfer to offices where they will be regarded as usurpers.
"We're all on an emotional roller-coaster," said Adrian Jenkins, a legal secretary with the Department of the Public Advocate, who, like Mrs. Den Bleyker and most other state employees, has received a routine photocopied notice telling her that her job may be eliminated. A subsequent notice tells a worker of an interview to attend to learn about bumping rights, scan seniority lists and learn what jobs are still open.
 
The Loss of a Treasured Job
 An 56-year-old investigator with the Public Advocate's Office here spoke bitterly of the prospect of losing a job he was grateful to land just two years ago.
"I love this job," said the investigator, who spoke only on the condition that he not be publicly identified. "I'd like to come back to it someday."
Because of his low seniority, he is all but certain he will be laid off from his $29,000-a-year job investigating the charges against criminal defendants being represented by public defense lawyers. His job is being claimed by a worker with greater seniority, and he has no place to go but out.
"We have become the new American family," he said. "We've moved from a kind of affluence, from a point where we didn't sweat every paycheck and didn't worry about putting our boys in college, to being right back where we were in 1960, without even a pension."
After 15 years in the Marine Corps and 25 years as a real-estate broker, the investigator, who lives in North Bergen, said that a state job was one of the few opportunities left to someone his age.
"No one wants to touch you after you're 40, no matter what the law says," he said. "You go to Xerox or I.B.M. at my age and they won't even take an application from you, so you're pretty much limited to taking these tests for state jobs."
Mr. Cimino, the Personnel Commissioner, originally estimated that 2,376 state employees would have to be laid off under a Republican-enacted state budget that cut the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent and directed the state to make up most of the $608 million shortfall by eliminating jobs paying more than $50,000 a year.
Since then, the number of expected layoffs has begun to shrink as some agencies find cash to reduce the impact of the budget cuts. Mr. Cimino said in an interview that it was too early to know exactly how many jobs would be lost.
What was clear, he said, is that state employees are being forced into unemployment at a very bad time.
"We are asking for attrition to occur and for people to leave the government at a time when there are virtually no jobs out there in the private sector," he said. "This is a very tough time for us and for everyone."
The Legislature directed that only supervisory employees, many of whom are no longer covered by union contracts or Civil Service, get the budget ax. But Mr. Cimino pointed out most that most such employees have many more years of seniority than lower-level union or Civil Service workers, and that their former status allows them to bump such workers with less seniority. The nonunion supervisors who elect to bump become union members again.
Often, Mr. Cimino said, the savings envisioned by eliminating the job of a $50,000-a-year bureaucrat will be realized only by laying off two $25,000-a-year secretaries or assistants with much less seniority.
 
Some Get Reprieves
 Some workers have received reprieves. The Legislature's Republican leadership recently reached an agreement with the administration of Gov. Jim Florio to save 97 jobs in the Division of Parks and Forestry to forestall the closing of several popular parks. But Mr. Cimino warned that, unlike some past years in which last-minute fiscal legerdemain averted layoffs, most of this year's cuts will not miraculously disappear.
"The number of people who lose their jobs will be significant," the Commissioner said.
For many workers, the agony will be felt when the choice is either bumping a colleague and friend of many years, or losing one's own job. Hetty Rosenstein, executive vice president of Local 1037 of the Communications Workers of America in Newark, said the union tries to dissuade workers from trying to save their friends.
"We tell them it doesn't do any good to think of sacrificing for your friends, because if you don't take their job, someone else will," she said. "Not only that, but you could be working next to your best friend of 10 years on Friday, and on Monday there's a new person there who not only bumped your friend out of her job, but you will probably have to train her yourself to do your friend's old job."
"It doesn't make for very good morale," Ms. Rosenstein said.
The union also maintains that the Florio administration is planning to lay off Civil Service workers while protecting the jobs of political appointees or those of non-civil-service consultants paid out of separate budgets.
Government departments are required by labor contract to examine the status of temporary workers like seasonal employees and consultants before laying off permanent Civil Service employees, said Thomas Vincz, a spokesman for the Department of Personnel. They must report in writing to the personnel department on the reasons for retaining such workers on while laying off Civil Service workers, he said, but the state is not required to eliminate temporary jobs before discharging permanent employees.
Mrs. Den Bleyker, an inspector of state-regulated coastal development, said consultants in her office have not received termination notices, while she and others may have to move to jobs for which they are untrained.
"I could end up as a stack-climber in Trenton, taking air samples," she said. "I could end up having to commute two hours to work instead of 25 minutes. Everything is just so uncertain, I feel like my life has been put on hold."

HEADLINE: When Mary Is Sighted, a Blessing Has Its Burdens

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
At first blush, a report of a visit from the Virgin Mary -- in traditional Christian belief, the very mother of God who lives in heaven with Him -- sounds like a wonderful event in the life of a local church and its community.
But local bishops, municipal officials and others can find such a report more of a burden than a blessing. 
 Reports of such visions have increased sharply across the country in recent months, church authorities say, bringing in their wake a host of problems from the sacred to the mundane. Local bishops must decide whether to give the church's official endorsement to the phenomena as genuine spiritual experiences. Mayors and police chiefs must handle crowds of pilgrims and sightseers who flock to each new sighting. And neighbors of the self-proclaimed visionaries must cope with the consequences of a miracle next door.
Psychologists and others studying the Marian visions speculate that the recent increase could be connected to a variety of factors, including the poor economy and to the approach of the year 2000. Perhaps the most significant factor is the widely publicized series of visions reported by six young people in a mountain village in the Balkans.
A perfect example of the problems associated with a report of a Marian apparition is the frenzy surrounding a contention by a New Jersey man that the Virgin will appear to him tonight, for the third time this summer, in the backyard of his home in the township of Marlboro.
The last reported visitation to the home of the man, Joseph Januszkiewicz, on Aug. 2, drew 8,000 people to the sleepy town of 28,000. For tonight, the neighbors are worried about their lawns and property and the Mayor has said the police will turn people away if they perceive a threat to public safety.
But the most delicate problem is that facing the local Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop John C. Reiss of Trenton. He has "directed the faithful" not to attend tonight, but last month he appointed a four-priest commission to study the validity of Mr. Januszkiewicz's assertion.
"The last thing a bishop wants is for someone to claim that the Virgin is coming for a visit," said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, the author of "A Flock of Shepherds," a book about the nation's Roman Catholic prelates that will be published this month by Sheed & Ward.
"It's a no-win situation," Father Reese added. "If the bishop says anything against the claim, he is accused of being anti-Mary. And if he encourages it, he may end up looking like a fool." Bishops apparently tread lightly where angels may be rushing in.
The church takes reports of Marian apparitions seriously, and in a few cases -- the most famous being the 1858 visions of Mary at Lourdes, France, and the 1917 visions in Fatima, Portugal -- the church declares that something miraculous has indeed occurred. When a new vision is reported, it is up to the local bishop to render a ruling on authenticity after a formal investigation, such as the one under way in New Jersey.
In Catholic theology, Mary is deserving of special honor and veneration. The Second Vatican Council, in its "Constitution of the Church," urged that devotion to Mary be "generously fostered" but cautioned against any suggestion that she is equal in stature to God.
Investigators studying a reported vision examine the sincerity and sanity of the person who makes the claim, check that the messages relayed contain no doctrinal error, and look for evidence that the events have indeed strengthened the faithful.
 
Local Officials Complain
 Some local government officials complain that the church's refusal to dismiss such visions makes the problem worse for them.
The New Jersey incident is "all following the familiar script," said Dr. Sandra Zimdars-Swartz, the author of "Encountering Mary" (Princeton University Press), which traces Marian visitations for two centuries. "The neighbors are upset, the Bishop says don't come. And the people will show up anyway.
"The only thing to do is pray for rain. And even that might not stop the crowds. It only makes it more of a pilgrimage."
Aside from any spiritual benefits, there are those who profit from the visitation events by selling Virgin Mary T-shirts or by turning their lawns into a parking lots and their homes into bed and breakfasts. But the overall ledger is in most cases negative. The last visitation cost the town of Marlboro $21,000 in police and sanitation overtime.
 
A SingularUnique Problem
 Robert J. Albertson, the business administrator of Marlboro township, has worked in local government for three decades, through efforts to desegregate the public schools to efforts to shut down abortion clinics. "But I've never seen anything like this," he said. "There's no one to negotiate with."
The ineffectiveness of the pleas to stay away are exemplified in Dr. Zimdars-Swartz. She plans to travel from her home in Lawrence, Kansas, where she teaches religion at the University of Kansas, to be at the visitation tonight in New Jersey.
Gabriel Meyer, the editor of a monthly magazine called Mary's People, which is published in Studio City, Calif., said that there has been a sharp upsurge in the number of reported visitations. "There is something remarkable happening," he said. Just last week, thousands of people gathered at a church in Cold Spring, Ky., where a priest said he expected an appearance or message from Mary.
Mr. Meyer estimated there are 150 "investigations of a serious nature" underway by church authorities worldwide of Marian apparitions. The most famous of these -- and apparently a catalyst for many other reports -- are the apparitions at Medjugorje, in what was Yugoslavia when the reports began in 1981 and is now war-torn Bosnia and Herzogovina.
 
6 People Report Visions
 In that small mountain village, six young people say that the Virgin Mary has visited and spoken to them regularly since June 1981. Some 17 million pilgrims have visited the site in the last 10 years, although travel there has become more difficult because of the civil war raging in that country.
The inaccessibility of Medjugorje seems only to have increased reports of Marian appearances elsewhere. In many instances, the apparitions are reported by people who recently returned from Medjugorje. Mr. Januszkiewicz in New Jersey is one such case. He returned from a Medjugorje pilgrimage in 1988 saying that he had been healed of a back injury and a hearing loss.
Six months later, as he sat on a plastic bucket in his yard, he said that Mary appeared to him bathed in a golden light. "She told me: 'My son, I have chosen you to do our work,' " Mr. Januszkiewicz has said. "She just told me to pray, pray, pray. Pray for the conversion of sinners."
After an apparition, visionaries like Mr. Januszkiewicz and the children in Medjugorje often report that the Virgin has promised to make another visit. When others gather to be with them, the visionaries see the apparition and report on the heavenly message. The others do not actually see the Virgin, although they sometimes report seeing flashes of light or that their rosary beads change color.
Such gatherings often draw people, both Catholic and Protestant, who are sick and seeking a miraculous cure. Many have reported being cured simply by being in the Virgin's presence.
 
Profound Spiritual Experience
 While acknowledging the headaches involved, those who have followed the Marian trail say that much good can come out of the visitations. They note that even if people are not miraculously healed, many come away with new hope and a profound spiritual experience.
Dr. Zimdars-Swartz, who is a Protestant, said that she is concerned less with whether a visitation actually took place -- "that is a question I stay away from," she said -- and more about the effect on the faithful. "It's the human dynamics I'm interested in."
Another Marian expert, Sister Bridgett Mary Meehan, the author of "Exploring the Feminine Face of God" (Sheed & Ward), said that she is "open to the possibility" that something miraculous is afoot. "I think God's presence and Mary's presence is a reality that we can encounter," she said.
But others like Mr. Meyer, the editor of Mary's People, are cautious. While his magazine tracks the Marian sightings and contains listings of Marian shrines around the nation, he says there is a risk that the impulse to run from one apparition to another can divert people's attention from the daily religious life of sacraments and prayer.
"The point of this movement," he said, "is not to keep you running from place to place but to alert you to the rich potential of your own religious life."

HEADLINE: ...Not to Upset the Pricing Cart

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Credit card issuers may be shrewder than Barry Nalebuff. His analysis omits the crucial fact that businesses that accept credit cards build the cost (averaging 2.15 percent) into their pricing structure. The issuers are unlikely to threaten their houses of cards by following the professor's proposals to penalize maxpayers. To do so would surely invite laws requiring businesses that accept credit cards to offer commensurate discounts to those who pay in cash. Such a discount would be an offer consumers would find hard to refuse, for the extra 2.15 percent charged for the privilege of receiving an average 27 days of credit card float is a 30 percent annual interest rate.

HEADLINE: Venturing Along a Remote Road

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.; ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH it gets a bit shorter and less forbidding each year as construction crews remove a few more of its most hazardous hairpin turns and steep hills, the 1,520-mile Alaska Highway seems in no danger of losing its claim as the last great driving adventure in North America.
Sure, there are other places to routinely spot moose, wolves and even bears wandering across your path amid majestic mountain scenery and pristine lakes. But probably nowhere else do you get these in half-continent dimension and with the sense of isolation provided by this historic two-lane snake of a road that twists from Dawson Creek in northeast British Columbia through the Yukon gold-rush country to Delta Junction, a couple of hours short of Fairbanks. Technically, Delta Junction is the end of the highway, since the final 98 miles existed before it was built. 
 Much of the time you're not within earshot of any radio station and the next gasoline may be as much as 100 miles ahead. Replacing a broken fan belt or water pump can delay you for days.
Yet unlike the route's earlier postwar days, when it was almost unthinkable to travel without spare parts, reinforced gasoline tank, tool kit and extra tires and fuel, almost any vehicle you would take on an out-of-state trip can meet the challenge. Asphalt and other paving, though of highly varying quality, has almost totally replaced dirt and gravel except where the road is being rebuilt or repaired.
Practically anybody with the requisite time and energy -- the vagaries of the road do require more than usual driver concentration -- can reap the singular rewards of driving to Alaska, the choice of 14 percent of the state's visitors (57 percent arrive by air, 29 by cruise ship or ferry). If you're quick, you can still do it in 1992 and take part in some of the 50th anniversary celebrations, which include a road rally over the entire length between Sept. 20 and Sept. 26.
Our northbound trip was in late July. We rented a van in Seattle, spent three days covering the 825 miles north to Dawson Creek and then spent five days on the Alaska Highway itself. Returning, we did the highway in three days and went the rest of the way to Seattle in two. Though we stopped in Vancouver for about 18 hours on the way up, we really didn't wander around much; driving the highway -- and getting to and from it -- kept us pretty focused.
Although much of the risk and discomfort are gone from today's highway, the I-wonder-what's-around-the-next-bend sense of anticipation and the fellow-traveler camaraderie remain. And in spite of its remoteness, the highway has much to teach about modern history, particularly the feat of its construction in less than nine months as a military necessity following the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent Japanese invasion and occupation of two of the westernmost Aleutian Islands. Begun in March 1942, the highway was dedicated in November of that year, allowing military vehicles to travel its entire length. In 1943, permanent bridges were built and much of the pioneer road was reconstructed and relocated to handle increased military traffic. The road was opened to the general public in 1948 and has been continually upgraded since.
Most highway travelers drive campers or motor homes, but our family of five -- my wife, Joyce, who was the relief driver, and our three children aged 13 to 19 -- found the Dodge minivan quite satisfactory and economical. We were glad, however, we didn't have to use it for cramped emergency sleeping. As it happened, we found lodging each night without reservations even though we took advantage of the extended daylight, which in July and August lasts until after 10 P.M., to cover more miles. Motels in the main stopover communities provide such standard amenities as color TV, ice and telephones. Lodges in remoter spots are more rustic, frequently without private bath.
We decided to allot five days for the highway, breaking it into fairly comfortable 300-mile segments as suggested in the valuable paperback "The Alaska Highway: An Insider's Guide," by Ron Dalby, an Alaskan who has traveled the route for decades. This allowed periodic stops for short hikes and animal observation as well as for rest, picnics and fuel.
While we felt a certain sense of accomplishment just getting to the fairly remote Dawson Creek -- the Fraser River canyon on the way from Seattle is breathtaking -- it was only when we reached the green, red and white sign marking the highway's official beginning that I felt a flush of excitement. "You Are Now Entering World Famous Alaska Highway," it reads.
THEN, after the obligatory photos and a stop at the adjacent visitor center, where a local disk jockey was interviewing highway returnees, we made sure our gas tank was full and headed off toward to the northwest in the early afternoon sun.
After passing huge fields of golden canola, we crossed the Peace River and, leaving lush farm country behind, entered forests of small spruce and birch. The road was better than we had expected, with traffic almost nonexistent by metropolitan standards, and we had some difficulty keeping to the 90-kilometer (56-mile) an hour limit, the maximum anywhere on the highway.
We glimpsed our first wildlife, probably a wolf. (My son, who kept track, says we saw a total of 4 moose, 8 reindeer, two wolves, 19 Stone sheep and 1 black bear.) Then we rumbled across a 100-yard stretch of gravel toward the first of what would prove to be many friendly encounters with local people.
Crossing the Sikanni Chief River, we decided to stop and have a look at the original wooden trestle bridge, which the guidebooks said was one of the few that remained. When we inquired at the gas station-lodge on the far side, the proprietor recounted sadly how the old bridge had burned less than two weeks earlier and then took the trouble to dig out newspaper clippings and personal photographs to help us appreciate this lost heritage.
Setting out next morning from Fort Nelson, now a popular overnight town of 3,700 but as recently as the 1950's lacking electricity or running water, a feeling of being in real wilderness enveloped us as the road lost its shoulder and began to wind. Legend has it that the builders, mostly American soldiers, made the twists to prevent the Japanese from landing on or successfully bombing the highway, but the more prosaic truth is that the terrain more or less demanded it.
A provincial campground at Summit Lake, an area of bare rocky peaks, gave us a splendid waterside picnic site, introducing us at the same time to the highway's notorious population of large mosquitoes. Insect repellent is a must.
Then, scarcely on the road again, we found ourselves suddenly part of a gallery watching four frolicking whitish animals that one highway veteran informed us were reindeer. The undisputed high point of our trip, however, was to come that evening as we basked in the Liard (rhymes with weird) Hotsprings, a pair of landscaped, 120-degree mineral pools that even in T-shirt summer weather are the perfect way to banish highway fatigue. The extremely popular park campgrounds fill up early in the day, but the springs themselves, to which a several-hundred-yard boardwalk leads through lush plants from the roadside parking lot, remain open in season until 11 P.M. Bathing is free.
We continued on to Watson Lake, our overnight stop just above the British Columbia border in the Yukon Territory. This outpost town of 1,700 -- the lake itself cannot be seen from the highway -- is distinguished by two things. One is an exceptionally good interpretive center on the highway's construction and lore. The other is the adjacent "forest" of more than 13,000 hometown road signs lugged here by travelers from around the world. This Alaska Highway tradition was begun by a homesick Army engineer from Danville, Ill., in the frantic days in 1942.
We made sure to gas up here -- highway veterans advise driving on the top half of the tank -- because the third day's drive was real wilderness, with Teslin, population 450, the only community of any size in the 271 miles to our next stop, Whitehorse. Gas, reflecting high taxes, cost us about $1.90 a gallon in Canadian towns but was about $2.15 in the remotest spots.
Impressive though the scenery remained, we had become slightly jaded and drove purposefully toward Whitehorse, stopping to take a short excursion to the modest Rancheria Falls, reached by an easy 10-minute hike at mile 695.2.
Whitehorse, a relatively large city of 21,000 (it's the capital of Yukon Territory and claims two-thirds of territorial residents), on the fast-flowing Yukon River, is more modern than we expected and of some gastronomic repute, though we succumbed to McDonald's and unmemorable Chinese. Its gold-rush history is colorfully evoked at the S.S. Klondike national historic site, where the wood-burning sternwheeler that once carried cargo and passengers north to Dawson City, not to be confused with Dawson Creek, now sits in permanent retirement. The tickets for a tour and the 20-minute film, offered from mid-May to mid-September, are free.
The fourth day's highlights were glacier-laden Kluane National Park 100 miles from Whitehorse and a brief excursion to Soldier's Summit, the spot overlooking huge, unspoiled Kluane Lake where the highway was officially opened in a November 1942 blizzard to the strains of "God Save the King" and the "Star-Spangled Banner," heard again now by recording.
DURING the final 150 miles in Canada we suffered the highway's worst -- low-grade pavement and large potholes that cut our speed to 40 or 45 miles an hour, in short the kind of highway I had once feared might mark the entire trip. I wondered, in fact, why this stretch wasn't even worse when I saw how frost heaves affected the area's trees, pulling roots askew and producing what is known as "drunken" forest.
The next morning brought us finally to the Alaskan border, where we used the handy turnout to make photographs of people with a foot in each country.
It was still some 225 miles to Delta Junction -- a distance we covered in under four hours. The pavement was now good again and Fairbanks lay less than 100 miles beyond Delta Junction.
Although this journey took more effort and time than the usual vacation, the only vehicle mishap was a quarter-sized windshield ding from flying rocks in a construction zone. The route, wild and remote though it remains, has been considerably tamed since the early postwar years. It's said the Alaska Highway is no longer a wilderness road but rather a road through wilderness.
 
 
 
STOPS ALONG THE LONG ROAD
 Except for a vehicle in top-flight mechanical condition, there is probably nothing as important for a successful and informed Alaska Highway trip as a copy of "The Milepost," a comprehensive 640-page guide to roads in western Canada and Alaska.
Updated annually -- the current edition is the 44th -- "The Milepost" provides mile-by-mile logs that describe not only towns and accommodations but also virtually everything along the way. It tells where the road is being repaired, which campgrounds have handicapped-accessible toilets, where to watch for bears, the location of a long-disappeared Hudson's Bay Company trading post, the best place to photograph a particular lake and even the location of litter barrels. Every entry for the Alaska Highway gives the number of miles and kilometers, down to the tenth, from both Dawson Creek and Fairbanks.
The magazine, however, does not critically evaluate motels, restaurants or other establishments, generally leaving it to proprietors to describe themselves.
But we were quite satisfied with the Provincial Motel in Fort Nelson, (604) 774-6901, despite having to scrounge a missing bathtub plug from a neighbor. Rooms for two at the Provincial are $51.75 to $60.95. The large Westmark Inn at Beaver Creek, part of a front-rank North Country chain, was particularly agreeable, (800) 544-0970 in the United States and (800) 999-2570 in Canada, offering a Laundromat, miniature golf course and a central recreation-TV building where we could send the kids.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Imperatives Of Recycling Are Gaining On Detroit

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Visionaries like Walter Chrysler and Louis Chevrolet couldn't have imagined the sprawling graveyards of rusting cars and trucks that bear testimony to the automotive culture they helped invent.
 These days the graveyards are shrinking slightly as recyclers find ways to recover materials and automakers respond to concern over the impact of automobiles on the environment and landscape. 
The politics and economics -- not to mention the practicality -- of recycling the nine million or so cars discarded every year in the United Statesare filled with contradictions and trade-offs. Federal fuel efficiency standards, for example, encourage automakers to use lighter materials like plastics and aluminum, which are far more difficult to recycle than plain old steel.
 To see how some of these trade-offs may be resolved, one must travel to Germany and Japan, the frontiers of automotive recycling today, where limited space for junkyards and landfills has spurred tough legislation and creative thinking.
"In the long term," said Horst-Henning Wolf, director of recycling for BMW, "all new vehicles will have to be designed in such a way that their materials can be easily reused in the next generation of cars." BMW, sensitive to the political power of Germany's Green movement, is among the few automakers to build a pilot "auto disassembly" plant to study ways to increase the amount of salvageable material. In this country, the company offers $500 toward the purchase of a new model to anyone bringing a junked BMW to its salvage centers in the Bronx, Los Angeles or Orlando, Fla.
 About 80 percent, by weight, of BMW's 1992 325i is recyclable, compared with about 75 percent for other vehicles. The company is pressing parts designers to avoid mixing two types of plastic or metal and plastic in a single part.
 The Big Three automakers believe the same laws and attitudes that have created bottle laws and closed landfills eventually will force more recycling. They are trying to slow legislation, but see it as inevitable: many consumers, especially the young, are insisting that vehicles embody environmental attributes that go beyond clean emissions.
 "By the end of the century we think people will be buying cars based on how 'green' they are," said David Millerick, manager of vehicle recyclability at the Ford Motor Company.
 For the past 20 years, makers of steel and aluminum have been building more furnaces that use scrap metal. With shredders, magnets and other techniques, it is reasonably easy to sort out the baseball-sized chunks of metal left of the hulks after the engines, transmissions, radios, batteries, exhaust systems and other reusable parts have been removed. The hard part is figuring out what to do with the rest, a hodgepodge of glass, foam, vinyl, dirt and several kinds of plastics, collectively called "fluff." Millions of tons of it must be thrown away or burned.
 The tipping fees at American landfills average $20 to $30 a ton, while German and Japanese recyclers must pay 10 times as much or more and thus have incentives to reuse as much of the car as possible.
 The volume of fluff, automakers have concluded, can be shrunk by removing most of a car's plastic parts and sorting them for recycling. But it isn't easy. Disassembly alone might take five people an hour. Tools must be invented, like the one BMW invented for safely puncturing and removing fuel tanks with gasoline in them.
 
Bumpers to Park Benches
 By finding more uses for recycled plastic, automakers could make disassembly feasible. Each new design for an automotive part is being analyzed to discover whether it can be made from a recycled material. "Once someone says, 'I can take all of the sheet molding compound you have and make soda bottles and park benches,' there is a market for the recyclers," said Jack Dinan, a G.M. spokesman.
 Plastic is becoming more and more attractive to automotive designers because it's light, strong, cheap and easily shaped. Automakers, however, use more than 30 different kinds for parts as small as buttons and as large as bumpers and body panels.
 Since various plastics are recycled differently, each must be labeled or color-coded by manufacturers. Some types can be re-melted and turned into new parts like intake manifolds; others must be shredded and treated and then can be used only for products like bird feeders or shipping pallets.
 The Nissan Motor Company, which operates disassembly plants in Japan and Germany, says it has found new ways to reuse urethane and polypropylene from bumpers. The automaker now turns about 2,000 bumpers a month into air ducts, foot rests, new bumper parts and shipping pallets.
 Most recycling laws in the United States so far have dealt with food packaging and bottles. Fluff may eventually be reclassified as a hazardous waste, because it contains some zinc, cadmium and other harmful chemicals. If so, disposal costs would soar. Other proposals in Congress, though not close to passage, propose requiring automakers to use up to 40 percent recyclible plastics.
 Big Three automakers, wary of new laws, have formed a consortium to find ways to reduce the number of plastics used, to use kinds that are easily recycled and to discuss disassembly. For an industry that always has been pushed to improve the quality and crashworthiness of its vehicles, there is an ironic twist to this cooperation: automakers helping one another design vehicles that also will come apart more easily.

HEADLINE: Andersen Consulting's Culture of 'Clones'

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
ON Sunday night, the buses roar up to the main entrance of Andersen Consulting's 150-acre training center in St. Charles, a Chicago suburb, and drop off hundreds of new employees from around the world. During the year, 4,000 raw recruits, most fresh from college, will file into this idyllic boot camp, with its wooded grounds and connecting country club.
Here they will spend three weeks being indoctrinated in a rigid corporate culture and a strict methodology for helping companies navigate the morass of high technology, whether it be installing existing computer systems or planning for future technologies. 
 Andersen Consulting's soldiers are conservatively dressed, clean cut and well programmed -- spitting images of the two L. Seward Johnson sculptures at the St. Charles training center. In fact, they are viewed by some in the business world as an army of clones who are too inexperienced to help Andersen adapt to radical changes in the way computing is done in corporate America and do battle against a growing number of competitors in a recession-slowed business.
"The culture is very positive but very insular," said Mel Bergstein, a former Andersen partner and now president of Technology Solutions Company in Chicago, a consulting firm and competitor. "They don't hire experienced people. It's all inbred. That's a strength but also a terrible weakness."
The Andersen formula, honed over more than three decades, has built the firm into a $2.3 billion colossus in the high-technology consulting business, right up there with International Business Machines and Electronic Data Systems in commanding a leading share of a $41 billion worldwide market. With 151 offices in 46 countries, Andersen's force of 22,000 consultants seems to be everywhere. Name a major corporation seeking technological advice and Andersen is probably bidding for the contract. Its consulting army has a big say in what kind of technology is bought and used around the world.
But now, after 30 percent annual growth between 1986 and 1990 fed by the frenetic pace of change in the computer industry, Andersen Consulting, until 1989 a part of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, faces the same problems that are battering computer makers like I.B.M. and Digital Equipment.
Companies have moved away from the mainframe systems that were Andersen's historical specialty to systems made up of powerful desktop computers linked by high-speed networks.
 
Retooling a Goliath
 The lengthy, complicated projects requiring many bodies to handle mundane tasks like programming have given way to shorter projects requiring far fewer programmers but more expert networkers. And the shift, analysts say, will test the very core of Andersen's corporate soul. Some wonder how quickly the Andersen Goliath can retool itself to this new model.
Meanwhile, companies like I.B.M., E.D.S., Digital and the Big Six accounting firms, seeking new sources of revenue, are stepping up their own consulting efforts and winning business from Andersen, demoralizing its staff and spurring turnover. And smaller businesses like Cap Gemini of France and the Computer Sciences Corporation of El Segundo, Calif., are an increasing threat.
"The whole nature of the business has changed," said George T. Shaheen, the managing partner who runs the privately held consulting firm. A 250-partner task force is rethinking the company's focus and structure and is scheduled to make proposals for change in November.
For now, Andersen is concentrating on getting bigger and longer contracts with existing customers. Most of its contracts are now between $5 million and $10 million. "The number of clients is decreasing but revenues stayed flat," said Julie Schwartz, an analyst with Dataquest in Lexington, Mass. "The size of their contracts in the U.S. has been increasing."
Andersen has been in the technical consulting business for more than 35 years, ever since it helped General Electric install its first computer in 1954. The consulting side grew so fast going into the 1980's that the consultants decided they should separate from their counterparts at Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm. Not unexpectedly, some of the audit and tax partners resisted, fearing for their own profits, and tension at the firm got so bad that a psychiatrist was brought in to facilitate the split.
There were also questions of conflicts of interest, put to rest when the Securities and Exhange Commission gave the go-ahead for the consulting arm to work with audit clients. Just how the two partnerships work is unknown since, as privately held entities under a Swiss umbrella organization called Arthur Andersen & Company S.C., they are not required to public reports. It is known, however that they remain linked both philosophically and financially, sharing some level of profits and expenses.
 
Call It Method/1
 Andersen pioneered in the 1960's a step-by-step methodology for handling any computer project. Known as Method/1, it provides a common language for questioning potential clients about what needs to be done and what kinds of software and hardware should be used. It also offers strict guidelines for managing a project and estimating its costs.
Method/1, now in its ninth iteration, works through a force of dedicated and well-trained employees (the company spends $157 million per year on training, an average of $7,200 per consultant). They see the computing world uniformly, speak the same language and are tied into a massive international network of expertise. And Andersen spends $264 million a year on computer research and development, with a 1,200-person advanced technology group, getting high grades from industry analysts.
"What's most impressive about them is that they do an extensive amount of R.&D. and they stay at the leading edge," Ms. Schwartz said. "They can take that new knowledge and institutionalize it, so the 22-year-olds can implement it. It's an incredible capability. And they are trusted by the Fortune 500."
Andersen's young recruits usually arrive with undergraduate degrees in computer science, information systems or engineering. "We prefer to hire them raw -- their loyalty is far higher that way," said Herbert W. Desch, a managing partner who runs the St. Charles training center.
The typical candidate, paid in the high $20,000, low $30,000 range, is in the top 5 to 10 percent of his class, with solid communication skills, aggressive attitudes and a desire to move up quickly. (The halls of St. Charles are still filled mostly with white men -- only 10 percent of Andersen's partners are female.)
Stanley M. Sword, a manager of the professional education division who has worked at Andersen for more than nine years, was one such recruit. With a degree in finance from the University of Illinois, he was recruited by the Chicago office, attracted by a chance to travel and Andersen's clearly laid out career path.
At St. Charles, the rookies learn to fix their sights on partnerships, where the power and the six- and seven-figure salaries are found. There are only two directions on the Andersen career track -- up or out. Many won't make it. Andersen has a 15 percent annual turnover rate which translates into 1,200 of the firm's 8,000 United States-based consultants leaving each year. Only 5 percent of recruits make partner.
Andersen's biggest clients -- the $100 million contract category -- include Sears Roebuck, Sun Oil, Northwest Airlines, Banc One, United Airlines and two British Government agencies that are being privatized. While the firm specializes in installing and sometimes running large computer systems for clients, it also helps them decide which computer systems to embrace next. It competes with the management consulting establishment, the likes of (McKinsey & Company and Bain & Company, always with a technological bent. And it makes and sells its own software, pulling in $212 million from that source last year.
A. George Battle, senior managing partner in charge of marketing, estimates that Andersen buys, modifies and resells more than $10 billion in computer hardware and software each year. The firm says it has no biases toward any computer vendor, and in fact, Mr. Shaheen claims that Andersen's penchant for "sleeping around" with many manufacturers gives it a strategic advantage over competitors like I.B.M., which naturally favor their own products.
The competition is unconvinced. Yes, said Martin Clague, general manager for I.B.M.'s consulting software and services group, I.B.M. will sell its own equipment if the opportunity is there. But, he added, Andersen consultants have their own biases: "If an Andersen consultant knows Digital, he'll recommend Digital."
Andersen's services do not come cheap -- senior partners earn $250 an hour. But it has an impeccable reputation for grit in getting an assignment done; it has been known to swallow millions of dollars in cost overruns to meet its commitments.
At the Merced County (Calif.) Human Services Agency, Andersen recently created a complex, state-of-the-art system to handle the county's welfare program and vastly underestimated cost. Rita Kidd, county project manager, estimated the overruns at as high as $4 million, but Andersen swallowed them, she said.
The main knock on Andersen is that it tends to trample the technology people within a company. "They march through a client like Sherman marched through Georgia," said Mr. Bergstein, who left Andersen in 1989 after 21 years. "They leave bruises and gore all over the place."
A multiyear engagement with Sears, Roebuck & Company grew bitter indeed. "Our information-systems people got steamrolled," said Bob Ferkenhoff, now the Sears merchandise group's vice president of information services, who saw the project's start, left for a time, then returned to pick up the pieces. "They tend to have young, high-charged people who use a different methodology and are incented differently than the internal folks. Andersen incents on getting the job done. We focus more on the quality of effort."
Steven J. Johnson, Andersen's managing partner for the retail-products industry, admitted that "our biases are toward getting it done rather than making it pretty." He defended the enthusiasm of the young troops, however, claiming "they can work miracles because they don't know any better."
 
The Troops
 Andersen claims it can move quickly to meet market pressures, saying networks of desktop computers -- client/server networks -- now comprise 70 percent of its work.
But critics question how quickly it can retrain its army to be proficient in the client/server environment. "The Andersen way can't work anymore," said Bonnie Digrius, a consultant with the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
As Thornton May, a consultant at the Tenex Corporation in Burlington, Mass., sees it: "Success at Andersen is keeping 22-year-old butts on an airplane, charging monopoly rents for average talent. People choose them because they think they've lost control. We argue that you lose more control with 200 22-year-olds running around your systems organization."
Added Russ Gullotti, vice president of the services business at Digital: "We can bring in our own army with people who are experienced in these technologies. I'd much rather have that experienced person than a 22-year-old with a lot of energy."
Mr. Desch, head of the St. Charles training center, has heard it all. "We don't apologize for it," he said. "The formula works very well. The planning for a project is done by top-level experienced people. Competitors who criticize us for this have all tried to follow our model."
But morale inside Andersen, particularly at the partner level, has suffered as work and travel schedules have been increased and the pressure to bring in new business has intensified. Paul Cosgrave, a senior partner in charge of systems integration in the Americas, left in January after 19 years when, he said, he could no longer tolerate the demands on his time. "I was traveling 100 percent of the time," he said. He is now head of AGS Computers, a Nynex company.
Though Andersen is still growing quickly in Europe, growth in the United States is slow. Business in the Northeast has been poor for four years and last fall a shakeup rocked the New York office, with 200 consultants leaving or being let go.
Despite the evidence of unrest, Mr. Shaheen is sticking with the formula. "The competition says it can't work," he said, "but it has stood the test of the market for 40 years."
 
 
 
FUTURISTIC STORES TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
 CHICAGO -- IN an old Sears warehouse here, Andersen Consulting has built Superstore 2000, the supermarket of the future, complete with self-checkout lines and computerized "chicken idea centers."
Food industry executives, some visiting three or four times, come to see what their businesses might look like in 5 to 10 years. For Andersen Consulting, with its $300 million in food-industry fees this year, the center generates streams of new business. There is also a futuristic retail store in Chicago and a hospital in Dallas.
But Andersen's commitment to research and development, upon which it spends $264 million a year, goes a great deal further. Three years ago, the firm ponied up $30 million for a 10-year commitment to the legendary artificial intelligence researcher Roger Schank and convinced him to leave Yale. Mr. Schank received a professorship at Northwestern -- and brought along 25 Yale colleagues -- and started the Institute for the Learning Sciences.
Here Mr. Schank has been building complex computer-based training "courseware" designed to allow Andersen's army of consultants to get training right at their desktops, via hands-on management games. The courseware, which combines aspects of artificial intelligence and multimedia software, will eventually be offered to clients.
In addition, Andersen's 1,200-member advanced technology group, headed by managing partner W. James Fisher, is driving the company's advanced but practical research, applying leading-edge technologies like imaging, neural networks, advanced math modeling and computer-aided software engineering to current consulting jobs.
"I came here," said Masud Arjmand, a mathematics Ph.D. who left Texas Instruments two years ago, "because Andersen gave me the opportunity to pursue the most challenging technology but in the context of solving real business problems."

HEADLINE: Clinton Country

BYLINE: By Roy Reed; Roy Reed, a former reporter for The New York Times, is a native of Hot Springs, Ark. A professor of journalism at the University of Arkansas, he is working on a biography of Orval Faubus.

 BODY:
Some people in the North see only redneck Bubbas when they look south. The South has plenty of rednecks. And Southerners have cultivated the redneck image to some extent to deceive outsiders into thinking that all of us down here are a bunch of country boys, easily gulled. Historically, that has meant that the outsider should keep one hand on his wallet. In my part of the South, there is also a tendency not to care much about the world's good opinion. If New York's style is in-your-face, Arkansas's is mind-your-own-business. To our discomfort, we are now being asked to explain ourselves, thanks to Bill Clinton.
So, how to explain the prevalence of progressive politics in this Dogpatch of a place? There are several causes. Alongside a lot of poverty, mismanagement, corruption, violence and plain bad luck stretching back to the 19th century, Arkansas has been fortunate in certain of its leaders and institutions. It had a strong but little-known cadre of activist women in the 20's and 30's that predated the women's movement. It was blessed, until last fall, with a statewide newspaper of uncommon elegance and influence. The same poverty that has dogged the state from its beginnings has spawned a hardy political ideology that has tended continuously, if erratically, toward antiestablishment populism, giving rise to a succession of leaders who have tried to stand up for common people. 
 Although Bill Clinton defined himself successfully in the Democratic primaries as a centrist, he started his political life as a populist liberal. (Republicans may not be surprised to hear this.) I covered his first race for public office in 1974, an unsuccessful campaign for Congress, and was astonished to hear this 28-year-old law-school teacher addressing conservative Rotary Clubs on the dangers of corporate abuse of power. Beware of the multinational corporations, he warned. Clinton had received his political baptism in the 1972 Presidential campaign of George McGovern, and was proud to call himself a a liberal. After he entered statewide politics, Clinton toned down some of his progressive rhetoric, but there is no evidence that he ever really abandoned his populism. Echoes of it can be heard in his campaign speeches this year, as he proposes tax increases for those at the top of the economic ladder.
The progressive-populist phenomenon is not hard to trace in Arkansas. The state has had more than its share of political plunderers, and the ordinary people have had to fight back. With a few noble exceptions, the state's founders in the 1830's were a band of thieves. They stole land, money and resources impartially from their fellow European settlers and the resident Quapaws. Shortly after statehood in 1836, banking and bond scandals erupted that ruined the state's reputation for generations. The first session of the legislature, in 1837, was distinguished by a murder; the House speaker stabbed a colleague with a bowie knife, one of the state's first manufactured products.
Understandably, a suspicion of politicians was one of the earliest attributes of the Arkansas mentality. John Gould Fletcher, a poet and historian of his state, says it remained strong into the 20th century, especially in the hill people whose manner of speaking he liked to re-create: "He warn't getting nowheres, with most of the land worthless and the rest of it wearing out. Them politician fellers in Little Rock, the high-stovepipe-hat, silk-stocking crowd, had never done a danged thing for him or his kind." Echoes of that sentiment can still be heard in the hills and small towns, and even in the cotton-socks wards of Little Rock.
All the while, there was fermenting in the state a political spirit that bordered on revolutionary. The populist movement that swept the South and part of the West during the last years of the 1800's had one of its strongest branches in rural Arkansas. Farmers here had a hard time deciding whom they hated most -- the bandits on Wall Street or the bankers on Main Street. A turn-of-the-century Governor named Jeff Davis ran all his political races against Wall Street and "those high-collared roosters" in Little Rock. Davis would eventually make it to the United States Senate, but he would never lose his common touch. At one of his first fancy dinners in Washington, seated between two ladies, he is said to have taken a bite of something hot and promptly spit it onto the floor. In the hush that followed, he exclaimed to his shocked table mates, "Some damn fools would have swallowed that."
Even populism was not strong enough for some Arkansawyers, as residents called themselves until a few years ago, when, in a fit of image improvement, an unsettling number became Arkansans. A few thousand took up a kind of barnyard Marxism and voted Socialist between 1900 and World War I. In 1910, an Ozarks farmer named Sam Faubus named his oldest child Orval Eugene after his hero, the Socialist leader and labor reformer Eugene V. Debs. Then he organized the Greasy Creek chapter of the Socialist Party and signed up almost every family in the neighborhood. The boy grew up to become Arkansas's most famous Governor until Bill Clinton came along. Most people remember Governor Faubus for an event that is hard to square with his left-wing upbringing -- his 1957 challenge of the Federal courts on school desegregation that forced President Eisenhower to send Federal troops to Little Rock to put black children into Central High School.
Arkansas's progressivism was especially strong during the Depression and helped President Roosevelt enact the New Deal. The Senate Majority Leader was Joseph T. Robinson, a native of rural Lonoke County who had been Al Smith's Democratic running mate in his unsuccessful Presidential campaign of 1928. It was Senator Robinson who steered F.D.R.'s legislation through the Senate. In 1932, the year Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated President Herbert Hoover, the voters of Arkansas made progressive history in another way. They elected Hattie Caraway to the United States Senate. She was the first woman elected to a full term in that body.
During that same period, a campaign against lynching was picking up steam all across the South. Its leaders were unlikely heroes -- high-born and well-to-do white women. Arkansas had an outspoken group that included Adolphine Terry, sister of the poet Fletcher and wife of a Congressman, David D. Terry. Mrs. Terry had been educated at Vassar. She and her friends threw themselves into the campaign vigorously, and, aided by The Arkansas Gazette, effectively put a stop to the barbarism in Arkansas. Twenty years later, when Little Rock was thrust into the world spotlight by the struggle to desegregate its schools, it was Mrs. Terry and her sisters who led the fight for racial justice.
The progressive impulse continued into the late 1930's. Gov. Carl Bailey bucked the political establishment -- dominated by wealthy Delta planters, some of whom kept their workers in a state of near-peonage -- by advocating social welfare for the poor, elderly and disabled. He reorganized the state welfare department to qualify Arkansas for full participation in all Federal welfare programs. But perhaps his main contribution was to help elect to the United States Senate a bright young man named J. W. Fulbright, who was running against an enemy of Bailey's, Homer M. Adkins, who had defeated Bailey for governor in 1940. Bailey took his revenge four years later by campaigning for Fulbright against Adkins for the Senate.
As a freshman Congressman, Fulbright had already been instrumental in passing the resolution that led directly to the formation of the United Nations after World War II. He went on in the Senate to become a leader in international affairs and education, and in the 1960's he became the principal Congressional critic of the Vietnam War.
If Bill Clinton should become President, Fulbright will be remembered for one other accomplishment: He exposed young Clinton to national politics and became his first political mentor.
Lee Williams, Senator Fulbright's administrative assistant, was looking for someone to help around the office in 1967. Bill Clinton had been recommended by an Arkansas political ally who had seen the young man at work in a state campaign earlier. When Williams telephoned Clinton in Arkansas, he said, "You can have a part-time job for $3,500 a year or a full-time job for $5,000." To which Clinton replied, "How about two part-time jobs?" Williams said: "You're just the guy I'm looking for. Be here Monday."
On the Fulbright staff, Clinton did whatever needed doing. Among other things, he helped set up public hearings on the Vietnam War. He watched and listened as Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, grilled the generals and cabinet officers and aroused the nation's conscience over America's involvement in Southeast Asia. He witnessed Fulbright's obsession with education. When he himself became a Rhodes scholar, it was a matter of pride to him that his hero had been one, too.
"There's no doubt that Fulbright was a major influence on Clinton," Williams said recently. Big events were taking place, and the young man soaked them up -- all the while studying the Fulbright style and character.
Clinton was not the only Arkansas politician influenced by Senator Fulbright. There was also David Pryor, now a Senator, who went to Washington as a House page when he was a boy and was struck with admiration for Arkansas's distinguished Senator. Even Dale Bumpers, the man who defeated Fulbright in 1974, was one of his admirers. Scores, perhaps hundreds, of progressive political activists in Arkansas trace their interest in public affairs to Fulbright and to his example.
RACE WAS THE all-determining, crippling issue in the South from the beginning of the nation until the 1960's. But in Arkansas, out on the western edge of the region, up against the Indian Territory, whites have generally been more accommodating toward their black neighbors than whites are elsewhere in the Deep South. That has been reflected, however imperfectly, in the state's politics.
Sidney S. McMath, a war hero, came home and took over the Governor's office in 1948. He was a friend of President Harry S. Truman and a liberal Democrat all the way -- even on the race issue. One of McMath's proteges was another World War II veteran, Orval Faubus. When Faubus began his turn as Governor in 1954, he looked to be as liberal as his predecessor. He appointed the first black members of the state Democratic Central Committee. He watched, and did not obstruct, the desegregation of several school districts around the state after the 1954 Supreme Court decision decreeing an end to segregated public schools. Then his political opponents began to attack him as an integrationist, the one label no Southern politician could afford in the 1950's. He finally gave in to the massive segregationist pressures and made his play against the Federal courts in 1957. That won him four more terms -- six altogether -- and an indelible stigma in the national mind as the quintessential racial separatist.
It also tarnished what was, in many ways, an unusually progressive record: Faubus raised taxes for education and other services; he reformed the snake pit of a state mental hospital into a modern institution; he built the state's first facility for retarded children; he cultivated the rich men who held behind-the-scenes power, but he also kept friendly ties to labor. After the anger of 1957 subsided, he built new bridges to the black community, even bringing in some of his former black enemies as advisers. When a modern voter-registration system replaced the poll tax in 1964, Faubus went along with electoral reform. Voting machines and clean elections replaced the poll tax and electoral fraud, at least in the more populous counties.
SOUTHERNERS HAVE come to expect scorn from the rest of the country. They suspect that this scorn is tied somehow to the way they talk. To a Southerner, a New York accent is strange, funny, exotic or, at worst, a signal of approaching danger. To a New Yorker, a Southern accent is mush-mouth, grating, irritating or, at worst, contemptible. Both perceptions are grounded in regional prejudice, but one is more pernicious -- in the same way that white racism, coming from the dominant culture, is more pernicious than black racism. Many Southerners believe that if Bill Clinton is defeated in November, the reason will be not his politics or his "character," but a pervasive regional scorn that wounds all of us down here, year in and year out.
Arkansawyers have probably been more image-conscious than most Americans, even most Southerners, simply because their image has been so consistently poor. It is hard to say how much of this image of redneck benightedness is earned and how much is the result of a national need to poke fun at someone. Bob Lancaster, in his book "The Jungles of Arkansas," devotes four pages to tracing the national myth that Arkansawyers don't wear shoes.
Bill Clinton came of age understanding that the state's endemic pessimism was part of its problem. "I knew the poverty of my roots," he told me some years ago. "But my people were optimistic and demanding. I've always had a passion about trying to get rid of this 'poor me' attitude a lot of people have about Arkansas, or this sense of limitation, or 'What do you expect -- this is just Arkansas, we can't do this, that or the other.' I was raised by people who deliberately tried to disabuse me of that idea from the time I was old enough to think."
His wife, Hillary, who was reared in a middle-class suburb of Chicago, joined her husband in fighting the Arkansas defensiveness. Thanks to their leadership, the tail-tucked citizens of Arkansas have lost a little of their suspicion of the outer United States.
While mind-your-own-business is the main component of the Arkansas political style, there is also a quality that can only be called behind-your-back. Important decisions in the state tend to get made by important men in the quiet of their clubs and offices. In the last two generations, none have been more influential than the men in and around the investment house of Stephens Inc. The state has other wealthy businessmen, like Don Tyson, whose family runs the largest poultry business in the world. Through the thriving Wal-Mart chain, the heirs of the late Sam Walton of Bentonville still lay claim to the nation's largest fortune. But none have been so influential in Arkansas politics as the brothers Jackson T. and W. R. (Witt) Stephens.
Before Witt died last year, he had been the leading king-maker in Arkansas politics since the 1940's. Growing wealthy from investments in bonds and natural gas, he used his money -- and that of his friends -- to shape policy in Little Rock and Washington, and was politically friendly with all but two of the 10 Arkansas governors since World War II. One of those exceptions was Winthrop Rockefeller, a man who did not need Stephens's money. The other was Dale Bumpers, now a Senator, who simply did not like the Stephenses. Of the remaining eight, Bill Clinton has probably had less to do with the Stephenses than anybody, maintaining a kind of strained cordiality, but without much trust on either side.
Clinton's support has always been so broad-based that he has not had to rely heavily on any one person or special interest. That is not to say that the Governor is unfriendly to special interests; it is just that no one group controls him. With the death of Witt Stephens, whose influence had already eroded, the state lost its last real power broker.
In her book "Arkansas Politics and Government," Diane D. Blair, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas, argues that Arkansas never had a large and powerful socioeconomic elite like the older states of the Confederacy. She notes that although slaves were essential to the cotton economy here, as elsewhere, Arkansas never had many big slave owners. Even after emancipation, the large planters managed to throw their weight around, but they had to share political power with the mule-headed hill people who always seemed to go their own way.
Sometime during the 1950's and 1960's, after mechanized agriculture forced blacks off the plantations and voting was regularized, the Delta planters became just another interest group. The old rural elite was supplanted by a business elite in the cities, triggering a demand for a more presentable class of politicians: People like Bill Fulbright, a university president; Sid McMath, a modern, educated man; David Pryor, a polished reformer; Winthrop Rockefeller, a transplanted sophisticate from New York; Dale Bumpers, a successful lawyer. And Bill Clinton -- Oxford, Yale, Georgetown -- a politician who would never spit his food on the floor, no matter what the provocation.
These refined and reformist politicians, like their predecessors going back to the 30's, have been elected time after time by a coalition of white and black urban and small-town voters who have increasingly demanded clean government and some semblance of progressive ideas. How a majority of the state's voters developed a taste for progressive politics is hard to explain. Professor Blair grapples with the question, suggesting several theories. One that has credibility among many observers is the longtime influence of the liberal Arkansas Gazette, which died last fall after 172 years of publication. "The major difference between Arkansas and the rest of the South has been The Arkansas Gazette," David Pryor once said.
The Gazette opposed lynching when it was unpopular to do so. It opposed the Arkansas Power and Light Company, a major political influence of the 30's and 40's, because its longtime owner, J. N. Heiskill, thought no one interest should exercise so much power. It opposed Governor Faubus over his school desegregation actions in 1957 and lost 30,000 subscribers in a month. From the 50's on, The Gazette took one liberal position after another on its editorial page. Even people who hated the editorials read the newspaper because it was literate and filled with information on how the state was run. Few other Southern states had this provocative counterweight to their conservative inclinations. Those who grieve The Gazette's passing wonder whether the surviving statewide newspaper, The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, will be able to fill the gap.
But deeper than the influence of any one institution has been the phenomenon of populism, born of poverty and hard times. Arkansas has always ranked at or near the bottom in virtually all the national indexes of economic well-being. The state now ranks 47th in per-capita income. Although there is evidence that in the past year, Arkansas's personal-income growth has outpaced the nation's, census figures for the 1980's show that the state's median household income dropped from 73 percent of the national median to 70 per cent at the end of the decade. Lagging behind the rest of the country has inspired generations of populist resentment against big wealth and its political influence.
Alongside that resentment has been a long and unflagging antipathy to corrupt politics and electoral fraud. One piece of recent scholarship on Arkansas politics is "How I Stole Elections," by Marlin Hawkins, a former sheriff of Conway County, up the Arkansas River from Little Rock. Sheriff Hawkins operated the last truly efficient political machine in the state. In his prime, he could deliver votes for a chosen candidate to within 100 of the exact number needed to win. Since the political boss's retirement, he has become a folk hero, partly because everyone understands that his style of politics was a lot more colorful and entertaining than the punctilious form that replaced it. Nevertheless, the voters who came of age during the decline of machine politics in the 60's seem to prefer not only cleaner government but also more forward-looking policies. For example, no serious candidate for office today would think of alienating the black electorate, which represents about 16 percent of the state's 2.5 million population. Few candidates in Arkansas fail to portray themselves as champions of equal rights and social welfare.
A DARK CORRIDOR of the Arkansas Capitol reveals opposing bronze busts of the two men who were, until recently, the state's most important governors. Their sculptors have put an impish grin on Orval Faubus and a grim face on Winthrop Rockefeller -- masks of comedy and tragedy that are almost the reverse of the real-life personas of the two men. In a way, those two busts encapsulate the entire contradictory history of Arkansas politics.
Faubus was probably the last political figure in America to have been born in a log cabin. He grew up not only in a socialist household but also in what today would be described as poverty. He knew both hard work and hardship. Rockefeller was reared in a wealthy Republican nest in New York. His grandfather was the man who cornered the market in kerosene, among other things, and raised the price so high that families like the Faubuses could barely afford it. Winthrop spent his playboy years squandering the fruits of that greed.
But after Rockefeller succeeded the retiring Faubus as Governor in 1966, he would earn a reputation as a great reformer and modernizer of Arkansas politics. It was Rockefeller's money that financed the difficult work of putting 105,000 black voters on the Arkansas registration lists after the abolition of the poll tax in 1964. He forced the old machine politicians to accommodate to a new reality in Arkansas politics. Hundreds of thousands of voters not only came to expect clean elections but also gained a new respect for racial tolerance and social welfare.
Since the Rockefeller era, virtually all of the state's governors, senators and representatives have been considered progressive, sometimes even liberal. Senators Bumpers and Pryor have found themselves, with uncomfortable frequency, in the company of Northern liberals when annual rankings of voting records are published. This spring, an unabashedly liberal 31-year-old woman named Blanche Lambert upset a 12-term Congressman, Bill Alexander, in the Democratic primary, and is a good bet to defeat a Republican in November. Amazingly, she is from an old planter family in the Delta.
If Bill Clinton is elected President, he will probably bring to Washington at least a few Arkansawyers of the progressive-populist persuasion. Among those likely to be chosen are Bruce Lindsey, another lawyer and Fulbright protege who is perhaps Clinton's closest friend; Diane Blair and her husband, Jim, a former Democratic national committeeman and a lawyer for Tyson Foods; Dr. Joycelyn Elders, director of the Arkansas Department of Health, an advocate of school-based health clinics that include sex education; Lee Williams, the retired aide to Senator Fulbright who is probably one of the most knowledgeable people in the nation on the workings of Congress; Robert J. Nash, head of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, which issues bonds to finance construction in small municipalities and school districts; Rodney E. Slater, a state highway commissioner and former Clinton aide, and Betsey Wright, a longtime friend and former top assistant of Clinton's who is now the campaign's director of research. Dr. Elders, Slater and Nash are black.
So when Bill Clinton tours the country advocating health-care reform, taxing the rich, increasing spending for education and job creation, and, in the old populist tradition, throwing the big-money rascals out, he is in no danger of alienating his own home-state constituency.

HEADLINE: Where the Pig in a Poke May Be a Jaguar XJ6

BYLINE: By SEAN MEHEGAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
AS 200 people watched intently, a snappy red 1986 Jaguar XJ6 sedan was wheeled into a barnlike garage in the Ironbound section here. Mike Parnes, the auctioneer, whacked a black rubber hose against the podium.
"What do you want to pay for this car?" he bellowed. "Eight thousand! Nine thousand!" 
 Nobody was biting. Finally he yielded, lowering the opening bid to $3,000. Someone raised a paddle, and the madness began.
Waving the rubber hose like an orchestra conductor gone berserk, Mr. Parnes moved the bidding up in $100 increments. His face reddened; the veins in his neck began to bulge. Just when it seemed he might keel over, the Jaguar was sold for $6,900 -- and another car rolled down the line.
At retail, the auctioneer said later, the Jaguar would have commanded more than $10,000.
Mr. Parnes is the general manager of John Blackwell Inc., which has sold more than 15,000 used cars since it opened for business in January 1991. There are public car auctions throughout the state, operated by local and Federal agencies. But since the demise of Auto Auction of America in East Orange last month, Blackwell has been the only company holding public car auctions.
 
25,000 Cars Confiscated
 Almost all the cars offered at auction have been repossessed from owners delinquent on their loan payments in New Jersey and nearby states. There is no shortage. In New Jersey, 25,000 vehicles were confiscated last year, an all-time high that was attributed in part to the recession.
Banks and credit unions take a beating at the auctions. Although the proceeds of each sale, minus a commission, go to the lien holders, repossessions usually result in a net loss of at least $2,000 a car, according to the American Banking Association. "You don't recoup your money," said Arthur Ramirez, first senior vice president at the National Community Bank of New Jersey.
But Blackwell is doing fine, Mr. Parnes said -- so well that the company is able to spend $1.5 million annually on advertising, mainly on Mad Mike radio spots, starring Mr. Parnes himself.
Blackwell schedules two auctions a week in its garage at 75 Stockton Street -- at noon Saturday and 7 P.M. Wednesday. "We're a good value," said Mr. Parnes, 42 years old. "We attract someone who's looking for a bargain."
But there is a catch -- a big catch. The bidders don't know whether the cars on the auction block will make it onto the highway, let alone get them home.
Unlike used-car auctions in New York State, which must offer limited warranties under the state's "lemon law" covering the engine and drive train for a minimum of 1,000 miles or 30 days, most auctions in New Jersey operate on an "as is" basis. That's because the state lemon law applies only to new cars.
What's more, bidders at the Newark auction are not allowed to start the engine or test the transmission; only inspections of the car's exterior are allowed. Although each vehicle is driven through the auction area, proving that it at least runs, there is no guarantee that it is safe for the open road.
As a result, successful bidders are taking a giant leap into the unknown. But most don't seem to mind. Such is the power of a perceived bargain.
"Sure, the engine could drop out on you," said Phil Moliere, a Bergen County resident in search of a mini-van. "That's a chance you take. But if you spend $2,000 and the car lasts a couple of years, that's better than spending $20,000 on a new car. There are no guarantees there, either."
Besides, Mr. Moliere said, there are ways to gauge a car's condition.
He stands outside the garage and intercepts the vehicles just before they are driven inside. Away from the din of whistles and Mad Mike's voice, Mr. Moliere listens closely to the engine for any pinging or evidence of skipping. If it sounds suspicious, he doesn't go near it.
Most of the vehicles auctioned off are not as glamorous as the Jaguar, and the savings not as spectacular. The typical car fetches $1,800 to $3,000 and shows more than 70,000 miles on its odometer. Damage to the door locks is not uncommon, a result of the repossessors' work.
 
Trouble Leaving the Lot
 Mr. Parnes deals in volume and can pick and choose which vehicles he will sell. "We don't take wrecks," he said. "The car's got to look good. The motor's got to be sound."
Of course, how a car looks doesn't say much about its overall condition.
One bidder, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, said he paid $1,200 last spring for a 1983 Toyota Tercel wagon that, on the surface, appeared to be in fine shape. When he drove it out of the lot, he discovered that the clutch assembly was shot and that the transmission slipped out of first gear.
Once the necessary repairs were completed, he said, the cost of the vehicle approached the retail price listed in used-car guides.
Such a possibility concerned Rich Geraci as his son Rick, celebrating his 17th birthday, eyed a sporty-looking sedan. Mr. Geraci drove his family over from Lincoln Park after seeing a newspaper advertisement for the auction.
"It sounds like a good deal," Mr. Geraci said. "But the thing that worries me is that you can't check out the engine. What if there's no oil in it?" As a result, Mr. Geraci said, he would use the occasion to just shop around and observe the bidding process.
Indeed, most of the first-time bidders walk away empty-handed, choosing to return another time when, perhaps, the prices are lower or they are more confident about their ability to choose wisely.
"The key point is not to rush," Mr. Moliere said. "Once you feel pressured to buy something, that's when you make a hasty decision."
 
Racing Stripes and Hot Colors
 As the cars were hosed down and driven to the auction block on this day, bidders quickly thumbed through used-car guides to find out the fair market value for each vehicle. A 1986 Cadillac Seville, with a retail book value of $6,900, went for $3,800; a 1984 Ford Bronco 4x4 worth $3,800 in a used-car lot fetched $2,500. (Successful bidders must also pay, in addition to the price of the car, an auction fee ranging from $199 to $349.)
In general, the crowd seemed most attracted to European luxury sedans and sleek Japanese models. Racing stripes, hot colors and spoked wheels were almost certain to drive up a vehicle's price.
And when a real dog was wheeled into the auction area, Mr. Parnes sought to liven up the proceedings with his own special brand of humor. As he commented later, "Buying a car should be fun." The company conducts audience surveys, he added, "and they say I'm crazy."
There was a time, Mr. Parnes said, when he offered warranties on his cars, but no more.
"If you're going to provide a warranty, it's not a true auction," he said. "Someone has to pay for it, and that's the customer."
The bidders at his auction find various ways to cope with the risk. Tony Koger of Woodbridge had an ace in the hole. "My brother," he said, "has a good friend who's a mechanic."
 
Where Cars Go on the Block

Car shoppers in search of auctions don't have to look far these days. Besides the auction at John Blackwell Inc., local police precincts, regional law-enforcement administrators and Federal agencies routinely put vehicles up for sale.
Most government-run sales can be tracked down in the legal-notices sections of local newspapers. Each car auction has its own distinct rules and regulations about bids, inspection procedures and form of payment. Almost all offer free admission.
The only regular Government public auction, and one of the more popular ones in New Jersey, is run by the General Services Administration, the agency responsible for selling United States Government fleet vehicles and autos seized by Federal law-enforcement officials. The G.S.A. auctions off about 125 cars on the second Friday of each month at its depot in Edison.
Unlike other auctioneers in New Jersey, the G.S.A. stands behind its vehicles, at least for a short while; if the car malfunctions within 15 days of purchase, the agency will buy it back. The G.S.A. also guarantees that the fleet vehicles that are auctioned have been serviced at regular intervals, although it makes no such pledge for seized automobiles.
Of course, these guarantees end up costing the bidder, because the G.S.A. sets a minimum price for each vehicle. If no one meets that opening bid, the car is pulled and offered at the next auction.
As a result, the bidding on a four-cylinder, three-year-old hatchback at a G.S.A. auction will probably begin at about $1,800, compared with less than $1,000 at Blackwell.

HEADLINE: New York Grand Prix to Have Environmentally Benign Effects

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New York's Deal on Grand Prix Race Glorifies a Proven Killer" (letter, Aug. 25) is filled with misinformation and misapprehension.
After long and arduous negotiations, the city entered into a 10-year contract providing New York with one of the world's premiere sporting events. From the success of similar races in cities like Detroit and Toronto, the Marlboro Grand Prix of New York is expected to succeed as a sporting event and economic boost. An economic impact study projects the race will add at least $56 million to the city's economy. 
 The city has proven its ability to organize mass public events, like the Democratic National Convention and the Persian Gulf war welcome home parade, that generate favorable attention and boost the tourist industry. New York City can attract large-scale special events that focus on our tourist, hospitality, restaurant, retail and entertainment industries.
The letter's implications that the city "trampled on environmental, land use review and public participation laws and regulations" are unjustified. The Grand Prix is a temporary event that will have no lasting impact on the environment or the community where it will take place. We followed all appropriate environmental and land use reviews, including a special noise analysis.
The Grand Prix will take place in an area of Lower Manhattan that is relatively empty during the weekend in which the race is scheduled. Air quality will not suffer because there will be 25 race cars running on methanol, a renewable, low-pollutant fuel, as against the normal traffic of gasoline-burning vehicles.
The race will also establish the New York Grand Prix Foundation, to support youth-related traffic-safety, after-school and summer educational programs. Philip Morris will use 1,100 of its 3,700 billboards in the months before the race for messages to discourage young people from smoking. The rest of the year, the company will place youth antismoking messages on some 350 billboards.
We believe New Yorkers will embrace the 1993 Grand Prix as an exciting and novel event. We have negotiated a favorable agreement with the promoter and the sponsors, and we look forward to acting as host to the event for at least the next nine years.

HEADLINE: DISPUTE OVER LAND BECOMES OBSTACLE TO SALVADOR PEACE

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS MARIAS, El Salvador

 BODY:
Seven months into El Salvador's difficult peace, extensive land claims by the former insurgents have become a major impediment to the demobilization of the nearly 8,000 Salvadoran guerrillas.
Leaders of the former rebels say their people will give up their weapons only if several hundred thousand acres of land is legally turned over to them, their families and sympathizers, either individually or collectively. 
 Joaquin Villalobos, one of the five senior leaders of the former rebels and the most effective military commander during the war, said this was the only way to insure that "the combatants are not demobilizing in exchange for a bad check."
 
Pessimism on Deadline
 Mr. Villalobos added that given the complicated issues on the table, "not even Mandrake the Magician could meet" the Oct. 31 deadline for complete demobilization.
No one expects war to resume if the deadline is not met, but the dispute mirrors the fact that one of the primary causes of the decade-long civil war -- access to land and social well-being -- remains largely unresolved.
So far this year, the differences over the land issue have been largely confined to negotiating tables, although in the first few weeks after the cease-fire took effect on Feb. 1, a number of agrarian groups linked to the insurgents took over, without major violence, some farms they had not occupied during the war.
Peacekeepers say several dozen people have been killed in recent months in isolated incidents that could have been linked to political differences but that land did not appear to be involved. No exchanges of gunfire have occurred between the two sides that would be considered truce violations.
The peace accords, negotiated over nearly two years with the help of a senior United Nations official, Alvaro de Soto, brought an end to more than 11 years of war between American-backed Government forces and five revolutionary groups making up the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which had help from Cuba and Nicaragua.
During last year's peace negotiations, President Alfredo Cristiani agreed in principle to find a way for guerrilla families and sympathizers to remain on land they occupied and farmed throughout the war, but the size of the guerrilla request, and the financial and legal implications, were not known until recently.
People who took part in the talks say there were intense pressures on both sides, particularly from the Bush Administration, to come up with a peace accord by the end of 1991, and that was part of the reason the land question was dealt with only in general form.
President Cristiani is willing to satisfy at least some of the demands of the former guerrillas, but is limited by a shortage of money and fears of a violent reaction from his own right flank, from which large-scale death-squad activity has erupted in the past.
 
Land-Disarmament Linkage
 If the rebel front continues to tie disarmament so closely to the land question, United Nations officials overseeing the transition to peace could order compliance with the Oct. 31 deadline, or they could draw up a new demobilization timetable. Neither step would assure a lasting peace, unless the Salvadorans find a way to accommodate each other.
Officially, the former guerrillas are claiming 600,000 acres for themselves and their followers, or 12 percent of El Salvador, which is the amount of agricultural land they say they occupied after the legal owners fled to areas outside guerrilla control.
In making this demand, the ex-guerrillas say they are simply backing up one of the key reasons they had in fighting the long war. Further, they say their land claims coincide with the principle established by previous Salvadoran governments, which tried to carry out a land reform program at the outset of the war in hopes of reducing peasant sympathy for the rebels.
International peacekeepers say that the former rebels, in private talks, have scaled back the size of their request, but the ex-guerrillas themselves confirm only that they have established a "priority" list consisting of 180,000 acres, about which negotiations are under way with the Government.
Although the greatest amount of the land claimed is in the northern departments of Morazan and Chaletenango, subsistence-farming areas where much of the war was fought, the economic jewel of the guerrilla claim is the rich lands surrounding Las Marias here in the department of Usulutan.
Usulutan produces coffee and other export crops, and most of the land is legally owned by powerful landholding families. This increases the possibility of conflict over the land claims, but it also means that Usulutan could become the source of the wealth the Marti Front needs if it is to become an important civilian political party.
Switching out of the radical vocabulary they used through most of the war, the ex-guerrillas now speak of using the agricultural wealth of Usulutan to "capitalize" them as a political force.
 
'We Demand What We Won'
 A seasoned former rebel combatant known as Ricardo made it clear that was the intent as he showed a visitor around a museum the front has created in a former coffee mill at Las Marias in honor of the insurgency.
"What interests us now is economic power," he said. "We demand what we won."
Of the ex-guerrillas' 600,000-acre claim, 150,000 acres is in Usulutan. It was not possible to learn how much of the smaller, priority package is in Usulutan.
One of those expecting to enjoy the fruits of this effort by the guerrilla leadership is Jose Antonio Romero Villacorta, who on a recent day sat in the door of his house a short distance down the road from the museum chatting with a insurgent who was still armed.
Mr. Romero said that he and his cooperative had "worked politically" with the guerrillas and were still willing to be guided by them. Two of his sons, he said, had served with the rebels and have recently been admitted to the new civilian police academy.
During the war, 72 families came together in the cooperative that Mr. Romero leads, controlling nearly 1,000 acres of land. He said they now expect that that land will become theirs.
In this small, overpopulated land, heavily dependent on agriculture, land conflicts have often been behind the worst violence. The agrarian reform decree of the military-Christian Democratic junta that governed El Salvador in 1980 is generally believed to have set off the wave of killings attributed to right-wing death squads that year.
Because this was a war that neither side won but neither admitted losing, the negotiations last year went into great detail in committing the Government to policies and programs intended to incorporate the former rebels into national political and economic life.
But there was not time during the peace negotiations to work out the specific arrangements on land.
As time has passed, the ex-guerrillas seem, if anything, to have toughened their position on the land issue, and the Government is only slowly coming to grips with how important it is to them.
The two sides have just begun to work on the logistics of surveying the land, establishing whether, in fact, guerrilla sympathizers are on it, and deciding how to deal with the claims of legal owners, who expect to be reimbursed or provided land elsewhere.
The Marti Front wants the Government to use its own funds or foreign aid to compensate the legal owners or buy them other land. But with land in short supply and the war over, land values are rising.
The Government says it doesn't have nearly enough money to meet the guerrillas' land claims and charges that the ex-guerrilla leaders are using the land question as a means to gain political advantage. The guerrilla front says that is exactly what it wants to do.
"Of course we are using this to strengthen our position," said Antonio Alvarez, a member of the land commission of the former guerrilla front.
 
'A Power in This Country'
 "We already are a power in this country," he said. "No government negotiates with a defeated army."
Eleno Hernan Castro, another member of the land commission, also made clear that even if the owners will not sell, it will be difficult to clear their land of former rebels and their followers.
"When the war came, the owners couldn't stay and work the land," he said, "so the workers made their own agricultural plots, and then they expanded, adding cows and other things. Now, they all expect to become owners."
He added, "And if they don't, who is going to be able to remove them?"
Mr. Villalobos has also said that complete demobilization depends on the assignment of new civilian police officers around the country to replace the old military-commanded National Police. Although the creation of the new police force, which will include former guerrillas, is behind schedule, the new academy is functioning and is expected to graduate its first class in February.
Under the accords, the ex-guerrillas were to demobilize at the rate of 20 per cent a month starting last May. So far, only one group of 20 percent has done so, mostly people who were not active combatants, and the number of weapons turned in was fewer than the number of people demobilizing.
The remaining 80 per cent, like the army, is gathered in what are called concentration zonesunder the observation of United Nations military and police experts.

HEADLINE: Corporate Elite A Fading Force Over Hartford

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Rumors floated through Hartford for months this summer that the financially troubled Hartford Whalers hockey team would be rescued by a familiar white knight: Aetna Life and Casualty.
As Hartford's largest employer and longest-running local booster, Aetna would simply not allow the city's only major-league sports team to go under or be wooed away, or so people said. 
 A decade ago, when Hartford was still dominated by a group of corporate executives known as the Bishops, they might have been right. The Bishops moved mountains here for a halcyon decade and a half from the 1960's into the 1980's, led mostly by Aetna. With powerful national companies behind them and City Hall often in agreement, the collective vision of Hartford's insurance and banking leaders became the official vision.
 
A Short-Term View
 Aetna's repeated and painful assertions that it would not single-handedly save the Whalers marked the sputtering denouement of the story of the Bishops. And business experts and sociologists say that echoes can be heard in other cities as well, where small groups of powerful people who once charted the direction of urban America -- whether it be the oil interests of Dallas or the old-money patricians of Atlanta -- have been humbled by the recession, or shoved aside by tumultuous changes at City Hall.
The greater pressures of the corporate takeover game and the worldwide economic competition also brought a new type of corporate leader, business experts say, more attuned to short-term profits and less concerned with the corporation as a social institution.
"C.E.O.'s are withdrawing from the community," said Joseph Galaskiewicz, a professor of sociology and management at the University of Minnesota. That has not meant, generally, that corporate charity has dried up, he said, but rather that executives squeezed by tough economic times, global competition and sometimes hostility from City Hall are more likely to be minding their own business.
In places like Hartford, or Minneapolis, where an axis of companies led by the Dayton Hudson Corporation helped forge a vision for the Twin Cities, the retrenchment has been particularly painful because the corporate powers in those cities had genuine social agendas, as opposed to the more familiar chamber of commerce goals like lowering business taxes or curbing regulation.
 
Remaking a City
 The era of deepest corporate involvement began in Hartford in the late 1960's, in the aftermath of riots that had torn apart some poor neighborhoods. In the years that followed, the corporations led an attempt to rebuild and revitalize downtown as a way to spur the growth of tax collections, and thus address the problems of the city's impoverished residents.
Whole blocks were razed to make way for redevelopment. Boards of corporate giants like the Travelers companies and Aetna put up tens of millions of dollars to expand the downtown area and build large office complexes like Constitution Plaza. They also led the drive and helped to finance the Hartford Civic Center, an indoor mall and arena.
Now, with corporate leadership diminished and the city struggling to cope with the recession, local business and community leaders have started what they call the Vision Project to chart new directions. One example is consideration of a proposal to ask the state to legalize casino gambling for Hartford.
"We are in such difficult times that people would like a deus ex machina, they would like a god to pop up out of the box and say, "Your problems are solved,' " said Hartford's Mayor, Carrie Saxon Perry. "But that's gone. It's a new day."
Business experts say that even by diminished standards, civic involvement by Hartford's top corporate leaders is still probably greater than elsewhere because of long traditions and culture.
But strains are also evident. In the last six months, the number of full-time staff positions devoted to charity or foundation work has been cut by more than half at the city's five largest corporations, according to the Coordinating Council for Foundations. Many companies have also reduced their giving, with reductions to the arts or housing.
"To the degree that business conditions are difficult, C.E.O.'s have a responsibility to focus inwardly on their businesses," said Denis F. Mullane, the president of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company and one of the few members of the old corps of civic-minded chief executive officers still in office.
 
Effects of Power Sharing
 Urban sociologists say that in cities all across the country, local politics has been turned upside down over the last decade as groups once outside the power structure have elbowed their way in. From Houston, which elected its first woman mayor, Kathy Whitmire, in 1981, to New York and New Haven, which in the last five years elected their first black mayors, leaders changed, even as urban problems deepened.
In Hartford, many residents say the problems have been compounded by an outdated charter. Here the mayor, the nine-member City Council and the appointed city manager all share power. And in much the same way that the power of the corporate leaders was eroded, so now there is no single strong voice who can speak for the city. Business leaders accustomed to a clear chain of command, or who remember the 1970's when Deputy Mayor Nicholas R. Carbone worked side by side with the Bishops, find it maddening.
Last year, dissident Democrats also managed to squeeze out of the City Council the few Republicans, who had been, until then, a conduit of communication between the board rooms of downtown and the rococo vaults of City Hall.
At Aetna, which invested $50 million over the last four years on a real-estate project on Pratt Street, a company spokesman said confusion at City Hall would make consideration of similar projects less attractive to business leaders.
"It was very discouraging," said the company's vice president in charge of real-estate investments, William M. Russell. "There's no concentration of power or decision-making to bring off a complicated project in any sort of smooth way. I can't think of the circumstances under which I would have the inclination and energy to repeat that project."
In 1975, there were perhaps two dozen major corporations in Hartford or its suburbs with strong roots here, as well as chief executives who had come up locally and lived here themselves for decades. Since then, business experts say, the number has been cut by perhaps half.
Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, once at the center of the chief executive officers' club through its former chairman, Walter J. Connolly Jr., merged with the Bank of New England, based in Boston, which went bankrupt in 1991. Heublein, the liquor company, changed hands twice over the 1980's and its executives now report to a parent company in London, Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. Connecticut General Insurance became part of CIGNA Corporation, based in Philadelphia.
The nationwide collapse in real estate values -- the prime assets of many insurers -- also forced cost cutting. Between 1987 and 1991, for example, the number of people employed in finance, insurance and real estate fell in Hartford by 10.3 percent, to 42,140 in June 1991 from 47,000 people four years earlier, according to the most recent figures from the State Department of Labor.
In cities as diverse as Portland, Me., Indianapolis, Phoenix and Cleveland, political experts say that business leadership in civic affairs has been either diminished or refocused. Charity contributions are much more likely to be tied to a company's profits and linked to projects that can eventually benefit the company.
 
A Corporate Legacy
 Sociologists say that old Puritan traditions of paternalistic, if authoritarian, benevolence have long been an element of local politics in old New England cities like Hartford, and in a broad band of the upper Midwest settled by New Englanders.
John H. Filer, who was born in New Haven and spent his career moving up the corporate ladder at Aetna until he became chairman, was one of the nation's leading spokesman in the 1970's for corporate civic involvement. By all accounts, he was the biggest Bishop of them all.
"They were investments, they were necessary investments," he said of his work and that of the other executives in Hartford. But it was not, Mr. Filer conceded, an example of urban democracy in action.
"We were well-motivated, and I think perhaps we were benevolent despots, if you will," he said. "But I don't like any system that puts into the hands of a few who are not elected an usual amount of power -- I think it's a dangerous thing to do."
Critics of the era, including many people now in power at City Hall, say the corporate leaders imposed a white male perspective on a city where a majority of residents are black or Puerto Rican. Even the choice of the city's one sports team, the Whalers, which was brought to Hartford in the mid-1970's by an Aetna-led local group, has been called into question by the revisionists. Hockey, they say, is a sport mainly played and loved by white males.
The corporate focus was also clearly on the city's downtown -- at the expense, some residents say, of the neighborhoods, where poverty and crime continued to fester, despite the efforts of the Bishops.
Whatever Hartford is to be in a world of diminished corporate involvement, those residents say, it will have to involve a new pattern. Some people point to Pittsburgh, where residents redefined their city as a high-technology sector after the withering of big steel's dominant role. Other people say finding a new vision will be hampered by the fact that it was always handled from above.
"Power is diffused, and maybe this is good," said Harry F. Merrow, former president of the Hartford Leadership Forum, one of the groups working on a project to develop a new vision for the city. "There are a lot more groups who are actively involved than there were when the Bishops were around. The problem is we haven't learned how to marshal those groups in the best interests of the city."

HEADLINE: INCOME DATA SHOW YEARS OF EROSION FOR U.S. WORKERS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Several new economic reports demonstrate starkly the extent to which Americans' incomes have stalled, painting a depressing picture of workers struggling to crawl up a down escalator.
Together they give the Democrats fresh ammunition for what they hope will be a potent weapon in the election campaign. 
 "Stagnation in wages is at the heart of this election," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. "People are very concerned with unemployment, but it's the stagnation in income that makes people believe that there's something fundamentally wrong with the American economy."
 
Stagnation and Decline
 The Commerce Department reported last week, for example, that income growth in 1991 trailed inflation for the first time since 1982 and that disposable income per capita, after removing inflation and taxes, had failed to grow since President Bush took office. The department's figures also show that average hourly earnings in the private sector are down 3.2 percent since January 1989.
As President Ronald Reagan once did, the Democrats are asking, often, whether Americans are better off than they were four years ago. The Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research center with close ties to the Democrats, released a study today showing that high school graduates now earn 26.5 percent less in entry-level jobs than similar graduates did in 1979. That study also found that after-inflation wages for workers with college degrees fell 3.1 percent between 1987 and 1991.
 
Outlook for Young Workers
 In another study, Congress's Joint Economic Committee said last week that a 30-year-old male with a high school education earned $3,500 less, adjusted for inflation, than a comparable 30-year-old did in 1979. The committee, dominated by Democrats, said most young men entering the work force should expect lower lifetime earnings than the previous generation of men. Too few women were in the work force a generation ago to make an equivalent comparison.
The Republicans have responded by berating Democratic "declinists" who assert that the next generation of Americans will be poorer than the current generation. The Republicans blame the Democratic Congress for the economy's poor performance and assert that the economy performed far worse under President Jimmy Carter than it has under President Bush.
But Republicans could find little comfort in last week's economic news. A Census Bureau report issued on Thursday, for example, found that median household income had fallen 5.1 percent since 1989, after inflation was factored in. That report also found that the number of Americans living in poverty rose last year by 2.1 million, to 35.7 million.
And the Labor Department reported on Friday that American business and industry lost 167,000 jobs in August, as factory employment slid to its lowest level since April 1983. The unexpected bad news paints a gloomy portrait of the economy.
"Contrary to the past, when people could anticipate that they would do better over their lifetime and their children would do better than they have done, now they face stagnation and even decline in their income," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who is the chairman of the committee. "The American dream of improving yourself and moving forward has not been realized over the last decade and a half."
Income stagnation is hardly new -- hourly wages have been slipping since 1973. But the prolonged economic slowdown during President Bush's term has pushed it to the center of the political stage. In a speech on Thursday to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, cited the dismal income statistics and said that four years ago, Mr. Bush promised "prosperity with a purpose," but that "four years later, we have no prosperity."
 
Dispute Over Statistics
 Bush campaign officials interpret the statistics differently, saying that hourly compensation -- they use figures combining wages and fringe benefits -- has grown a total of 3 percent under Presidents Reagan and Bush, after having fallen 1.6 percent under President Carter.
"The picture is nowhere as bleak as the Clinton campaign would have you believe," said Torie Clarke, the Bush campaign's press secretary. "They're trying to exploit the emotions of people in tough economic times." She said that if Governor Clinton was sincere about wanting to increase economic growth and incomes, he would press Congress to approve President Bush's growth package, which includes a capital gains tax cut and a tax credit for first-time home buyers.
As for the talk of downward mobility, Bush Administration officials respond that the 35-year-olds today generally earn more than when they were 25.
But Lee Price, senior economist for the Joint Economic Committee, said, "The steepness of the income gains from 25 to 35 is less steep than it used to be."
 
A Challenge for the Winner
 Beyond the tit for tat of the campaign, the question of static earnings poses a daunting challenge for whoever wins in November. Economists across the ideological spectrum say the most important question facing the United States is to find ways to lift workers' earnings and the nation's growth rate.
William A. Niskanen Jr., a member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers and chairman of the Cato Institute, a conservative research center, saw several reasons for the wage stagnation. He cited low growth in worker productivity since 1973 and the internationalization of the American economy, two trends that have increased wage pressures on American workers. "It's put our low-skilled workers more in competition with low-skilled workers in other countries."
Wages have also been held down, he said, by the rapid increase in nonwage costs paid by employers, most notably those for health care.
Liberal economists say slow growth in the minimum wage and the weakening of unions have also contributed to low wage growth.
There seem to be as many theories about how to increase growth and income levels as there are economists. Conservatives usually propose cutting taxes, especially those on capital gains; Democrats generally favor increased public investment on highways, railroads and telecommunications, which they say will spur growth and efficiency.
The one area that Republicans and Democrats agree on for raising growth and incomes is improving education, but they disagree on how.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said the slowdown in wage growth and productivity growth dated from well before President Bush's election. He attributes the slowdown in productivity in large part to the reduced rate of capital investment per worker, and "the enormous growth and changing composition of the labor force."
Many economists say the flood of baby boomers and women into the labor force has helped push down productivity growth and wages since 1973. People in these groups were new to the labor force and thus relatively inexperienced.
 
Need for More Investment
 "To get wage growth up over the long haul, we need to get productivity growth up," Mr. Boskin said. "And to do that, we need tax incentives to spur investment and entrepreneurship as well as enormous improvement in elementary and secondary-school performance."
Wage stagnation and stunted economic growth in general have fueled voter disaffection. A Gallup poll in June found that 75 percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied with the opportunity for the next generation of Americans to live better than their parents. Twenty-two percent said they were satisfied.
"The general idea in America that kids can live better than their parents -- people just don't think that's working anymore," said Larry Hugick, vice president with the Gallup Organization. "It's giving up the American dream to some extent."
In a New York Times-CBS poll in August, 78 percent of the respondents said the state of the economy was fairly bad or very bad, while 21 percent said it was fairly good or very good. In that poll, 80 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way President Bush was handling the economy, while just 14 percent approved.
Lawrence Mishel, research director for the Economic Policy Institute, said wage stagnation could hurt President Bush with some voters. "There are two groups of swing voters: blue-collar Reagan Democrats and yuppie suburbanites who are socially liberal but conservative on economics," he said. "These people aren't feeling so good about Bush because he's taking it out of their lunch bucket and briefcase."
Kevin Phillips, a Republican author and commentator, said income stagnation could prove a boon for the campaign of Governor Clinton. "The lack of growth in personal income, in the hands of a skillful political attacker, can be used to show that the growth in the economy has mostly benefited certain income groups and levels and Wall Street, while it hasn't benefited the average person very much," he said. "They could argue that it represents the policy priorities of the Administration to help the people at the top. There is a lot of potential benefit in this if the Democrats can make it stick."
Neil Newhouse, a Republican poll taker, said weak wage growth definitely helped Governor Clinton but did not clinch the election for him. He said that economic problems meant that a lot of people "will give Clinton a listen," but that they still had to trust that he would run the economy better than President Bush. For that, he said, "I don't think they have an answer yet."

HEADLINE: No Easy Fix For Somalia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 6

 BODY:
As relief officials scramble to organize food, workers and logistics to alleviate the suffering in Somalia, they are uncovering a disaster that many believe was allowed to spin out of control through international neglect. But now that attention has been focused on the eastern African country's devastating famine, it is proving difficult to provide the remedies needed to deal with hunger on so great a scale.
Despite a stepped-up United Nations effort, an American airlift and planes from several European nations joining the International Committee of the Red Cross -- for 18 months the only major relief agency working in Somalia -- the gap between what is required in the country and what is being offered remains large. 
 And as delivery delays persist and people die by the hundreds each day, the 1.5 million Somalis thought to be at risk of soon starving to death are becoming weaker, and the chances of saving them ever more bleak.
 
War and Empty Promises
 The barriers to a smooth operation are many. Some result from the factional fighting that has torn apart Somalia, something that extends to the looting of food. But other obstacles are rooted in complicated logistics, the political concerns of donors, and the failure of some governments to pledge assistance despite their expressions of sympathy, even outrage.
A nuts-and-bolts problem is the inability or unwillingness of those private relief agencies already working in Somalia, most of which are concentrated in the capital, Mogadishu, to send personnel to the rural areas.
This is particularly true in the southwest, where the suffering is most concentrated. These agencies are essential in setting up feeding centers and in carrying out lengthy transactions with local Somalis to insure that the food is not looted.
Two agencies, Irish Concern and a Los Angeles group, the International Medical Corps, have gone beyond Mogadishu and are working in Baidoa, in the rural hunger zone. But both say they are overstretched and have no staff to send to other areas with urgent needs. There are other relief agencies, like World Vision, that have sent high-ranking representatives to Mogadishu on a number of occasions but have yet to establish a continuing presence in the country, officials said.
Ten days ago, the Red Cross increased its estimate of the amount of food needed for what it said was "the survival of the nation." About 60,000 tons a month was required, the Red Cross said, up from 45,000. But it acknowledged that with its $100 million armada of helicopters, ships, barges and transport planes, it could only deliver 22,000 tons a month.
 
U.N. and U.S. Falling Short
 So far, the United Nations, which has delivered 40,000 tons of food to Somalia this year, and the Americans, who started an airlift a little over a week ago, have not been able to make up the difference.
When the White House abruptly announced a military airlift of food to Somalia three weeks ago, officials said the United States would donate 143,000 tons of grain, oil and other items.
But this food is pledged for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and so will not even begin arriving before then. Only 10 percent of the 143,000 tons is expected to be airlifted. The rest will be sent by ship or sold to merchants in Kenya who, according to American officials, will resell it in Somalia at monitored prices.
This program of selling food to merchants, a method used in famine situations to revive commerce, is being explored. But it, too, is yet to get under way, the officials said.
According to Fred Cuny, an American expert on disasters who is heading the food-sales program, its aim is to try to rejuvenate, no matter how meagerly, the depleted economy. It is important, he says, that ways be found to help Somalis from being continually dependent on food aid.
Thus, by sending merchants back into the country with low-priced grain, even a barter system could be established between those herders who still had a little livestock and the merchants with food.
The United States airlift from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Somalia started on Aug. 28, to a fairly secure town, Belet Uen, on the Ethiopian border. It is a place that the Red Cross has already been serving for five months. Officials acknowledged that the daily flights to Belet Uen -- which have so far delivered roughly 30 days' worth of food -- were a way for American military pilots to learn the ropes in Somalia.
 
U.S. Assistance Is Selective
 On Saturday, the military airlift was expanded, with two planes carrying 20 tons of food sent to Baidoa, perhaps the hardest-hit rural area and one prone to factional trouble. The flights there will continue, the officials said.
So far, the American planes have avoided other hardship posts, where the death rates are also high. Two such places are Hodur, 170 miles northwest of Mogadishu, and a bush town, Bardera, about 200 miles west. In Hodur, United States officials say, there is not yet a relief organization on the ground to insure that the food they deliver reaches the hungry.
In Bardera, about 16,000 desperate people have gathered in the last few weeks. Untold numbers have perished along the sandy tracks into town, and at least 60 people die there each day.
But American officials say there are political reasons for not flying there. They say they are leery of giving too much of a boost to one of the two main protagonists in the nation's civil war, Gen. Mohammed Farrah Aidid, who now has his headquarters at Bardera.
The decision not to send food there was made even though the American military recently flew into Bardera to assess the situation and hacked down trees on either side of the dirt airstrip in anticipation of running a food shuttle.
 
Balancing Warlords
 Mr. Aidid's chief opponent in the Somali civil war is Mohammed Ali Mahdi, another warlord who controls the northern sector of Mogadishu. He was named interim President last year. The United States recognizes neither man as the leader of Somalia. By not sending food to Bardera, or pushing for greater logistical support on the ground by nongovernment agencies, it appears intent on not offending Mr. Mahdi -- even at the cost of many more people dying.
Several American officials expressed concern that much of the food airlifted to Bardera would end up with Mr. Aidid's gunmen. But relief workers argue that by flooding an area with food, some of it is bound to filter though to the bereft.
As a Somali Red Crescent worker put it: "Losing food is normal -- people loot like it is a hobby -- but in the end the more food that is brought, the lower the prices, the less incentive there is to loot, and it's better for the poor."
The United States says Bardera will have to be served by flights from the United Nations World Food Program. But strapped for aircraft, the United Nations has not been able to keep up a steady flow of food there, where the first relief workers, from CARE, were posted four days ago.
The workers had lined up a trucker to take the United Nations-supplied food to outlying areas, in an effort to encourage starving people to stay there rather than make the journey to Bardera. But because of the shortage of food in Bardera itself, the trucks were never dispatched.
 
A Shortage of Donations
 The World Food Program, a Rome-based specialized agency that requests food abroad and dispatches it to drought and famine areas, is getting a poor response from donors. Last week, the program's executive director, an American, Catherine Bertini, said 72,000 more tons of food would be sent to Somalia.
Mohammed Sahnoun, the United Nations Secretary General's special representative in the country, remarked that this is "not so much."
"And so far they have only given 30,000 tons," he said. "What's 30,000 tons? We should be reaching 50,000 tons a month."
Mr. Sahnoun, a retired Algerian Ambassador appointed in May, has been needling the United Nations for months on what he regards as its lamentable performance in Somalia.
The absence of United Nations personnel in the Somali capital for almost all of 1991 on security grounds -- expatriate workers were evacuated at the beginning of last year -- was one of the main reasons for the limited information in other countries about the building disaster in Somalia, Mr. Sahnoun said.
When a few, mostly junior United Nations staffers were sent back to Mogadishu earlier this year, under pressure from the United States, it was usually on a part-time basis and without much enthusiasm, he added. In July, Mr. Sahnoun questioned why a British nongovernment agency, Save the Children, had delivered more food to Somalia than the United Nations Children's Fund.
He asserted that much of this failure was due to an overwhelming United Nations bureaucracy that, in contrast to the Red Cross, is made up of civil servants more interested in their careers and perquisites than in the job at hand.
He asserted further that when he went to Berbera, a port in northern Somalia, he found staff members of the Red Cross working there while the United Nations people had left for the beaches of neighboring Djibouti, saying the town was unsafe.
Despite all this, he said, now that United Nations agencies have been embarrassed into working harder, it is up to governments to pledge food. "The World Food Program is complaining it is not getting enough support from the donors," Mr. Sahnoun said.
 
No Help From Tokyo
 Officials said that Japan had not yet given support. They said that Germany had sent two planes but no food and that Italy, while trying to mediate the civil conflict, had not sent food either.
The United Nations Children's Fund, ordinarily a very popular agency with donors, said its Somalia program, too, was suffering from a shortage of funds. So far, $11 million had been collected -- most of it in the last two weeks -- of the $22 million needed to supply seeds to farmers, provide supplemental food for children and offer health services in coming months, a spokesman, Ian MacLeod said.
In the meantime, 10,000 tons of United Nations food sits in a storehouse in Mogadishu's harbor area, enough to supply about a million people for three weeks, relief workers said. Shootings and squabbles at the port among Somali factions in the last week have prevented the United Nations from moving the food out.
The 500 Pakistani soldiers due in Mogadishu as part of the United Nations force to insure the distribution of such food have been delayed and are not expected for several weeks, Mr. Sahnoun said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN -- Issues: Free Trade;
Clinton Is Pressed to Take Stand on Pact

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 6

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton, who is fond of seeking compromise where it did not previously exist, may yet be forced into a corner as President Bush works to push him toward taking a firm stand on the North American Free Trade Agreement that was announced last month.
It is a delicate problem for Mr. Clinton that could expose one of his weakest traits: his penchant for trying to have it both ways. 
 At various points in the campaign, Mr. Clinton has chosen obfuscation when a direct answer held some risk. The most noteworthy instances were his explanations of his military deferments during the Vietnam War and his explanation of whether he had smoked marijuana.
The issue of free trade poses such a risk. Mr. Clinton takes a chance on alienating an important group of supporters on one side, while giving the Bush-Quayle forces ammunition on the other side to attack him for caving in to labor interests.
 
Clinton Supports Concept
 The trade agreement, if ratified by Congress, would make Canada, the United States and Mexico the world's largest trading bloc. Representatives of organized labor have denounced the pact outright, saying it would cost thousands of jobs. But Republicans and business leaders have argued that a trade agreement would increase exports and strengthen the economy.
Mr. Clinton has said he supports the concept of encouraging free trade to help American exports, but he has also said he would support only an agreement that called for strict protections for labor standards and the environment.
"I very much want to be for a trade agreement," Mr. Clinton said tonight in an interview on NBC. "I hope I can be for this one but you've got to give me a chance to read it and analyze it."
Last week Mr. Clinton told the A.F.L.-C.I.O.: "With Europe becoming more integrated, and maybe more closed, with Asia becoming more integrated, and maybe more closed, we have to have some markets. And that's why I hope we can get the right kind of agreement with Mexico."
But Mr. Clinton has not taken a stand on what standards the agreement should meet. His advisers say they will not formulate details until they have a chance to scrutinize the complicated agreement, which is scheduled to be presented to Congress on Tuesday.
Mr. Bush said gleefully last week that Mr. Clinton was going to have "straddle sores" before it was all over. The President has made the trade agreement a central feature of his campaign, and his aides plan to continue criticizing Mr. Clinton on what they describe as his efforts to "backpedal" from supporting the plan.
 
'Trying to Please All Parties'
 "He is trying to please all parties," said Torie Clarke, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign. "That is not leadership."
Mr. Clinton's aides and supporters, naturally, disagree.
"He has been forthright in saying the free trade agreement done right can be a good thing," said Gene B. Sperling, Mr. Clinton's economics adviser. "He rejected the philosophical argument that a free trade agreement is inherently bad."
So far, the Arkansas Governor has succeeded in deflecting questions on the agreement, saying he needed to study the final document, which is enormous, complex and not yet available to the public. Mr. Sperling says, "It's just not intelligent to have a position yet."
Part of the reason is that union leaders see little alternative to backing the Democrat this year. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. gave Mr. Clinton a pre-Labor Day endorsement last week.
 
Waiting to See Agreement
 Mr. Sperling said the only groups pressing the Clinton campaign to be more specific on the trade agreement were the Republicans and trade lobbyists in Washington.
"It would warm my heart if I got one phone call for Head Start for every 50 phone calls we get on trade issues," Mr. Sperling said.
Tom Donahue, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he could accept Mr. Clinton's position for now.
"Our position has been clear," Mr. Donahue said. "His has been, too. He has said we ought to see the agreement, which I think is eminently responsible."
Mr. Donahue conceded that Mr. Clinton had to attend to political positioning in the interest of winning more votes than just those of organized labor.
"He is a candidate for President of the United States," he said. "I'm not. I can pop off about this."
Many labor unions were slow to support Mr. Clinton during the primary campaign, citing his spotty labor record in Arkansas. But after seeing the Democratic candidates many labor leaders preferred fall by the wayside -- first Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and then former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California -- they have joined the Clinton fold.
 
Labor's Backing of Clinton
 William H. Bywater, the president of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, said he was dead set against what he called "this crazy free trade agreement" and has told Mr. Clinton about his objections.
"I'd like to hear Clinton come out and say, 'As far as I'm concerned, the wage rates of workers in Mexico are far too low, and if you want to start raising the standard of living in Mexico, then bring them up to the minimum in the United States -- $4.25 an hour,' " he said. "That's what I think he should do."
Backing Mr. Clinton at this juncture has become the most pragmatic of decisions for many labor leaders. Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., has said Mr. Clinton need not take a position on the trade issue until after the election. The trade issue could prove crucial in several states Mr. Clinton is counting on to win, including Michigan and Illinois.
But it remains unclear whether these leaders speak for their rank-and-file members, many of whom are suffering from job losses brought on by the closing or relocation of manufacturing plants.
Danny Hoffman, the former auto worker who is now staff coordinator of the University of Michigan's Labors Studies Center, said Mr. Clinton's position has been "vague."
"I don't fault Clinton for saying he is in favor of trade," Mr. Hoffman said. "But what I want to find out is what kind of restrictions are you willing to put on Mexico?"
He said the auto workers he had talked to about the election were leaning toward Mr. Clinton.
"They're saying anything's better than Bush," Mr. Hoffman said. "But it's not a real clear choice right now."

HEADLINE: Gains Are Reported in Talks on Haiti

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Negotiators for Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the Government of army officers who overthrew him tentatively agreed last week in their first meeting here to send an international peacekeeping mission to Haiti, a representative of Father Aristide said.
Father Aristide's backers and diplomats from the region say the Bush Administration's support is vital to the success of the proposal to deploy unarmed neutral observers to Haiti's nine administrative regions to reduce the level of political violence and prepare the way for the restoration of an elected government. 
 The Administration has recently seemed lukewarm about Father Aristide, a charismatic priest whose government was overthrown on Sept. 30, 1991, nine months after an election monitored by American and international observers.
 
Military Response Sought
 The exiled President's representative at the talks, the Rev. Antoine Adrien, said in an interview on Saturday that the Haitian military has been asked by the Organization of American States to respond by Tuesday to the proposal.
Father Adrien said that the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Joao Clemente Baena Soares, who mediated in the talks, was ready to dispatch the first 18 "democracy monitors" as early as Wednesday. Four officials of the organization are already in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, to set up the operation.
The Haitian military's representative at the meeting, Foreign Minister Francois Benoit, has not discussed publicly what went on in the talks, which ended late Friday night. Officials at the O.A.S. would say only that the talks had been "useful" and had opened a new channel of communication to the military leadership.
Mr. Benoit and Haiti's current Prime Minister, Marc Bazin, can operate only with the sufferance of the military, which is suspicious of any international intervention and fearful that the return of Father Aristide could make officers vulnerable to criminal trials.
The military has nullified previous agreements reached under O.A.S. auspices.
In the interview, Father Adrien, who heads a 10-member commission appointed in July by the exiled President and based in Port-au-Prince, called on the Bush Administration to lend its active support to the new initiative by putting pressure on the military to accept O.A.S. monitors.
He said Washington appeared to view the military leader of Haiti, Gen. Raoul Cedras, with the same tolerance it accorded the former Nicargauan strongman, Antonio Somoza Debayle.
"We have been making concession after concession, but nothing is asked from the people on the other side of the table," he said, reflecting the opinion of many of Father Aristide's supporters that a leader who won two-thirds of the popular vote in a reasonably free and fair election should expect more help from the Bush Administration.
"The other side has made no concessions at all," Father Adrien said. "They preside over this incredible violence and yet nothing is asked of them. There is no accountability for what they are doing."
Recent reports by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Amnesty International and other groups have painted a bleak picture of Haiti. They say that the level and style of violence recalls the worst days of the Tontons Macoutes, the death squads of the Duvalier family.
Father Adrien, who has set up an office in the Haitian capital to represent Father Aristide, said repression by the military Government has grown more intense in the last three months. He attributes this to discontent among the people over the political stalemate and the economic embargo, however porous, which has hurt many Haitians.
"Repression is the sign there is resistance to the military," Father Adrien said, speaking by telephone from Brooklyn before his return to Haiti today. "It goes up because resistance is up."
The exiled President's representative said that the talks this week were not negotiations about Father Aristide's returning to Haiti.
"We were talking about stopping the violence," he said. "Only that."
The introduction of rights monitors, similar to teams operating in Nicaragua and Suriname, has been discussed for nearly 10 months. Volunteers from the United States and Canada who speak French or Creole have been asking to join, O.A.S. officials said.
The Aristide camp wanted to send 18 monitors to each of Haiti's administrative regions, called departments. Father Adrien said that Mr. Baena Soares told him and Mr. Benoit that only 22 monitors were available for the whole country.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN -- Issues: Taxes;
Clinton Painted as Taxer but Isn't Tarred

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Last month, President Bush's political strategists rolled out a political weapon so fearsome that it had destroyed three Democratic Presidential candidates in 12 years, and pointed it squarely at Gov. Bill Clinton.
On Aug. 20, on network television, Mr. Bush himself squeezed the trigger. 
 "Here's the question for the American people," he said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. "Who do you trust in this election? The candidate who's raised taxes one time and regrets it? Or the other candidate, who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed it every time?"
Thus did Mr. Bush fire off the accusation that a President Clinton would siphon voters' paychecks to feed a vast and indolent bureaucracy. It was the same charge that wounded the Presidential hopes of Democrats in 1980, 1984 and 1988, only more deadly: Mr. Clinton had already said he would impose $148 billion in new or higher taxes during his first term in office.
 
Charges of Distortion
 Yet two weeks later, the Democratic nominee appears not only to have dodged Mr. Bush's attack but even to have turned it against him. A counterattack accusing the President of distorting Mr. Clinton's record on taxes has been echoed by political columnists and amplified by approving editorials in major newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. The Bush campaign's own accusations of distortion, some verifiable, have passed mostly unnoticed.
Perhaps most ominous for the White House, the broader message about Mr. Clinton's tax policies has failed -- so far, at least -- to resound through the electorate as in past Republican campaigns. Polls show that, even coupled with a renewed pledge to cut taxes in a second term, Mr. Bush's attack seems to have barely dented Mr. Clinton's standing on the issue.
"We're putting out information that's documented and footnoted," one Bush aide said last week, "and Clinton's out there throwing spitballs at us with nothing to back it up. And who do you think is getting the play?"
In any case, the Republican attack's apparent inability to damage Mr. Clinton as effectively as it did Michael S. Dukakis, Walter F. Mondale and Jimmy Carter reflects a new reality..
Mr. Bush all but repudiated his low-tax image in 1990, when he broke his "no new taxes" pledge and assented to an increase in the personal income tax rate. Mr. Clinton and the Democrats, meanwhile, have hit on the notion of tax fairness (translation: soak the rich) as a way to get around public resentment of taxes.
Bush aides say they have no intention of slackening their assault, noting that they started late and that the two months left until the election can be a political eon.
But Mr. Clinton has dominated the debate so far with his swift response to Mr. Bush's declaration that the Arkansas Governor approved 128 tax increases during his 11 years in office.
Both sides accuse the other of distorting the facts, and both appear to have a point.
The Clinton forces correctly charge Mr. Bush with inflating the grand total of tax and fee increases by including some mundane state actions -- like a longer dog-racing season that raised the state's share of gambling revenue.
 
Add Up the Numbers
 The Clinton staff has issued a list that shows 127 tax and fee increases during the Governor's tenure. The Clinton list, compiled by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration, says there have been 34 tax increases and 93 fee increases during Mr. Clinton's 12 years in office. Fees include things like court costs for convicts, medical licenses, driver examinations, drunken-driving fines, birth certificates and water-safety studies.
The Clinton list also shows 73 instances in which taxes have been cut while Mr. Clinton has been Governor.
The Bush camp, for its part, correctly accuses Mr. Clinton of misrepresenting the source of Mr. Bush's data by contending that they were invented. In fact, the figure was drawn from the Democratic-controlled Arkansas Legislature's annual Tax Handbook, which records actions that raise or lower state revenues.
Some aides on both sides say privately that the true number of revenue-raisers is academic because the argument is meant to highlight the candidates' different approaches.
 
Backed Several Increases
 As Governor, Mr. Clinton supported and proposed several tax increases, including sales taxes on food and fuel that hit the poor proportionately harder than the wealthy. And the 1991 Legislature enacted more than 50 tax and fee increases that were expected to add more than $300 million a year to the state's budget, which this year is $1.9 billion.
But most neutral experts view his record as moderate, and the tax burden on the average Arkansan, measured as a share of total income, changed little during his tenure.
Mr. Bush's strategists, while insisting that their numbers on Clinton-engineered tax and fee increases are technically accurate, acknowledge that their aim was to grab attention.
"We firmly believe that increasing taxes costs jobs," Jim Cicconi, a senior issues adviser to the Bush campaign, said in an interview. "I don't care whether you raise them on small business, foreign investment or ordinary people. And he's raising them by the bucketload."
 
The Fundamental Difference?
 Mr. Clinton's advisers also say the broader issue is the economy, but they agree on nothing else. "The real issue here is, is there something systemically wrong with the economy -- something fundamental?" said Robert Shapiro, a Washington economist and senior Clinton adviser. "Bush believes the economy is fundamentally sound, and that all we need to do is make marginal changes like adjusting the capital gains rate for inflation. Our analysis is no -- the economy has fundamental problems, and we need an entirely new strategy."
In simple terms, Mr. Bush contends, as did Ronald Reagan, that lower taxes and less spending will free money for investment, create jobs and produce revenues to rebuild the country and lower the Federal deficit.
Mr. Clinton, not unlike his Democratic predecessors, contends that higher taxes on the wealthy and big business will create money to improve schools, rebuild public works and put in place other building blocks for growth.
If history counts, Mr. Bush's argument should carry the day. In 1988, the Republican label "Taxachusetts" demolished Governor Dukakis's image and helped carry Mr. Bush to his first term. In 1984, Mr. Mondale's candidacy withered after he declared that either he or Ronald Reagan would raise taxes as President, but that only Mr. Mondale had the courage to say so in advance. Part of what washed Mr. Carter out of office in 1980 was a tide of Republican votes against "tax-and-spend" Democrats.
 
Who Is More Likely?
 But the Republican argument, so potent for more than a decade, seems not to be persuading voters to shift their allegiances. A poll by Gallup for Cable News Network and USA Today of 1,001 registered voters in mid-August, before Mr. Bush's convention speech, rated Mr. Clinton by a margin of 43 to 39 percent as "more likely to raise taxes." The same question, asked last week of 1,007 voters, placed the margin at 49 to 36 percent -- a nine percentage point shift. The margin of sampling error in both surveys was three points.
But despite what the Republicans say about him and taxes, Mr. Clinton is still ahead in voter surveys, although his lead has narrowed since the Republican convention.
Almost everyone who follows politics has a theory about why this is happening, but in the end, it comes down to Mr. Bush's performance.
The President not only broke his no-new-taxes pledge, he has not consistently carried out his promise of less government. Since 1989, spending for agriculture, for example, has risen by 12.7 percent after inflation, and spending on interior programs, like parks, has gone up 27.3 percent. Housing and independent agency budgets have jumped 36 percent, and transportation spending by 32.4 percent.
"Bush is a guy who lives in a fiscal glass house and is running around with a slingshot shouting, 'Look at me!' " said Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst. "After the record of this Administration, they can't simply turn around and do the old tax-and-spend thing when the Democrats can simply point to their record."
Other experts cite the state of the economy, which they say has eroded the Republican argument that what America needs is more Reagan-style economics. "The magic of no tax increases and lots of tax cuts, damn the torpedoes, isn't working this time around," said Charles Schultze, once President Carter's economic adviser.
Mr. Clinton's economic adviser, Mr. Shapiro, says he is pleased with how the public has reacted, or not reacted, to Mr. Bush's attacks on Mr. Clinton. "What we're seeing in the tepid response to the Republican attack is that the attack was so overdrawn that it's lost its credibility, and that the Bush Administration itself is not credible on the tax issue. And finally, the President is not credible with respect to what would be required to restore economic growth."

HEADLINE: Cuba Cancels Atom Plant, Blaming Costs and Russians

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Disclosing a major setback to his country's fast-shrinking economy, President Fidel Castro announced late Saturday that work on Cuba's largest industrial project, a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant intended to relieve the island's crushing energy shortage, had been halted indefinitely by rising costs.
Although the 1,600-megawatt Cuban reactor complex was of more modern design than the failed Soviet reactor at Chernobyl, its construction at Juragua, near the southern port city of Cienfuegos, had long been a source of tension between Havana and Washington. Some American experts expressed concern that any accident could threaten Florida. The Cuban Government repeatedly dismissed such concerns. 
 Delivering an annual speech commemorating the start of the Cuban revolution, Mr. Castro instead described the suspended project as a casualty of the demise of the former Soviet bloc.
He bitterly attributed the suspension to Russia's insistence that the plant's skyrocketing costs be paid in hard currency, rather than through the subsidized barter arrangements of the past. Mr. Castro said the Russian terms were "totally impossible."
 
$1.1 Billion Cost Already
 With a tone of distress repeatedly creeping into his voice, he said that although the Juragua plant was 70 percent completed, "we don't have any other alternative but to halt construction." The project, which was begun in 1980, has already cost Cuba $1.1 billion.
Mr. Castro's speech, normally delivered on July 26, was delayed by a rare trip to Europe, where he attended an international conference and the opening of the Olympic Games in Spain.
For many Cubans, the nuclear plant was one of the few bright spots on an increasingly bleak economic horizon. In the last two years, as the withdrawal of aid from the former Soviet bloc has hit the economy, vehicles have all but disappeared from roads for lack of fuel, consumer goods and basic foods have become increasingly scarce and, most recently, electricity has been tightly rationed.
"This is a big blow, no question," said Wayne Smith, a former United States diplomat in Havana who runs the Cuban studies program at Johns Hopkins University. "This would have been a great help to their economy if they could have gotten the reactor going. For the people, it had become a symbol of Cuba's entry into the modern era."
In his speech, monitored in Miami, Mr. Castro described other ways the Cuban economy had been damaged by the end of Communist aid, saying that the island's imports had fallen 70 percent and that key industries like sugar and nickel were hurt by falling prices and reduced investment.
In the lone positive note, he said the country's sugar harvest had totaled seven million tons this year, well below record levels but far more than many had predicted.
Even this good news was blunted, however, by the fact that the harvest had to be extended by two months to compensate for the use of manual labor where machines once worked, and by an end to Soviet subsidies, meaning that the country will earn far less from its crop than in the past.
 
Senior Officials Dismissed
 As Cuba's economy has come increasingly unraveled in recent months, Mr. Castro, vowing to defend Communism to the death, has begun dismissing senior officials, fueling speculation that major rifts in the leadership are emerging between reform-oriented officials and hard-liners.
In June, Mr. Castro dismissed his son, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, as head of the nuclear energy program, citing "inefficiency." That was followed by the removal of Julio A. Garcia Olveras, the head of Cuba's Chamber of Commerce, who had enthusiastically recruited foreign investors for the country's limited program of economic liberalization.
There have also been persistent rumors of a fall from favor by two of Mr. Castro's senior lieutenants -- Carlos Aldana, the Communist Party's chief of ideology, who has dropped out of sight in recent weeks, and Roberto Robaina, leader of Cuba's Union of Young Communists.
"The basic economic assumptions have been so challenged that there is a real question of being able to hold things together politically," said Andrew Zimbalist, an expert on the Cuban economy at Smith College in Massachusetts.
"What you may have in the case of Aldana and with others is people who think the situation has to change more quickly, and Fidel is worried that that kind of change could threaten him."
In his speech, Mr. Castro denied that there were divisions in the leadership, but added: "There are those who become discouraged, who become cowardly. There are those who are traitors, those who desert. This happens in all eras, in all revolutions."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: In Prime Time;
Bush and Clinton Go After Each Other on NBC

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Ark., Sept. 6

 BODY:
In what amounted to a televised kickoff for the fall campaign, President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton used a pair of back-to-back live interviews on NBC to elaborate their core ideological differences, attack each other in relatively genteel terms and defend their records.
To what seemed the clear annoyance of both men, the center section of each interview with Tom Brokaw focused on issues of personal credibility that each man intensely wishes would be gone. 
 For Mr. Clinton, the subject was his conflicting explanations of his behavior in avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War. For Mr. Bush, it was the long-lingering, and recently resurrected, question of whether as Vice President he knew more than he has acknowledged about the Iran-contra affair in 1986.
 
'Just a Late Smokescreen'
 Mr. Bush handled the question about the Iran-contra case fairly smoothly, airily dismissing the notion that he had not told the truth about his activities.
"That's been looked into by millions of dollars' worth of investigations under this Walsh hearing," he said, referring to Lawrence E. Walsh, the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra case. "If I had done anything wrong, Tom, they'd have been all over me like you can possibly imagine. This seems to me to be just a late smokescreen out of that dead old saw out there."
Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, seemed angered by a question by Mr. Brokaw about why he told reporters last week that he knew nothing about a news article in The Los Angeles Times describing efforts by his uncle, Raymond Clinton, in 1968 to secure a slot in the Naval Reserve for him, when, in fact, he had been told in March of his uncle's efforts.
 
New Spending Without Taxes
 "I didn't say that came as a surprise to me last week; it came as a total surprise to me in March," Mr. Clinton began, in a statement that seemed both somewhat confused and at times at variance with the facts. "The press described The Los Angeles Times story to me in a totally different way. They never mentioned this issue."
He added: "The truth is I have told the same story all along. Maybe I have not handled it as well as I should have.
Mr. Clinton was much more self-assured when he told Mr. Brokaw that it would be possible, in a Clinton Administration, to reduce the Federal deficit and start a new array of spending programs without raising taxes.
"That is what I propose to do," he insisted. "That is what I believe will happen." He conceded that he did not know for sure if he was right, but he said: "Do I believe it? You bet I do -- because in my state that's what we have done."
In his interview Mr. Bush sought to soothe the anxiety of Americans over the nation's economic problems.
"I think things are getting better," he said. "And I'll tell you one thing: We are poised for a strong recovery. Interest rates are down. Inflation is down."
The President added: "We have had five consecutive quarters of growth; anemic though they may have been, they've been growing. I'm not prepared to say I think things are going to get dramatically worse at all."
Earlier today the President tossed the first ball at a baseball game in Louisville, Ky., for the benefit of the victims of Hurricane Andrew, attended a Polish-American festival in Chicago and finished his campaign day with the television interview from Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
If Voters Won't Love Bush, He Hopes They Fear Clinton

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
After all the oddities and subplots of the 1992 campaign, from the boomlet for Ross Perot to the challenges of Patrick J. Buchanan and Edmund G. Brown Jr., from the street theater of the New York primary to the morality plays of the Houston convention, the final 57 days will center on a few political basics.
Can President Bush, presiding over a sluggish economy and a nation that two-thirds of Americans say is "off on the wrong track," persuade a majority of the voters that things would be worse under Gov. Bill Clinton? 
 Some experts believe it is already too late for Mr. Bush to do much to change his own image or the perception of the nation's economy under his stewardship; one of the constants of this quirky year has been the voters' disenchantment with the Bush Presidency, with his approval rating in the New York Times/CBS News Poll hovering at 40 percent or less for seven consecutive months.
 
Simple Strategy for Bush
 So while there are a number of nuances to consider, outlined point by point below, the fundamental strategic imperative for Mr. Bush is as starkly simple as it was for Jimmy Carter in 1980: A struggling incumbent in tough times must cast his challenger as an unacceptable alternative.
If the voters cannot learn to love their President, in other words, they must be taught to fear his opponent. Or, as Mr. Bush has begun to put it, "Who do you trust?"
Mr. Clinton enters this final stage of the campaign with what must be, for him, a heady sense that the political winds are finally at his back. He is ahead in the national polls, and the electoral map, at the moment, looks more auspicious for the Democrats than at any time since Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign, which also put the Republicans on the defensive throughout much of the Sun Belt.
But Mr. Clinton could lose these winds in the next two months. He must become more than the repository of anger and discontent with Mr. Bush and 12 years of Republican rule. He must fend off all the doubts about his character and persuade the voters that there are no further surprises in this Governor from Arkansas who has only recently arrived on the national stage. And he must defend his political philosophy and his readiness to be President against the questions that will be stoked by the Bush forces.
It was not so very long ago, after all, that Mr. Clinton's public image was heavily skewed toward the "slick Willie" that his critics portray, the untrustworthy pol always pushing the envelope of truth, whether in explaining his draft history, detailing his record in Arkansas or discussing his experience with marijuana.
This is the struggle of the next 57 days. Here is a guide, with mileposts, omens and numbers to watch.
 
The Debates
 The debates are the great formal events of a general-election campaign, and they take on added importance in a race like this. For a challenger like Mr. Clinton, simply taking the stage with a President confers stature, many analysts believe. For a struggling incumbent like Mr. Bush, the debates offer an opportunity to change the chemistry of the race and force a national audience to reassess and think anew.
The Commission on Presidential Debates has proposed three such sessions, with the first on Sept. 22 in East Lansing, Mich. But the Bush campaign served notice last week that the commission's proposal was unacceptable.
While Republicans are tight-lipped over exactly what they object to, some form of negotiation over debates is expected after Labor Day, with James A. Baker 3d, the new White House chief of staff, expected to play a prominent role.
"I dealt with him in '76 and '80," said Jody Powell, the former press secretary for Mr. Carter. "He's very good, very smooth, a real gentleman. And if you don't watch out, you'll find yourself wanting to work something out just to be gentlemanly about it."
Mr. Clinton, who has already begun his preparation for the debates, will try to use them to raise what aides call his "comfort factor" with the voters, and, obviously enough, to try to look like a President. In 1980, the one debate between Ronald Reagan and Mr. Carter was considered crucial in allaying fears about the former Governor of California, thus hastening the big swing toward Mr. Reagan in the final days.
"The only thing he had to prove to people was that they did not have to be scared if he had his finger on the button," said Eddie Mahe, who was an adviser to the Reagan campaign. "When he proved that, it was over."
For Mr. Bush, the debates are a chance to demonstrate his mastery of foreign policy, his accumulated experience on the national scene, even, perhaps, to highlight his war record. If Republicans have their way, the Governor from Arkansas will take the Presidential stature test before a national audience -- and flunk it.
 
The Map
 By mid-September, both campaigns will have a full round of post-Labor Day polling data and will begin to make some serious decisions on the map: Which states are winnable, which are safe and which should be written off.
At the moment, the all-Southern Democratic ticket is creating an unusually competitive map. Ordinarily, the South is a Republican stronghold in Presidential elections, but Mr. Bush is having to pay close attention to Texas and, particularly after the hurricane, even to Florida.
With 57 of the required 270 electoral votes, those two states are essential to any Republican victory, particularly since California, with a whopping 54 electoral votes, seems to be leaning so heavily to the Democrats.
If the Bush campaign locks up its Southern base over the next few weeks, while the Democrats cement their hold on the Northeast and the West Coast, the race will be fully joined in the big states of the industrial Midwest. While these states are expected to be exceedingly competitive, a Chicago Tribune Poll showed last week that Mr. Clinton currently has a formidable lead in Illinois, 51 percent to 32 percent.
This region is always susceptible to a bread-and-butter appeal: Mr. Clinton will be saying the country cannot afford another four years of Republican economics, while Mr. Bush will assert that the taxpayers are about to fall victim to another taxer-and-spender, and one with with environmental-extremist tendencies at that.
 
The Economy
 In the midst of this contest, in the first week of October, the Federal Government will issue the final unemployment statistics before the election.
These numbers can have an enormous impact on elections, as the Republicans discovered in 1982, when the unemployment rate broke into the double digits in October and they lost 26 seats in the House the next month.
Mr. Bush badly needs to inspire some hope in the voters about their economic future under a second Bush Administration. But the unemployment statistics issued Friday showed how difficult that task could be.
The latest numbers, showing that factory employment had dropped to its lowest level since April 1983, also prompted another round of worries among financial analysts that the economy is not recovering. There will be new statistics almost every week, from housing starts to unemployment claims, that will feed this debate. It will be capped a week before Election Day with the Gross Domestic Product numbers for the third quarter.
As Mr. Baker and his team try to improve the image of the Bush domestic record, they will have to cope with all these numbers.
 
October Surprises
 Every campaign pitting a challenger against an incumbent features feverish speculation about an "October surprise," some foreign policy coup or other development to make the President look larger than life. But as Jody Powell puts it, such "surprises" may be easier to speculate about than to produce.
"It's got to survive the smell test," he says, noting that policy moves are heavily scrutinized for political motivations.
What is clear, however, is that October is the month when campaigns go for broke. It is so close to the election that gaffes, scandals or damaging disclosures can be hard to recover from.
Candidates who have burst into the national consciousness quickly, like Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton, are particularly vulnerable to last-minute controversies prompting last-minute doubts.
Mr. Clinton, in the New Hampshire primary, showed his ability to survive such a test, and while there is no current sign of another shoe dropping, there is much residual nervousness about it in political circles.
Moreover, if this campaign is like any other, Mr. Clinton will almost certainly face some kind of unpredictable crisis or test, whether it be a verbal gaffe or an associate's blunder, that will force voters to take his measure once again.
"In some respects, that could be the biggest event in the whole fall campaign," argues Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker, "because if he passes it, he's very likely to be President."
Republicans disagree with that optimistic assessment of Mr. Clinton's chances, but top strategists in the Bush campaign have believed all along that this election will, in the final days, come down to trust and leadership traits.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Clinton has recently tried to challenge the trustworthiness of the Republicans, largely over their economic promises.
 
The Numbers to Watch
 This year has been notable for wild swings in the polls, and the surveys of the past few weeks suggest that the trend is continuing. Still, there are a few numbers to watch that may be more telling than the shifting ranking in the trial heat.
One of the most important is Mr. Clinton's personal-image rating. Just three months ago, after the ferocious primary season, just 16 percent of the registered voters viewed Mr. Clinton favorably, while 40 percent viewed him unfavorably, The New York Times/CBS News Poll found. The most recent Times/CBS Poll showed a 36 percent favorable rating, to 28 percent unfavorable.
"Bush can't win without that number moving," said Mr. Mahe, the veteran Republican strategist. "If the Clinton unfavorable doesn't move, then the result in the final analysis can't be a great deal different than it is now."
Republicans take heart from the British Conservatives' against-all-predictions victory in the final days of the elections last spring. Democrats remember how Ronald Reagan finally allayed the doubts in 1980.
"The only thing that would surprise me in this race is if I wasn't surprised," said James Carville, a top strategist for Mr. Clinton. "If I'm talking to you the day before the election and I say, 'Well, things pretty much played out the way I expected,' that would surprise me."

HEADLINE: Stocks Higher in Tokyo

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Japanese stocks were higher today. At about an hour before the close of trading, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up about 140 points. Brokers said buying was supported by the belief that Japan's central bank would cut its discount rate. A lowering of the key lending rate was made more possible by the Federal Reserve's move in the United States last week to reduce the Federal funds rate, they said. On Friday, the Nikkei gained 168.81 points, to 18,555.30.

HEADLINE: With G.O.P. Faltering, Senator Is on His Own

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 6

 BODY:
John Seymour faces two unanticipated obstacles in seeking election to the United States Senate seat that Gov. Pete Wilson appointed him to 19 months ago: The collapse of the Republican Presidential campaign in California and the plunge in popularity of his mentor the Governor.
Mr. Seymour insists that coattails mean nothing in this quirky state of ticket-splitters and that Mr. Wilson's nose-dive is temporary and of no consequence. But this relentless good cheer is drowned out by a chorus of prophets who say that a bland former State Senator plucked from obscurity needs all the high-powered help he can get. 
 "It looked like Seymour would be taken in hand and led to victory by Wilson and Bush," said Mervin Field, director of the statewide Field Poll, which recently found President Bush trailing Bill Clinton by a staggering 34 points here, Mr. Wilson with the lowest approval ratings of any Governor in the state's history and Mr. Seymour an 18-point underdog in his Senate race against Dianne Feinstein. "Now that Wilson and Bush don't have any credibility, it looks like Seymour's got to be on his own."
While Mr. Seymour says that "neither George Bush nor Pete Wilson will have a tremendous impact one way or another on my campaign," he seems to be trying to separate himself from both. That is an awkward task, which has left Mr. Seymour looking bold one minute and browbeaten the next.
A case in point was the Republican convention, where the party platform included a vehement anti-abortion plank. This was an opportunity for Mr. Seymour, a 1990 convert to abortion rights, to distinguish himself from the party hierarchy, reassure Republican women considering defection to Ms. Feinstein and pick up news media attention.
The results were mixed.
Mr. Seymour's crusade for a floor fight fizzled after the Governor, who generally favors abortion rights, begged the delegation to stand united with the President. And Mr. Seymour's losing battle antangonized many right wing Republicans, who are now threatening to stay home on Election Day.
The Senator's hand was slapped for his convention speech, in which he said that he was "not entirely happy" with the platform. The speech was delivered in a nearly empty hall, because Mr. Seymour was assigned an unfavorable morning time slot. And the party chairman blue-penciled another part of his speech, eliminating a reference to Barbara Bush, rather than her husband, as the conscience of the party.
 
'They Swatted Him Away'
 "They swatted him away like a little fly, they edited his copy and he had a nowhere role in the convention," said Kam Kuwata, campaign manager for Ms. Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco who narrowly lost the 1990 race for governor.
But Mr. Seymour found rewards as well as punishments at the convention. The Senator, who had earlier but without notice challenged the President on his slow response to the sagging economy, had his first real moment in the sun, appearing on the "Today" show and the "MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour." And Mr. Seymour won the thanks of many Republican women.
Mr. Seymour's record as a Senator includes at least two votes involving issues that Ms. Feinstein promises to exploit: a "yes" vote on the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court and a "no" vote on a family-leave bill.
In his Senate tenure, Mr. Seymour says, his proudest moment was his authorship of a bill, now in conference committee, that would protect the interests of agriculture while modifying the way water is allocated here. His bill won Senate approval over a competing one by Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, which was less favorable to farmers but preferred by environmentalists. In this situation, as in his pleas for revision of the Endangered Species Act, Mr. Seymour argues that wildlife cannot be protected at the expense of jobs in these recessionry times.
The fortunes of the President and the party could affect Mr. Seymour in more subtle ways than the coattail effect, which was weak here even during the Reagan landslides.
Marty Wilson, the state chairman of the Bush-Quayle campaign, said all Republican candidates could suffer in a state staggered by the recession because "people seem to believe at the moment that the Democrats are better able to handle the economy."
And Republican candidates also suffer the effects of the recession in fund raising, Mr. Wilson and others said, because the party's most dependable contributors here -- aerospace, real estate savings-and-loan interests -- have been hardest hit.
Mr. Wilson added that national party's focus on family values could hurt candidates here, as well, because this is a "very tolerant" state where "people may hold their noses and turn off" to that kind of rhetoric.
The Governor's problems have another set of side effects for Mr. Seymour, who hoped to model his campaign on the 1990 race for governor, when issues of special interest to women did not dominate.
 
The Governor Is Busy
 Pete Wilson was to have been at the forefront of Mr. Seymour's fund-raising effort, helping fill the war chest necessary to buy television time. But money has been scarce, which some political experts blame on the Governor's preoccupation with a two-month budget standoff that ended last week, a ballot initiative that he wrote to revise the welfare system and other anxieties.
"To say Pete Wilson's plate is full is an understatement," said one prominent state Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He's got the Seymour race, the initiative, the budget. He's chairman of the Bush campaign, which is a shambles. He's worried about his own political rehabilitation. You have to ask yourself, how much time does he have to help?"
Despite the gloomy forecasts, the 54-year-old Mr. Seymour is a plucky campaigner, always 15 minutes early at campaign stops and eager to jump out of the car. He looks like a lounge singer and has the same improbable optimism that the main stage is just one perfect song away.
At a group home for delinquent boys in San Diego last week, he wielded a broken microphone with the verve of Phil Donahue and told every boy that it was "neat" or "super" to hear of his success. At a speech before hundreds of Agriculture Department employees, he told jokes about his short stature and his former job as mayor of Disneyland, formally known as Anaheim.
And at a buffet luncheon in Newport Beach for his Orange County volunteers, he led the others in the Pledge of Allegiance, answered all questions with an impressive array of facts, shook the hand of every man, kissed the cheek of every woman and remembered what precinct each ran.
If only sheer energy could win the race, Ms. Seymour seems to be saying, he soon would be California's senior Senator. Just look at how he's spent his freshman year in the Senate: racking up a 96 percent attendance record for votes and also spending 208 days on the stump in California.
"He's trying valiantly," said Mr. Field. "But he's cast adrift without much of a record at a time when the tide is running against him. He's like someone taken on an ocean liner by his parents or some protector. Then the ship sinks, he's in the lifeboat alone and he's wondering, 'Where did everybody else go?' "

The Economy
New economic reports demonstrate starkly how Americans' incomes have stalled, painting a picture of workers struggling to crawl up a down escalator. Together they give the Democrats fresh ammunition for what they hope will be a potent weapon in the election campaign. "Stagnation in wages is at the heart of this election," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. [Page 1.] 
 In cutting a key interest rate, the Federal Reserve is walking a tightrope, trying to nudge the economy forward without pushing the dollar off a cliff. The dollar has slipped to record lows against the German mark in recent weeks, principally because short-term interest rates are so much lower in the U.S. [37.]
Corporate charity has not dried up, but executives squeezed by tough economic times, global competition, and sometimes hostility from City Hall are more likely to be minding their own business than providing civic leadership. [1.]
Cool weather meant a dismal summer for the air-conditioning industry. Despite a late-August week of brow-wiping heat and humidity, most of the summer in the Northeast and Midwest -- which constitute 60 percent of the air-conditioner market -- has had mild temperatures. [38.]
While President Bush has promised that the Government will pay for rebuilding South Florida and Louisiana, the Government is fighting requests for millions of dollars for repairs in communities struck three years ago by natural disasters. [7.]
 
International
The founder of the GPA Group, Tony Ryan, will take over the chief executive's post at the world's largest aircraft leasing company, which is based in Ireland. [37.]
The European Fighter Aircraft, an ambitious attempt by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain to set aside national rivalries and cooperate in the development of an advanced warplane, has run into snags. And at the Farnsborough air show in England, American, French, Swedish and Russian aircraft makers were only too glad to try to pick up the slack. [37.]
Soaring prices on Shanghai's stock exchange reflect the growing enthusiasm, bordering on desperation, of ordinary Chinese to become shareholders -- preferably rich ones. After six years of on-and-off experimentation with shares, China is accelerating the development of a modern stock market. [37.]
President Fidel Castro said work on a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant had been halted indefinitely in Cuba. The plant had long been a source of tension between Havana and the U.S. [5.]
 
Companies
As auto workers prepared for Labor Day at General Motors' Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., they were brooding over what had happened to their vision of the future. G.M. is closing the plant next year. For thousands of people, black and white, from Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas, the plant was a ticket out of the coal mines and away from dead-end jobs sweeping floors. "G.M. was security," said Linda Robbins, whose husband worked at Willow Run for 23 years. "How could this happen? Why didn't anyone stop it?" [1.]
It is hard to see what the U.A.W. gained through the nine-day walkout at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant that idled more than 40,000 workers nationwide. When the auto workers struck, they said their goal was to force the company to keep open a tool-and-die shop that provides 240 jobs and that G.M. wanted to close. Under the agreement overwhelmingly ratified Saturday, G.M. agreed to keep the shop open only for a few additional months. News Analysis. [37.]
 
The Media Business
 Nielsen remains the only game in national TV ratings, even though the networks and advertisers are generally unhappy with the service. Bill Carter: Television. [41.]
There may yet be life after death for Punch magazine, the British institution that shut in April [41.]
Black Dome Press has succeeded by specializing in books about the Catskill Mountains and the Hudson River. [41.]
A new magazine, Seesaw, is seeking to bridge the cultural gap between the U.S. and Japan by focusing on children. [41.]

HEADLINE: AFTER THE STORM;
Life on Fringes of Ruin Makes Cautious Comeback

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Well north of the worst hurricane damage to Dade County, Shawna Drew, a beautician, sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic on Interstate 95 for 90 minutes, six times as long as her usual commute. Tears streamed down her face, as rain fell in sheets around her car.
"At first, after the hurricane it was like, 'I'm alive, I'm alive, Heaven be praised,' " Ms. Drew said Thursday. "Now it's like, 'I'm alive and I have a home, but I'm stressed and I'm sad and it seems real trivial to paint ladies' fingernails for a living.' " 
 In Miami, Miami Beach and the other heavily populated areas of northern Dade County that escaped the brunt of the storm, life gradually began returning to normal -- a very somber normal -- last week. But Hurricane Andrew has wrought dramatic changes in the landscape and psyche of the place, and hardly anyone is untouched.
"Everyone knows in their bones that this is a defining moment for Miami, as was the hurricane of 1926," said Arva Moore Parks, a local historian and author.
Nearly everyone in northern Dade County regained electricity last week, relishing their first hot showers since the hurricane struck early on Aug. 24. Television stations dropped their 24-hour emergency programming. Businesses, most notably gas stations and supermarkets, reopened.
On Wednesday the National Guard left Coconut Grove, and the 11 P..M. curfew was lifted in Miami Beach. On Thursday bus service resumed, and the county rescinded its order to boil water. And on Friday the county manager, Joaquin Avino, donned a suit and tie -- a sign, he said, that the county was back in business.
But many said it was hard to find a tasteful way to move on with life while neighbors about 40 miles south were still struggling to find food and shelter.
"There is a real feeling of guilt -- and compassion -- among those who did not suffer serious damage," said Ruth Shack, president of the Dade Community Foundation. "The mood is very restrained."
At the trendy News Cafe on Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, Su Rudy, an actress, halfheartedly ate a piece of chocolate cake on Wednesday, her first night back out on the town. "We're sort of walking around in a fog, like why were we spared?" she said. "All the damage we have at my condo is fish in our swimming pool."
Even far north of the military encampment in South Dade, where 24,000 troops were stationed amid the rubble, it was impossible to forget. Navy PT boats docked next to glittery cruise ships at the Port of Miami, and Army helicopters buzzed overhead.
 
Volunteers Directing Traffic
 Further, half of the county's traffic signals were out, and 5,000 out of 23,000 traffic lights were not just dead but blown away. At some intersections, volunteers, including a 73-year-old woman and 14 county attorneys, were directing traffic. At others, extremes of courtesy or aggression prevailed, depending on the drivers.
Most trees and shrubs have vanished, denuding a once-lush environment and, in particular, the parks that were a point of local pride. On Labor Day, instead of picnicking in those parks, hundreds of families planned to head south to volunteer their help.
Many Miamians said they considered it unseemly to enjoy a glass of wine or a night at the movies, believing that any indulgence in normal pleasures to be an insult to the enormousness of the moment.
Writing under a headline that read, "Do Touchdowns Really Matter Now?" Edwin Pope, sports editor of The Miami Herald, even dared to question the importance of sports here.
"So many people who thought their whole lives were wrapped around the Dolphins and the University of Miami Hurricanes -- irony of ironies, hurricanes as heroes! -- have learned that sports represent neither wall nor roof," he wrote in a column that would have been heretical before Aug. 24.
Still, even in the immediate wake of the storm, there were those who considered restraint unnecessary.
Four days after the hurricane, at Wolfie's, the seemingly indestructible delicatessen-restaurant on Miami Beach, Gerald Schwartz, a publicist, had a political breakfast for five judges up for re-election.
"Would you believe, in the middle of all this, every top condominium leader in the Beach I got out here?" Mr. Schwartz said proudly.
Judge Jack Coe of Dade County Circuit Court wriggled uncomfortably at his side. "It can't be politics as usual," he said. "Frankly, I'm embarrassed to even be campaigning."
That same day, a sign of how some relationships were indeed changing after the storm, The Herald collapsed the distance between journalist and subject. Its front-page banner headline, directed at the Federal Government, read, "WE NEED HELP."
 
A Very Personal Story
 "This story is more personal for every one of us, and every one of our readers, than any I've experienced in my career as a journalist," said David Lawrence, the paper's publisher.
Among The Herald's 2,600 employees, 70 lost their homes, and many more suffered damage. As the newspaper ran a relief program for its own workers, its editors and reporters put out a special hurricane section for 10 days, which included a bulletin board containing scores of poignant inquiries about missing persons.
All employers in the county were caught in a double role, that of tending to their own while also servicing their customers.
Carnival Cruise Lines was forced to cancel one cruise after the storm. But the loss proved beneficial for Carnival's homeless employees, who moved their families onto the ocean liner Fantasy for almost a week.
While most major employers have issued paychecks to employees who could not show up for work, smaller businesses and not-for-profit companies could not afford to do so.
 
Hot Weather and Frayed Nerves
 In Coral Gables, Books & Books, an independent bookstore, reopened, without electricity, four days after the storm. Its few customers bought children's books, because their children were climbing the walls without television, and photographic books about Miami, mementos of the way things were.
Farther south, at the Everglades Alligator Farm, Charles Thibos prayed that his 100 breeder alligators would survive without their weekly feeding of five chickens each. Meanwhile, more than 100 newly hatched alligators swam in his bathtub.
With temperatures in the 90's every day, tensions ran high throughout the county. The immediate adrenaline rush that followed the hurricane had given way to frayed nerves and a depressing realization of how much effort it would take to rebuild.
Judge Cindy Lederman of Dade County said domestic violence, particularly cases involving weapons, had surged since the hurricane. She and a colleague have issued twice as many temporary restraining orders against husbands and boyfriends in the last week, about 20 a day.
"And those were just for those who were able to make it to the courthouse," Judge Lederman said.
One sign that things were returning to normal could be found in Miami Beach, where young people on in-line skates were hawking the inevitable "I Survived Andrew" T-shirts. Meanwhile, TWN, the gay weekly newspaper, featured "Himicane" Andrew on its cover.
Jodi Kurry, a 22-year-old saleswoman at Victoria's Secret in Coconut Grove, where few women were buying lingerie last week, frowned at such levity. "I think we have to get back to normal life with a good deal of sensitivity, because it will never be back to normal down south," she said.
Ms. Kurry, a University of Miami graduate student, had never been to Homestead until she went there as a volunteer worker last week. For many in Dade County, until last month's storm Homestead and Florida City were little more than towns they passed through on the way to the Keys.
 
Parallels With 1926 Storm
 The hurricane blitzed the poorer residents of the county and spared most of the big condominiums, hotels and banks at the county's center. As a result, recovery for the county as a whole should be easier than it was in 1926, said Ms. Parks, the historian.
She said there were many parallels between the aftermath of the 1926 hurricane, the last real big one to hit Dade County, and the weeks after Hurricane Andrew. In 1926 the hurricane was followed by looting; food was donated quickly but distributed slowly, and martial law was established. But the 1926 hurricane wiped out Miami and Miami Beach, not Homestead and Florida City.
Some of the many fashion photographers at South Miami Beach were back behind their cameras last week. They cleared the debris from a patch of the beach and used long lenses that blurred the fallen trees in the background.
One fashion model suggested that the hurricane would make Dade County an even more desirable location, because the lunar landscape and thousands of soldiers in Homestead would provide a dramatic setting.
But Barbara Cominsky, vice president of the Michele Pommier Modeling Agency, discounted that idea. "No one has asked for that, and I hope no one does," she said.
The hurricane has provided a temporary economic lift for northern Dade County. Hotels, usually all but vacant in September, are filled with electrical workers, insurance adjusters and displaced families.
Miami Beach is welcoming back tourists, although Key Biscayne's oceanfront hotels and state park are still closed.
For Dade County residents, it was a peculiar week, and not only because of the devastation.
Smoke curled into the air from fallen trees being burned in 34 open pits.
Some 200 monkeys, on the loose from a research institute, were shot and killed by people who feared that the animals might be carrying AIDS.
While dead horses rotted in south Dade County canals, some northern residents complained that their cable television service was not being restored quickly enough.
But, with good will not always characteristic of this area, about 400 volunteers rode 10 county buses to South Dade on Saturday to rake up the debris.
The hurricane has unexpectedly made Dade County, a splintered community of diverse and often warring groups, feel almost united.
"We have survived riots, refugees, scandals and bankuptcies, but with each survival we have given away a quality of life,' said Ms. Shack, the head of the community foundation. "Maybe, now that we're cooperating, we have the chance to rebuild what was ticky-tacky and actually make it better."
