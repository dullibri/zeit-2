THE AMERICAS
 
COLOMBIA: INDIAN TRIBE ASKS ASYLUM -- All 2,500 members of an Indian tribe have asked for political asylum in Spain, saying their community faces extermination at the hands of leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads. The homeland of the Embera-Katio people in Cordoba Province has become a battleground for the groups. Larry Rohter (NYT) 

ECUADOR: WORLD BANK LOAN -- Barely a month after strikes and protests threatened to topple his Government, President Jamil Mahuad has obtained preliminary approval from the World Bank and other international lending agencies for a $900 million economic rescue package. The agreement is intended to lift Ecuador from its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
MEXICO: U.S. LIFTS TUNA BAN -- Over the objections of American environmentalists, the U.S. has lifted an embargo on Mexican canned tuna and authorized its sale carrying the label "dolphin safe." The U.S. imposed the embargo in 1987, saying dolphins were trapped in the large nets used by many Mexican fishermen. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
MEXICO: ELECTORAL REFORM BILL -- Opposition legislators in the lower house of Congress struck a blow to the governing party, known as the PRI, by approving a sweeping electoral reform law. The bill imposes new controls on government use of the news media during campaigns, permits the nine million Mexicans living abroad to vote, increases penalties for vote buying and election fraud and allows for party coalitions. The reform seems unlikely to pass the PRI-controlled Senate, however. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
ITALY: ANDREOTTI FACES LIFE TERM -- A public prosecutor in Perugia asked that former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti be given a life sentence if convicted on charges he conspired in the 1982 murder of a journalist. Mr. Andreotti, 80, is also awaiting a verdict in Palermo, where he is on trial on separate charges that he was the Mafia's main protector in Rome. (NYT)
 
SPAIN: NEW PINOCHET CHARGES -- Judge Baltasar Garzon broadened the indictment against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, adding 12 charges of torture against the former Chilean dictator, making a total of 72 from the period beginning in 1988. The move came as General Pinochet's lawyers said they would appeal Britain's decision giving the go-ahead to extradition proceedings that could force him to stand trial in Spain. Al Goodman (NYT)
 
GREECE: MODERNIZING ITS FORCES -- Greece awarded Lockheed Martin a $2 billion contract for more than 50 F-16 jet fighters as part of a program to modernize its armed forces. Prime Minister Costas Simitis also announced that Dassault Aviation of France would be given a contract for 15 Mirage 2000-5's and an order to upgrade 10 others in Greece's fleet of about 60. (AP)
 
LITHUANIA: PREMIER STEPS DOWN -- Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius resigned, saying in a television address that his disagreements with President Valdas Adamkus were weakening the country. The two have been locked in a struggle over economic policy and have traded accusations of corruption. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ASIA
 
INDIA: PREMIER READY TO RUN -- Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, head of the coalition government that lost a confidence vote, said he would lead that same coalition into elections as its prime ministerial candidate. He also said in an interview with the magazine India Today that "it might be highly improper" for his caretaker government to sign the nuclear test ban treaty by the September deadline if the election is delayed until then. The date for new elections is not expected to be set until next week. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
CAMBODIA: NEW ASEAN MEMBER -- The 32-year-old Association of Southeast Asian Nations achieved its dream of including all 10 countries in the region. At a ceremony in Hanoi, the association inducted the final member, Cambodia, after a two-year delay following a coup in that country. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: SHORTCUT TO PRISON -- An Israeli officer has been sentenced to 14 days in jail for mistakenly driving into a Palestinian self-rule area in an incident in which the Palestinian police opened fire and wounded an Israeli soldier, military officials said. The officer, a lieutenant in the paratroopers, was trying to take a shortcut to an Israeli Army base, the officials added. (Agence France-Presse)
 
IRAN: KHATAMI PLANS ARAB TOUR -- President Mohammad Khatami will visit Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar from May 10 to 20, signaling a marked improvement in ties between Iran and its Arab neighbors. Relations with the Arab world deteriorated after the Islamic revolution in 1979 and during the eight-year war with Iraq. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
LESOTHO: SOUTH AFRICA PULLING OUT -- South Africa started withdrawing its troops from Lesotho, but South Africa and Botswana said they would set up a joint rapid reaction force that could deal with any further disturbances there. The two nations sent troops to Lesotho last September in an effort to restore order after months of political unrest. Donald G. McNeil Jr. (NYT)
 
RWANDA: EX-MAYOR GETS LIFE -- A military court in Switzerland sentenced a former Rwandan mayor to life in prison after finding him guilty of crimes committed during the 1994 genocide, including murder, attempted murder, incitement to murder and war crimes. The case against Fulgence Niyonteze, 35, was the first time a Rwandan suspected of war crimes had gone before a national court. Mr. Niyonteze was tried in Switzerland because he sought asylum there in 1994. (AP)

HEADLINE: Nafta vs. Mexico's Trees

 BODY:

To the Editor: 
 Re "All Across Mexico, a Chainsaw Massacre of Trees" (news article, April 28): When Mexico signed the North American Free Trade Agreement five years ago, it opened its forestry sector to increased trade and investment. At least a dozen United States logging companies went south, drawn by new access to vast forest reserves, few regulatory costs and a booming demand for wood-fiber packing by Mexico's export-driven manufacturing industry. Unable to compete against the flood of cheap American grain imports, Mexico's small farmers now cut trees to survive. These corporations now want to extend Nafta's forest-friendly rules to the rest of the globe through the World Trade Organization.

HEADLINE: Risk Takers' Safety Net

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
About two years ago, Matt Hazard and three of his buddies got together to form a new, hard-rock band in Minneapolis. At a loss for what to call themselves, they settled on Moral Hazard.
"The guitarist wanted to get my last name in the band because we thought it sounded cool, but every combination seemed kind of lame," recalls the 19-year-old Mr. Hazard. "But we were all in the same high school economics class, and one day our teacher began writing that term on the board and we said, 'That's it.' " 
 He adds, "It seems like a relevant term to society."
Indeed. Rarely do dreary economic abstractions become fodder for mainstream media accounts or occasional cocktail party chatter as the concept of moral hazard has.
Simply put, moral hazard describes any situation, though usually a financial one, in which risky behavior is encouraged because risk takers believe they will be bailed out of mistakes by a third party.
Think Asia and Russia here. The international financial crisis that erupted in Thailand and began tearing across the globe nearly two years ago left the policy wonks who had to deal with its consequences in a philosophic bind.
Many lenders and investors had plowed money into rapidly growing countries like Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea in the belief that governments there would always prop up certain key companies. But many of the corporations were so larded with bad debt that the governments couldn't keep them afloat forever. In Russia, feverish financial speculation was fueled in part by the belief that the Russian Government wouldn't default on its bonds and by the perception that Russia, with all its nuclear warheads, was too big for anyone to let it fail.
Investors badly misjudged the situation in all those countries, lost money when economic meltdowns occurred, then stampeded for the exits. That put all the countries in a squeeze. After all, it's hard to keep food stocked in stores and an economy moving ahead when nobody will lend you more money. So the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury Department both advocated lending fresh funds to these nations to get them over the hump and back onto the happy track of prosperity.
"No, no, no!" shouted critics of that idea. They said that if the I.M.F. and the Treasury Department gave more money to the countries, both the countries and speculators would feel safe to invest recklessly in the future because they knew they would be bailed out. Classic moral hazard.
"When individual behavior is random and the downside is bid up by implicit guarantees of being bailed out, you encourage risky behavior," observes William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. Asia and Russia, of course, aren't the only arenas in which moral hazard has reared its ugly head.
Other well-known cases of moral hazard at work include the savings and loan debacle in the United States a decade ago, in which owners of old-fashioned mortgage banks felt safe taking fliers on dangerous real estate forays because the banks' deposits were insured by the Federal Government. The Government-led rescue of the once high-flying hedge fund Long Term Capital might also be morally hazardous if it encourages free-wheeling speculation disconnected from the threat of financial ruin.
Although no public money was used to keep the fund afloat, critics said the Federal Reserve's orchestration of the rescue sent a signal that some funds, no matter how much gambling they indulged in, were too important to fail.
Insurance underwriters and their customers regularly engage in morally hazardous transactions. Health insurers constantly weigh what medical treatments they will cover, trying to decide whether coverage will induce patients to pursue elaborate and expensive treatments that they don't necessarily need. The flip side of this is, of course, insurers or H.M.O.'s that become so tightfisted and risk averse that patients can't get treatments they surely need. Home ownership can also be a morally hazardous proposition. People who might otherwise avoid building homes in Malibu because of the risk of fire and mudslides or in hurricane-ravaged parts of the East Coast might do so anyway because their home insurer picks up the tab if their house is destroyed.
Morally hazardous situations may also crop up outside the narrow confines of the financial world. Take major league baseball, for instance. The American League, unlike the National League, has long had a designated hitter rule that allows a team to substitute a better batter each time their pitcher would normally step up to the plate. And where is the moral hazard in that? It turns out that American League pitchers tend to throw more bean balls at batters than do their counterparts in the National League because, some studies say, such risky -- even nasty -- behavior can't be punished. The designated hitter rule keeps the bean baller safely away from the plate, where an opposing hurler could otherwise launch fastballs at his head in retribution.
Spotting morally hazardous situations may be easy in retrospect, after the risk has surfaced, but it can be much harder to discern moral hazard -- or act on it -- in a crisis.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, as canny an observer of financial markets as anyone in Washington, was attuned to the ambiguities of moral hazard when he defended the effort to pump fresh funds into South Korea in 1997 as that country edged toward economic collapse. "Look, I wouldn't spend a nickel to bail out investors or creditors," he said at the time. "The purpose of this is not to help creditors; the purpose is to help Korea." But he conceded that saving the country also meant saving investors who had placed errant bets there.
Others agree that sidestepping moral hazard can't be the sole goal. They say a more nuanced balancing act must be struck between not encouraging risky behavior and forestalling an economic crisis before it spins further out of control.
"Sometimes people just say, 'Oh, there's a moral hazard here,' and rule out a whole range of actions that might be taken," says Barry Bosworth, a senior economics fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "I'm not saying we just disregard moral hazard and charge ahead, but it is often the case in financial crises that those who triggered the crisis don't pay at all; average citizens do."
One way to avoid moral hazard is to establish better frameworks for anticipating and reducing risks in a world where different countries hew to wildly different ethical and financial standards. Along these lines, Gordon Brown, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, has called for improved financial disclosure, better oversight and stronger ties between the public and private sectors to stave off financial disasters in various parts of the globe.
Big central banks, if they're honestly run and efficiently operated, can also be useful lenders of last resort when a crisis looms. Mr. Bosworth points out that the United States banking system operated for about 100 years without a central bank to act as a lender of last resort during financial crises. So before the creation of the Federal Reserve earlier this century, the country frequently lurched from financial crisis to financial crisis, a pattern that has largely disappeared here since the Depression.
For his part, Mr. Niskanen at the Cato Institute doesn't rule out lending during a crisis if all somebody needs are a few bucks to get them over the hump.
But if larger problems like corruption, cronyism or wasteful economic policies exist when a bailout is being considered, he is inclined to emphasize the downsides of bailing out shortsighted risktakers and creating moral hazard.
"I think we should respond in a crisis based on rules established before the crisis occurs and not based on rules negotiated during a crisis," he says.
But others demur from this point of view, noting that pulling the plug on a borrower -- even if it is the right thing to do in terms of avoiding moral hazard -- can often make a bad financial situation even worse.
"This is a game about getting the right balance between systemic risk and allowing markets to function," said Morris Goldstein, a former International Monetary Fund official and a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "I lean more to the case by case approach than to the idea of laying out rules in advance. It's very difficult to lay out an either-or rule because systemic risk can sometimes be overwhelming."
There are some rock bands who share Mr. Goldstein's philosophy and extol the virtues of benevolence if the threat of moral hazard arises, especially when rules are not clear or maybe don't even exist, as in the notoriously fickle and unfettered music business.
"When we researched it on the Internet, moral hazard seemed to be people whining about the U.S. helping out other countries," says Mr. Hazard. "But in the music industry you just can't make it on your own, and you always need someone to bail you out if you're going to make it. So that side of moral hazard has a lot of meaning for me."

HEADLINE: Challenging Everyone's Conceptions About Blacks

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
At times Orlando Patterson seems to be mouthing the arguments of racial neoconservatives. An African-American who teaches sociology at Harvard University, Mr. Patterson asserts that problems in many black neighborhoods stem less from white racism than from the breakdown of the black family and the behavior of black men who impregnate too many black women and marry too few.
In other moments, he sounds like a traditional liberal, insisting slavery and the Southern sharecropping system are to blame for such irresponsible behavior by breaking down the family structure. 
 Then again, his proposed solution -- that more black women should marry outside their race -- might take those on the left and right by surprise.
"Once they make that important decision to explore the broader marriage market, it may well put more pressure on Afro-American men to shape up," he said in a recent interview. "But the situation right now is that they've restricted their market to the men who have no incentive to change."
Such iconoclastic views have helped turn Mr. Patterson, 59, into one of the most provocative thinkers on the status of blacks today. Conservatives criticize him by saying he focuses too much on the debilitating effects of slavery and not enough on the impact of the welfare state. Black feminists chastise him for challenging the notion that black women suffer from double discrimination because of their race and sex. (He says they are getting more education and higher incomes than black men.)
Meanwhile, some blacks take him to task for publicly airing "dirty linen." Kenneth S. Tollett, a professor of sociology at Howard University, said: "I don't think he appreciates the consequences of his analysis. He is apparently blaming black males as the major source of difficulties in the black community. That's just fodder for racists and people who want to denigrate the black community."
Yet agitating people may be the point. "It's a cultivated style of his," said Glenn C. Loury, a professor of economics at Boston University and a friend of Mr. Patterson. "He means to be iconoclastic. He means to go against the grain. He takes relish in it."
Mr. Patterson has been challenging conventional ideas about race for years. He has written five weighty sociological treatises, including "The Ordeal of Integration" (Civitas/Counterpoint, 1997) and "Freedom in the Making of Western Civilization" (Basic Books, 1991), both of which won the National Book Award. He has also penned three works of fiction, including "The Children of Sisyphus," published in 1964 when Mr. Patterson was 23 years old. It was one of the first accounts detailing the life style and philosophy of Jamaica's Rastafarian cult.
"I was writing about the Rastas long before they became fashionable," he said in the lilting accent of his native Jamaica as he leaned back on a leather sofa in his fifth-floor office. Mr. Patterson's skin is deep bronze; his hairline is receding. A wispy goatee clings to his chin.
Now it is his latest book, "Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two American Centuries" (Civitas/Counterpoint), that is causing a stir by weighing in on the long-running debate over how much damage slavery did to the black family.
During the antebellum period, abolitionists emphasized the havoc slavery played on black family life. After the war, Southerners who dominated American history for decades flipped that argument upside down, calling slavery a stabilizing force on blacks whose family life deteriorated after emancipation.
Earlier in this century, sociologists like W. E. B. Du Bois and E. Franklin Frazier placed the spotlight once again on the debilitating aftereffects of slavery. As a young official in the Johnson Administration, Daniel Patrick Moynihan was influenced by their work as he grappled with the persistently high level of out-of-wedlock births among blacks.
In the 1970's, Mr. Moynihan's argument was countered by Herbert G. Gutman, a professor at City University of New York. In his classic book, "The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom," he tried to show the resilience of the black family and how through all of slavery's depredations, the family emerged relatively intact. Mr. Gutman's work was seized upon by many black intellectuals who were both troubled by Mr. Moynihan's depiction of black antisocial behavior and the implicit message of Mr. Gutman's work: If black families survived the ravages of slavery, then whatever problems that plague them today are the result of contemporary racism.
To Mr. Patterson, however, Mr. Gutman's theory is romantic nonsense.
"Look, how can you have 270 years of history in which the family was not recognized, women could be raped, beaten, stripped naked in the fields before their so-called husbands; where men were emasculated deliberately in the sense of having no authority, no say over their children, even though they are encouraged to reproduce; how can you have 270 years of that and claim that people came out with intact families with a two-parents, suburban-type family?" he asked. "It's just absurd on the face of it."
He scoffs at critics who say his forthright critique of black men and families hurts African-Americans. And he is impatient with the reluctance to discuss sexual relations between black men and women.
Mr. Patterson started writing about gender relations among African-Americans in 1991, when Anita Hill leveled her explosive charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas after he was nominated for the Supreme Court. In an Op-Ed article for The New York Times, he dismissed the charges and Mr. Thomas's alleged "Rabelaisian humor" with Ms. Hill as merely examples of a "down-home style of courting."
Mr. Patterson was hissed at when he repeated his theory at a conference at Georgetown University a year later. After the experience, Mr. Patterson began to throw himself into the issue of why the relations between black men and black women were in such a sorry state.
His interest in the subject has a personal dimension as well, however.
His father was a police detective whose efforts to unionize police officers caused him to run afoul of the British colonial authorities in rural Jamaica, turning him into a bitter man who drank too much and abused his wife. The couple separated when Mr. Patterson was 2. They reunited when he was 11, but there was always tension in the marriage.
"I guess a lot of my attitudes toward gender and so on are formed by that experience, because I do think that I've always had difficulty relating to him," Mr. Patterson said of his father. "They came back together mainly for my benefit, but I'm not sure that was a great idea for them."
At college at the University of the West Indies and in graduate school at the London School of Economics, Mr. Patterson called himself a "radical nationalist." He demonstrated for an end to Jamaica's colonial status -- he was 22 when the country became independent in 1962 -- and for a federation of Caribbean nations. His left-wing politics led to a long friendship with Michael Manley, the late socialist Prime Minister of Jamaica, to whom Mr. Patterson was an unofficial adviser for many years.
In 1968 a crackdown by a conservative Jamaican Government against leftist student and faculty organizations at the University of the West Indies, where he was teaching, convinced Mr. Patterson that he should move to the United States, where he was eventually appointed to the Harvard faculty.
His background and interests have created an odd mixture in Mr. Patterson: a black student of the American racial dynamic who was born and raised in a foreign country with a black majority. It is a mixture he says allows him to view racial issues here with a fresh eye.
"Growing up in a society in which almost everybody -- my kinsmen anyway -- were people of color, you don't experience the kind of racial hurts which from what I read in autobiographies and accounts by sociologists are a very powerful shaper of attitudes," he said. "Race was something I discovered intellectually later on in college. But having a group of white people who were the majority around you and constantly giving off signals of their superiority and your inferiority was something I was spared the burden of having to put up with."

HEADLINE: Minnesota Mining Says Profit Declined

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, April 30

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the maker of more than 50,000 industrial and consumer products, said today that its first-quarter profit fell 4 percent despite a rebound in sales in Asia.
Net income fell to $384 million, or 95 cents a share, from $400 million, or 98 cents, a year earlier. The per-share results were better than the average forecast of 91 cents of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation, which tracks corporate earnings. The company's shares rose $3.375, to $89. 
 Minnesota Mining, whose products range from Scotch tape to Nexcare bandages to industrial abrasives, said revenue rose 2.2 percent, to $3.78 billion from $3.7 billion. The company, which gets half its sales overseas, had its best performance in five quarters in the Asia Pacific region. Sales also rose in the United States, though just 2 percent at a time when the economy surged.
In Asia Pacific, sales volume rose 7 percent. Optimism for a turnaround in the region has fueled industrial stocks for the last two weeks.
The company's shares, which touched a two-year low of $65.625 on Sept. 1, have weakened in the last 18 months on concerns about Asia's economies and six straight quarters of year-to-year profit declines for the company.
But since the start of the year, its shares have risen 25 percent, helped by this month's gains by industrial stocks.

HEADLINE: Outgoing U.N. Development Chief Berates U.S.

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 30

 BODY:
With American debt to the United Nations soaring and contributions to development aid plunging, the outgoing chief of the United Nations Development Program, the highest-ranking American in the United Nations system, has accused the United States of "tragic shortsightedness" in failing to support the world body.
The United States has consistently "undervalued, underutilized and underfunded" the United Nations and its agencies in recent years, said the development chief, James Gustave Speth, a soft-spoken environmentalist known to be close to Vice President Al Gore. 
 Mr. Speth, who will step down at the end of June as head of the United Nation's largest agency after six years, was interviewed on Wednesday in his spacious office with a panoramic view of the United Nations Secretariat and Manhattan's East Side. He is leaving to be dean of Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
In words laced with frustration, he deplored what he called American "ignorance" of the "extraordinary" role played by the United Nations in preventing and containing conflict, sustaining development and reducing poverty. He criticized not only the Republican-led Congress, which has been holding $1.6 billion in past dues hostage to anti-abortion and other domestic concerns, but also the Democratic Administration that had nominated him.
While "a lot more supportive" than Congress, the Clinton Administration has also given the United Nations too little priority, he said, often "going it alone" as a superpower and failing to press for the implementation of its pledge to reward the reforms it advocated.
A troubling indication that Washington had given up its leadership here, many United Nations officials said, was the Administration's decision to permit a non-American to replace Mr. Speth, who was the sixth American to hold that post.
Several diplomats and American officials said that Washington had given up the post in hopes of further reducing its contribution to United Nations development aid. Last week, the General Assembly confirmed Secretary General Kofi Annan's nomination of Mark Malloch Brown, the British-born World Bank vice president, as Mr. Speth's successor.
The U.N.D.P., the world body's main foreign-aid arm, has about 5,000 employees in 130 offices throughout the world and disburses about $1.9 billion of its $2.2 billion budget to fight poverty and underdevelopment. Europeans, resentful of the United States for failing to pay $1.6 billion in assessments, had campaigned for the U.N.D.P. slot.
Although the agency's budget comes from voluntary contributions, America's portion of the budget has been dropping. In the new issue of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Speth called Washington's aid budgets "particularly stingy." In the interview he noted that while Nordic countries contributed about $16 per capita to his agency, America's per capita contribution stood at 50 cents.
The drop comes at a time of growing poverty amid abundance. Almost three-fifths of the world's 4.4 billion people in developing countries live without basic sanitation; almost one-third are without safe drinking water; a quarter lack adequate housing, a fifth are malnourished and 1.3 billion live on less than $1 a day, he said.
"Most Americans have no sense of how desperate the lot of one half of humanity is," Mr. Speth said.
Mr. Speth said that although the United Nations had made "dramatic progress" in eliminating duplication and waste, and that his own agency had undergone "significant restructuring" -- spending nearly a fourth of its budget now on projects that promote better government, democracy and market forces -- the Administration's budget request of $80 million this year was still 20 percent less than what it requested and Congress approved.
He warned that a weakening of the United Nations' development efforts would undermine the organization's peacekeeping activities. "It is the hands-on work of helping people in 160 countries around the world that builds up the credibility of the United Nations and gives it access," he said.
John R. Bolton, senior vice president of the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, disagreed with Mr. Speth's suggestion that failing to support the world body's development work was lessening its impact in world diplomacy. But he agreed with those who criticized the Administration for not fighting to keep an American in the agency's top job. It showed yet again that the Administration was "spineless" and "without vision," Mr. Bolton said.
Robert DeVecchi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and president emeritus of the International Rescue Committee, said that the nationality of the administrator mattered less than his competence. American relief workers were "delighted" with Mr. Malloch Brown's appointment, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Investigating Big Wall St. Investment Firms

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The Federal Government has started an investigation into the way some of Wall Street's largest investment firms set the fees they charge companies to sell their stock to the public in initial offerings.
The Justice Department's antitrust division blanketed the financial community's most prestigious securities houses with subpoenas on Thursday for information about the fees for initial public offerings, the companies' lawyers said. 
 A Justice Department spokeswoman, Gina Talamona, said, "The antitrust division is looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the underwriting services for initial public offerings."
The inquiry follows a wave of public offerings, particularly of high-technology and Internet companies. Last year 374 companies went public, raising nearly $37 billion, according to the Securities Data Company. By contrast, in 1990, 172 companies raised $4.5 billion when they went public.
The existence of the subpoenas was disclosed in documents filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Goldman, Sachs & Company, which is preparing to go public on Tuesday and raise more than $3 billion.
Goldman said it had received a subpoena from the Justice Department "requesting information with respect to its investigation of an alleged conspiracy among securities underwriters to fix underwriting fees."
Executives at Goldman said they did not expect that the subpoena would affect its plans to go public.
The breadth of the Justice Department inquiry was far broader than just Goldman. Lawyers and executives involved in the cases said the list of subpoena recipients included Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch & Company, Credit Suisse First Boston, Lehman Brothers, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.
The inquiry, in its initial stages, surprised Wall Street executives who have already denied accusations in a related civil lawsuit that they conspired to set a standardized fee. Studies have shown that Wall Street firms typically charge about 7 percent for smaller public offerings of up to $80 million, and less for the larger ones.
"We were genuinely shocked that Justice took this on," said an executive at one of the larger firms that received a subpoena this week.
A lawyer for another firm said it was "a true mystery" why the Justice Department's antitrust division had felt compelled to get involved in a market that he said "remains very competitive."
The Justice Department inquiry follows a series of private class action lawsuits brought by shareholders against 25 of the nation's largest and smaller securities firms that were recently consolidated in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
That case, filed by the New York law firm of Kirby McInerney & Squire, accuses the underwriters of violating Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and various provisions of the Clayton Act by conspiring to keep the fee that underwriters charge companies issuing stock at a nearly uniform fee.
"The fee is a major source of underwriters' profits and has been called 'the last bastion of the clubby cigar-smoking world of investment banking,' " the law firm said in a civil complaint filed last month. "The underwriter fee for I.P.O. offerings in the United States is uniformly 7 percent. This uniformity cannot be justified on the basis of costs and risks and would not exist in a competitive market free of collusion."
The complaint also quotes from a 1997 article in The Wall Street Journal quoting the head of underwriting at one investment bank saying, "The fact is, we'd be cutting our own throats to compete on price." It notes that in foreign countries, where there is even greater risk to the underwriters, fees may be as low as 3 percent or 4 percent.
"The large numbers of underwriters competing for business in I.P.O. offerings, and the healthy economy and stock market of the last six years, should have resulted, in our highly developed and extraordinarily efficient securities markets, in lower and more competitively negotiated fees," the complaint said. "In fact, as the demand for I.P.O. securities has increased and underwriter risk has decreased, the percentage fees on I.P.O. securities have held constant."
Alice McInerney, a lawyer who helped draft the civil complaint, said the shareholders had been harmed by the collusive efforts of the underwriters because the value of their stock was diminished by the size of the fee.
But lawyers representing the underwriters have disputed that contention. Earlier this week, they moved to dismiss the case, partly on the theory that shareholders do not have standing to bring a lawsuit under Federal antitrust laws because they are neither competitors nor direct purchasers of underwriting services. In court papers, the defense lawyers noted that not a single company that has issued stock had joined the case.
The defense lawyers also argued that the mere existence of similar pricing by the underwriters did not prove any collusion to violate antitrust law.
"Plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts that, if proven, would be sufficient to establish concerted action," the defense lawyers wrote in their brief seeking to dismiss the case. "Plaintiffs, instead, rely on conclusory allegations that unspecified meetings were held through which prices were allegedly fixed and agreements enforced. But they do not allege a single fact that lends even an inference of concerted action or any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any of the 25 named defendants, many of which were not even syndicate members in the offerings in which plaintiffs participated."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: BELGRADE;
Bombs Pound Heart and Homes of Serbia's Capital

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, April 30

 BODY:
When NATO bombed residential areas of Belgrade for the first time early this morning, two errant missiles, meant for military office buildings, hit houses instead.
Dejan Filipovic, 26, was in his upstairs bedroom on Miruliceva Street when a missile nearly blew him out of the window. 
 He scrambled out the rest of the way, over the wreckage of the Zlatni Ovan restaurant, the Golden Goat, breaking only his leg, his sister, Aleksandra, said.
"We were in the living room and Dejan was upstairs," Aleksandra said, pulling at the sleeves of her sweatshirt as she shifted through the rubble. "My mother went through the window and I followed her, but my father stayed because my brother was upstairs. When he realized Dejan was alive, he climbed out, too. And then it all collapsed, and we all thought we were very lucky to be alive."
Branko Filipovic, her uncle, said: "These are crazy people to do this -- monsters. There's no military building here."
Aleksandra, an economics student, laughed harshly. "This is one of the 'mistakes' of NATO," she said with all the venom she could muster. "It's just another of those 'mistakes.' "
On Thursday in Washington, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the air war against Yugoslavia had entered the "domination phase."
General Shelton described improving weather and said NATO had planned 670 air sorties through the day and night. "So today's a big one," he said.
It certainly seemed that way in Belgrade, which had its worst night of bombing, coupled with a presumably unrelated earthquake about 5:30 A.M. People joked that "if NATO doesn't get you, an earthquake will."
After the earthquake, one shaken person interviewed on Studio B radio said: "Nothing can surprise us now. Only Armageddon, maybe."
But the deep percussion of high explosives lasted for hours, as NATO chose targets in the heart of Belgrade -- the massive paired 1970's-era buildings of the Defense Ministry and Army General Staff Headquarters, just across the street from the elegant Foreign Ministry, and the federal Interior Ministry, which had seemed to be pretty effectively destroyed earlier in the war.
Four people died, none of them in the houses that were destroyed in the Vracar district, near the Kalenic market, one of the city's largest. At least one police officer died; he had been doing guard duty by the Interior Ministry, officials said. At least 37 people were hurt; 13 of them seriously. But officials insisted that the Defense and Army buildings had been emptied of workers weeks ago.
In the morning, the scene around the buildings was somber and eerie, as shocked Belgraders picked their way over a carpet of broken glass and shattered masonry, as if Fifth Avenue had been hit by missiles and every window for a half-mile had shattered.
Some gathered on the corners to stare, speaking in hushed voices; others walked along fixedly. Some stopped to pick up a bit of shrapnel and put it in their pockets. Some diplomats, who had come to work to find their windows blown in all over their offices, milled around outside, staring at the shrapnel pockmarks gouged out of the sculpted stones of the facade.
Workmen with long straw brooms swept the sidewalks and streets, making little heaps of glistening, broken trash before shoveling them into trucks to cart away.
The oddest sight was of other city workers carefully pulling the weeds from the dirt around trees -- some of which had bent or broken in the blast -- as if a long-ordered city beautification project was being carried out on schedule amid the ruins.
"What really makes me angry is the Foreign Ministry," said a passer-by named Ilija. "It's one of the most beautiful buildings in the city, and it's like the old civic Belgrade is being destroyed."
The Foreign Ministry, begun in 1903 and finished in 1936, has lovely arches and windows, with a marble reception area now left open to the elements. Pretty iron bollards on the sidewalks had been broken off and elegant street lights bent or severed.
Diplomats had made nervous jokes in recent weeks about being across the street from such likely targets. The huge defense buildings, faced with pink stone, were known as Sutjeska, after a Bosnian mountain where Tito fought a grand battle in 1943 and was wounded.
But there was something shocking about the home of Yugoslav diplomacy being shattered in this remote-control war, an irony immediately seized upon by the ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic, who noted that the bombing occurred only hours before the arrival of the Russian special envoy for the Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
"NATO wants to bury under concrete and steel, under the debris, not only the civilian victims but the idea of a diplomatic settlement itself," Mr. Vujovic said. "This is an attack on diplomacy as a method to solve the crisis in Kosovo."
In the Vracar district, an end to the war seemed quite far away. The history of bombing cities in this century is a mixed one, but tends to reinforce patriotism and anger, not diminish it.
Branko Filipovic had nothing but imprecations for NATO. "This will go on until they have the mercy to stop it," he said. "If the international community does nothing, we won't exist. But we won't give up Kosovo."
Aleksandra said: "I think they cannot know our people and our life here. We're a small country but educated and proud. We're proud to live in this city and we're proud to be Serbs and we will stay proud."
Then she laughed, describing how her uncle often slept in their house, because he lives so close to the Defense Ministry. "He slept here for 10 days, thinking it was safer," she said. "And now they're both destroyed. Only five minutes before our street was hit, he called us and said everything is smoke and dust."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS;
From Milosevic, 6 Steps Toward Ending the War on the Serbs

BYLINE: UPI

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, April 30

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview today with President Slobodan Milosevic:
 
PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC -- In Yugoslavia we have 26 different ethnic groups. Any one of them could cause trouble if agitated from the outside, which is what happened in Kosovo.
In Belgrade we have 100,000 Yugoslav Albanians, and never a problem with them. Walk from our Parliament building and you will see many shops with their Albanian names. Not one window smashed here in all those years of violence in Kosovo. Our people never considered them responsible for the behavior of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army terrorists. . . . 
 Ethnically mixed states is the trend in the new global village. The Kosovar terrorists were trying to reverse a phenomenon.
 
Q. Which you then attempted to do in Kosovo after March 24?
 
A. Absolutely not. That is the big lie which, repeated often enough, becomes conventional wisdom.
 
Q. You are denying that your armed forces drove people out of their homes and torched entire villages?
 
A. We are not angels. Nor are we the devils you have made us out to be. Our regular forces are highly disciplined. The paramilitary irregular forces are a different story. Bad things happened, as they did with both sides during the Vietnam war. . . .
 
Q. Satellites show entire villages torched.
 
A.Individual houses, yes. But not whole villages, as we saw on TV in Vietnam when American forces torched villages. . . .
 NATO believes it can pick on a small nation and force us to surrender our independence. And that is where NATO miscalculated. You are not willing to sacrifice lives to achieve our surrender. But we are willing to die to defend our rights as a sovereign nation. . . .
 
Q. After you walked away from the Rambouillet accords on Kosovo, did you really expect more than a month of sustained bombing?
 
A. Rambouillet was not a negotiation; it was a Clinton Administration diktat. . . . Rambouillet was a recipe for the independence of Kosovo, which clearly we could not accept. . . .
 
Q. So how do we get out of this mess?
 
A. A political process, not by more bombing. . . . Please tell me why a U.N. protectorate is needed. That is not to say we are against a U.N. mission. . . . The U.N. can have a huge mission in Kosovo if it wishes. They can bear witness to the legal behavior of our law-enforcement agencies and to the fact that everything is now peaceful, that the K.L.A. has ceased to exist except for scattered small groups that can still stage ambushes.
We cannot accept an occupation force, whether it flies a NATO or U.N. flag.
 
Q. So you accept a U.N. peacekeeping force?
 
A. Yes, but no army.
 
Q. Without weapons?
 
A. Self-defense weapons are normal, but no offensive weapons. We cannot accept anything that looks like an occupation. . . .
The idea behind Rambouillet was 28,000 troops, including 4,000 Americans, who would be occupying Kosovo with tanks, armored personnel carriers and heavy weaponry.
 
Q. So in your judgment what is the nature of a compromise between NATO and Yugoslavia?
 
A. First of all, cessation of all military activities.
 Second, simultaneity between the withdrawal of NATO troops now concentrated on our borders in Albania and Macedonia, on the one hand, and the decrease of our own troops in Kosovo from their present level of 100,000 to the normal garrison strength of between 11,000 and 12,000, which was the regular Pristina Corps.
 
Q. You went from 40,000 to 100,000 troops in Kosovo since the bombing started?
 
A. Yes, because of the danger of aggression across our borders by NATO forces. . . . But if the danger of NATO aggression is over, we can send our troops back to Serbia.
 
Q. How long would such a simultaneous withdrawal take in your judgment?
 
A. We can do it in one week.
 
Q. And the third point?
 
A. The return of all refugees, regardless of their ethnic or religious affiliation.
 
Q. And when would the U.N. peacekeeping force go in? Before the refugees can return presumably.
 
A. I don't like the word "force." We would welcome U.N. mission, not what "force" implies. There is no job for forces. What would such forces do? Just ruin our roads with their tracked vehicles. . . .
My fourth point is the political process. We will continue direct negotiations with Mr. Rugova Ibrahim Rugova, a prominent Kosovo Albanian in the presence of the international community. They can listen to every single word that is spoken, but they cannot act as mediators. We want to achieve the widest possible autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia. . . .
My fifth point is free access for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Red Cross.
Sixth, an economic recovery plan for the three Yugoslav federation states that have been heavily damaged by NATO aggression. . . .
 
Q. What would you say to European participation as the European Union, not as individual NATO countries?
 
A. There are European countries that are not members of NATO, like Ireland, that would be acceptable.
 
Q. Contingents from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus have also been mentioned.
 
A. They, too, would be acceptable.
 
Q. Surely you are not prepared to face several more weeks of NATO bombing as the diplomatic haggling continues?
 
A. One more day is too much. But what choice do we have if NATO insists on occupying Yugoslavia? To that we will never surrender.

HEADLINE: Economy's Growth Keeps to Fast Pace, Up 4.5% in Quarter

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
America's economic boom -- already the second longest on record -- shows no signs of flagging.
Despite a decline in auto production and another sharp deterioration in the trade balance, the United States economy grew at a surprisingly robust 4.5 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 1999, the Government reported yesterday. 
 That is the sort of heady pace usually associated with the first, not the ninth, year of an economic expansion. Moreover, most forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, had been expecting a visible slowdown from the previous quarter's frenetic 6 percent rate.
"This economy continues to defy the aging process," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company in Boston. "The only discernible weakness is the trade deficit. And this has merely slowed the economy from warp speed."
A burst of domestic spending fueled last quarter's gains. Consumers, who account for more than two-thirds of the nation's buying, spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Home purchases shot up at an annual rate above 15 percent. And business investment in new plant and equipment, which had faltered last summer, continued to rebound, advancing at a 7.6 percent rate.
Investors were stunned by the economy's momentum. Fears that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in the next few months to cool things off sent bond prices down sharply, and stocks tumbled, too. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 89.34 points, to 10,789.04.
To William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, the latest report on the gross domestic product "in some ways was even stronger than the fourth quarter's."
Despite the virtual absence of inflation now, Mr. Dudley said, growth this fast always increases the risk that wages and prices will start to creep steadily upward.
But even though the so-called G.D.P. deflator -- which measures changes in the prices of domestically produced goods -- jumped to a 1.4 percent annual rate compared with eight-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter, the increase appeared mostly to reflect a one-time pay increase for civil servants.
Steven Landefeld, director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, pointed out that prices on everything that businesses and consumers buy, including cut-price imports, rose no faster last quarter than in the fall, at a 1.1 percent rate.
How long can the good times last? An economist who has spent the last 15 years studying American business cycles says the short answer is: pretty much as long as the Federal Reserve, committed to preventing an outbreak of inflation, remains convinced that the danger is minimal.
The economist, Christina D. Romer of the University of California at Berkeley, explains in a forthcoming article in The Journal of Economic Perspectives that long periods of uninterrupted growth are a post-World War II phenomenon. Between the early 19th century and the 1960's, the longest interval between recessions was half a dozen years or fewer. But the 1960's boom lasted nearly nine years, the 1980's growth cycle stretched for almost eight years, and the expansion of the 1990's has now passed its eighth birthday.
What changed? Professor Romer said: "We learned something from Keynes about how to prevent recessions, i.e. how to use monetary policy to counter economic shocks. But the new-found competence eventually turned into hubris."
During the Vietnam War and the years after the 1973 oil shock, she says, "we expanded too much and created a lot of inflation."
To undo its own mistakes, the Fed had to create some truly nasty recessions, including the severe recession of 1980-82 engineered by Paul A. Volcker, then the Fed's chairman. Ever since, central bankers have managed to avoid overexpansion, and the only recession, the one largely precipitated by a consumer pullback in response to the outbreak of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war, was relatively short-lived and shallow.
With the Fed's having shown restraint in the past, Professor Romer said, "We don't have to create a recession to get inflation down."
Professor Romer says that Alan Greenspan, who has been in charge at the Fed since 1987, has been lucky as well as smart. Trouble in the rest of the world, paradoxically, turned out to be a boon for the American economy. Tough times abroad helped hold inflation down as the prices of raw materials and imports collapsed and foreigners poured their money into Wall Street.
As for American consumers, they are behaving as if bad times are far, far away. With unemployment at a 30-year low, inflation-adjusted take-home pay rising handily, and spirits about as high as they have ever been, consumers are spending all of their income -- and then some. In addition, the well heeled are cashing in some of their stock market gains while the less well-to-do are taking advantage of easy credit to borrow more.
After-tax personal income soared at a 4.6 percent annual rate this winter, but spending rose at an even headier 6.7 percent annual rate and the personal saving rate, already around zero, fell into negative territory to the lowest level, minus five-tenths of a percent, ever recorded. (The measure, while seriously flawed, nonetheless clearly shows that Americans are saving less than they were just a year or two ago.)
Business, which has been having trouble passing higher costs along, is spending freely once again as well to improve its efficiency. Although the growth of computer purchases slowed this winter, businesses invested heavily in low-technology gear, new office space and the like.
What could go wrong? A meltdown in the stock market could spook consumers into becoming born-again savers. Corporate America, facing heavy debts and mediocre profits, could suddenly slash its investment budget. Another deterioration in growth abroad -- at the moment things look a bit firmer -- could reverse the budding spring revival in manufacturing that seems to be under way. And inflation may start to simmer again. For now, however, these are just risks, not realities.

HEADLINE: As Deadline Closes In, Patriots Reject Lucrative Hartford Offer

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 30

 BODY:
Five months after the New England Patriots announced a startling plan to move to Connecticut, the football team said today it was walking away from the most lucrative stadium deal in professional sports now that Massachusetts is willing to pay to keep the team.
Patriots executives attributed their decision to problems with the site in downtown Hartford, which is now occupied by a steam plant and is contaminated with coal tar and other toxins. But the withdrawal came just three days after Massachusetts legislators, after years of bitter and unproductive negotiations with the team's owner, Robert K. Kraft, promised a subsidy of $70 million to help him build a new stadium next to his current one at Foxboro, south of Boston. 
 Mr. Kraft's decision turned what had seemed a stunning coup into an embarrassing and expensive fiasco for Connecticut officials, most critically Gov. John G. Rowland, who had brokered the deal that would have saddled taxpayers with the entire cost of the $375 million stadium.
The Patriots canceled the contract with a curt notice to the state at 4:30 P.M. today, just two days before a deadline that allowed the team to back out without any penalty. Lawyers for the Patriots had determined that if the team waited any longer, it could be liable to the state for damages of as much as $100 million, according to a National Football League executive.
Much about the team's future remains uncertain. An executive close to the Patriots expressed disgust with the current Massachusetts offer, which would require the team to finance the entire cost of the stadium, while the state paid for new parking lots, roads and other improvements. But clearly the team would like to work something out. "It's not an option -- it's our home," the executive said.
Patriots officials also said Mr. Kraft would consider selling the team, having grown weary of the frustrating stadium talks he has held with three states -- including a flirtation with Rhode Island -- ever since becoming the team's fourth owner in 1994.
Mr. Rowland at first had promised the stadium site in the Connecticut capital would be ready for play in 2001, but that target had slipped to 2002. Then, consultants to Mr. Kraft told him this week that there was a 50-50 chance the stadium would be delayed at least another year. Team officials said that report prompted their decision to cancel the contract.
An official who works closely with Mr. Kraft said the team had misgivings about the Hartford site as long ago as February, which is the reason the exit clauses like the one exercised today were built into the contract.
In a letter to Mr. Rowland, Mr. Kraft said: "The scope of this project was a mountainous undertaking and much more complex than anyone anticipated when our discussions originally began. We know that you have exhausted every effort to meet the deadlines that have been within your control, but it has become clear to us that the goal of playing in a new stadium in Hartford by the year 2002 has a significant degree of uncertainty."
Mr. Rowland, a second-term Republican angrily challenged the Patriots' explanation, saying he believed the state had been used as a pawn by Mr. Kraft to extract a deal from Massachusetts. "No one walks away from a year's planning and a $374 million package because of concerns of the schedule being a little bit longer than usual," he said.
Hartford officials had envisioned the stadium as the centerpiece of a revitalization project, Adriaen's Landing, which was to include a hotel and convention center, lifting a city that has suffered through years of economic decline as manufacturers left and insurance companies consolidated.
"I often said it's not just about football," Governor Rowland said at a somber news conference tonight. "It's about having pride, it's about creating community spirit. We tasted that, and I think that that taste is still with us. We're going to find and create other opportunities and chances for Hartford."
The team, which has played in the Boston area since its birth in 1959 as the American Football League's eighth franchise, now will be eagerly courted by Massachusetts officials. Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said tonight, "The New England Patriots will be playing in Massachusetts, where they belong."
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate who had led public opposition to the stadium, said other cities and states should learn a lesson from Connecticut's bitter experience. "A government needs to know what they're doing and who they're dealing with, and Connecticut showed it did not know either one," Mr. Nader said. "Bob Kraft was using Connecticut against Massachusetts and then when Massachusetts came around, he threw the deal into the river."
Andrew S. Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who is a leading opponent of subsidized stadiums, said: "You have to be careful not to invest too much of your political and financial resources in one of these deals. Rowland took none of the necessary precautions to protect his state and his city."
Mr. Rowland showed his bitterness at his news conference, held in the same ornate room at the Capitol where legislators had donned Patriots hard hats for the jubilant announcement Nov. 19 that the team had agreed to move to Hartford.
"There was always that feeling that Mr. Kraft was always looking for a way out," he said. "Everything always had a very cautious tone. He was not doing somersaults and saying he can't wait to come to Hartford."
Stacey James, the Patriots' spokesman, said Mr. Kraft would not have exerted so much effort or energy on the Hartford deal if he had not been sincere. "We entered into this agreement in good faith to try to play in a new stadium in 2001," Mr. James said. "We signed it for 2002, but when you start talking about 2003, you're talking five football seasons from now, and there simply was no guarantee it wouldn't be longer."
The Governor promised lawsuits against the team and the N.F.L., which served as a midwife to the Massachusetts proposal. Although it initially had voiced little concern about the Connecticut deal, the league had grown worried in recent months that by moving from the 6th-largest television market to the 27th, the Patriots would hamper the league's negotiations with television networks.
Connecticut was most frustrated by the involvement of the N.F.L. Commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, who flew into Boston for a highly promoted round of visits to business and political leaders.
Mr. Rowland estimated the state had spent "a few million dollars" on consultants and site tests. "You can expect legal action, not only with regard to the Kraft family but presumably with the N.F.L. as well," he said. "I don't think we'll have any problem recovering any of these damages."
The State Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, said he would be "moving aggressively and quickly to take any available action to assert the state's legal claims and rights." Mr. Blumenthal asserted that the N.F.L. has been "throwing its weight around in a way that restrains competition and injures consumers."
Connecticut politicians poured scorn on Mr. Kraft. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Moira K. Lyons, a Democrat from Stamford, condemned what she called "the lack of good-faith principles shown by the Kraft family."
Mr. Rowland, though, can expect to be showered with blame in coming days, since he cut the deal in secret, then said that he would stake his legacy on its success. Edward Marcus, chairman of the Connecticut Democratic Party, said stadium preparations had cost the state millions of dollars but added, "What may be even more important is the loss to our reputation."
On the darkest day of his political life, Governor Rowland joked that he is now an official New York Jets fan, and indicated that he never gives up. When asked whether he plans to try to lure another team, he said, "I can assure you that I am not -- at this moment."
Massachusetts legislators have promised to enact their offer before May 25, when N.F.L. owners are scheduled to discuss the Patriots' stadium plans. Three-quarters of the owners must approve any relocation by a franchise. Supporters of the Massachusetts plan have said that if Mr. Kraft did not accept their proposal, they would make their case directly to the other owners.
Paul G. Kirk Jr., a Boston lawyer and former Democratic National Chairman who is leading the Massachusetts bid, had spent the week begging businesses to sign up for luxury suites to help make the deal more attractive to Mr. Kraft. Tonight, Mr. Kirk was so confident of the state's prospects that he said skyboxes now would be "first come, first served."
Mr. Kraft hinted at his future plans and galled Connecticut officials by using his termination letter to thank them for working "so hard in this effort to help the Patriots remain a competitive franchise in New England."

HEADLINE: Beliefs;
On generosity to the poor: three sociologists find some surprising results in a religious survey.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
"Pie in the sky bye-and-bye" was the mocking refrain of political revolutionaries who accused religion of pacifying the poor with heavenly hopes instead of helping them with earthly goods. Yet compassion toward the poor, with here-and-now almsgiving as part of it, has been part of every major religious tradition. So it is not surprising that three sociologists recently set out to answer these questions:
Does religion really matter when it comes to giving money to help the poor? Are the Christian groups that are generally associated with concern for the poor, namely, serious Roman Catholics and liberal Protestants, the most generous in aiding the poor? Do the giving habits of political and theologically conservative Christians, especially those influenced by the religious right, show an anti-poor sentiment? 
 Mark D. Regnerus, Christian Smith and David Sikkink, all associated with the sociology department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, re-examined data gathered in the 1996 Religious Identity and Influence Survey that had been financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Among questions on ideas about morality, gender, education and civic activities, this national telephone survey asked respondents how much of their time or money they had spent in various social and political activities: "a lot," "some" or "none." One such activity was giving money to organizations that helped "the poor and needy."
Writing in last September's issue of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, the sociologists make the data jump through all the usual hoops: race, gender, education, age, income, recent financial change, size of family, size of community, political affiliation. To the latter they add whether respondents had relied on the Christian Coalition or similar organizations in deciding how to vote.
The sociologists also analyzed the data according to church attendance and how important respondents said religion was in their lives. Respondents were divided into religious categories: fundamentalist, evangelical, mainline Protestant, liberal Protestant, low-attendance Protestant, high- and low-attendance Catholic, other religious (Jews, Hindus, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and similar groups whose respondents in the sample were too few to analyze separately), and, finally, nonreligious.
And what did they find?
First, religion apparently matters. The nonreligious were far less likely to report giving "a lot" to groups aiding the poor than all the religious groups except low-attendance Catholics. Control for demographic factors, and the nonreligious are at the bottom of the giving hierarchy.
The degree of religiosity apparently matters, too. The more intensely religious the respondents, the more generous they were apt to be, regardless of their religious affiliation.
Second, "other religious," the residual category containing Jews, Hindus and similar groups, were considerably more likely to give than even the highest of the major Christian categories. Also, nonwhites and women reported giving "a lot" more often than whites and men, and college graduates a little more often than those without degrees. Democrats and Republicans finished nearly in a dead heat, with Republicans winning by a nose.
Third, liberal Protestants and practicing Catholics do not especially stand out in their generosity to the poor. Evangelical Protestants appear mildly more generous.
Fourth, there is no evidence of an anti-poor mentality, as measured by reported giving, among political and theological conservatives. "The conventional wisdom regarding the hostility of politically and theologically conservative Christians toward the poor appears incorrect, at least on this count," the authors write.
What surprised them even more, however, was that those who looked to religious-right organizations like the Christian Coalition for guidance in voting were more likely to report "significant 'pro-poor' giving habits." They were strikingly likely to report giving "a lot".
The limits of this analysis do not escape the authors. From the standpoint of the poor, attitudes toward government assistance, tax relief and health care, or attitudes toward unemployment, economic growth and unionization, may have far greater consequences for well-being than personal charity.
Then there are the inevitable shortcomings of survey data. What definitions exist in the respondents' mind of organizations that help "the poor and needy"? What do they have in mind by giving "a lot"? The random differences can be assumed to cancel one another out. But what if liberal Protestants or, for that matter, college-educated evangelicals consistently had a more stringent notion of what constitutes "a lot"? Systematic differences among religious, political or demographic categories in understanding those questions would skew the results.
Nonetheless, public debate about justice for the poor often slides from what means will best accomplish what goals to ad hominem judgments about the motives and attitudes of the debaters. Whether politically and theologically conservative Christians are right in their prescriptions for relieving poverty is a question distinct from whether they are anti-poor, a la Ebenezer Scrooge, in their personal outlook -- and, as with the transformed Scrooge, giving habits are a reasonable test of the latter.
"Fundamentally," the three sociologists say in their discipline's understated style, "making the jump from economic conservatism to declaring persons to be hostile toward the poor seems unwarranted, according to our research results."

Little Action Was Taken On Complaint, Officials Say
Sheriff's officials in Littleton, Colo., acknowledged that they had done little to follow up a complaint that a neighbor made last year that Eric Harris, one of the teen-age gunmen at Columbine High School, "talks often of making pipe bombs and using them to kill numerous people." But at a news conference, the officials also defended themselves against mounting criticism that they had ignored signs that the two teen-agers were unstable and dangerous. The officials also released copies of Web pages posted by Mr. Harris. A1
 
Officials of the National Rifle Association, gathered in Denver for the organization's annual convention, rejected any suggestion that the gun lobby was responsible for the Littleton killings and asserted that they would stand fast against any new initiative on gun control. "Our mission is to remain a steady beacon of strength and support for the Second Amendment," said Charlton Heston, the N.R.A. president. "We cannot let tragedy lay waste to the most rare and hard-won human right in history." A12

HEADLINE: Tennessee Talks of Paring Plan for 'Uninsurables'

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
In one bold stroke, Tennessee converted its Medicaid health benefits to managed care five years ago and used the savings to cover hundreds of thousands of people who could not afford health insurance of their own or were too sick to qualify. With three million people enrolled, the program, called Tenncare, became the most ambitious and generous government health plan in the nation.
But with Tenncare's costs rising and Tennessee facing a budget deficit, the program is under fire and facing probable retrenchment under pressure from Gov. Don Sundquist. And the people most at risk are those who benefit most from the state's effort at providing nearly universal health insurance: those with chronic or even terminal diseases who have been rejected by private insurance. 
 To arrest a projected 12 percent increase in Tenncare spending for the year beginning in July, Governor Sundquist, a Republican elected to a second four-year term in November, has proposed a moratorium on new enrollments of those regarded as uninsurable, for six months or a year, while the state explores cutting benefits, raising premiums and tightening eligibility.
Meanwhile, the Tenncare director, Brian Lapps Sr., is suggesting that some beneficiaries of the program are exploiting it. The poorest recipients, Mr. Lapps says, could help pay for their care if they would only curb their use of cell phones and cigarettes.
"We have a spoiled population that wants everything for nothing," he said in an interview.
The program's advocates are troubled by the proposed curbs in the program.
"Tennessee did something ahead of the curve, and now it's back to the Okefenokee Swamp," said Dr. Stephen P. Raffanti, medical director of an outpatient AIDS clinic at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center that opened its doors when Tenncare began and now has 1,500 patients.
Tenncare is free for most of its beneficiaries, who are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The better off pay premiums, deductibles and fees based on their incomes. Applicants with debilitating pre-existing conditions, like AIDS or multiple sclerosis, qualify merely by presenting a letter from an insurance company denying them coverage.
Tenncare's impact has been greatest for that last group, which the program calls uninsurables, currently numbering 108,000 of the 1.3 million enrolled in Tenncare. But they are also by far the most expensive group -- a single patient's medication can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year -- and the cost of extending coverage to this group is at the root of Tenncare's problems.
Caught between rising prescription costs and growing numbers of these sickest patients, Tenncare has cut its payments to doctors and H.M.O.'s below what they need to break even, according to a state-financed analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consulting firm.
The program is struggling as the state seeks ways to balance its budget. Education is expected to be among the areas hardest hit.
One day this month, 52 of the uninsurable came to testify at a hearing the state called on the proposal to stop enrollments. The speakers and their advocates expressed resentment at what they called Mr. Lapps's stereotyping of the sick.
Wearing a sticker proclaiming, "We are not the problem," David Tignor, 24, said he has hemophilia. Mr. Tignor is hobbled by braces for ankles that internal bleeding has turned arthritic. He caught AIDS and hepatitis C from a blood transfusion. The state and Federal Government pay for his medicine, which costs more than $100,000 a year.
"This is my work cell phone," Mr. Tignor said, pulling one from his jeans and thrusting it at Mr. Lapps, who presided, taking notes. Mr. Tignor said he needed the phone to call for help when he fell, and added that his employer paid for it.
Louise McKown, 49, pulled herself up to the microphone on two canes that she had decorated with bouquets of violets and daisies. Ms. McKown has a degenerative brain disease that has slurred her speech and made noodles of her legs.
"The day may come when I can no longer speak, write or type," she said. She admonished Mr. Lapps, "This was most definitely not caused by smoking or drinking." And then she added, "I do not want your pity, but I do wish that you understand my reality."
In his one response to his petitioners' comments, Mr. Lapps promised that those who were already enrolled in Tenncare would not be disenrolled.
The Clinton Administration allows states to devise variations of the basic federally subsidized state Medicaid programs that for the most part cover parents and their children who are on welfare and, more recently, parents who are moving from welfare to work at low wages.
In developing Tennessee's variation in late 1993, Gov. Ned McWerter, a Democrat, and his commissioner for finance and administration then, David Manning, thought that by using managed care and health maintenance organizations to cover the state's 800,000 Medicaid recipients, they could both tame the inflation then raging in health care and generate savings to cover people who were uninsured, including the uninsurable.
To maneuver around a hostile physicians' lobby and a skeptical Legislature, which was then out of session and whose approval was not needed, Mr. McWerter and Mr. Manning opened the program overnight, as the new year began in 1994. Health care institutions and his own administration were ill-prepared, and abuses, fraud and foul-ups ensued.
"It was 'Who's on first? Where's second?,' " said Gordon Bonnyman, director of the Tennessee Justice Center, a public policy advocacy group. An influential lawyer and lobbyist, Mr. Bonnyman helped assure Tenncare's start by trading his support for the shift to H.M.O.'s for Mr. McWerter's promise to cover the uninsured.
In spite of the chaos, Governor McWerter, whose term expired in January 1995, had put the state on the road to the universal care that President Clinton proposed then and that Congress subsequently blocked.
"Tenncare showed that if there is a political will, it could be done," Mr. Bonnyman said. "Now that is being casually, cavalierly, thoughtlessly tossed aside.
For the moment, Tenncare is entrenched. It covers 24 percent of the population. Its enrollment includes 768,000 Medicaid recipients, whose coverage is not threatened, along with the 108,000 uninsurable and 411,000 of the previously uninsured, mostly workers and their families who either are not offered insurance through their jobs or cannot afford it if they are.
By some measures, the program is succeeding. A survey last year by the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville found that 81 percent of the enrollees were satisfied with Tenncare in 1997, compared with 61 percent in 1994.
Enrollees using hospital emergency rooms, the survey found, had fallen by half over the three years, suggesting that people are getting treated before crises strike.
Tenncare's advocates say the program has also succeeded in keeping many of the uninsured self-sufficient.
"I have patients at five and six years who are working," said Dr. Raffanti of the Comprehensive Care Clinic, the one specializing in AIDS. "A lot of these patients I'm going to keep from going to end-stage disease for a very long time."
Some officials and health care experts here trace the program's current financial travails to two miscalculations early on. One, they say, was the McWerter administration's high expectations for the impact of managed care in reducing costs. Another was a decision to limit coverage to 1.3 million enrollees.
So appealing was the promise of coverage that the uninsured, most of them healthy, rushed aboard. The limit was reached within months, and in late 1994, the state stopped enrolling them, though it later reopened coverage to uninsured children.
But under an agreement with the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which regulates Medicaid and Medicare, it continued to enroll the uninsurable. And as their numbers grew, the state lost more and more of the contribution to the cost of their care that it had received from the largely healthy uninsured.
"Ideally, we should open enrollment to the uninsured, not wait for people to get sick," said John Ferguson, the state commissioner for finance and administration.
But there are other issues, too, said Mr. Lapps, the Tenncare director.
He knows his new terrain: for three years, until last October, he was an uninsurable Tenncare enrollee because of a condition he declines to disclose, and is now covered by the state employee health plan.
Mr. Lapps says that he wants to preserve the program and that "we are 60 to 65 percent of having it right." Problems he wants to tackle, he said, include insurance companies suspected of dumping patients on Tenncare, signs of illegal enrollments, excessively generous benefits and a failure to verify enrollees' incomes.
But enrollees are an issue, too, Mr. Lapps said. "There are a lot of responsible poor out there," he said. "But there's a portion who drive up to the doctor's in a BMW. The question has to be raised: What is their purchasing priority?"
Mr. Lapps has some support. The Tennessee Medical Association has fought Tenncare from the start, mostly because of cuts in doctors' fees, which Mr. Lapps would partly restore. "He's talking the talk that we've been talking for five years," said Russ Miller, the association's spokesman.
The Federal Health Care Financing Administration must approve the moratorium during which the state would look into revising Tenncare. Negotiations continue, and Federal officials in Washington declined to comment. But Commissioner Ferguson said, "The reading we're getting is, we could close enrollment."
Mr. Bonnyman, director of the justice center, said that would be the demise of Tenncare as it has been known.
"It's like the Governor woke up and said, 'Why are we covering all these people when other states aren't?' " he said. "It's a poignant testimony to our national incapacity to develop a rational and humane health policy."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 4, 1999, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about Tenncare, the Tennessee health care program for the uninsured, misstated the number of people enrolled. As noted elsewhere in the article, it is 1.3 million, not 3 million.
 The article also misspelled the surname of the governor who established the program. He is Ned McWherter, not McWerter.

THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET, by Salman Rushdie. (Holt, $27.50.) Gods, humans and rock performers mix and match conduct -- some horrific, some charming -- in a novel not of our world but of a dangerous, fragile world, riven with earthquakes and set at a refractive angle to ours.
 
THE LEXUS AND THE OLIVE TREE, by Thomas L. Friedman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.50.) A columnist, formerly a correspondent, for The Times explains, with anecdotes as well as analyses, what the instant electronic global economy is and what it may take to live there.
 
THE MEME MACHINE, by Susan Blackmore. (Oxford University, $25.) An informed effort to popularize the theory that cultures are controlled by replicating units (memes) analogous to the genes of biological theory, and that their operations drive cultural evolution.
 
THE SEA CAME IN AT MIDNIGHT, by Steve Erickson. (Bard/Avon, $23.) Several stories mesh together, or fail to do so, at the level of echo and metaphor rather than plot in this firmly apocalyptic novel at whose center is a dislocated girl who sells memories in a Japanese brothel.
 
THE SOPRANOS, by Alan Warner. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A kind of gloomy farce by a young, talented Scottish novelist who has every sympathy with a pack of teen-age choirgirls down in the big city, where wishfully licentious outbreaks fill up, for a while, the vacancy of hope.
 
VERA: (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov), by Stacy Schiff. (Random House, $27.95.) A thoughtful biography of Nabokov's wife, protector, dogsbody and perfect reader that opens up a 52-year marriage without pretending to explain every enigma.

Zen and the Art of Fashion

BYLINE: By Bob Morris; Bob Morris is a frequent contributor to The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Lee, a young man with good cheekbones from a poor family, grew up where there was no Banana Republic. He was not schooled in the subtle ways of J. Crew, either. He simply wore what was cheap and easy -- T-shirts, fleece, sneakers and sweats that did not ring of chic or knowingness. When he moved to Manhattan for college and settled into a stimulating new life of study and play, Lee remained badly dressed and adamantly unstylish.
One day in late October, while he was sitting in the park watching the leaves on the ground being styled for a photo shoot, a slender figure caught his eye. She was a young woman named Flo with pale hair that took the autumn light. Flo was the founder of a big, trendy mail-order company called Zen, which promoted spirituality through clothing, furniture and cosmetics and marketed itself by pushing purity, timelessness and harmony with nature. Although she was not a student of the discipline, Flo had the Zen thing down pat, and she felt totally one with it all. 
 Lee had never met anyone like Flo. She spoke in a hushed voice as if in a monastery. She called bubble baths aromatherapy, wore shoes that looked as humble as a monk's (but cost more than a personal computer) and paid thousands of dollars to go on retreats where she ate nothing and did not speak for days at a time. Everything about Flo -- from her imported jute headband to her ahimsa-silk skirt (made from silkworms that have died naturally) -- was complicated in its simplicity. Flo was a mystery with a really good body.
That winter, while snow from a movie shoot gently dusted the rooftops of Washington Square, Lee moved in with Flo. This was when his troubles began. It was not just that Flo's home, done in an intimidatingly monastic style, made him feel like a slob. Or that Flo's fastidious fervor for the purest of foods -- nondairy, gluten-free, organic -- made him feel like a reprobate every time his stomach growled. Rather, it was her gentle but constant concern about his bad haircut and careless wardrobe that made him feel as unworthy and anxious as a tourist in Paris.
One day in early spring, when troughs of hydroponic grass began gracing the tables of better dinner parties all over town, Lee visited the master of a SoHo zendo. The master, or sensei, agreed that, yes, it is a paradox that retailers use the language of Zen, which teaches the senselessness of attachment, to promote consumerism. But a Zen master, after all, is trained to accept the world as a paradox.
"What happens to my fist when I open my hand?" the sensei asked, posing a koan, a Zen riddle that can't be answered. It left Lee speechless.
"That is the point, exactly," the sensei said. "There is no answer. But now let me ask you this: Have you not noticed, since you came to this city from your small town, how muted and spare people can be? Have you not observed, as you go about your day, the attention others pay to subtlety? This nonlook of no-thought takes work. And even our monks cloak themselves in black and shave their heads with great intentionality because they know that when they finally achieve satori -- the great moment of enlightenment -- it's good to have just the right look."
The sensei fell silent as he glanced, with some distaste, at Lee's haphazard outfit.
"Birds put effort into building their nests just so," he said. "Poets write with a lyrical economy of style. This spring, you should find your way to a place of simple pale shades -- grays, blues, beiges -- that reflect the gentleness of clouds and sky. Learn from Zen, and I mean both the spiritual discipline and your girlfriend's mail-order company, and you will find a new way of being that is both flexible and fashionable. Clean your closet and open your mind."
Lee blushed with excitement. He was starting to understand the way. "How can I thank you?" he asked. "Just have Flo call me," the master replied, "the next time Zen is having a sale."

HEADLINE: WEEKEND GETAWAYS;
Beyond Charm in Charleston

BYLINE: By SUSAN JACOBY; SUSAN JACOBY is working on a four-generation history of her family.

 BODY:
EATING breakfast in the shade of a palm tree on a sun-drenched Easter morning in Charleston, surrounded by the sound of church bells pealing from every direction and azaleas in full bloom, I surrendered to pure pleasure. A first-time visitor is overpowered by the city's exquisite 18th- and 19th-century architecture, sensuous foliage, near-Mediterranean interplay of light and water and, last but not least, unimaginably good food.
Yet Charleston and its nearby low-country plantations are overwhelming in another, more sobering way. Touring the meticulously preserved historic center, one is reminded -- explicitly and implicitly -- that all of this beauty owes its existence to a system under which, for nearly 200 years, a few human beings owned, and profited from the labor of, a great many more human beings. 
 For every paean to the past during house and plantation tours (usually accompanied by assurances that this family never abused its slaves), I found black and white Charlestonians who encouraged me to look beneath the surface of their richly textured city.
A visitor cannot hope to see everything of historical interest in one weekend -- I immediately crossed Fort Sumter off my itinerary -- and the best way to begin an exploration of the many layers of Charleston is on foot. On my first day, I set out along Meeting Street after breakfast at Joseph's, an unpretentious, superb restaurant where I fortified myself with scrambled eggs, spicy sausage patties, home-fried potatoes, grits and muffins.
Meeting Street bisects Charleston's historic center, beginning at its southern tip with the Battery (so named because guns were mounted there to deter British ships during the War of 1812).
My first stop was the Circular Congregational Church, said (probably apocryphally) to have been constructed in the round to prevent the devil from hiding in corners. The congregation was founded in 1681 by dissenting Scotch and Irish Presbyterians, French Huguenots and English Congregationalists. Meeting Street took its name from the original church building, known in the 17th century as the White Meeting House.
From its founding in 1670, the Carolina colony was a haven for religious dissenters (though the Anglican Church would not lose its status as the state-established religion until 1778). By 1749, Charleston had attracted enough Jews to form Congregation Beth Elohim, which would later become the birthplace of Reform Judaism in America.
The original Circular Congregational, completed in 1806, was designed by Robert Mills, the pre-eminent Charleston architect of his day, whose later works included the Washington Monument. The Pantheon-style building, erected without a steeple, was mocked for years in a piece of local doggerel:
Charleston is a pious place
And full of pious people.
They built a church on Meeting Street
But could not raise a steeple.
That church was destroyed by fire in 1861; it is amazing, in view of Charleston's history of devastating fires, earthquakes and hurricanes, that so many colonial and early 19th-century structures have survived. In 1890, the present Romanesque building, also in a more or less circular form, was built on the same site.
Farther north on Meeting Street is a Mills building that survived the 1861 fire -- called, appropriately, the Fireproof Building. The graceful 1826 classical revival structure, which now houses the South Carolina Historical Society, was the first building in the United States specifically designed to protect public records from fire.
Charleston has retained its antebellum beauty, now fiercely protected by the secular religion of preservationism, because the town never experienced the post-Civil War economic boom that Victorianized the architecture of other, more prosperous Southern cities. As Charlestonians like to say, they were "too proud to whitewash and too poor to paint."
But Charleston is not a museum like Colonial Williamsburg, and many of its historic houses are privately owned and closed to the public. For a visitor, it is great fun to peer through iron gates into courtyard gardens (though it may not be as much fun for the residents) and imagine the private lives behind the lovingly preserved colonial, Federal and Greek Revival facades. On Meeting Street, I stopped for a tour of the 1808 Nathaniel Russell House, noted for its flying staircase that seems to spiral upward with no apparent support.
Meeting Street's restored glories end at the harborfront's White Point Gardens. From there, I turned left along the High Battery walkway, with an unsurpassed view of the harbor and the three-story houses with broad piazzas (the Charleston term for porches) introduced by early settlers from Barbados.
Heading back toward the center on Church Street, I paused at the small French Protestant Huguenot Church, also founded by dissenters, in 1681. It is the only church in America where the original Huguenot liturgy is still regularly used, with an annual service in French.
The 1845 building, supported by slender, fragile-appearing buttresses that rise over each pointed bay to a groined ceiling, stands out even in a city filled with architectural gems. Its unique visual impact derives from the combination of Gothic style and the plain esthetic of a low-church Protestant sanctuary.
Leaving the Huguenots behind, I circled back toward Meeting Street around the old city market and headed south toward Calhoun Street and its landmark Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Calhoun was long called Boundary Street (many older Charlestonians still use the term) to distinguish between the part of town where black activities were severely restricted and the area where blacks could live and worship more freely.
A plaque on the front of the white stucco church notes simply that Emanuel A.M.E. was "founded 1818, closed 1822, reopened 1865."
The congregation was founded by the Rev. Morris Brown, a free black minister who had been affiliated with a local white Methodist church. Before the Civil War, some free blacks, and many slaves, worshiped (always in the back pews or balconies) in Charleston's white churches. Mr. Brown started his black church after traveling secretly to Philadelphia in 1791 to be ordained by the newly formed Free African Society, established by blacks dissatisfied with second-class status in northern Methodist churches.
In 1822, the original church (not on its present site) was burned down by whites because the building had been used as a meeting place by Denmark Vesey, the free black carpenter who was executed for attempting to organize a slave rebellion. Emanuel reopened immediately after the Civil War, when the congregation bought the land where the present church, dedicated in 1891, stands. Approximately a century later, the church installed a monument to Vesey.
Frances T. Mack, 80, and Lee Bennett, 77, members of the church's history committee, explained that they grew up knowing nothing about Vesey. "I don't know whether our parents, or even our grandparents, knew who he was," said Mrs. Mack. ""But if they did, they were afraid to talk about it."
After leaving the church, I made a final stop at the nearby Avery Research Center for African-American History and Culture, originally a school for freed slaves, where I was looking for information on a black Charleston artist, Edwin A. Harleston (1882-1931).
The next morning, I rented a car for a drive to two plantations situated along the Ashley River about 30 minutes from Charleston's center.
The Magnolia Plantation and its gardens represent the best of English garden design, transplanted and transformed over a 300-year period into a subtropical kingdom of camellias and azaleas, laurels and live oaks draped in hanging moss. Originally laid out by the Rev. John Grimke Drayton, the plantation's owner for most of the 19th century, the gardens were subsequently enhanced by a series of lacy white wooden bridges that lend a Giverny-like feel to the ponds and waterways. The entire plantation is also a wildlife preserve, with a swamp garden that attracts ornithologists from around the world.
This "informal" arrangement, artfully designed to create the illusion of a seamless blending with nature, is the kind of garden I like best. But I was also drawn to Magnolia by an old, almost-forgotten interest in the art of Mr. Harleston, whose work I encountered many years ago when I stumbled across his portrait of the philanthropist Pierre S. duPont in a Delaware state building.
Until this year, when I spotted Mr. Harleston's name in Edwin Ball's book, "Slaves in the Family," I did not know he was an African-American.
In the 1920's, Mr. Harleston longed to paint landscapes at Magnolia but was denied permission, because, although the gardens had been open to the public since 1870, they were closed to blacks. He then dressed as a workman in order to sketch and photograph scenes he would later paint.
Even in such an enchanted landscape, the ironies of intertwining white and black history are everywhere. Mr. Drayton, the horticultural visionary, called slaves his "black roses." He was also the nephew of the famous (the official Magnolia guidebook calls them "notorious") abolitionists Angelina and Sarah Grimke. Yet Mr. Drayton must have been influenced by his aunts because he built a schoolhouse on the plantation and engaged in the then-forbidden activity of teaching slaves to read.
Just a few miles away, the more elaborate Middleton Place, believed to be the oldest formal landscape garden in America, evoked the heritage of slavery for me even more powerfully than Magnolia.
There is a great deal to see at Middleton, from stable yards with demonstrations of everyday antebellum plantation activities to a restored house with the books and artifacts of a family that produced a president of the First Continental Congress; a signer of the Declaration of Independence; one of America's first classical archeologists, and a United States Minister to Russia.
But the formal gardens, laid out in 1741 by Henry Middleton (the Continental Congress president) are the main attraction. It took 100 slaves almost a decade to complete the terraces, walkways, hedges, artificial lakes and plantings patterned after the work of Andre Le Notre, who designed the gardens at Versailles.
Working in the gardens must have been a more desirable job for a slave than wresting tar and turpentine from the forests or rice from swampland. Yet I was on the verge of heat exhaustion after two hours spent walking around the grounds on an 85-degree day.
AFTER returning to Charleston, I had just enough time to look up "Honey Man," the lone work by Mr. Harleston currently on display in the Gibbes Museum of Art -- which also has an outstanding collection of more than 500 miniature portraits -- on Meeting Street.
The painting confirmed my impression of Mr. Harleston as a major talent at a time when a black man could not support himself as an artist. Recalling an era (the period of the opera "Porgy and Bess") when Charleston's black vendors sold honey, shrimp and crabs door to door, "Honey Man" is a portrait of a tired wage-earner, his shoulders bent with the weight of his baskets. He might have been walking down one of the elegant streets I had admired the day before.
It felt good to get back to 1999. On my last night, I dined at Magnolias, recommended to me by a lifelong Charlestonian. It was my best meal in a city of great food: pan-seared chicken livers with a thin, crisp crust outside and melting softness inside; buttermilk mashed potatoes, and spicy tomato chutney that exploded in my mouth with the taste of summer. My dinner companion was equally enthusiastic about her seafood gumbo, a low-country specialty. Did I mention the currant bread pudding with rum sauce and homemade vanilla ice cream?
After dinner, I had enough energy -- New South cooking leaves out some of the traditional fat and flour -- for a stop at Atlantic Books on East Bay Street. Charleston is a great book town, especially for historical, rare and out-of-print works, and I found a volume on Renaissance Italian city-states that I had been trying to track down since 1990.
The next morning was Easter Sunday, and I ended my trip to Charleston as I began -- in the graveyard of the Circular Church. Children were hunting for Easter eggs in the city's oldest burial ground, with monuments dating from 1696. One girl, spotting me as an outsider (it wasn't hard, since my New York woman's standard black uniform stood out among the Charleston pastels) pointed out an inscription.
Under the slab lay the three sons of Richard and Mary Savage, who died within 10 days of one another -- of typhus, yellow fever, smallpox? -- in 1784. The boys were ages 3, 5 and 7. "It's much better to be growing up today, ma'am, wouldn't you say?" observed my young guide.
That was the message I took away from a city that makes the past impossible to forget.

 BODY:
Missing from Berman's essay on the cultural war between insiders and outsiders was the real war: class war. Clinton's consistently high poll numbers during the Lewinsky fiasco were based not on some cosmic dominance of the hippie heathens over the Christians, but on the fact that the have-nots simply did not care. Could Clinton's impeachment help retrain formerly well-paid factory workers about to be dumped into the service industry? It meant absolutely nothing to so many people, and the indifference was so widespread that many in the G.O.P. mistook it for moral decay instead of distracted desperation.

Our Humanity Vs. Their Sovereignty

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
Perhaps Bill Clinton really believed that he was going to war to crush the seeds of World War III in the Balkan morass. Or maybe he decided that NATO needed a new cause to refresh itself. Or he became convinced that saving Western Europe from a flood of Albanian refugees was a vital American interest. Maybe he was just furious at that man, Slobodan Milosevic, for refusing to let Kosovo move toward independence like the rest of the former Yugoslav federation.
Domino theories and subtle diplomatic strategies may have guided the White House, but they don't explain Americans' willingness to follow the President into this new war. The reason for that is obvious -- on every television screen. It's those pictures of almost unfathomable atrocity that once again drive our politics. 
 Those scenes of huddled masses burned out of their homes and driven into exile aroused our sympathy and overrode all obligations to respect Serbia's sovereignty. Once the cameras went into action, and the President promised only surgical, aerial combat, no U.N. treaties or Russian entreaties could keep us out. And once "in," as the slogan went, we had to "win," whatever that meant.
Brushed aside were the slogans of the former anti-war movements that America was not "the world's policeman," that we had no business interfering in other nations' civil wars. A few critics clucked about our inconsistency -- our failure to get similarly aroused about even worse barbarities in Cambodia, East Timor, Liberia, Sudan, Algeria, Rwanda. Did Asian and African slaughters not qualify for American response?
What those challenges fail to grasp is that our responses, or lack of responses, are not based on consistency of policy. They're based on the tube. Television drives the public temperature // and cameras were either barred or scared away from those other battlegrounds. Hence there were no bloodcurdling images, and words alone failed to move us.
Cameras also drive our choice of military tactics. President Clinton ruled out ground combat in Kosovo because he had seen how the sight of bloody battle scenes on TV forced our retreat from Vietnam. And he himself ordered us out of Somalia after a single American soldier was shown beaten to death and disgustingly dragged around by people that the troops had come to feed. Images seize our hearts.
But they also cloud our thoughts.
Long before television, or bombers or telephones, Americans questioned their purpose in the world. In every generation, one faction insisted that we fight only to defend the national interest, using power to guard our frontiers and to bargain for the economic and political welfare of our people. Another faction insisted that we had to fight also for our national beliefs, to promote our universal values of peace, freedom, justice and democracy.
Jefferson thought societies had the same obligations as individuals to advance moral values. Hamilton thought a nation had no right to indulge "emotions of generosity and benevolence" at the expense of its own interests. Madison struggled for a middle ground; he said nations must serve their interests, but thought these sometimes included the general interests of mankind.
In our century, we learned to devise different strokes for different folks. President Wilson came through World War I agitating for the "self-determination" of peoples held down by the enemy powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary. But he ignored the domination of other peoples by the United States and by allies like France and Britain.
We continue to be torn in that Wilsonian fashion. Like Hamilton, we worry about oil-supply lines more than about civil liberties in the Middle East. Heeding Jefferson, we wage economic warfare to promote human rights in South Africa or Cuba. And when it comes to China, like Madison, we recognize our national interest in a bountiful trade and our human interest in opposing tyranny. Even after a decade of profound transformation in China, we cannot erase the images of the tanks in Tiananmen Square.
China now opposes our attacks on Yugoslavia on behalf of dissident Kosovo because it fears our intervention would challenge its claim to Taiwan and its hold on Tibet. Yet the Chinese are eager to join the World Trade Organization, to which they would have to yield a large measure of sovereignty. In a similar ambiguity, the United States in recent years has sided with China to oppose the creation of an international court to prosecute war crimes. Yet when the cameras finally caught up with the skeletal remains of atrocity in Rwanda and Bosnia, Americans guiltily endorsed some ad hoc trials of a few captives for "crimes against humanity."
Milosevic remains a poor candidate for trial so long as we need to negotiate with him for an eventual deal for Kosovo. We want to preserve a sovereign Yugoslavia even as we bomb within its borders. The United Nations is no help; it forswears intervention in matters of "domestic jurisdiction" even as it sponsors a "universal declaration of human rights." So we let the cameras steer our course.
Someday in the next century we will acknowledge that there can be no global human rights without global laws and no way to write and enforce the laws without a global congress, courts and cops. The more our cameras intrude upon the world's terrain, the more of our sovereignty will we yield to our humanity.
As the lion in the jungle of nations, the United States is obviously not ready to yield to a higher authority. But in time we will realize, like the nations of Western Europe, that sovereignty has become the enemy of safety. The time will come when Americans recognize that anarchy among nations constitutes a threat to our interest and welfare. We would then take the lead in creating a canopy of law across the globe. Only under a regime of law can politics replace violence and allow the reason of words to take precedence over the passion of pictures.

HEADLINE: Franchise for Little Jobs Around the House

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHO among us has never had a leaky faucet, a door that won't close or a broken porch railing? Nagging small repairs, to be sure, yet for the unhandy, finding someone else willing to take on small jobs has become almost impossible.
Sensing an opportunity for a specialized business led to the formation of the Handyman Connection, a Cincinnati-based company, which recognized a need and turned it into a successful franchise operation. 
 Based on the concept that homeowners across the United States would welcome a helping hand for home repairs and small remodeling jobs, Handyman Connection franchisees supply retired craftsmen and experienced specialists to do things like carpentry work, minor plumbing and electrical repairs, painting, wallpapering, ceramic tiling and masonry work as well as deck construction and kitchen and bath remodeling. A little more than a year ago, Stephen White, 48, former chief executive officer of a 100-bed hospital in Lebanon, Ind., bought the Handyman Connection franchise for Westchester region and opened in Elmsford.
"The health field was becoming more difficult, and after 20 years I was ready for a change," Mr. White said. "I always dreamed of owning my own business, and I figured now was the time."
Mr. White and his wife, Dale, also wanted to return to the New York City area to be near relatives. "Once we settled on where we wanted to live, I started researching the possibilities," Mr. White said. "I could buy an existing business or buy a learning curve, which is what I call a franchise. I knew someone who had bought the Handyman Connection franchise so I met with him, and what he had to say convinced me that this was a very good franchise, especially for someone who is good with his hands. My dad, who was a steam fitter by trade, and the handiest guy I ever met, taught me a lot."
Before making a decision, Mr. White explored other franchise possibilities. "I looked at a few retail operations, 1-800-Flowers, for one, and some temporary personnel agencies, but Handyman was the best choice for me."
Mr. White said the price he paid for the Handyman franchise, $75,000, was based on demographics. "The more populated areas, those with a population over half a million, cost more," he said. "I have Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam and Sullivan Counties, and in time, I expect to open offices in some of them. I'll probably start with Rockland. Close as it is, it has been hard for me to recruit people who live in Rockland. Timewise, they say it isn't worth it with the traffic on the bridge so heavy."
Besides the six-county territory, what did Mr. White get for his $75,000? "I bought a business system, group purchasing ability and advice," he said. "It cost me about $10,000 to $15,000 to open the office, but I'm very satisfied. Starting from scratch, I did $250,000 in the first year."
The biggest challenge facing Mr. White is getting good people. "I have plenty of business, and our work is guaranteed for a year," he said. "I only take people with at least 10 years' experience in their trades with three references that are checked. They're bonded and insured by us, but they work as independent contractors. We give them full office support and handle all the paperwork."
Retired craftsmen make up the biggest group. "They're bored staying home and glad of the opportunity to earn a little extra money," Mr. White said. "They can work as much or as little as they please. We also draw from a group of younger people, with full-time jobs, who work for us after hours."
The freedom and ease of being able to pick and choose jobs attracted Robert Herbst, a painter, to Handyman Connection.
"Some years back I had my own business, until the recession closed me down because my customers, who were building houses on spec, just couldn't pay me," Mr. Herbst said. "Then we moved upstate for a couple of years. But we wanted better schools for the kids, so we moved back down to Wacabuc."
Mr. Herbst, who has been doing a lot of jobs for Mr. White, said: "It's a good arrangement -- very flexible -- and it's hassle free, no paperwork, and that's a big thing. If I want to take the day off, no problem. If I want to work on my own, that's O.K. Being able to fill in when you want to or when you need extra money suits me."
Although Mr. Herbst is not paid for the time it takes him to give free estimates to potential customers, he said: "It's the way this business has always been run. Everyone gives free estimates."
Work is billed at between $35 and $50 an hour, Mr. White said. "But frequently we send out one person who can handle a variety of jobs such as fixing loose tile in the bathroom, caulking a bathtub or planing a door down," he added.
As the franchisee, Mr. White keeps half the money generated from a job. "The company was started seven years ago by two guys, Marvin Belkin and Arthur Neuman, who couldn't find anyone to make the small repairs needed for a condo they owned in Cincinnati," he said. "It's a natural for me because I've always been interested in repairing and remodeling, and I understand what good craftsmanship involves."

At the Scene Of a Crime?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE COTTLE; Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

 BODY:

Q. I recently discovered that the corporate division in which I am a manager has been engaging in practices that are at least questionable and possibly illegal. With a few discreet questions, I have learned that the vice president in charge of the division sanctions the activities and that my peers don't share my qualms. Without disclosing my reason, I have lined up a transfer out of the division, but it won't take effect for several months. In the meantime, how can I protect myself if things blow up? Should I talk to a lawyer?
 
A. "Possibly illegal" is not the same as illegal -- or even unethical. At this stage, you need more facts about the issues involved. 
 "Try to determine whether you're calling the line too close" advised James Schrager, a business ethicist and professor of strategy at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. Because you seem to be the only person who questions these activities, you may be overreacting.
To understand your company's actions -- and how or why it may be bending the rules -- talk to your peers, Mr. Schrager said. Someone may be able to explain the situation to your satisfaction. "But if you're hearing things like, 'everybody does it,' or 'they've never stopped us before,' or 'the law is poorly written,' there may be a real problem," he added.
Personally, there is good news: In most cases, you don't have much to worry about from a legal standpoint. "If an individual employee is not engaging in wrongful or criminal activity, then there isn't much likelihood of individual liability," said Philip M. Berkowitz, a management employment lawyer with Salans Hertzfeld Heilbronn Christy & Viener of New York.
But if you think you should distance yourself from your division's practices, get your objections on record, Mr. Schrager said.
Talk to your boss, but be sure to keep the conversation private and nonconfrontational. "If you make it a personal dispute between you and the boss, that doesn't do anybody any good," Mr. Berkowitz said.
As a last resort, consider talking to in-house counsel. The lawyer could not only clarify the law, but the conversation could also document your concerns. Be aware, though, that the lawyer will almost certainly tell your boss about the discussion. To avoid the appearance of going over your boss's head, you may want to ask him or her for clearance first. (Of course, even if nothing shady is going on, your boss may take offense, refuse your request or even blow up at you.)
Think twice about approaching an outside lawyer. Not only will it cost you serious money, but the lawyer also won't have a complete picture of your organization, Mr. Schrager said. And should anyone find out, your loyalty could be questioned. Besides, if the behavior you've uncovered is serious enough to merit your own legal representation, you may want to think less about protecting yourself until your transfer, and more about finding another employer altogether.

HEADLINE: In Chicago, Layers of History but Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
A TUMULTUOUS strike more than a century ago settled the question of whether the model town of Pullman -- built practically in a single stroke by George M. Pullman to house thousands of workers of the Pullman Palace Car Company -- was a new American utopia.
It wasn't. 
 Today, as a landmarked but beleaguered neighborhood on Chicago's far South Side, Pullman is struggling to define exactly what it is.
The question is more than an existential exercise, for it bears on a new effort to restore the remaining public buildings and attract the visitors -- and visitors' dollars -- needed to bolster its economy.
The critical state of affairs was underscored in December, when the main office building and an adjacent erecting shop, both abandoned, were set afire by an arsonist. The blaze ravaged the clock tower, a red-brick Victorian confection that marked Pullman's picturesque spot in an otherwise unforgiving industrial landscape along Lake Calumet, closer to Indiana than to the Loop.
Although Pullman was developed in 1880 as a self-sufficient community within the greater township of Hyde Park, it was long ago subsumed into the City of Chicago. It is now a neighborhood of roughly 35 blocks, with some 4,000 residents. Under court order, the Palace Car Company gave up its role as landlord by 1909, but its successor, Pullman-Standard, was building and refurbishing railroad cars here through the 60's.
Red-brick workers' cottages and two-story flats still line Pullman's verdant blocks in neat, tight arrays. The Hotel Florence, a rambling Queen Anne dowager, still greets visitors with a deep veranda and a tiny mountain range of gables, dormers and chimneys. The abandoned market hall is ringed by four curving colonnades that recall the loggias of Renaissance Italy.
Soaring over the town square is the steeple of the Greenstone Church, made of a stone that ranges in color from moss to lichen to jade, with stained-glass windows as delicate as doilies. The town stable, now an auto-repair shop, is still ornamented with two carved horse heads.
But the clock tower, Pullman's cynosure, is a tumbled and charred ruin whose arched windows are now empty portals to the sky.
"It's swaying in the breeze," said Keith Herron, the assistant superintendent of historic sites in the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, which owns the clock tower. The state plans to spend $2.1 million to stabilize the structure by wrapping steel bands around it and filling in the windows with wood braces to increase lateral stability.
Preservationists in Pullman are encouraged by the renewed attention that has accompanied the catastrophe. After a long spell of what seemed like official indifference, the city and state are forming a task force to chart a fresh revitalization effort.
The panel is to be headed by James R. Thompson, a former Illinois Governor whose administration bought the clock tower and hotel 10 years ago to create what Mr. Thompson called "the greatest railroad museum in America."
Although nothing came of those plans, great fires seem to have a galvanizing effect on Chicagoans.
"Isn't it sad that it has to be something tragic like this that has to be a catalyst?" asked Deborah Bellamy-Jawor, executive director of the Historic Pullman Foundation, a nonprofit group concerned with preservation, restoration, education and research. "But from now on, it's a bright future."
The Florence (named for George Pullman's daughter) was already scheduled to undergo a $1.9 million stabilization later this year. And a $200,000 renovation is under way at the market hall.
Restoring the public structures, no easy task in itself, may be the most straightforward challenge facing the task force. More vexing -- and more interesting -- is how to interpret and convey these 19th-century buildings to a 21st-century audience.
Is Pullman a monument to transportation? Certainly, the name was once synonymous with travel, since the sleeping and dining cars that emerged from Pullman's factories made long-distance train trips "comfortable, inexpensive and safe enough for the middle class," Stanley Buder wrote in "Pullman: An Experiment in Industrial Order and Community Planning" (1967).
Is it instead a monument to city planning and that long tradition of American utopianism that spawned experimental communities like New Harmony, Ind.; Columbia, Md., and, more recently, the Florida towns of Seaside and Celebration?
IS it a monument to organized labor? The 1894 strike, which grew out of the Pullman company's refusal to abate rents even as it slashed wages and jobs, was a milestone in the union movement. It reverberated nationally when it was joined by the American Railway Union under Eugene V. Debs, which refused to move trains carrying Pullman cars, prompting the Government to use Federal troops as strike breakers.
Or is Pullman a monument to civil rights? The men who tended to Pullman cars were Pullman employees (the cars were leased, not sold, to railroads) and their union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, was one of the most potent advocates in the early 20th century for the equal treatment of African-American workers.
"It is some of the richest history that we have at any site," said Mr. Herron, whose agency owns about 60 properties throughout Illinois.
Added to the historic complexity is the complicated economic and racial reality of modern Pullman, which cleaves along 111th Street into a poorer north neighborhood, largely of renters, and a more affluent -- though scarcely wealthy -- south neighborhood, where many homeowners have fixed up their properties. The districts are separated by the old Pullman works, where some residents would like to see a shopping center, while others would prefer a more purely historic restoration.
Pullman said he built the town to "exclude all baneful influences" -- taverns, brothels and labor agitators chief among them -- and to provide homes "of such character and surroundings as would prove so attractive as to cause the best class of mechanic to seek that place for employment."
His architect was Solon S. Beman, who had worked under Richard M. Upjohn of New York on the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford. The landscape designer was Nathan F. Barrett, who had laid out estates in the New York area.
"George Pullman understood the commercial value of beauty," said Michael Wolski, the foundation's tour coordinator. And properties in Pullman -- even the church, which was to be rented by different denominations -- were expected to earn a 6 percent return annually on investment.
To insure revenues, the company cut two checks for workers: one for the current amount of rent due, the other for whatever was left over in pay. Workers would endorse the rent checks back to the company at the Pullman bank.
"I have seen men with families of eight or nine children to support crying there because they only got three or four cents after paying their rent," said Thomas W. Heathcoate, a car builder, testifying in 1894 before the Federal commission investigating the strike. The United States Strike Commission concluded that "the esthetic features are admired by visitors, but have little money value to employees, especially when they lack bread."
In a blighted state by the 1960's, Pullman was relatively inexpensive. "A lot of people moved here because the housing was affordable," said John Cwenkala, who has lived in Pullman 16 years. "Pullman is one of the only communities that was really restored by blue-collar workers."
Like most of his neighbors, Mr. Cwenkala is eager to see action after decades of talk. "There has been no lack of studies," he said. "It would be nice to see something happen."

HEADLINE: Welcome to 'Stealth University';
SUNY at Farmingdale Remakes Itself and Hopes Someone Will Notice

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE

 BODY:
HAZEM TAWFIK nodded sorrowfully as he stood in the spacious white industrial laboratory he directs at the State University of New York campus at Farmingdale.
A big, genial man in love with manufacturing engineering, he has an array of high-tech toys: a laser cutting and welding machine, a stereolithography machine, even a 10-foot-high Cincinnati Milicron robot. And he has companies begging for his help in solving their manufacturing riddles. But he needs more students. 
 His program once drew 150 students a year, but now has only 25, most of them part-timers who come evenings after work. That is not enough to fill the lab or to take on all of industry's problems, so, he longs for more.
"Students in high school do not see engineering and technology as viable careers," he said. "They say: 'Why do I have to go through tough courses and study, instead of taking easy courses in business and becoming a banker and making lots of money?' "
That longing for more students is repeated across SUNY Farmingdale, a sprawling 380-acre campus on the Nassau-Suffolk border that has classrooms full of high-tech equipment and a variety of specialized laboratories but the air of a slightly scruffy, underused movie set.
The local economy is booming, and businesses, frantic for technically trained employees, are lining up to hire Farmingdale graduates. But many of the school's laboratories sit empty for much of the day. Its once-crowded parking lots are wide open. Its students occupy only four of its eight former residence halls.
On a recent afternoon, the college's state-of-the-art security imaging laboratory was empty. So were its elegant formal gardens, where purple rhododendrons and hearty yellow daffodils bloomed profusely in the chilly sunshine, and the greenhouse where banana trees were lined up waiting for balmier weather to be moved outdoors.
At the aviation center a few miles away, six or seven students huddled around a table receiving ground instruction in the late afternoon, while sleek Katana training airplanes sat lined up on the runway, their engines silent.
One exception was the dental hygiene clinic, where rows of students in blue lab coats leaned intently over real patients, picking at the tartar between their teeth. The program is the most competitive at Farmingdale; it receives around 200 applications for about 50 slots each year.
Farmingdale employees describe their college as a little-known treasure, but that has proved little consolation as they have watched enrollment slide. In the mid-1970's, Farmingdale's enrollment -- counted as the equivalent of full-time students -- was nearly 10,000. Today, it is under 4,000.
"We think we have a wonderful institution, but we are the best-kept secret on Long Island," said Tina Sneed, assistant dean for enrollment services, whose job it is to recruit more students.
She has a tough challenge. Many high school students see science and technology as too difficult. And the collapse of Long Island's defense industry that threw many engineers and technicians out of work left others skeptical that such careers are worth the effort.
"Everyone on Long Island knows an engineer who was laid off, so they are shying away from technology because they think it is cyclically unstable," said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association. She emphatically rejects that belief. Defense is cyclical, she says, not technology.
Perhaps worse, though, is that Farmingdale itself has been through so many changes in recent years that high school students and their families and guidance counselors are confused about what it offers.
"Our students used to go to Farmingdale for air-conditioning, veterinary, pre-engineering and drafting," said Felice Solomon, director of guidance for the Plainview-Old Bethpage School District. "Then Farmingdale got out of a lot of those programs."
Asked about new programs, she said, "People don't know about them, and when people don't know, they don't go."
Even students at the college are sometimes not certain about what is there. Rich Marandino, a 21-year-old senior from Massapequa, said he and a classmate in visual communications had planned to transfer to another college after two years. It was only after an interviewer at another college expressed such admiration for their Farmingdale portfolios that they decided to stay two more years.
"They were like 'Wow,' " said Mr. Marandino, who aspires to be an art director and whose spiky black hair and silver earring would make him look at home at any art school in Manhattan. "Besides, the teachers here are well connected," he added.
Farmingdale's need to clarify its identity concerns Peter D. Salins, SUNY's provost, who says the former two-year agriculture and technical school has a way to go before it feels like a full four-year college.
"There is still a huge credibility gap," he said. "They have to convince the Long Island community -- students and their parents -- that they are a more advanced institution than they've been perceived as. For the perceptions to change, the substance has to change; it is a bit of the chicken and the egg."
Farmingdale officials are trying to burnish the college's image now that their decadelong struggle to transform the campus is finally falling into place.
"We're close," said Frank A. Cipriani, Farmingdale's president of 21 years, who is on administrative leave developing a fund-raising campaign. "The pieces are almost all in place. I can't produce enough graduates to satisfy the demand. What we have to do now is attract enough students who can benefit."
Although still not complete, changes are visible on several fronts:
* Farmingdale officials say their enrollment slide appears to have ended. Applications this spring have been relatively flat, a disappointment compared with the 15 percent surge at SUNY's Old Westbury campus and the 3 percent gain at Stony Brook, but a relief after the declines in recent years. And the college is beginning more aggressive recruiting efforts, including an open house this weekend -- its first in years.
* The college is accelerating its transformation into a four-year college. Although students have been able to transfer into its handful of bachelor's degree programs for several years, it accepting freshmen directly into four-year degree programs only last fall. So far this spring, 572 students have applied to its bachelor's degree programs, up from 298 at this time last year.
* SUNY has provided additional financing for some specialized programs like aviation, which allowed Farmingdale to lease new planes and provide more flying time for student pilots. A picture of the new planes in the SUNY admissions brochure helped draw more students and build its program. "Two years ago, we had no dispatcher and no mechanics and I was putting the oil in all the airplanes," said Stephen Campbell, the college's chief pilot. "Now we have two dispatchers and a mechanic and an assistant."
* The college is teaming up with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and SUNY Stony Brook to build a business incubator for biotechnology startup companies at one edge of Farmingdale's campus. New York State is putting up $15 million to finance the bioscience park, which is expected to provide research opportunities and jobs for Farmingdale students and faculty.
"We're making a lot of progress, but people don't know it yet," said Frank Pellegrini, chairman of Farmingdale's chemistry department and of its faculty and staff planning committee. "I've been here for 30 years, and the cows and pigs haven't been here for 20 of them," he added.
SUNY officials in Albany say they, too, are encouraged that Farmingdale appears to be heading in the right direction after years in limbo. As part of their new campus-by-campus "mission review" procedure, they recently examined the college's strategic plan and indicated their satisfaction, although they have not yet given their formal approval.
"Farmingdale has huge potential," Dr. Salins said. "Even though they are still predominantly a two-year institution, they've increasingly gotten four-year degrees, and that's the future."
But he is pressing for even greater change. He has asked Farmingdale to continue to raise its admissions requirements and to institute tougher hiring and promotion criteria for its faculty, many of whom do not have doctorates.
"If you are going to be a baccalaureate institution, you have to have commensurate faculty," he said.
Farmingdale has already come a long way from its creation in 1912 amid Long Island's potato farms as a four-year agricultural institute with a dual mission: to educate students and to support Long Island's economy.
For decades, it trained farmers and nurserymen and developed products like the Farmingdale grass seed, which was designed to withstand the fungus attacking Long Island's suburban lawns. In the 1940's, it began to train workers for Long Island's burgeoning defense industry.
At first it was free; now tuition is $3,200 a year for two-year degree students and $3,400 a year for bachelor's degree students.
Dr. Cipriani recalls that when he first arrived in 1964, a constant stream of yellow school buses brought 50,000 school children to see the college's cows and pigs.
But as the baby boom filled all available classrooms in the 1970's, Farmingdale departed from its traditional mission, offering more liberal arts programs.
"We were playing the role of a third community college," said Michael J. Vinciguerra, Farmingdale's provost and acting president. "We lost a little of our shape and focus."
It worked for a while. But when the baby boom ended, student enrollment slid. Then came the end of the Reagan defense buildup. That sent Long Island's economy reeling and, combined with the recession of the early 1990's, cut sharply into employment. The demand for Farmingdale's technical graduates fell and so did applications.
"The economy didn't turn up for a very long time," said Dr. Kamer. of the Long Island Association. "It was really a slow recovery until the last two years."
As Farmingdale tried to refocus, it decided that students needed broader training than was possible in four years. In 1985, it won permission to offer baccalaureate-level courses alongside its two-year associate's-degree programs, and added bachelor's-degree programs in electrical engineering technology and manufacturing enegineering technology. And in 1987, it graduated its last class of agriculture majors.
But as it gave up popular two-year programs like mortuary science and early childhood education in preparation for adding four-year programs, fewer and fewer students came. The campus struggled along, deferring maintenance and cutting faculty and staff to save money.
"Ten years ago, the faculty weren't sure where we were or where we were going," said Margaret Porciello, chairwoman of Farmingdale's business and computer systems department.
It was not until 1993 that the school won the Regents' permission to become a four-year college, and the shift to four-year status has not been entirely smooth. One problem, Farmingdale officials say, was that to become a four-year college, they had to promise not to add programs offered at nearby colleges.
That proved a high price, as Farmingdale found itself limited in what it could add. Although it introduced four-year degrees in areas like aviation administration and communications, other fields like business seemed to be out.
"We were Stealth University," said Dr. Vinciguerra. "Because of those restrictions, we were hiding programs and nobody could find them." With SUNY's top administrators supporting the college's expansion now, he said, "we don't have to hide it."
The transition is still under way. Farmingdale has plans to add nearly a dozen four-year degree programs in the next few years, including forensic science, environmental engineering technology and health information systems. Farmingdale officials believe they have the backing of SUNY administrators to add them, but each program has its own complications.
In dental hygiene, for example, Judith Friedman, the department's chairwoman, said a four-year program makes sense because it will prepare students for a wider range of jobs in research, industry and consulting.
"But four years would be a very big change for students to accept right now," she said, "so we will have to work our way in gradually."
The visual communications department is also edging toward a four-year program. Currently, students enroll in the two-year associate's degree program and then reapply for admission to the upper-class program or enter as transfer students.
"Two years is really not enough," said Wayne Krush, a professor in the art department. "Students need the four years to get experience."
The department provides that experience through an "in-house agency" class where seniors design ad campaigns, Web sites and other projects for real not-for-profit clients. Clients this year include the American Heart Association, the Heckscher Museum of Art and SUNY Farmingdale itself.
Offering four-year degree programs, however, will not necessarily bring in as many students as the college wants. So John I. Kostanoski, who directs a bachelor's-degree program in security systems "to train the new breed of security director who understands security technologies," put his program on the Internet. Although it was introduced only last year, it already has 48 full-time students on campus and another 11 on line.
Creating more four-year programs is not the only challenge. Dr. Cipriani, Farmingdale's president, said he is trying to design a fund-raising campaign because the college must raise more private money. Farmingdale's endowment is only about $500,000 and the college brings in less than $750,000 a year in private money.
"With the cutbacks in state support, it is incumbent on presidents to see if they can cushion that gap," he said.
The college is also trying to expand student recruitment, introducing techniques many other colleges already use. It is using Internet applications and has begun to have its students visit high schools. It has begun to offer on-site admissions at community colleges to draw more transfer students, and it is holding the open house this weekend. . Next year, admissions officers wants to meet earlier with high school counselors and to offer more on-campus activities to show off the college.
"We feel our students and their parents need to have a sense of what we really are all about," said Ms. Sneed, the assistant dean for enrollment services.
Farmingdale's changes are a central theme in its admissions video. "A Farmingdale education isn't the same as it was five years ago," it proclaims. "We've changed because the world has changed."
The college is also seeking outside advice. Last month, Dr. Vinciguerra huddled with a representative from Noel-Levitz, a consulting firm that advises colleges on student recruitment, to see what else Farmingdale might do. He said the consultant was "surprised at the clarity of our vision, but said we have to project it better.
"We have a super story to tell," Dr. Vinciguerra said. "I love this place; I really believe in this place. I think we have really found a good path to the future."
He predicts that Long Island's vigorous economy and population growth will also help.
Whether Farmingdale can finally complete its transition will become clear in the next few years. In Dr. Salins's view, the college is poised to make the jump.
"It's like a Nintendo game," he said. "They have to leap across a chasm. If they make it to the other side, they will be home free and everything will be great. If not, they will languish. But the leap is scary."

HEADLINE: Turning On the Lights Downtown;
More Cities Are Banking on Live Theater (and Places to Eat) Being the Switch

BYLINE: By LEONARD FELSON 

 BODY:
AS Connecticut's cities search for ways to recapture the luster they once possessed, theaters and performing arts centers are increasingly playing a supporting role in those urban revitalization dramas.
In June, The Bushnell in Hartford will break ground on an 88,000-square-foot $30 million addition, giving the 69-year-old 2,800-seat landmark a modern 950-seat auditorium for smaller productions. 
 In New Haven, an extensive renovation of the Shubert Performing Arts Center two years ago has allowed the 85-year-old theater to return to its roots as a showcase for pre-Broadway tryouts and other world premieres. And in Stamford, modernization of the Palace Theater, built in 1927 as a vaudeville and movie house, has already enabled the theater to bring major Broadway productions to the city.
In all three cities, the expansion and renovation work has been accomplished with financial help from private donors, corporations and the state, which has approved millions of dollars in aid. Beyond the obvious benefit to the theaters, city, state and corporate leaders have supported the projects because they believe the arts can serve as an economic catalyst to bring new life to urban centers.
"The arts enrich our communities, and they are helping to create tourism and entertainment districts in many of our urban areas," said Gov. John G. Rowland. "Community theaters, museums and galleries all help bring people downtown. And the arts are helping to spur economic development by enhancing the quality of life in cities and towns throughout Connecticut."
In return, theater operators say many restoration projects would not have occurred without support from Hartford. "We're delighted we have a governor and legislature who both recognize the value of cultural assets to economic development," said John Hiddlestone, operations director for the Stamford Center for the Arts, and the man in charge of the Palace Theater improvement project.
Indeed, other cities across the state also have theater renovation projects, most with state financial support. Among them are the following.
* The Garde Arts Center in New London is in the midst of a $15.7 million renovation that not only includes the former movie theater (built in 1926) but also two blocks on State Street, designed to redefine the downtown area and connect people to the heart of the city.
* The Warner Theater in Torrington is restoring the Art Deco theater (built in 1931). The $12 million public/private partnership aims to create an anchor downtown as well as a cultural and entertainment draw for northwestern Connecticut.
* In Bridgeport, the Polka Dot Playhouse, with a $2 million grant from the State Bond Commission, is converting a former bank building into its new home. The Klein Auditorium, also in Bridgeport, is using a $2.5 million grant to renovate.
* The former Colonial Theater in Hartford received $5 million in state aid to help redevelop the theater and create new retail space in the city's West End.
Though officials of most of the theaters being renovated say work needs to be done to modernize bathrooms, enlarge lobbies and update electrical, heating and cooling systems, the work will also open the theaters to many more groups, whether community companies or touring shows. That in turn translates into opportunities to draw more and varied audiences, which also means more activity on the streets of the state's cities.
"Just look at the newest performing arts center to come on line in Newark," said Arnold C. Greenberg, president of The Bushnell's board of directors. "It's created crowds and energy. It brings people downtown, which is good for the city's image and for restaurants."
Renovating or expanding performing arts centers is more than good for the arts organizations and theaters across the state, he said. Economically, for example, The Bushnell's addition will create 150 to 200 construction jobs, and once built, 100 new theater employees will be hired.
More importantly, said Mr. Greenberg, the sight of construction cranes ought to provide a psychological boost to Hartford, which for most of the 90's has seen few new construction projects get off the drawing boards. The new theater is scheduled to open in the fall of 2001.
When open, Mr. Greenberg said, he expects increased activity at restaurants near The Bushnell, including new ones that may open as a result of the added venue, and he said it is possible that a vibrant street life of eateries, cafes and boutiques could develop along Capitol Avenue between The Bushnell and downtown Main Street. In fact, with plans to create new housing developments on surface parking lots near The Bushnell, coupled with plans to create a $1.3 billion riverfront development known as Adriaen's Landing, Mr. Greenberg said, "it's not fanciful to imagine a marvelous boulevard from the State Capitol to the Connecticut River -- and The Bushnell will spark the new activity."
The renovation of the Shubert in New Haven, which helped turn it into a pre-Broadway house again, has similarly boosted economic activity in that city. The recent pre-Broadway production of "The Civil War," for example, brought 28,000 people downtown to see the show.
"For two months, 150 to 200 people from the show lived in our hotels, bought three meals a day, and left a lot of money in the city," said Caroline Werth, the Shubert's president and chief executive officer.
Besides attracting producers, actors and theatergoers from New York, the new Shubert is also drawing 30 percent of its audience from Fairfield County, Ms. Werth said, many of whom had never been to the theater before. "They're discovering that it's the same ride from Greenwich to New Haven as it is to Manhattan," she said, "except it's much less expensive."
At the Long Wharf Theater, not far away in New Haven, the managing director, Michael Ross, agreed that the theater could have a strong impact on a city's economic impact. "We've run the numbers on what we bring to the community," he said. "On any given night if both our venues at the Long Wharf are operating" -- a capacity of 700 people -- "63 percent of the people go to a restaurant in the area, and 89 percent go to a restaurant in New Haven. On average they spend $25 to $35 per person."
Though the Long Wharf, built in 1965, isn't being renovated, it expects to benefit from a proposed shopping mall next door, a 1.3-million square-foot complex called the New Haven Galleria at Long Wharf. The mall, which still has several legal and permit hurdles to overcome, is anticipated to draw one million shoppers a year. Mr. Ross said the mall developers have already agreed to work with the theater and the arts community to promote events.
Officials say the arts have played a key role in Stamford's effort to recapture a vibrancy downtown. Among the improvements to the 1,584-seat Palace, bought in 1989 by the Stamford Center of the Arts, was the enlargement of the stage and the addition of dressing rooms to accommodate large-scale productions. Improvements continue, including the construction of a new lobby and a 195-seat basement auditorium, but since the Palace reopened for large-scale musicals, Stamford has witnessed a burst of night life.
"This was a city in which the streets went totally dead at 6 o'clock," said Mr. Hiddlestone. "Gradually that's changed. Now there are nightclubs, bars and lots of restaurants, and though the theaters aren't the only cause of that change, they certainly help bring people out on the street," he added.
The ability to present Broadway productions in Connecticut theaters has also contributed to what economists call "reverse tourism," the environment that allows the state to keep residents' spending power within the state.
"A growing number of people can see entertainment in Stamford that they used to have to go to New York for," said Mr. Hiddlestone. "Obviously, it's a different experience than being in New York, but at least it's here on the doorstep," he said, noting the recent production of "Peter Pan" at the Palace, which went on to Broadway. "It was the same cast, the same production," he said.
Farther northeast along the shoreline, in New London, the Garde may be the model of how smaller cities can leverage the arts to rebuild a sense of community. "Our strategic vision is all about that reconnection," said Steve Segal, the theater's managing director.
"The programming is not necessarily about what happens on stage," he said. "In an urban setting, you have to also look outside the perimeters of the theater." Toward that goal, the Garde has bought key pieces of the State Street block to help lure people downtown and to ease their fears that the city is a dangerous place, Mr. Segal said.
"We like to think of ourselves as the grand lobby of the heart and soul of the city marketplace," Mr. Segal said. "Out of those interactions, other things happen. The waterfront gets developed. New restaurants open. And new partnerships -- educational, cultural or residential -- can start to bloom."

A $9-Million Expansion for Norwalk's Aquarium

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
A $9-MILLION expansion of the $30-million Maritime Aquarium now under way in South Norwalk is the most dramatic of a number of changes in progress or planned in a formerly rundown area that has sought a new identity in recent years.
Other developments include the purchase of a large amount of commercial and residential space along Washington and South Main Streets, the heart of the neighborhood, by a national developer that specializes in upscale urban areas.. 
 The aquarium expansion, which is scheduled to open in the summer of 2000 as an educational center, will be housed next door to the existing aquarium on North Water Street in the former Hatch & Bailey Lumber Company building. The 35,000-square-foot brick structure has been vacant since the aquarium opened in 1983.
Next month, workmen will begin shoring up the 19th-century structural members preparatory to renovating the interior and attaching the building to the aquarium.
Reconfigured out of a 100,000-square-foot 19th-century iron works on the west bank of the Norwalk River, the aquarium is considered a key element in the city's revival. Record crowds in the last three years, including more than 607,000 visitors paying $6.8 million in admission fees last year, made acquisition of more space crucial.
Almost all of the $9 million has been raised, according to David Sigworth, spokesman for the aquarium, "but some of it is in pledges coming to us over the next 10 years." To fill the gap, the aquarium has asked the city, which owns the land and buildings, to establish a $3.5 million line of credit.
Among the largest contributions to the project are $2.4 million from the state's Department of Economic and Community Development and $700,000 each from William Ziegler, an aquarium trustee; Newman's Own, Paul Newman's charitable foundation, and the Kresge Foundation, of Troy, Mich.
Coincident with the expansion of the aquarium, Starwood Investments L.L.C. of Washington, D.C., has begun cleaning up the exteriors of scattered properties that it acquired last November around the corner on Washington Street and South Main Street..
The company spent $7.5 million on 95,293 square feet spread through 31 ground-floor commercial condominium units in 16 buildings, and five entire buildings.
The shops, restaurants, offices and residential condominiums converted in the early 80's from dilapidated 19th-century buildings transformed the neighborhood from a slum into a stylish urban enclave now on the National Register of Historic Places. It was the first step in rescuing South Norwalk from oblivion.
Herbert Newman, head of Herbert Newman & Partners, New Haven architects, is the architect and planner for the aquarium's long-range expansion, which, he said, "could stretch over the next five to 15 years." Mr. Newman is a former professor at the Yale School of Architecture, where he is now critic of architectural design.
"The Hatch & Bailey building will retain its character," said Mr. Newman, "as an old building with interior walls of exposed brick and exposed wooden trusses, typical of mill buildings of the 1800s, juxtaposed with elevators, stairways, classrooms, conference rooms, research facilities, a kitchen, dining area and gift shop."
A new entrance will be installed on its north side, serving as a main entrance to the aquarium as well, until the existing main entrance on North Water Street is altered in the next expansion phase.
THE aquarium, the Hatch & Bailey Building and the land are part of a city-owned tract called Reed-Putnam, named for two nearby streets. It runs along the river from the aquarium to Interstate 95.
Plans approved by the city last year would join South Norwalk to downtown Norwalk by building a linear park along the river, enabling visitors to walk a half mile from the aquarium to the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum on West Avenue.
A new Stepping Stones Museum for Children, which is under construction on the grounds of the mansion for a fall opening, will have one permanent exhibit and several changing exhibits year-round, as well as many hands-on activities.
Reed-Putnam plans also include a major hotel and residential project just north of the aquarium, an office complex near the highway and the demolition of the 100,000-square-foot Lock Building opposite the aquarium, to make way for a much needed 600-car parking garage.
Erected in sections from the 1870's to the 1940's and listed on the Connecticut Register of Historic Places, the building, where locks were once manufactured, "is full of asbestos and the soil is contaminated with arsenic," said Edward Musante, executive director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency. The building, owned by Michael di Scala, a local real estate developer and the Gardella family of Norwalk, is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
"The city has said it wanted to tear it down since 1983," said Mr. Gardella, "making it very difficult to rent." Only 25 percent is occupied by about 40 artists working in 16 leased spaces, and some warehousing and small manufacturing.
The city had named Clay Fowler, head of Spinnaker Management, a Stamford developer, to demolish the building, build the garage and develop a mixed-use residential/store complex on the aquarium's 126-space parking lot on North Water Street.
The artists responded by forming the Historic Lock Building Association, an advocacy group organized to save the building. Substantial public and some official support has persuaded the city to relent until appropriate studies can be produced.
"If it's feasible to provide parking for the aquarium without tearing down the Lock Building I would prefer it," said Peter Nolin, Common Council President.
C. William Kraus, vice president of the association, has been working with Artspace Projects, of Minneapolis, toward that end. "We want to develop the building as a regional attraction, with gallery space, sculpture gardens, artists' lofts and living space," he said.
Artspace, a nonprofit developer of space for artists, estimates that, at a cost of $13 million, the building would yield about 50 artists' live-work spaces of 1,000 to 2,000 square feet, with ground-floor parking in an existing garage on the ground floor.
"We work primarily in historic districts," said Chris Velasco, Artspace manager, "converting warehouses, hotels, schools that people don't know what to do with." Funded by the Ford Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, corporate foundations, grants and Federal historic-preservation tax credits, Artspace has been buying and renovating disused buildings since 1979 and renting them out to artists at affordable rates. It administers a $60-million portfolio.
To satisfy the aquarium's need for parking, Artspace retained TAMS Consultants, of Boston, parking engineers who designed the new garage at Logan International Airport, to devise an alternative to the Lock Building. Later this month TAMS is expected to present to Norwalk officials a plan for a 600-space garage on the parking lot.
BUT according to Mr. Musante, whose agency must approve Reed-Putnam projects, the city already considered and rejected that idea. "The economics work out better if the land value of the surface lot could be used to subsidize the cost of public parking at the Lock Building site," he said, "by developing the surface lot for mixed use."
While the aquarium is just a few steps from Washington Street, the anticipated synergy between the two has not materialized. Most aquarium visitors are families with children who tend to bypass shopping and restaurant meals.
Another disappointment is the unsavory after-dark reputation that has settled on the street due to an inordinate number of bars and nightclubs that filled many recession-generated vacancies.
Complaints from visitors and apartment residents about drunk and disorderly bar patrons, panhandlers, and deafening rock music have reached a point where the Planning and Zoning Commission is expected to hold a public hearing at its May 19 meeting on modifying its regulations. A proposed amendment would prohibit new bars from opening on Washington Street and adjoining portions of South Main Street. Existing bars would not be affected, but those that convert to other uses would not be permitted to revert back to bars.
In spite of these concerns, the neighborhood is exactly what Starwood Urban looks for nationwide -- undervalued urban real estate, focusing on mixed-use holdings with a strong retail component.
"We like the eclectic nature of the place," said Robert S. Wennett, president of Starwood Urban. "Washington Street attracted us because it has more of an urban feel than the upscale villagey atmosphere of Westport or Greenwich." Among its acquisitions are spaces containing the Sassafras gift shop, Molly Brody's antiques, Beadworks, And & Company upscale clothing and household accessories, and several restaurants including Donovan's, Pasta Nostra, Amberjacks, Porterhouse, and Cote d'Azur.
Starwood Urban is a retail venture of Starwood Capital Group L.L.C. of Greenwich and Wennett Urban Retail of Washington D.C. Starwood Capital also controls Starwood Hotels & Resorts and Starwood Financial Trust. The South Norwalk acquisitions were purchased from numerous owners including Patriot Properties L.L.C. and Scirocco Partners, and from institutions that had foreclosed on some properties.
"There have been too many absentee landlords," said Mr. Wennett, "no single owner to control space and make a difference. Individual owners get whoever will pay the most rent, whereas we seek out tenants for a specific market. It is not our goal to fill up with national tenants. We plan to be very hands-on owners, working with tenants and shifting away from the overemphasis on nightclubs."

I-95's Exit 8AIs a Magnet To High-Tech Warehouses

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: CRANBURY TOWNSHIP, N.J.

 BODY:
THE Graybar Electric company is starting up a distribution center here whose managers promise overnight delivery of electrical parts as far away as Boston or the suburbs of Washington. "If someone orders by 5 P.M., we'll have it on their loading dock before they open up the next morning," said Paul J. Milata, Graybar's regional manager here.
He can make that promise because he is managing a new building that is installing the latest equipment. But another important factor is the location of the building in Cranbury Business Park, about two miles from Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike. 
 Not only is the site, about 60 miles southwest of New York City, midway between New York and Philadelphia, but it is almost equidistant from Boston and Washington. It is also an overnight ride west to important industrial centers in Pennsylvania and Ohio or east to the consumer markets of Long Island.
Because there is very little housing in the area, trucks have largely unimpeded access over local roads to the Turnpike, part of Interstate Route 95, which connects with the national highway system.
These are among the reasons that the area off Exit 8A has become one of the East Coast's prime centers for warehousing and distribution. Real estate executives estimate that there are 35 million square feet of industrial space within a few miles of the exit, most of it built over the last 10 years.
The area is so identified with warehousing and distribution that one developer, Kerzner Associates, named its project Eight A Corporate Park.
According to a year-end report by Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services company, buildings in the 8A area accounted for 54 percent of the 2.6 million square feet of industrial construction in the northern and central parts of the state last year. Little building is going on now -- about 54,000 square feet -- but brokers and real estate executives say many applications are awaiting approvals and add that they expect further speculative construction to begin as the existing space fills up.
"This is a market that has always had speculative construction," said Michael Nachamkin, a vice president of Prologis Trust, a real estate investment trust that bills itself as as much an expert in global logistics as a real estate owner. "You need to have an inventory of space for your national customers," added Lisa R. Clark, a marketing executive with Prologis. She explained that companies operating on a national scale want distribution facilities ready when they decide to enter markets, without the delays involved in securing permits and construction.
A flurry of leasing in the first quarter of this year took 1.35 million square feet of space off the market in the 8A corridor, according to Cushman & Wakefield. In the largest single deal, Home Depot, a household products retailer, leased an entire 812,739-square-foot warehouse in Cranbury. Caliber Logistics took 150,000 square feet at 24 Charles Court in South Brunswick.
"This is an active market," said Paul D. Cohen, executive vice president of SBWE, a real estate services company based in New Jersey. "The inventory builds up for a while and then it gets leased."
"Exit 8A is the northernmost spot on the Turnpike with land available," said Jonathan B. Tesser, director of leasing for Matrix Development Group, one of the pioneer developers in the area. "Every time rents start to creep up, people start building on spec again."
Rents are modest compared to office space, but given the size of the buildings, can add up to a hefty annual total. For example, Building Two in Cranbury Business Park has 151,200 rentable square feet. Brokers say modern warehouse space typically rents for $4.25 to $4.75 a square foot annually, with older buildings ranging from $3.75 to $4.25 a square foot. But brokers reported that some owners have been bumping up asking rents for the most modern and best located buildings to the $5.10 to $5.25 a foot range in recent weeks.
Mr. Tesser estimated there is land near the exit for an additional 15 million to 20 million square feet of development. This land, which is, in effect, being warehoused for warehouses, has produced an interesting phenomenon: actively farmed fields running up to the edge of industrial parks. "I've got a spinach field on the east side of the plant, corn on the other and winter wheat in the back," said Mr. Milata of Graybar.
The continuing agricultural activity notwithstanding, real estate executives say almost all of the land is available for development when needed. "The owners keep it planted, but all of it is under contract or option for development," said Lou Belfer, a senior vice president of SBWE.
Real estate executives say the 8A market developed the way it did because the large blocks of land suddenly became easily accessible to the Turnpike when the exit was built in 1966. The highway was widened in the late 1980's, providing separate car and truck lanes down to 8A.
"Exit 8A was an afterthought," said Mr. Cohen, noting that it is almost midway in the 17 miles between Exits 8 and 9, which were part of the original layout of the highway, which was built in the early 1950's.
"Development started here around 1982, but there really wasn't mass development until 1985," Mr. Cohen said. He said development continued actively until 1991, when a recession in the real estate business brought everything to a halt. Activity resumed in 1995, he said, with existing property being absorbed, and then new construction began.
Most of the early building in the area was done by local developers such as Matrix, Frank A. Greek and Son and I. Heller. But in recent years, the real estate investment trusts have become a factor, with Prologis and Trammell Crow entering the market and Reckson Associates Realty Corporation combining with the local Morris Companies.
Matrix took over the old Phelps Dodgebuilding, a dark, brooding structure long familiar to motorists on the Turnpike. It changed the appearance of the 650,000-square-foot structure by lightening the color of the walls. Matrix added 550,000 square feet of space to what is now called 200 Docks Corner Road and recently finished leasing it all to tenants that include Barnes & Noble and Cooper Tire.
The Graybar operation is in a building built and owned by Prologis Trust, formerly Security Capital Industrial Trust, which claims to be the largest owner of warehouse-distribution space in the country, with 166 million square feet. Like the other buildings in Cranbury Business Park, this one is tall enough so goods can be stacked 32 feet high, and it has an advanced fire suppression system, an ultraflat floor and broad areas outside the building for trucks to maneuver.
Brokers and other real estate executives say a building of this sort represents the current state of the art and renders obsolete buildings put into operation less than a decade ago. Advances in forklift truck technology have allowed goods to be stacked higher in the steel racks that fill most warehouses.
Higher stacking is more economical for distributors because it allows more goods to be stored on the same piece of land. "Ten years ago 24-foot clear was state of the art," said Mr. Nachamkin, referring to the vertical distance between the floor and the trusses that support the roof. "Today 32 feet is standard," he said, noting that some buildings have 36 feet of stacking space.
"You can get one-third to one-half more product in a building with 36-foot clear height than 24 feet," said Benjamin Katz, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG, the real-estate services company.
"There is a trend toward fewer but bigger boxes in the warehouse business," said Stanley Danzig, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield. "But only about 10 percent of the product at 8A has ceiling heights over 32 feet." However, he pointed out that not every business needs the greatest height. "Some people don't need 32 feet," he said. Those older facilities, he said, will be leased at lesser rents than the new tall buildings can command.
Although the economics of higher stacking are generally favorable, the technique has imposed some additional demands on builders. One is for floors that are really, really flat.
Even a minor variation in floor flatness can be a problem when hoisting pallets of goods over 30 feet and trying to fit them into closely packed racks. One Prologis estimate is that one millimeter of variation at floor level can result in a load being as much as 12 inches out of line at the top shelf of a rack.
"Above 30 feet, you will have things dropping through or they simply won't go into the rack,"' said William L. Mascharka, president of Frazier Industrial Company, a major manufacturer of racks based in Long Valley, N.J.
So builders are using laser-guided devices known as screeds to produce flat, smooth floors that resemble ice skating rinks. And the concrete is compounded with a chemical additive that makes the floor smoother as it is cleaned.
In the Graybar distribution center, a line of grout patching compound runs down the center of each aisle of racks. The ground conceals a wire that sends signals to a device on a forklift truck to keep it squarely in the center of the aisle, so all the driver has to think about is forward and back and up and down motion.
Keeping the forklift in the precisely right position allows narrow aisles and the ability to pack goods in more closely. Because of the sensor system, a forklift measuring 76 inches wide operates in an aisle of just 84 inches. Because the truck cannot turn in such a narrow space, the building is equipped with forklifts whose lifting masts pivot to insert and remove pallet loads of electrical equipment.
IT costs on the order of $800,000 to $1 million to equip a 200,000-square-foot warehouse with racks, industry executives say. Narrow aisle fork trucks with pivoting masts cost approximately $50,000 apiece and a warehouse would need four to six depending on how fast goods move in and out. Several less sophisticated fork trucks to load and unload trailers at the dock would also be needed at $15,000 to $20,000 each.
Fire suppression is another issue in high-rise warehouses. In the past, most fire codes required the installation of sprinklers in the rack system itself, which was expensive to install and often had to be modified if the products being stored changed.
But in recent years the development of the early-suppression, fast-response sprinkler system has permitted the development of warehouses as high as 35 feet of clear height, without sprinklers in the racks. Instead, the sprinklers are mounted under the roof and use a high-pressure pump and more sensitive sprinkler heads to dump a large quantity of water early in the life of a fire. Sprinkler head technology currently undergoing testing may permit 40-foot clear heights in new construction.
The availability of land in the 8A area allows developers to provide accommodations for trucks, which have grown larger over recent years and have trouble turning around and maneuvering in more crowded urban areas.
"We are building larger truck courts for trucks that are 53 feet long now compared to 40 feet a few years ago," Mr. Nachamkin said. "They are taller too, at 110 inches from 96 inches."
"With these larger spaces the trucks don't have to back in nine times to get in the right position," Mr. Katz said.
Although warehouses are places to store things, many companies do not want to store them very long. With just-in-time manufacturing operations becoming common in American industry, many companies want more frequent deliveries of smaller amounts of material so it can be used as it arrives, rather than go into storage at the factory.
Companies like Prologis are constructing buildings with truck loading doors on both sides of the building, so material can flow through the building from suppliers to customer.
With two sets of doors, material can be received on one side and shipped out the other simultaneously.
The lack of a big population in much of the area off Exit 8A means that companies can operate at all hours without complaints about noise from the neighbors. "Home Depot supplies its stores overnight," said Robert Sager, a managing director at Insignia/ESG. "In an industrial park, they can operate any hours they want without getting residential complaints."
Real Estate executives say the three main towns in the area, Cranbury, South Brunswick and Monroe Township, have had varying attitudes toward development.
"At first Cranbury was against development, so the early projects were in Monroe and South Brunswick,"' Mr. Cohen said. "But then taxes in Cranbury started going through the roof, and coming out of the recession they changed their master plan and accepted development."
Mr. Tesser of Matrix Development said that "20 years ago Cranbury was the most difficult to deal with."
"Now," he said, "Cranbury has most of the available land and is into development."

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT;
For Newark Council Members, African Trip Draws Criticism

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
In a publicly financed show of sibling amity, members of the Newark City Council are planning a two-week trip to the Republic of Ghana later this month.
Several thousand Ghanaians make their home in Newark, and the city has established official ties, through Sister Cities International, a nonprofit group based in Washington, with two cities of the West African nation, Kumasi and Cape Coast. 
 Donald Tucker, Bessie Walker and Gayle Chaneyfield-Jenkins, the Council members planning to make the trip with at least three other people from May 8 to 22, will be able to speak English, Ghana's official language, while meeting with Ghanaian officials and business people and passing out T-shirts and pencils to local schoolchildren. The delegation will also attend the African-African American Summit in Accra, the country's capital, on the last week of the trip.
But official travel has become virtually synonymous with bureaucratic excess in Newark, where the Council and the Board of Education -- before a state takeover of the school district in 1995 -- have been criticized for indulging in junkets at the expense of taxpayers hard pressed to pay for basic services.
Councilman Tucker, who visited Ghana in 1995 to establish the Sister Cities link, said in a brief telephone interview that the relationship, including the May trip, afforded an opportunity for cultural, educational and business exchanges. "They sell Ghanaian products, and we buy Ghanaian products," Mr. Tucker said.
Others agreed, at least in principle. "Oftentimes, when you get the relationship, you're surprised at the kind of business opportunities you have," said Gerald Janssen, senior vice president of the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, who accompanied Governor Whitman and other political and business leaders on a trade mission to South America last month.
Mr. Tucker said that three Ghanaian delegations had visited Newark to promote the country's mahogany exports. But Mr. Tucker could not say whether any deals had resulted, nor could he provide specifics of any other business or cultural exchanges, and he did not return repeated follow-up calls.
Ms. Walker and Ms. Chaneyfield-Jenkins, as well as City Clerk Robert P. Morasco and staff members in his office, all failed to return calls or provide copies of an itinerary or the Council resolution authorizing the trip. A spokeswoman for the Council, Geraldine Clark, said she was not at liberty to talk about it. A spokeswoman for Mayor Sharpe James, Pam Goldstein, said the Mayor thought the trip was a waste of money, and said she had no further information.
The silence from City Hall contrasts with the clamor of criticism from other members of the Council and some Ghanaians in Newark. Cory Booker, the newest member of the Council, said he had been told that the trip would cost the city $36,000, for airfare, hotels, goodwill gifts and other costs, not including the "hundreds of hours" he said City Hall employees had put into its planning.
Mr. Booker, who joined Councilman Augusto Amador in voting against the trip, said the Sister Cities relationship may have value, but he failed to see the need for a visit by Council members, particularly when the goals of the trip were not clearly defined. "I don't know what they're expecting to come from this trip," he said.
Mr. Booker also criticized the Council's decision, which he said was proposed by Mr. Tucker, to spend $7,000 to take along Leonard Jeffries Jr., a professor at the City University of New York who stirred controversy nine years ago when he said, among other things, that Jews had dominated the slave trade. Dr. Jeffries, a native of Newark who has traveled in Ghana, did not return messages left at his office.
Newark is hardly the only city where such trips have been criticized, justly or otherwise. "There have been criticisms that Sister Cities have been a waste of municipal money," said Alexander Gorev, an official of Sister Cities International in Washington, who said he was unaware of the Newark trip. But in the vast majority of cases, Mr. Gorev said, "this is certainly a misperception."
Atta Boamah, a native of Kumasi who moved to Newark in 1988 and sits on the executive board of the Ghanaian Society of New Jersey, said Mr. Tucker was bringing Dr. Jeffries because they were personal friends and had been named honorary chiefs by villages in Ghana. But if there is to be a trip to Ghana, he said, then one of Newark's 3,000 to 4,000 Ghanaian residents should act as a guide, not Dr. Jeffries.
Mr. Boamah, a South Ward district leader and a political opponent of Mr. Tucker, said he had a theory about why he and other local Ghanaians have been excluded from any planning or information about the trip. "I believe there will be a business deal," he said. "That's why none of us were informed."
Even more fundamentally, he said, many of his fellow expatriates are unhappy about Newark's having close ties with what he considers his homeland's oppressive regime. "We're fed up with the government," he said.

New Library Chief

BYLINE: By F. ROMALL SMALLS 

 BODY:
After nearly a year's search, the Mount Vernon Public Library has hired Rolly (Rodney) J. Lee as director of the 103-year-old institution, which serves as the central library for the Westchester Library System.
Mr. Lee is the former executive director and chief executive officer of the library system in Gary, Ind., with a population of 150,000 and six branch sites with more than a million books. 
 "The library continues the educational process where the schools leave off," Mr. Lee said. "We are in an age of information. The library is the hub by which all information is assembled and disseminated under one rubric. There is no other source in society that delivers free information, regardless of one's socio-economic status."
Mr. Lee has hired an assistant director and obtained funds from state and Federal agencies, corporations and foundations to augment the library's $2.8 million budget.
He also wants to end a contract dispute between the 60 full-time and part-time employees and the library's administration and work more closely with the public schools as well as to upgrade technology in the library, which has nearly 500,000 books. It is one the largest libraries in the State. F. ROMALL SMALLS

HEADLINE: THE CULTURE OF MONEY;
Bidders Without Faces

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst is a novelist and financial journalist. His column on the cultural dimensions of money and business appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE auction, it seems, is the emblematic transaction of our time, as characteristic of fin-de-siecle America as the potlatch in some tribal societies, or imperial land grants in colonial days. As a means of exchange, it encapsulates a good deal about us, with our emphasis on individual freedom, fair markets and, lately, technology. For while many of us still imagine a fast-talking, gavel-wielding auctioneer, or perhaps the desperate shouting of traders in the commodities pits, the rise of the auction is now fueled by computers.
We are not far removed -- a couple of hundred years perhaps -- from a time when ordinary people had no practical way to sell things to anyone but their neighbors, or perhaps to a few strangers at a market fair. Now, because of the Internet, we can auction almost anything among millions of potential buyers at minimal transaction costs. Culturally, this phenomenon has implications. 
 For one thing, it means the death of the bargain. After all, bargains depend on such market imperfections as inadequate information, barriers of time and distance, and so on. Buy something in an Internet auction and you can be sure you are paying the highest possible price. Economists refer to the "winner's curse," which comes free with whatever you happen to acquire at an auction. (The curse is winning.)
Prowl Ebay for a while and you'll sometimes see people bidding as much for second-hand stuff as the same items would cost new. Sometimes, bidders even drive the price above retail.
The tendency to overpay at auction, of course, is not limited to the Internet. Auctions have changed the nature of book publishing, for example: Manuscripts or even fragments of manuscripts by top authors attract frenzied bidding from publishers chasing the next blockbuster, while piles of work by the rest of us poor hacks are left to languish unloved in mid-list hell. The same dynamic is at work in the movie business, where studio heads desperately bid huge sums to land the few hot scripts, and in pro sports, where stars with expiring contracts can weigh multiple proffered fortunes.
In retail transactions, auctions take consumers another step away from the face-to-face dealings once central to village life. On-line auctions are efficient, but how do you get one to sponsor a Little League team, or lower an awning over Main Street when it rains?
As business becomes more virtual, so do communities. The growth of auctions suggests we're becoming a nation of solitary consumers, trading electronic balances for overpriced tchotchkes without ever leaving home. Talk about home shopping networks!
While auctions do a good job of setting prices for copper and pork bellies, the Everyman sort of auction fostered by the Internet depends heavily on cultural "commodities" whose value is more subjective.
To help us arrive at a bid for pork bellies, we have information about bacon consumption, population trends, herds on hog farms and so forth. But who really knows how to value a lamp by Poul Henningsen or a painting by Irving Lehman?
The phenomenon is also at work in the astonishing run-up of Internet stocks, whose value, to the denizens of chat rooms and the world of on-line trading, is just as subjective in the absence of earnings.
HE may long for a world in which we buy staples across the counter from a kindly old fellow in an apron, yet we like auctions almost as much as we like the "category killer" superstores that have wiped out the mom-and-pop retailers of memory.
In fact, though, Internet auctions may have more in common with market day in a medieval village than with ordering from the operator at the toll-free number in Omaha. Ebay offers the opportunity to inquire about items for sale via E-mail, and, after the transaction, you can rate the person you bought from. These ratings are recorded, and anyone can look up anyone else's record before entering a transaction. In other words, J. P. Morgan has been proved right again: Character counts.
And so far, when you buy something in an on-line auction, you're not dealing with Wal-Mart or Home Depot, but rather with Joe Cyberspace in Columbus, Ohio, who happens to be parting with a pair of arts-and-crafts bookends you just can't live without. In this day of a shrinking globe and vanishing community, that's something.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
When She Talks, Stocks Move

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
ACCORDING to its advertising, Dean Witter measures its success "one investor at a time." But it might also say that behind each of its 11,450 brokers is one Leah Modigliani.
Ms. Modigliani, among other things, is day-to-day manager of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's list of 10 stocks it recommends most strongly for purchase, called its fresh-money buy list. When she makes a new choice -- on Wednesday, for example, it was the Mead Corporation -- many thousands of customers get calls from brokers suggesting they follow her lead. The chosen company's market capitalization then typically swells by hundreds of millions of dollars. Mead jumped $4.75, or 12 percent, on Wednesday. 
 But what really distinguishes Ms. Modigliani, a slight, 34-year-old roller-blade enthusiast, from most Wall Street strategists is intellectual firepower, no doubt related to one of the best economic pedigrees this side of Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury secretary. (Both his parents are economists and two uncles, Paul A. Samuelson and Kenneth J. Arrow, are Nobel laureates in economics.)
Ms. Modigliani is the daughter of academics -- in social psychology and education -- and a distant cousin of Amedeo Modigliani, the painter and sculptor. And her grandfather is Franco Modigliani, winner of a 1985 Nobel in economics.
"My grandfather's enthusiasm for economics is absolutely contagious," she said. "But I never expected to be particularly interested in economics. It's just that it was my favorite subject at Oberlin." She is now known for developing, with her grandfather, a new way to judge the performance of mutual funds and other portfolios.
Byron R. Wien, her mentor and boss, had complained that most comparisons ignored the amount of risk that managers took. He asked that she try to figure out why. What Ms. Modigliani found was that existing methods were either not rigorous or precise enough -- she cited Morningstar's star system -- or were too difficult to understand. "I just kept thinking there's got to be a better way," she recalled in an interview in her 11th-floor office in Morgan Stanley's theater-district headquarters on Broadway.
Her solution began over the dinner table at her grandfather's house in Boston, not long after she joined the firm in 1995. He asked her what she was working on. After a brief discussion, she said, "we knew we were on the same page." Drawing on her grandfather's pioneering work on corporate leverage, she developed over the next year a measure that she called risk-adjusted performance. It soon became well known as Modigliani-Modigliani, or M-squared.
In essence, the approach first adjusts leverage artificially, to make all portfolios as risky as a benchmark, like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Then it measures returns. It is the kind of challenge that taps Ms. Modigliani's intellectual heritage -- from Oberlin College and Harvard Business School as well as her ancestors -- and also earns people money.
"What I really love is combining the two -- taking the academic ideas and making them applicable," she said. "And it's about human behavior as well as finance and math."
She said she follows Mr. Wien's prescription to have fun at work, though nobody would confuse the Morgan Stanley version with, say, fraternity high jinks. "My idea of fun is choosing stocks for the portfolio," she said, and "to think about risk and talk about risk to investors."
Her style of living, which must allow for a 7:30 meeting with analysts each workday morning to discuss stocks, is anything but yuppie indulgence. Ms. Modigliani, who in June plans to marry Nicholas McGrane, a venture capitalist for Bankers Trust, lives in Manhattan's West Village, where, she says, "I hardly ever run into people on the street from work."
In fact, she is something of an activist. Last week, she was exulting because Eulia Charles, a young woman she had been mentoring for four years through a group called the Student Sponsor Partnership and whose parents never finished high school, had won a full scholarship to Fordham University. Ms. Modigliani took Ms. Charles to a family reunion of her Italian-Jewish clan -- transplanted to the United States after Italy adopted anti-Semitic laws in the 1930's -- in Boston for Passover last month.
She is also involved with Girls Inc., an after-school program that teaches girls about money, and serves on the investment committee of Oberlin's board of trustees.
Since she has had a high income for only a short time and is repaying large student loans, Ms. Modigliani's own stock portfolio is relatively modest. Still, she insists on backing her opinions with her own cash. "I can't really be advising people what stocks to buy unless I'm doing it myself," she said. "Byron, he wants me to feel the pain when the stocks go down -- and I do."
Between Oberlin and Harvard, Ms. Modigliani worked for six years at Marsoft Inc. in Boston, where she managed the production of software for economic forecasting in the bulk-shipping industry. But she went on to business school, she said, because she wanted to put her academic background to use in a practical setting.
At Morgan Stanley, she and Mr. Wien -- whose job she is likely to inherit someday -- share the view that the stock market is about 25 percent overvalued. They have been adding some cyclical stocks, like DuPont, and small-cap companies, like Cyprus Amax, a metals concern, to the firm's hypothetical model portfolio.
But Ms. Modigliani said she doesn't feel pressure to conform. "I'm allowed to have my own opinion on whatever I want," she said. "When I talk to the brokers and the clients, they know I'm saying what I really think. That intellectual freedom really is important to me."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
Putting a Braver Face On Japan's Bad Loans

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
"HE'S Don Quixote," said Jun Satoh, chief manager of credit policy for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, motioning to his senior colleague, Eiichi Haruki. "I'm Sancho."
The two Japanese bankers came to the United States on a mission that some of their peers regard as nearly as crazy and embarrassing as tilting at windmills, though it is likely to accomplish a lot more. The quest: enticing institutional money managers, beyond a small circle of bargain-hunting specialists, to invest in Japan's mountain of defaulted bank loans. 
 Japan's banks have traditionally hated to sell nonperforming loans, because acknowledging that some or all of what was owed will never be recovered is seen as humiliating in a culture that takes humiliation hard.
When economic times were good, banks could afford to be unrealistically patient and optimistic about a few bad debts. But the bursting in 1992 of the country's "bubble economy" of soaring real estate and stock prices and the seven long years of recession that followed have left the country's banks with nonperforming loans that by some estimates total $1 trillion. By tying up capital that could otherwise be lent anew, they throttle bank earnings and starve the economy of credit.
The dead weight dragged a few weaker banks into liquidation and forced others to merge. Ultimately, it prompted the Government to design a $64 billion bailout plan, announced last October, to help the survivors cope by injecting capital into banks that took write-offs before the end of the fiscal year, on March 31.
Alone among Japan's biggest banks, though, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi has stood aloof from the bailout and tried to solve its problems on its own. And that's where the delicate journey of Mr. Satoh and Mr. Haruki comes in.
In 1997, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was among the first Japanese lenders to start selling its defaulted mortgages on factories, stores and office buildings. So far it has sold loans totaling $7 billion in face value in 17 deals with Wall Street "vulture" funds and hedge funds in Britain and America.
These are the same kinds of investors who moved in early when the United States had a similar problem, the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry in the late 1980's, and who made big profits buying up dud loans at 50 cents on the dollar, restructuring them and selling them at 60 or 65 cents.
BUT the investors who wield money on the scale that Japan needs -- the big pension fund managers -- came late to the bulk auctions of S. & L. loans by the Resolution Trust Company. This time, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi wants to lure those managers into the game earlier.
"They've taken a lead role in reaching out to nontraditional investors because it will broaden the market and speed liquidation," said Jack Rodman, a managing director of a Los Angeles accounting firm that specializes in real estate, E&Y Kenneth Leventhal, and one of Japan's leading bad-loan deal makers.
Outreach is what Mr. Satoh and Mr. Haruki were doing in California, trying to prepare the ground for future sales by preaching the general advantages of investing in dud Japanese loans on Japanese terms. They paid calls on two of the United States's largest institutional investors, the California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, and the treasurer of the University of California.
Squiring the two bankers into the offices of the fund managers was William J. Popejoy, who has experienced the pain of real-estate cycles first hand. At Federal regulators' behest, Mr. Popejoy was chosen in 1984 to try to forestall the demise of American Savings, the nation's largest S. & L., It ultimately failed despite his efforts.
"We said we aren't here to do a deal," said Mr. Popejoy, now the president of Pacific Capital Investors of Irvine, Calif. "When the Japanese came and bought assets in the U.S., they bought them the U.S. way," he said he told the portfolio managers. "We'd like you to think about buying Japanese assets the Japanese way."
Pacific Capital has already bet its own money on that kind of thinking. It recently completed a deal to buy 40 loans with a face value of $370 million from the bank, and wants to buy another package of loans five or six times that size, preferably with pension funds as partners.
Pacific Capital's deal with the bank requires it to stick to nonconfrontational tactics in trying to collect on the defaulted loans. The aim is to get partial repayment from the debtors without resorting to repossession, an intense humiliation in Japan that the bank still wants to spare its customers, even nonpaying ones.
"They're concerned with how we treat their borrowers," Mr. Popejoy said.
Institutional investors are likely to consider such a deal attractive if it includes an American partner to service the loans, said Martin J. Whitman, chairman of the Third Avenue Value fund, who has been an outspoken advocate of changes in Japanese law to ease the bad-debt problem. Spokesmen for Calpers and for the University of California treasurer would not comment on their meetings with Mr. Satoh and Mr. Haruki.
TO HELP it make its case to investors, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi discarded its historical ways of analyzing nonperforming loans in favor of approaches drawn from the R.T.C.'s experiences, like valuing the loans based on cash flow. In the process it pioneered a secondary market that was new for Japan.
"Two years ago, you couldn't liquidate nonperforming loans," Mr. Haruki said. "This is very new. The effort was put into finding out what the investors' appetite is for." When the bank's bulk-sale plan passed muster with Japanese tax authorities, other banks followed suit.
Emboldened, the bank is considering securitizing some of the bad loans, another strategy rare in Asia but common in the United States. "In Japan, when you want to change things, it takes a long time," said Sachio Mikumo, a bank executive who accompanied them on their California trip. "There were skeptics, but not any more."
Mr. Rodman of E&Y Kenneth Leventhal estimates that $40 billion of nonperforming Japanese loans have been sold in the last three years at prices averaging 10 percent of face value, much lower than was typical in R.T.C. sales.
Buyers have included CS First Boston, Salomon Smith Barney, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Sales should accelerate this year as once-hesitant banks, spurred by the bailout, begin writing off and selling bad loans the way Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi has, American investors say. "Everyone's waiting for the tap to open," said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., chairman of Colony Capital.
When it does, Mr. Satoh and Mr. Haruki hope that the pension funds they are evangelizing will be ready to buy in bulk -- and help buoy prices.
"This is the only way the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi survives," Mr. Satoh said.

HEADLINE: The Nation: No Benefits, But No Jobs;
Welfare's Missing-in-Action

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
They seem, at this point, to be the disappeared, the missing, the lost in action of the new welfare era.
As more and more states track down former welfare recipients to assess how their well-being has been affected by stricter eligibility rules and more stringent work requirements, the question of those not accounted for looms ever larger. 
 The dimensions of the question are not trivial; the group of people neither working nor on welfare amounts to more than one-quarter of former recipients, state officials have said in several preliminary reports.
And in the information wars between advocates for the poor who contend that recent welfare changes are too harsh and state officials who present them as working well, the "missing" category is becoming a weapon that both sides seek to wield.
There are two kinds of the unaccounted-for: those who simply could not be found by trackers and those who have stayed off welfare but are not working. Not on welfare but not working either? What, then, are they living on? How do they survive?
When Massachusetts issued its first detailed, long-term report on how former welfare recipients seemed to be doing in mid-April, Claire McIntire, the state's commissioner of transitional assistance, immediately hailed its findings that a majority were working and about 20 percent were back on welfare as good news.
But her "very first question" to her staff, she said last week, was, "What is happening to the other 25 percent?" So she asked researchers to get back to her about how, exactly, those who were neither working nor on welfare were getting by. The answer was piecemeal. Of all the households that remained off welfare, 75 percent had an adult member working, the researchers found. The rest could be broken down like this:
* Just over 6 percent were in the process of re-applying for welfare or other assistance;
*About 2.5 percent were getting some form of Social Security payment;
* About 12 percent had been working in recent months but were not at the time of the survey;
* The remaining 5 percent or so had other explanations.
"I would not characterize them as missing," Ms. McIntire said. "We know they're still around, and they have other means by which they are supporting themselves and their families. And if they do not, we want them to come back to us and we will help them get back in the work force."
Such assertions draw vehement challenges from the advocates for the poor who see the Massachusetts report more as cause to worry than to rejoice. Unfamiliar with the official breakdown Ms. McIntire had ordered internally, they had their own ideas of what was happening with the missing 25 or 30 percent.
"My guess is that some have probably moved in with former spouses and boyfriends, of whom some are probably abusing them," said Randy Albelda, a University of Massachusetts economist, citing the high percentage of welfare recipients who have suffered domestic abuse. "Some people are probably going underground and doing illicit and illegal activities."
But basically, Ms. Albelda said, "We don't know what's happened to people, and it's going to get worse because the people who went back on welfare will have no welfare to go back to" now that time limits in Massachusetts are kicking in. "They're our missing," she said.
The advocates also point out that the people who could not be found at all for the survey, or refused to answer, are likely to be worse off than those who answered, and that respondents were likely to be less then honest because they were told that the information they provided could be forwarded to their case workers.
Around the country, there is a growing push to fill the holes in the welfare puzzle. Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that, in the simplest terms, the states made changes in their welfare programs, their case loads dropped much faster than they had expected and the immediate question became, "What happened to those families?" Two key questions, he said, are, "How many are working and how many are in desperate circumstances?"
That broad picture is now emerging. State reports have tended to show that about two-thirds of former welfare recipients get jobs and about one-fifth find themselves even poorer than before.
SO now, Mr. Tweedie and others said, efforts to track the families that left welfare are getting more advanced, and officials are beginning to ask follow-up questions about how former recipients who have not found work are supporting themselves, and what exactly are the barriers that keep them from getting jobs.
In Wisconsin, said Jan Van Vleck, a state expert on post-welfare tracking, the latest survey asks the question, "If you have not identified any forms of support, could you let us know how you are living?"
One way many are likely to be living, Mr. Tweedie noted, is by depending even more on family than before. A New Jersey study of certain former recipients, he said, found that as they were leaving welfare, 38 percent said they planned to get a job; but only about half of those people actually did. And just 23 percent said they would depend on family support, but then a full 47 percent actually did.
The worry is that such family support may not be sustainable for long, he said, because the families that former recipients depend on are usually poor as well.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: STEVEN A. CHAMBERLAIN;
Invesco European Fund

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG

 BODY:
A LONGTIME fan of Manchester United, the English soccer team, Steven A. Chamberlain, manager of the Invesco European fund, can do something that most other sports enthusiasts can't: control a chunk of the sports franchise he follows so passionately.
But Mr. Chamberlain's strong affection for "Man United" is not the reason he invests in it, or in the two other soccer clubs in his portfolio. 
 As an aggressive, growth-oriented manager, he is focused on the fact that soccer is the most popular sport in Britain and across Europe, and that major clubs are reaping increasing shares of television advertising revenue.
"Really, these companies are actually very good leisure plays," he said by telephone from his London office.
Soccer club shares account for just 1.75 percent of the fund's portfolio, which contains 79 stocks. The fund, with $631 million in assets, has returned 18.7 percent, annualized, for the three years ended April 23, compared with 16.8 percent for the average European stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. But there have been problems this year; the fund is down 7.2 percent, versus a decline of just 1.3 percent for the peer group.
Mr. Chamberlain attributes the recent performance to the portfolio's high-growth stocks, which carry big price-to-earnings multiples. Manchester United, with a P/E of over 50, is down 12.3 percent this year. "These companies have come in for profit-taking as investors shift to deeper cyclicals," he said, referring to oil, chemical, and some mining and steel companies. Some investors are also returning to Asian stocks, out of favor until recently.
Mr. Chamberlain, 34, grew up near Sheffield in northern England -- not far from Manchester -- and has been with the Denver-based Invesco Funds Group since 1987, working in a centuries-old complex in the City of London. He became manager of the European fund in 1990, when he was just 25.
The fund's assets are spread around Europe, mostly in large-capitalization companies. "What we really want to do is find companies that are operating in business areas that are growing, where they are well positioned to also be able to grow in that market," he said.
To zero in on stocks, he analyzes industries, visits companies and uses computer screening. He pays special attention to companies that have shown above-average return on equity over the last six years. "If they have a proven record over that sort of time period," he added, "it usually shows that they're doing something right."
But the fund, like others invested in Europe, has been hurt by slower growth in economies, by the shaky start of the euro and by negative market sentiment from the conflict in the Balkans.
One top holding is Vodafone Group of Britain, the wireless network provider. It took a big step into the American market in January, announcing its plan to buy Airtouch Communications for more than $60 billion.
"Earnings growth has been strong, but earnings are still at a low level, because the company is reinvesting lots of capital," Mr. Chamberlain said. "This is what we like. We want companies that are generating cash, hopefully sufficient amounts to be able to expand their businesses, and they're hopefully operating in markets where they have lots of room to grow."
Mr. Chamberlain said he first bought Vodafone stock in January 1997 at 2.54, it closed Friday at 11.45, and he has a target of 15.40 for 12 months.
A SMALLER company, Tomra Systems of Norway, specializes in so-called reverse vending machines. Customers return empty recyclable bottles and cans to the machines and receive tickets that can be redeemed at store checkouts. More than half of Tomra's revenues come from the United States.
"Tomra has more than 90 percent market share globally in those machines," he said. "We liked it because we thought that it had a big target market in which to grow."
He bought Tomra stock in August 1995 at about 30 Norwegian kroner. It now trades at 310 kroner, and his 12-month target price is 430.
Telepizza, the largest fast-food company in Spain, also has outlets in Portugal and other European countries. Mr. Chamberlain said Telepizza has a 60 percent share of the Spanish pizza market, "and it's a fast-growth market because fast food in Spain is underdeveloped."
In the United States, he said, an average person spends $300 a year on fast food. "In Spain, it's about $15," he added.
Telepizza delivers by moped. "The pizzas themselves are pretty good, but it's really the fact that they're very good at marketing and they offer a very good service," he said.
He started buying the stock in February 1998 at the equivalent of 4.95 euros. It now trades at 6 euros; his target is 9.18 by next April.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Out of Asia: The Move Toward Global Regulation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Asian crisis is subsiding. Even Russia is reviving a bit. But for all the relief that brings, the global financial meltdown remains a haunting memory -- not as searing as the Depression for a generation of Americans, but scary enough. And just as the Depression brought regulation to America's financial markets, the Asian and Russian crises are forcing rules on the global market.
That is a striking shift in course. The thousands of lenders and borrowers who move money among themselves in what is called the global financial market had counted on markets to heal themselves without much oversight. Many economists encouraged that view, until Asia took a dive. And now public officials with the power to regulate global markets are speaking more explicitly than ever about actually doing so. 
 They are not thumping pulpits about it. But in interviews, speeches and forum discussions at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held here last week, some officials offered views they would not have dared to put on the record six months ago.
"There is a growing acceptance in the official international community that you tremendously increase the risk of triggering volatility and crisis if rules are not made for the proper structuring of debt," Jack Boorman, the I.M.F.'s director of policy development, said in an interview. Volatility is a euphemism for the panicky rush of foreign lenders out of Asia, then Russia, and then Brazil. Credit even dried up in the United States last fall, until a worried Federal Reserve abruptly cut rates.
While the World Bank had spoken out for global rule-making, the I.M.F. had held back, and so had the Clinton Administration. But it was clear at last week's meeting that they, too, have now come on board.
The Asian crisis has imposed on all of them a common frame of reference. It goes like this: The global capital market, like national markets, is neither self-regulating nor self-curing. Left alone, lenders and borrowers tend to operate with too much exuberance, on the one extreme, and then pull back too far in panic, on the other.
"Crises are, in a sense, accidents," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, in a speech last Sunday. "As with accidents, crises will never be eliminated, and are not amenable to silver-bullet solutions. Think of auto accidents: If one looks back at any auto accident, there are always many things that could have combined to produce greater safety."
Given that recognition, the new rule-making -- or accident prevention, as Mr. Summers put it -- is under way. It is now openly recognized that lenders must be regulated, and negotiations have begun over what strictures to impose on them. (Hapless borrowers have been lectured from all sides since the global crisis started in 1997 on how they should have behaved and must now behave.)
"There is more belief now in the necessity of controls on both the lending and the borrowing side," said Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s first deputy managing director.
The lenders, after all, are part of a system that can swing too easily from optimism to pessimism. These swings are facilitated by short-term loans, which lenders prefer to long-term lending. Loans of less than a year are less expensive for lenders because banks need not keep as large a percentage of the loans' value in reserve. And short-term loans can be withdrawn quickly in a crisis, which makes the lenders whole but tends to deepen the crisis.
Borrowers are also tempted by short-term loans. They can often borrow abroad for the short term at relatively low interest rates and re-lend the borrowed money long term at home at higher rates. They gamble that the short-term loans will be renewed indefinitely, not suddenly withdrawn in panic.
One goal of the new rule-making is to discourage short-term lending in favor of long-term loans, which are less likely to finance speculation and more likely to finance factories and similar investments. Not surprisingly, this shift is turning out to be the hardest part of the new rule-making process.
LENDERS, naturally, are opposed. "Presumably the market, on its own, will find the right balance between short- and long-term credit," said James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers Association.
Public officials are sensitive to this resistance. Still, there is much talk of raising reserve requirements on short-term loans, and of requiring bondholders to postpone repayment in the event of a crisis.
Tougher proposals come more slowly to the table. One is the so-called Chile approach: When short-term foreign loans enter in great quantity, Chile requires the foreign lenders to deposit a percentage of each loan in a noninterest-bearing account -- a tax, in effect, that raises a loan's cost. Such a strong deterrent never entered Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's speeches, until April 21, the eve of the meeting here.
"Some countries," he said, "may deem more comprehensive measures -- such as Chilean-style taxes on short-term capital inflows -- to be appropriate." Caveats filled the next three sentences, but no rejection. The rule makers, mindful of Asia, are clearly moving forward.

HEADLINE: Life on the Edge;
How High a Fence Is the City Line?

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
CHERRYL MITCHELL is a native New Yorker, born and raised in Brooklyn. But she's quick to tell you she doesn't think much of life in the city, or the "concrete forest," as she calls it.
"I left and I've never missed it or looked back," she said. "Now I hear birds and see real trees when I wake up." 
 While there are trees in Brooklyn, and birds, Ms. Mitchell lives in a 200-year-old house on two acres in Charleston, Staten Island, next to the wetlands and forest of the Clay Pit Ponds State Park. Dogs and cats roam the grounds, even a goose. The sky, unbroken by silhouettes of buildings, seems a million miles from the city.
But when turkey hawks wheel overhead, swooping for prey, it is often a pigeon they will grab for an afternoon meal. The skies are not theirs alone. Frequently, the thunder of jets flying in and out of Newark International Airport can be heard. For the earthbound, the vista includes oil refineries lining the New Jersey side of New York Harbor, and, on the way to Ms. Mitchell's house, the mountain of urban garbage that makes up the Fresh Kills dump.
With her home two miles from the Outerbridge Crossing to New Jersey and half that from the municipal boundary, Ms. Mitchell lives on a frontier. Like thousands who live on the city's margins, on Staten Island, in Queens or the Bronx, she is a New Yorker on the edge.
It is often said that New York is less an urban monolith than a collection of small towns. All over the city, there are distinct neighborhoods, many of them with a well-developed sense of community. Some are like small villages, where everyone seems to know everyone else and generations of the same families have lived and died.
In communities that touch, in some cases straddle, the city line, the border helps define the place for its residents, though the effect varies considerably. For some the boundary is a dividing line that connotes separation from the city. And there are those who think that's a good thing, like Frank Scala.
"I live in Bayside, Long Island," he says, "not Bayside, New York." A retired teacher who lives in the Queens home where he grew up and raised his own family, Mr. Scala sees Bayside as "a town or a village, like a rural part of Nassau or even Orange or Westchester County."
Well, not exactly. Although there are plenty of one-family homes nearby in the northeastern Queens communities of Bayside, Douglaston, Douglas Manor and Little Neck, some of them on wooded plots and quiet streets like those in Nassau County, there are also two- and three-family homes and apartment houses.
The area is ringed by highways, and two of the city's East River bridges, the Whitestone and Throgs Neck, provide a crossing to the Bronx. Bayside's main commercial artery, Bell Boulevard, has the same parking meters and arcane street signs that bewilder motorists in the five boroughs, and city buses rumble up and down the main streets.
Still, in eastern Queens, where there is no subway (it ends in Flushing, several miles west), a car is a must. The public schools are among the city's finest, with reading and math scores rivaling those of upscale suburban towns across the county line.
Demographically, the area is also similar to towns next door in Nassau County: more affluent, with more white people than the city as a whole. While 1997 census estimates put the white population of New York City at just over 50 percent, Bayside is 73 percent white, while in Douglaston 80 percent of residents are white. Average family income citywide is $65,777 annually. In Bayside it is $84,170 and Douglaston, $83,185.
There are other signs of suburbia. At Fort Totten, which the city will soon acquire from the Federal Government, children play soccer on windswept fields overlooking Long Island Sound and Little Neck Bay, where the boats of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point ply the waters.
Then there are buying habits. People shop locally or, more often than not, in Nassau border communities like Great Neck and Manhasset, as well as at Long Island malls like Roosevelt Field and the Source in Westbury. A Source spokeswoman, Billie Scott, said 15 percent of its customers came from Queens. Many Nassau businesses advertise in local Queens papers, said Victoria Schneps, who publishes The Courier, a Bayside weekly.
Thus Mr. Scala, who heads the 464-family East Bayside Homeowners Association, is far from alone in thinking that he has far more in common with residents of, say, Lake Success, N.Y., than with those of Bensonhurst or Greenwich Village.
"I don't think of myself as a city person," said Geraldine Spinella, president of the Bayside Historical Association, whose family has lived in Bayside since the 1890's.
"It's a suburb within the city," agreed Tess Mittman, a 40-year resident. Councilman Michael J. Abel, a native of Bayside who represents the 19th District, which includes the northeastern part of the borough, said: "I don't live in an outer borough. I live in an inner county."
He recalled that residents deluged him with complaints when the Post Office decided to refer to the area generically as Flushing (the name of its main post office), eliminating place names like Bayside from its computers. Under pressure from residents who objected to identification with a more urban and less affluent area of Queens, the Post Office relented.
The reasons for this pervasive sense of apartness from the city are partly historical. Residents of eastern Queens didn't want to become part of New York City in the first place, voting against municipal consolidation in a referendum that preceded the creation in 1898 of Greater New York, the late 19th-century term for what is today New York City. Their distrust of the city led eastern towns to secede from Queens, thereby forming Nassau County; even among towns remaining, skepticism was high.
Today, the feeling persists along the Queens-Nassau line. Not just in Bayside and Douglaston but also in communities to the south like New Hyde Park, Floral Park and Bellerose, all bisected by the municipal border, lying partly in Nassau and partly in Queens. There, where the homes tend to be more modest than in the neighborhoods to the north, those who live on the New York City side are aggrieved by what they say is the city's outright disregard of their needs, according to Councilman Sheldon Leffler, who has represented many parts of the area for more than 20 years and whose 23d District abuts Mr. Abel's. "People think that the city doesn't give them adequate attention," he said.
Susan M. Noreika, a resident of the Queens part of New Hyde Park who has been chairwoman of Community Board 13 since 1971, said, "We've always had to fight like tigers for everything we need," like street repaving.
This disaffection has led to the formation of neighborhood groups like the Lost Community Civic Association, whose president, Oscar Berenberg, declared, "Half the people in city government probably don't even know where Queens is." It has also led residents of border communities to identify more strongly with suburban counterparts.
For example, in the area roughly bounded by 225th Street and 257th Street in Bellerose, New York State Route 25 is known as Jericho Turnpike on the southern, Nassau side, and as Jamaica Avenue on the northern, Queens side. That causes confusion, so Richard Hellenbrecht and other members of a Bellerose civic group are trying to get both sides to take the same name "as a way to help people in the community get together."
Their choice for the joint name? Jericho Turnpike. "There's no reason in the world why people in Nassau would want to name their street for Jamaica," Mr. Hellenbrecht said. But presumably every reason why those on the Queens side would want their street named for a town in Nassau.
Of course, not everyone in eastern Queens is wary or disdainful of the city. Residents note that their property taxes are generally a small fraction of what they would be in the adjoining Long Island suburbs. Thousands commute to Manhattan daily, according to the chairman of Community Board 11 in Bayside, Bernard Haber, who said that he and others "like being a part of New York City," able to take advantage of the city's cultural offerings.
As Mr. Leffler put it, "It's like a best-of- both-worlds philosophy." Such city-friendly sentiment exists, no doubt, elsewhere along the border, too. But there are also places on the edge where the city just doesn't seem to be all that important.
Take Woodlawn, a small, 40-square-block enclave of the northern Bronx just below the Westchester County line. Bordered by the Bronx River Parkway on the east, Van Cortlandt Park on the west, Woodlawn Cemetery on the south and, on the north side, by Yonkers, the inhabitants of Woodlawn are in effect geographically cut off from the rest of the Bronx. But not philosophically, according to Councilwoman June M. Eisland.
The people in the community are "proud to be Bronxites," she said, and eager to overcome "the stereotype that the Bronx is not comfortably residential." They are also "very happy to be where they are," she said, "equidistant between Manhattan and the shopping malls of Westchester."
James C. Reilly, a 15-year resident and past president of the Woodlawn Heights Taxpayers Association, agrees, but only up to a point. He says there is another kind of identity that matters far more to residents. "For most people who live here," he said, "parish boundaries are more important than municipal boundaries."
In some ways, Woodlawn is a throwback to an earlier New York, when one or two ethnic groups predominated in a neighborhood. Here, the vast majority of residents are Roman Catholic, according to the Archdiocese of New York, and their parish, St. Barnabas, which crosses the city line, includes roughly equal parts of Yonkers and of the Bronx. Most residents are at least partly of Irish descent, with citizens of Italian and German ancestry coming in second and third.
"We have always thought in terms of our parishes," said the Rev. Richard Gorman, chairman of Community Board 12, who now works for Catholic Charities but began his career at St. Barnabas. "It's part of Catholic culture."
By appearance, the Bronx and Westchester parts of the parish are hardly distinguishable: one-, two- and three-family homes, some small apartment houses. Even the street signs on both sides of the border are green and white. Residents of both parts of the community shop at the businesses that line MacLean Avenue, the main commercial street on the Yonkers side, and Katonah Avenue, in the Bronx, where there are numerous Irish bars and an Irish bakery. Their children play Little League ball together.
Social service agencies ignore the border. On the Westchester side, Sister Edna McNicholas and the Rev. Tom Flynn, both from Ireland, work at the Asiling Irish Community Center, where they assist thousands of immigrants each year, according to Sister McNicholas, many from Woodlawn. In the Bronx, the Woodlawn satellite office of the Queens-based Emerald Isle Immigration Center sees 70 to 100 people a month seeking assistance in applying for green cards or citizenship, according to Patricia Bowie, an employee. Although the center is open to everyone, she said, "every person you see is Irish or Irish-American," coming from both sides of the community.
Even the parish church, St. Barnabas, symbolically straddles the city line, half in and half out of the city. The pastor, the Rev. Francis C. Toner, said it was a deliberate choice made by the church's builders in 1910 "so that no one group could claim it for its own." So homogeneous is the neighborhood that people living on the Yonkers side will often say, when asked, that they live in Woodlawn, identifying with the city. And that's something suburban residents rarely do.
Staten Islanders have long prided themselves on their relative isolation from the rest of the city, calling theirs "the forgotten borough." And Charleston is clearly to Staten Island what the borough is to the rest of New York: if not forgotten, then certainly the last frontier.
It sits next to the narrow Arthur Kill and New Jersey, on what residents call Staten Island's South Shore, where towns seem to run into one another and boundaries are hard to draw. Charleston is generally thought to run from the Arthur Kill on the west to Bloomingdale Road on the north and east and then to Route 440 on the south. Areas nearest the shore remain the least developed; there, where equestrian and hiking trails of Clay Pit Ponds Park can be found, people still raise small farm animals and stable and ride horses.
Not that Charleston is a bucolic paradise. This is real country, where people work and live, not some picture-postcard ideal. Indeed, Charleston was once a fairly sizable industrial town, where bricks were made from the region's clay soil. The legacy of this industry, from the 1850's to the 1920's, can be seen in the historic homes and street names like Kreischer, after the brick factory's founders. It can also be seen in the detritus of an industry gone bankrupt, and in zoning that allows people to be shoehorned between industrial properties.
Owen Reiter was born in the Bronx and raised in Queens. He lived in Manhattan until 1985, when he and his wife, from Minnesota, discovered Charleston. They were taken by the open space, by the chance to raise animals and do serious gardening, he said, and by the 200-year-old home they eventually purchased, which was originally owned by one of the founding families of the area. There were also woods behind the property and, beyond them, a beach on the Arthur Kill.
The Reiters keep goldfish in outdoor ponds. They raise ducks and chickens. They once kept horses. Their home is immaculate and grounds well tended. Across the street are other neat homes. But the rest of their surroundings are something else. Deserted barges litter the beach. There are factories nearby, some abandoned, others functioning, and across the street a junkyard of garbage and cars. Fuel tanks line the horizon; the Arthur Kill State Correctional Facility is near.
In short, isolated in a part of the city as far from Manhattan as possible, the Reiters still live near some of the most unsightly things modern life can produce. Yet they still cling tenaciously to their home, and to Charleston. Why?
"There's nowhere else in New York City where I could find a similar situation for the kind of money I can afford," Mr. Reiter said. Industry or not, "there's still no other place that's still so rural." Older houses in Charleston sell for $175,000 to $200,000, depending on the condition and plot size, according to Lydia Ragucci Real Estate, with new two-family homes and semidetached one-family dwellings priced from $225,000 to $250,000.
But will the rural character last? For residents, the prospects of stopping development nearby don't look good. Already, attached homes on microscopic plots crowd once vacant land near Bloomingdale Road, just up the block from Cherryl Mitchell. There are plans for more, too, and for hundreds of other homes on the water's edge near Mr. Reiter's place, said Lorraine Sorge, president of the Staten Island Taxpayers Association and a former chairwoman of Community Board 3. The city is reviving long-dormant plans to build a shopping center on wetlands it owns next to the Clay Pit Pond Park, plans that residents have opposed for years.
"I fear for Charleston," Ms. Sorge said.
Cherryl Mitchell is also fearful. And downright angry. "I feel like the rest of Staten Island is encroaching on me," she said, pointing in the direction of newly built homes that for now are still invisible from her property.
Ms. Mitchell says she feels little, if any, kinship with those who are moving to Charleston, or even with those who live farther in on Staten Island, closer to the Staten Island Expressway and the established commercial centers. She does all her shopping in New Jersey, she says, never bothering to go to places like the Staten Island Mall, which is about the same distance away as Woodbridge Center in New Jersey. And she vows that she may move altogether if the new houses get any closer. There's simply nowhere left to go, she said, except out.
Still, she plans to stay, at least for now. It's the country, after all. Or as her friend Ms. Sorge puts it, referring to poultry some Charleston residents still slaughter for their dinners, "Where else in New York can you still see chickens running around without their heads?"
Nowhere, of course. Unless you count Manhattan during morning rush.

HEADLINE: Going For Broke

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN

 BODY:
DIANNE LAWE, a private investigator, arrived early enough on an overcast morning last November to beat the garbage truck to Harry Leonhardt's home in a tranquil neighborhood north of Houston.
When she lifted the lid of the dark green trash can at the foot of Mr. Leonhardt's driveway, Ms. Lawe found just what the lawyers who had hired her said she might: a trove of financial documents, many of them emblazoned with the corporate name of the National Gypsum Company. 
 Mr. Leonhardt, a consultant and former building industry executive who had advised National Gypsum as it went through a messy bankruptcy in the early 1990's, had been ordered in a subpoena to turn over any papers he had relating to the company. The lawyers say they sent Ms. Lawe to check Mr. Leonhardt's trash the day before his scheduled deposition because they thought he might be tempted to throw away whatever documents he had; he later explained that he did not even realize he still had the papers and simply was cleaning boxes out of his closets.
Like many other companies that make construction materials, National Gypsum filed for bankruptcy to help rid itself of thousands of injury claims that were pouring in from people who had become ill -- or feared they would -- after inhaling asbestos in the manufacturers' products.
What distinguished National Gypsum's case was the outcome.
For three prominent investment firms that held most of the company's senior debt -- Fidelity Management and Research; Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Trust Company of the West, an investment firm based in Los Angeles -- gypsum turned to gold when National Gypsum went on to flourish after it emerged from bankruptcy in 1993, largely in their control. The firms doubled or even quadrupled their initial investments, making upwards of $240 million in profits.
But thousands of others had claims against National Gypsum -- asbestos-exposed workers, school districts, hospitals and universities that spent millions ripping asbestos from their ceilings and walls, investors who bought National Gypsum bonds for their retirement accounts. At best, they were left with mere fractions of what they were owed. Those creditors have been unhappy with the company almost from the day the trouble started. But now their lawyers -- the people who hired Ms. Lawe -- say they finally have proof that the resolution of the bankruptcy case was a miscarriage of justice.
The lawyers say documents they have uncovered suggest that before the bankruptcy was settled, the company and the investment firms had a secret cost-cutting plan, devised by Mr. Leonhardt, that had the potential to add millions to the company's value -- and eventually did. Though bankruptcy court judges are supposed to approve all advisers and professional fees, the court was never told that National Gypsum had hired Booz-Allen & Hamilton, the consulting firm, to flesh out the plan.
To the contrary: The company and the investment firms' experts said on the witness stand that National Gypsum's expenses had already been cut to the bone. Documents that might have painted a different story -- like those in Mr. Leonhardt's trash -- are only now making their way to the courthouse, as part of a long-running lawsuit now heading to a Texas appeals court.
The defendants in that suit -- including the three investment firms, former executives of National Gypsum, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the company's financial adviser during the bankruptcy (but not Mr. Leonhardt, whose behind-the-scenes role was not initially known to the plaintiffs) -- all say there was no secret plan and no misconduct of any sort.
"It's a fantasy piece," said Bryant C. Boren Jr., a Dallas lawyer who has kept busy representing the company's former officers and directors in much of the litigation that has trailed the bankruptcy. What the creditors' lawyers call Mr. Leonhardt's secret plan, Mr. Boren added, was nothing more than his sales pitch for a role in restructuring National Gypsum.
The investment firms, meanwhile, say their gains were their rightful reward for making the risky choice to take stock in National Gypsum in exchange for their bankruptcy claims. It was an unforeseen upturn in the economy and the housing market -- not some back-room conspiracy -- that led those shares to triple soon after the company emerged from bankruptcy, they say.
"It is clear that the rise in National Gypsum's stock price subsequent to the reorganization was principally due to an upturn in the U.S. housing market generally and in gypsum prices in particular," said Scott Beyerl, a spokesman for Fidelity.
And in any event, the defendants add, the dispute has already been aired in court and resolved in their favor.
Undisputed, though, is the meager amount that National Gypsum's bankruptcy left for a long parade of creditors.
"I think I've been had," said Alfred B. Earnest, a retired human-resources manager from Houston, who invested $1,800 of his retirement money in the company's junior bonds in 1986. After years of waiting, Mr. Earnest was paid $592.65 in 1995.
Anxieties are high, too, for asbestos-exposed workers counting on payments from a trust fund established during the bankruptcy proceedings. Already, 300,000 claims have been filed, even though the first signs of lung disease often do not emerge until 30 years after the exposure. National Gypsum's fund, which has received a total of $518 million to pay claims, may run out of money as soon as 2002, according to W. Dee Hilton, its managing trustee.
"Because of the alleged fraud committed during the bankruptcy process, the trust did not get the money that it would have," Mr. Hilton said.
The three investment firms, however, received the entire value of their bonds -- and, in the end, much, much more. Lawyers for the asbestos trust, Mr. Earnest and the others who held the company's junior bonds estimate that Fidelity; Goldman, Sachs; the Trust Company of the West, and a few other senior creditors walked away with securities that, in total, were eventually worth as much as $800 million for bankruptcy claims that had a face value of only about $300 million.
Indeed, because the bankruptcy had driven down the value of National Gypsum bonds, the stakes actually cost the three investment firms only about $120 million to acquire.
Goldman, which put up $31.8 million, acknowledges that it more than doubled its money. (Those profits are atop the investment banking fees it made for advising National Gypsum to take on debt in the mid-1980's.) Trust Company of the West says it quadrupled its initial investment of $40 million or so. Fidelity has not divulged details but lawyers for the other creditors believe that it at least doubled a $30 million investment.
 
A Judge's Concern For Facts Not Known
The Federal judge who spent three years shepherding National Gypsum through bankruptcy has second thoughts about those results.
In a written opinion a year ago -- in which he was in the awkward position of arguing that his own judgment ought to be re-examined -- Judge Steven A. Felsenthal said he was concerned that the "very integrity" of the bankruptcy process might have been harmed by the possible concealment of work-force cuts intended to save $30 million a year.
Though he was "keenly sensitive" to the protection of jobs during the bankruptcy process, Judge Felsenthal wrote, "substantial work-force reductions were not presented to the court" when he was asked to confirm National Gypsum's reorganization plan.
During the bankruptcy, Judge Felsenthal had rejected arguments that the company was underestimating its value, saying there was no evidence to back up that claim. Had he known that the company would be announcing layoffs in October 1993, just three months after it emerged from his court, the case would have ended differently, Judge Felsenthal said in his January 1998 opinion.
The value of the company would have been greater, and "unpaid asbestos claimants and unpaid bondholders would have benefited," he wrote.
But Judge Felsenthal's ruling came on a narrow issue about the payment of certain legal fees. The fraud case is being argued in Texas state court, and there the disgruntled creditors' charges have been rejected. On March 1, David C. Godbey, a Texas district court judge, decided without much explanation to leave the outcome of the bankruptcy case essentially intact.
That is the decision that the asbestos trust fund and creditors who owned the junior bonds plan to appeal. They say the district court gave short shrift to evidence they discovered, largely over the last year, of a conspiracy to conceal the company's true financial value during the bankruptcy court proceedings.
"They walked away with $500 million of value that belonged to other people," said James R. Moriarty, a Houston lawyer who represents the junior bondholders. "These people have committed an outrageous fraud."
The defendants, however, argue that letting bankruptcies be reopened because events didn't turn out as some of the parties expected would destroy the system. "The consequences of permitting that second trial would indeed be devastating to the principle of finality of judgments," the lawyers wrote in their motion asking Judge Godbey to dismiss the case.
 
How Some Creditors Got Less of the Pie
It wasn't until late 1997 that the lawyers for the creditors began to piece together what they now contend took place behind the scenes of the bankruptcy case.
At a hearing before Judge Felsenthal, a lawyer for the company's former executives said the work-force reductions were not management's idea, but had come from consultants at Booz-Allen. That was the first that the plaintiffs' lawyers had heard of Booz-Allen's involvement. But with that lead, the lawyers subpoenaed Booz-Allen and obtained many key documents, including a plan prepared by Mr. Leonhardt.
When Mr. Leonhardt was confronted last fall with the discovery of the documents in his trash -- including spreadsheets that showed his estimates of the company's worth -- he said it was all an innocent mistake. He had no idea he had any relevant documents, he told the junior creditors' lawyers at his deposition; he was simply cleaning his closets, and the spreadsheets and other papers, which he did not even know he had, must have been in boxes he was tossing.
But the lawyers say they believe there are many more documents that the defendants should have turned over long ago.
"They've put up every conceivable obstacle to try to keep us from getting at the truth," Mr. Moriarty said. "Every single defendant has said they don't have the documents. It's all part of their plan."
Mr. Boren said in response, "It shouldn't surprise anybody that people who claim there's a conspiracy but can't find evidence of that then say there's a conspiracy to hide the evidence."
This is not the first time, however, that National Gypsum has been accused of being slow to produce crucial documents in a court proceeding. In June 1990, when the asbestos lawsuits hit a crescendo, the company lost a case filed by 52 Texas school districts that had bought its building products and wanted to be reimbursed for the cost of removing them.
In explaining his ruling, the Texas district court judge who decided the case said he was dismayed by evidence that National Gypsum had concealed or not produced documents that the schools had subpoenaed while preparing their case. Later, just before a subsequent trial was to begin, to decide how much money the Texas schools should get, the company filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code, stopping that trial and hundreds of similar lawsuits dead in their tracks.
By filing for bankruptcy, National Gypsum transferred the injury claims from the trial courts, where juries don't generally consider whether a company can afford to pay any damages they might award, to Federal bankruptcy court, where the priority is settling a company's debts so it can continue its operations.
At the end of the bankruptcy, a trust fund was set up to pay the asbestos claims. The company has contributed $138 million to the fund, while insurance companies have so far agreed to pay $380 million. But that money will not cover claims expected to reach $2.3 billion.
With the fund running out of money, asbestos-exposed workers who are not yet ill wonder what will be left for them.
"The doctors tell me sooner or later it's coming around," said Leroy Gilley, a retired boilermaker in Chickasaw, Ala., who spent four decades insulating boilers and has buried friends who died from lung disease. The trust fund should have money "until all the people are gone," he said.
The trust fund also was responsible for reimbursing property owners that had claims against the company. Because money is tight, that group has received less than half of the cost of their repairs. The biggest claimant, New York City's schools, sought about $44 million and have received $20 million, Mr. Hilton said.
 
A Profit Opportunity Not Widely Shared
Mr. Leonhardt has not been named as a defendant in any of the litigation, but his work is at the heart of what the angry creditors are calling fraud in the National Gypsum bankruptcy.
A consultant with more than 40 years of experience in the building and gypsum industries, he prepared an analysis -- never disclosed to Judge Felsenthal -- that concluded that National Gypsum was paying $40 million a year too much for costs associated with selling its products and operating its administrative offices.
The report by Mr. Leonhardt is significant because, while he was preparing it in 1992, the company's executives and other consultants hired by the investment firms were testifying in court that those costs could not be reduced and would instead rise with inflation by about 3 percent a year.
Days after Judge Felsenthal, relying on the testimony, approved National Gypsum's reorganization plan in April 1993, a series of private meetings about implementing a cost-cutting program began, according to documents obtained by the creditors' lawyers.
Attending the meetings were Mr. Leonhardt; Peter C. Browning, chief executive of National Gypsum, and two men whom Trust Company of the West hoped to place on National Gypsum's board: Richard Masson, a managing director of Trust Company of the West, and Vincent J. Naimoli, now an owner of baseball's Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who was then chief executive of Anchor Industries International.
According to an April 16, 1993, memo written by Mr. Browning, it was agreed on April 1 that National Gypsum would hire Booz-Allen to help determine which specific costs could be cut and which workers could be let go. On April 6, Mr. Browning wrote a memo informing employees of the company's decision to bring in the consultants.
Handwritten notes taken during the April meetings by John E. McGrath, a Booz-Allen consultant, indicate that one of the participants said the company could save as much as $40 million, or 50 percent of its selling, general and administrative costs. "30% to 50% SG&A can go!" he scribbled. His notes also say that there was an opportunity to increase the value of the company by $200 million to $600 million.
It was at this juncture, the junior creditors contend, that National Gypsum and the investment firms made a clear choice to hide their plans from the bankruptcy court. The accusers point to another passage in Mr. Browning's April 16 memo, in which he says that Booz-Allen's work needed to be delayed.
"Since it is felt by counsel that the project would require court approval at this stage," the memo says, "we have decided to postpone the initial phase" until either the company emerged from bankruptcy "or whenever we have reached a point where obtaining court approval would be more appropriate."
In a deposition, Mr. Browning testified that it was appropriate for the men -- all of whom expected to be directors of the new National Gypsum that would emerge from bankruptcy -- to begin talking about future plans for the company. But actually spending the money to hire Booz-Allen was a matter for the new company, which would not exist until July, he said.
Indeed, National Gypsum formally emerged from bankruptcy that July 1, without ever having informed the court of its dealings with Booz-Allen. The first announcement of the restructuring was made on Oct. 5, 1993, when the company announced that it was laying off 12 percent of its work force to save $30 million a year.
The news came just a month after a key legal deadline; the creditors had until Sept. 6 to ask Judge Felsenthal to revoke the company's reorganization plan if they suspected fraud.
Playing out the opportunity that the executives had envisioned, National Gypsum's cost-reduction plans delighted the stock market. In the week after the layoffs were announced, the stock rose 20 percent; by February 1994, the company's shares had hit $40 -- more than three times the $12.50 price at which they had been valued, at the urging of the company and investment funds, by the bankruptcy court. Gypsum prices were booming during the period, as well.
Lawyers for the disgruntled creditors estimate that the three investment firms would have turned their $295 million bankruptcy claim into $790 million if they held their stock until October 1995, when National Gypsum was acquired for $54 a share, or about $1.2 billion, by Delcor Inc., a private investment company led by National Gypsum's former chairman.
Not all the firms held the stock that long. The Justice Department required Goldman, Sachs to sell its 20 percent stake in November 1993 after Federal antitrust officials learned that Goldman's Water Street Fund also owned 43 percent of the USG Corporation, National Gypsum's largest competitor. Goldman made a profit of about $70 million on the deal, according to a deposition by Barry S. Volpert, who managed the National Gypsum investment for the Water Street Fund.
Lawyers for Goldman, Sachs said that because the firm sold its shares so quickly after National Gypsum emerged from bankruptcy, it could not have reaped any benefit even if there were a secret plan. They also said Goldman had intentionally taken no role in creating new business plans for National Gypsum because it knew it would have to sell its investment quickly.
Trust Company of the West held its stock longer; according to evidence obtained by the junior creditors' lawyers, the firm sold its stock and bonds, which had cost $40 million, piecemeal from 1993 to 1995 for $180 million.
Those numbers sting for people who haven't shared in the good fortune.
"The big money guys took care of themselves," said Jackie Fields, who owns a Phillips 66 distributorship in McAllen, Tex., and bought some of the company's money-losing junior bonds, "and left everybody else in the cold."

THE ACCUSATIONS
 
Lawyers for the trust fund and junior creditors contend that National Gypsum executives and the investment firms kept a cost-cutting plan secret until after the bankruptcy, so they could reap its rewards. At a deposition, lawyers confronted Harry J. Leonhardt, an industry consultant, with documents found in his trash can. The investors and executives say that there was no secret plan and that the company's recovery reflected an economic upturn. (pg. 1)
 
"A Building Products Bankruptcy"
National Gypsum's future has fallen and revived along with the market for its gypsum products. Here are some key points in the company's bankruptcy and its aftermath.
 
April 1986 -- National Gypsum's executives take the company private in a leveraged buyout with advice from Goldman, Sachs. The transaction increases the company's debt by hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
Oct. 29, 1990 -- National Gypsum files for bankruptcy protection as the price of gypsum falls and the company is buried in injury claims from people who have inhaled the asbestos fibers in its building products.
 
Late 1990 to 1992 -- Fidelity, Trust Company of the West and Goldman buy the company's senior debt at cheap prices and become the company's most powerful creditors.
 
Spring 1992 -- The three big investment firms decide to break away from the other creditors, hire their own lawyer and work toward getting the court to approve a reorganization plan that benefits their interests.
 
Fall 1992 -- A bankruptcy committee representing all creditors except the three investment firms says it believes that the company is intentionally understating its value in documents filed with the bankruptcy court.
 
December 1992 -- Harry J. Leonhardt, a consultant, completes a written plan that says National Gypsum is spending $40 million too much on selling and administrative costs. He gives copies to Trust Company of the West and Fidelity.
 
1993
 
March 9 -- Bankruptcy Judge Steven A. Felsenthal approves the reorganization plan presented by the company and the three investment firms.
 
April 1 -- The company's chief executive, Mr. Leonhardt and two representives of Trust Company of the West agree to hire Booz-Allen & Hamilton to implement a cost reduction plan.
 
April 14 -- Booz-Allen consultants prepare a letter stating they plan to begin work on April 19.
 
April 16 -- In a letter, Mr. Browning says that the company's lawyer believes the Booz-Allen project would need court approval and that the work therefore will be delayed.
 
July 1 -- National Gypsum emerges from bankruptcy protection.
 
Oct. 5 -- The company announces that it is cutting its workforce to save $30 million a year. Within a week, the stock rises 20 percent.
 
1995 -- Creditors file a lawsuit against the company's former executives charging that National Gypsum and its financial advisers hid the cost-cutting plan from the bankruptcy court. The investment firms later are added as defendants.
 
Jan. 21, 1998 -- In a written opinion, Judge Felsenthal says that the company's value would have been greater -- and that smaller creditors would have received more money -- had he known about the job cuts before National Gypsum left his court.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Perilsof Investing On Automatic Pilot

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WHILE stock investors applauded the Dow Jones industrial average's assault this week on another nice round number -- 11,000 -- it is likely that few of them were participating in the profits. That's because most investors have money in stocks listed not in the Dow but in the Standard & Poor's 500, which has risen only half as much as the Dow this year.
Proving that no investment trend lasts forever, the S.& P. is now the laggard after years of beating the Dow. And this is occurring just as mutual funds that mimic the S.& P.'s moves have been flooded with money. 
 The turnabout reflects a shift in sentiment among some investors that began about two weeks ago. Sensing a revival of economic growth around the world, investors plunged into stocks of industrial companies, like paper, steel, cement and chemical concerns, seeing them as likely beneficiaries of the recovery. At the same time, investors started to exit the technology and health care stocks that had made the S.& P. a star.
Unlike the Dow, which is weighted by its stocks' prices, the S.& P. 500 is weighted by its stocks' market capitalizations.
What does this mean for investors? Just as the impressive performance of the S.& P. has masked a bear market in many smaller stocks since last summer, its current malaise masks a bull market in stocks with lower market caps, which are not big contributors to it.
Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer of asset allocation at Trust Company of the West in New York, said investors should prepare for a stealth bull market. "The averages will be in a trading range," he said. "But within the confines of that trading range there will be wonderful moves in stocks that will not show up in the indexes."
This is already happening. Shares of Dow Chemical, for example, rose 40.8 percent in April. But because it is such a tiny component of the S.& P. -- 0.267 percent of the index's value -- its rise has had little impact on the 500. Microsoft, with a weighting of 3.77 percent, fell 9.6 percent in April, producing a significant impact.
The S.& P. is vulnerable because it is dominated by the companies investors have been selling in recent weeks. Technology and health care companies account for 19 percent and 12 percent of the index's value, respectively. In contrast, chemical companies make up 1.9 percent of the index; paper and forest products account for 0.6 percent, and aluminum concerns represent 0.3 percent. Because these stocks make tiny contributions to the S.& P., as they have surged, the index has shrugged.
It may be premature to say that the era of momentum investing is over. But buying what has been going up is no longer working. Even the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks, left for dead in recent months, was up 8.8 percent in April, versus the S.& P.'s 3.8 percent rise.
Jeffrey M. Warantz, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, reports that even the tiniest stocks have improved. While companies with less than $250 million in market value were, on average, down 6.7 percent for the year in early April, they are now down only 1.6 percent.
All of this is very positive for investors whose holdings are diversified among small stocks and large, value and growth. It is not good news for those who have placed all their eggs in the S.& P. 500 basket.

HEADLINE: New Formula Yes. But Is It Improved?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
A LOT of diversification-minded investors are gravitating toward a group of indexed stock mutual funds that may seem a far wiser choice than the familiar version tied to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The funds, called total market funds, track several thousand stocks to mimic the spectrum of American securities, not just a chosen 500 of the biggest companies. Though the retail assets in such funds are still relatively small, at $11.1 billion versus $116.3 billion in S. & P. 500 index funds, they have grown more than 14-fold percent since 1994, when only the Vanguard Group had such an offering. 
 Some experts, in fact, see total market funds as a kind of all-in-one solution for investors' stock fund needs, giving them exposure to all kinds of equities -- large and small, value and growth. And they have rock-bottom expenses, too. But this is where investors can go wrong, because the easiest tack is not always the best.
Investors flocking to total market funds, which track the Wilshire 5000 index, may not be aware of the funds' limitations.
There is no denying the growing popularity of total market funds, helped by well-publicized endorsements of the Wilshire 5000 by the likes of John C. Bogle, senior chairman of Vanguard, and Burton G. Malkiel, the Princeton economics professor and author of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" (W. W. Norton).
"I now believe the best general United States index to emulate is the broader Wilshire 5000-stock index -- not the S.& P. 500," Professor Malkiel said in the book.
The biggest and longest-established of this handful of funds is the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, which began in 1992 and now has more than $10 billion in assets. Newer entries are Fidelity Spartan Total Market Index, the T. Rowe Price Total Equity Market Index and, since Feb. 1, Wilshire Associates' own version, the Wilshire 5000 Index Portfolio.
The appeal of such funds is based on a major failing of the S. & P. 500: that it contains only large companies and is weighted by capitalization so that the biggest stocks have undue influence.
When examined, however, the Wilshire 5000 -- now expanded to include all 7,200-plus publicly traded companies headquartered in the United States with readily available prices -- has a weight problem, too. Like the S. & P. 500, it is weighted by market capitalization, so there is not as big a difference between the two as one might expect.
In fact, as much as 80 percent of the Wilshire's value is in companies that are also part of the S. & P. 500. This striking overlap means that an investor who may think he is getting stakes in a healthy portion of small and midsize companies is actually looking at a quite meager side dish.
Today, with the price-to-earnings ratios of many big stocks in the stratosphere, risk-conscious investors may conclude that such indexing still gives them an uncomfortably large exposure to expensive stocks.
Indeed, the two kinds of index funds track each other closely: Vanguard Total Stock Market has returned 19.9 percent annually on average from its inception seven years ago through April 23, versus 21.4 percent for the Vanguard Index 500, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
A BETTER idea may be allocating assets to put more emphasis on mid-cap and small-cap index funds, thereby balancing the risks of stocks with high P/ E ratios against those whose valuations are less exalted. That is something you cannot do in a total market fund.
Of course, an investor with a total market fund, or some combination of benchmark-linked funds, has indexed all his assets. What's wrong with that? While it is accepted that indexing makes sense for large-cap stocks, the jury is still out on indexing when it comes to smaller issues.
Consider the 18.9 percent average annual return of the S. & P. 500 for the 10 years ended March 31. That beat every category of general equity fund over the period, according to Lipper Inc., the research firm in Summit, N.J. But the average small-cap fund returned an average of 13.6 percent annually over the same period, handily beating the 9.7 percent average of the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies.
(The average mid-cap fund returned 14.6 percent, annualized, over the 10 years, versus 17.4 percent for the S. & P. 400 index of mid-cap stocks).
The lesson: A total market index fund is a good core holding. But if you choose it as an all-in-one substitute for a genuinely diversified set of stock-market assets, you are likely to pay for the convenience.

HEADLINE: Political Muscle: The Only Good Enemy is a Strong/Weak Enemy;
Straining To See the Real Russia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
BELIEVE it: The Russians are hopping mad. For 8, 10 years now, they followed American advice on how to become capitalists. They swallowed American foreign-policy handouts urging that Russia be "integrated into Euro-Atlantic and global communities" and built into "a modern, market-based economy." They gave up on empire, cut up their missiles and ceded three of their clients to NATO. And for what? More than $60 billion in new debt. A beggar, rubber-ruble economy. A skeletal military. A short leash held tight by the International Monetary Fund. And now, the leveling of their one remaining friend in all Europe, Yugoslavia.
Last week Washington came back again, beseeching Moscow to help cut a deal to end the Kosovo crisis, and Russians wonder why. Most of them now believe Washington gives lip service to free markets and global partnership, but is secretly just as happy -- no, happier -- to have Ivan face-down on the floor at last, one arm behind his back. 
 Could they be right?
Well, no, not literally. It is easy to argue that America has fumbled its policy of promoting a healthy, democratic Russia, though the Russians have fumbled plenty all by themselves. Few would make the case that, in the long run, the United States would not benefit from a prosperous Russia that shares at least some of its basic values.
But there's the rub: Nobody knows what Russia will be in the long run. Russia may have lost a cold war. But as the last eight years have shown, it is no postwar Germany or Japan, no vanquished foe to be occupied and rebuilt in the American image. Quite the opposite: The Russia that re-emerged from hibernation this spring seems at times almost gleefully anti-American and, yearning for empire, is considering new unions with Belarus and Yugoslavia itself. If Russia is the country it seemed to be for 10 years after the fall of Communism -- a nation struggling to grow into a modern democracy -- then the West has a long-term stake in its success. But if the real Russia is instead the seething fury visible on the nightly news, the glory-mongering defender of murderous hypernationalism, then its success looms fearsomely as a threat.
So the United States thinks of Russia mostly in the short run. And even in the short run, it's not easy to noodle out whether America's interests are best served by a Russia that is robust, or one that is weak. For undeniably, Russia's current sallow state has given the United States license to act in ways that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, when two superpowers bestrode the world.
The steady drip-drip of bombing runs by American jets over Iraq would be far riskier were Russia able to bolster its old ally, Saddam Hussein, or wield more clout in the United Nations Security Council.
Russia's decline has shifted the balance of power further toward America in the Middle East. It has opened potentially strategic oil deposits in Russia's Caspian Sea backyard to American companies, and spawned a game of pipeline-building politics in which the effect of American policy -- and even perhaps the intent -- is to weaken Russia's influence with other members of the former Soviet Union.
Last weekend's declaration by NATO that the alliance had broadened its mission to battling proliferation and genocide outside its borders would have been impossible were Russia a force in world affairs.
Indeed, the Russians complain bitterly, they acquiesced to NATO's absorption of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic this year only after being assured that the alliance was fundamentally defensive -- and that Russia would have a voice, if not a veto, in its policies.
Yugoslavia, of course, is the marquee example, the epitome of the American policy conundrum -- and the sum of all Russia's fears. Does a weak Russia serve American interests? Absolutely. Russians are furious over NATO's decision to intervene in what they see as a civil war. They are even more furious over Washington's turning a deaf ear to their objections -- indeed, over the decision to authorize bombing as Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov was crossing the Atlantic to meet President Clinton.
But would a stronger Russia serve American interests? The United States seems to believe so; bogged down after 40 days of bombing, Washington and its NATO allies have embraced Moscow as the best hope for getting the Yugoslav strong man Slobodan Milosevic to the bargaining table.
Russians are exquisitely sensitive to the contrast. Western leaders support Russia's mediation of the crisis "for a very simple reason -- they want to convince Russia to put pressure on Milosevic to make him accept NATO's ultimatum, in order to stop the military action and say that NATO has won," Alexei G. Arbatov, the deputy chairman of the defense committee in Russia's lower house of parliament, said at a seminar last week. "This is not a request for Russia to facilitate the peace process. This is pressure on Russia."
From the American perspective, ignoring a weakened Russia now seems cost-free. Sure, Moscow still has 7,000 nuclear warheads, but nobody thinks that even the craziest Russian nationalist is about to fire them. But there's a long run in Russia, too, and a Moscow that sees the United States as its enemy can play some cards, from weapons proliferation to cozying up to China. Nor can anyone assume that Russia, with more oil than anyplace, will always be a beggar.
Dmitri K. Simes, a leading scholar of Russia who is president of the Nixon Institute, a Washington-based foreign policy research organization, says he understands why Moscow feels used. In his view, the United States sincerely wanted to enlist Russia as a strategic partner, but its decision to hang its entire policy on President Boris N. Yeltsin and his team of reformers -- even as Mr. Yeltsin became more autocratic and unpopular and the reforms were eaten away by corruption -- left precisely the opposite impression.
"And when these individuals and those policies all collapsed in August of '98," Mr. Simes said, "I think the Administration found itself without a policy -- with a lot of frustration, with an absence of new ideas and, if you wish, a perverse sense of satisfaction that if Russia didn't quite live up to the Administration's expectations, at a minimum they were in such a mess that they didn't have to take them seriously.
"I think the Russians have sensed that on a variety of issues -- Iraq, Kosovo, arms transfers, Caspian pipelines. On all those issues, the Administration is talking about partnership, but in each case its idea of partnership is that Russia would walk in lockstep with Administration policies."
Militarily and politically enfeebled, Russia has swallowed hard and accepted American policy on many of those issues -- even in Kosovo, where Russia basically supported United States positions in the United Nations. But on the other hand, Mr. Simes said, "there's a difference between impotence and acceptance of American policies."
It is with Yugoslavia that that difference, long concealed under a veneer of Russian-American cooperation, has burst into view.
"This is a clash of civilizations," Alexei Podberezkin, the deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian parliament's lower house, said last week. "They offer us an aggressive and virtually Protestant model of democracy -- no, they impose it on us. What is happening in Yugoslavia and what happened in Bosnia and Croatia is an attempt to impose the Western understanding of values, including democratic ones. But Russia may have other values -- cultural, historical and democratic."
Leonid N. Dobrokhotov, a former aide at the Communist Party Central Committee in the 1980's and now an adviser to the party's chairman, Gennady Zyuganov, put it more elegantly in an interview last week.
"As a result of the actions in Yugoslavia, we've again found our natural enemy," he said. "The problem isn't Milosevic. This is a geopolitical problem."
More and more Russians agree, which underscores one of the dangers of short-run policies: Strung end to end, they become the long run. Some Russians now argue -- and Mr. Simes said he fears -- that with Yugoslavia, American policy toward Russia may have crossed that divide.

They Might Even Meet Alan Greenspan Himself

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
It comes as no surprise that teen-agers would love to meet the Chicago Bulls or the Spice Girls. But how about shaking hands with members of the Federal Open Market Committee? Well, for high school students in the final rounds today and tomorrow of the Fed Challenge, a sort of monetary-policy bee for budding macroeconomists, the committee has star power.
Teams in the finals, held each year in Washington, typically portray members of the committee, which sets the nation's monetary policy in discussions of financial conditions and debates over whether to adjust interest rates. Then the teams are grilled by judges recruited by the Federal Reserve, which runs the event. 
 The students' knowledge sometimes amazes the judges. Lloyd Bromberg, director of educational programs for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who has been a judge for the contest in the past, recalled one contestant who quoted from an arcane report by the Fed bank in Kansas City, Mo. "The judges looked to each other and said, 'I didn't read that article,' " Mr. Bromberg said.
Now in its fifth year, the contest shows evidence of changing the way economics is taught. Several high schools around the country offer college-credit courses that prepare students for the Fed Challenge, according to Federal Reserve officials. A powerful incentive is the prize money, provided by Citigroup: a $40,000 grant for the winning school, a $10,000 scholarship for each of the five members of its team and $10,000 for their teacher.
This year's finalists will meet some members of the committee they have studied and portrayed -- and perhaps an even bigger monetary star. It's not certain yet whether the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, will be there this year, but Mr. Bromberg said that in 1997, the students "lit up," when Mr. Greenspan appeared to award the trophy.

An Off-Key Finale for a Spectacular April

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the last day of April with a whimper, suffering its biggest loss of the month on concerns the economy was growing too fast, threatening to hasten inflation and cause interest rates to rise.
 But over the month, the Dow did not go quietly: it rose 10 percent, crossing the 10,000 milestone; set 13 new highs, and flirted with 11,000 before closing at 10,789.04 on Friday. 
 In the first four months of the year, the Dow added 18 percent, surpassing what it gained for all of 1998.
 It has been one of the most spectacular months ever for the Dow, Scott Bleier, chief market strategist for Prime Charter Ltd., told Reuters on Friday.
 Investors jumped on inflationary fears and the month's end as reasons to take profits. When you consider the market has risen almost 1,000 points in the past four weeks, investors have a good excuse to sit back and enjoy some of their recent winnings, Charles Crane, market strategist at Key Asset Management, told The Associated Press on Friday.
 In Europe, markets ended the week higher, with a 1.93 percent rise in London and a 3.3 percent increase in Paris and Frankfurt. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: Political Muscle: The Only Good Enemy is a Strong/Weak Enemy;
When Allies Are Fierce Competitors

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LATE in the day on April 6, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson showed up at the White House with some bad news for President Clinton: The leakage of nuclear secrets from America's weapons labs was far worse than anyone thought. The Chinese -- whose Prime Minister was on his way to Washington -- may have obtained computer codes that are the key ingredient for simulating nuclear weapons explosions.
It was the kind of chilling discovery that would make for a good Washington thriller. But real life is more complex. In a speech the next morning, Mr. Clinton said Americans do indeed have reason to worry about China, but not only a muscular China with the latest weapons technology. Americans have as much to fear, he argued, from a weak China whose ailing banks and bankrupt enterprises could undermine the world economy. 
 "If we've learned anything in the last few years from Japan's long recession and Russia's current economic troubles, it is that the weaknesses of great nations can pose as big a challenge to America as their strengths," Mr. Clinton said. "So as we focus on the potential challenge that a strong China could present to the United States in the future, let us not forget the risk of a weak China, beset by internal conflicts, social dislocation and criminal activity, becoming a vast zone of instability in Asia."
It was the starkest moment yet in what has emerged as the central foreign policy conundrum in Washington: In an age when your military adversary can also rank among your biggest trading partners, and when your military allies double as your fiercest economic competitors, does America want weak global neighbors or strong ones?
That question is increasingly the subtext of daily debate here, fracturing the Democratic and Republican parties across unusual lines, trapping lawmakers and pundits in circular arguments about where America's true interests lie. It helps account for the crazy-quilt of American foreign policy. And the problem is made more complex by the fact that the world stage is crowded by weak states -- countries that are jockeying for global influence while struggling to keep from drowning in debt, self-doubt and rising unemployment.
The Japanese, once masters of the art of converting old-fashioned capital into political capital, have watched their global influence decline faster than the price of an office building in the Ginza. While Russia tries to flex old muscles in the Balkans, it is submitting to the humiliation of having the International Monetary Fund micro-manage its economy. (Last week, spurred by fears that Moscow is feeling dangerously alienated from the West, the I.M.F. finally committed to $4.5 billion in new loans for the nearly insolvent Government, just enough to stave off national default for another year or so.)
The Chinese spies who may be tinkering with the nuclear codes are probably thankful for the fact that, unlike millions of others who toil for the state, their jobs are going to be around for a while. And then there are the Europeans, who are slogging through a war in Yugoslavia just at the moment that their economies are slowing and their new currency, the Euro, has fallen 10 percent. This was supposed to be the year the continent focused on becoming the next great economic superpower, linked by a single currency and a huge market. Instead, one European finance minister visiting Washington last week moaned, "We're spending all our political energy on a 600-year-old problem."
"It's an extraordinary moment that perhaps we haven't seen since the '20's, or at least since the days of the Marshall Plan," said Kenneth Courtis, the chief Asian economist for Deutsche Bank. "You have the world economy flying on one engine -- the United States. And almost everyone else is dealing from a weak hand."
You would think this would leave Washington filled with joy, and often it does. After all, that single engine still has its afterburners lit: The Government reported Friday an astounding 4.5 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, once again beating virtually every forecast. It's hard to imagine any country threatening America's sole-superpower status for decades. It's even harder to recall that only a decade ago Washington was still preoccupied with Japan's buying spree in Hollywood and on Wall Street, and wringing its hands about the successes of Asian-style capitalism. But the celebration of American supremacy sometimes obscures the far more complex risks of managing world affairs amid global economic and political fragility. And the truth is that Washington is still a lot more comfortable containing an easily identifiable enemy than managing a system where cracks on one side of the globe can radiate to the other.
Part of the problem is that weakness comes in many forms. There is Russian-style weakness, an inability of the state machinery to make the country function, to keep control. Whatever temporary pleasure Americans derived from watching the Russian military threat fall apart has been tempered by the fear that economic chaos has put its nuclear expertise up for sale. "During the cold war we knew that Russia's nukes were under strict control, but we were terrified of the people controlling them," said Michael Mandelbaum, a Johns Hopkins University professor who has written about the new challenges of managing a global system in which leaders are overwhelmed by the forces around them. "Now the fear about Russia is that nothing is under anyone's clear control -- not the taxation system and not the atomic-industrial complex."
And then there is Japanese-style weakness, a subject President Clinton will be carefully dancing around on Monday as Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi arrives for an official visit. In Tokyo the problem isn't a collapsing state; it's a chronic inability to get political consensus, whether the issue is bolstering security in Asia or remaking the world's second-largest economy.
Mr. Obuchi will be arriving with the news that the lower house of Parliament has finally passed legislation that would allow it, in theory, to act like a real ally of American forces should a military emergency break out in the Pacific. But the bill was stripped of several key elements, including one that would let Tokyo participate in enforcing international sanctions, and the Pentagon still fears that if North Korea lashes out, Japan may sit on its hands.
OF more immediate concern is whether Japan's seven-year recession is finally ending, as the Japanese insist. If not, Japan's troubles could choke off Asia's fragile recovery and force the United States to continue taking in a wildly disproportionate amount of the world's exports. Sooner or later, that will cost American jobs, which is why Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin warned again last week that America's soaring trade deficits are "not politically sustainable." But in Japan's case, as in Russia's, Washington has few levers to pull.
In fact, Washington is never quite sure with whom it should be negotiating. Mr. Obuchi has scant control over the pace of Japanese reforms. That power is in the hands of the country's scared corporate heads, its much-criticized bureaucrats and its workers, who are terrified by the rising unemployment rate and know that they have few options if they lose their job.
If Boris N. Yeltsin was once committed to reforming the Russian economy, he has given it up. It is notable that ever since Russia's currency devaluation and default on some of its debt last August, the Clinton Administration has cut back on providing free advice about the wonders of making the transition to a market economy. "It would only stoke their resentments further," one senior State Department official said. "We're wiser to shut up about reform."
But at least there is some agreement in Washington that a stronger Japan and an economically stable Russia are in the country's interests. Raise the subject of China, and it's a different story. On Capitol Hill these days, China is once again a power to be contained.
The revelations of nuclear espionage bolster the arguments of conservatives who say the Clinton Administration has been blinded by big business and big donors, and that it buried the evidence of transgressions at Los Alamos because they threatened the policy of engagement. Add their voices to those of human rights groups who are horrified by China's recent crackdowns, unions that fear trade deals, and Taiwan supporters who want more protection from the mainland's missiles.
At the other end of the spectrum are Mr. Clinton and many of America's China experts, who see 100 million jobless wandering the Chinese countryside, failing state-owned enterprises and insolvent banks that -- at the Government's insistence -- keep those enterprises afloat. And there are Russia-like symptoms: arms proliferation, the rising power of organized crime, a military in business for itself.
The theory of integrating China into the World Trade Organization -- the deal President Clinton walked away from earlier this month -- is that it would help the Chinese pull off the feat that the Russians couldn't. It would force China to deal in a Western legal system, to open up, to let a billion Web users bloom.
A nice theory, but the reality is that Washington wants China, like Russia, to be strong on Washington's terms. Washington wants to encourage Chinese economic strength and discourage military strength; it wants nations to independently find their own way to a market economy -- as long as it runs strictly according to Western rules. In short, Washington wants strong economies run by leaders who will shrink their military power and act weakly beyond their borders. But Washington is not likely to get what it wants.

HEADLINE: Final Return Of the Canal Colors Vote In Panama

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: PANAMA, May 1

 BODY:
The "Trautenbels," a 484-foot cargo ship, was ushered from the Pacific Ocean into the Panama Canal by tugboats, and by two electric towing locomotives into a water lane. Steel gates snapped shut, enclosing the ship in a chamber, inside which it was lifted by rising water, a process repeated twice more at different points for a voyage up to 85 feet above sea level, across mountains now flooded by artificial lakes.
Up close, the Panama Canal is a fascinating feat of engineering, an American-made 50-mile passage that carries more than 13,000 ships and 190 million tons of cargo a year between two oceans and that, this year, the United States will relinquish to Panama -- along with about $4 billion worth of property. 
 The canal and the prospects for an economic boom based on the property Panama will inherit are by far the most important issue looming over Sunday's presidential election, a contest between the son of Gen. Omar Torrijos, who negotiated the Panama Canal Treaty with President Carter in 1977, and the widow of a President ousted by the General. The winner, whose tenure is limited to one five-year term, will preside over the Dec. 31 handover.
The canal is so hallowed that the candidates, locked in a tight race, agreed that it could not be the subject of electoral mudslinging.
But it is Panamanians' fervent desire to use the handover to help eradicate high unemployment and poverty rates and help this country of 2.8 million people toward a brighter future.
The next administration faces the challenge of disposing of the valuable real estate the United States is leaving and replacing the jobs and income earned from the American bases, which has run to as much as $350 million a year. It must also operate the canal, which brings about $545 million a year in tolls, oversee its expansion and prevent deforestation of the watershed.
Polls showed the election to be a close match. In Panama's clique-ridden politics, Martin Torrijos, a 35-year-old, is trading heavily on the memory of his father, who died in a 1981 plane crash. And his opponent, 52-year-old Mireya Moscoso, is the widow of Dr. Arnulfo Arias, who was elected President three times only to be deposed by the military each time, the last just days after taking office in 1968, in the military coup that installed Gen. Torrijos.
Although both have been active in the political scene in the 90's, each has sparse experience in government. Their political platforms have broad similarities. Both oppose privatization of certain services and promise honest government.
Mr. Torrijos has served as Deputy Minister of Government and Justice for the current President, Ernesto Perez Balladares, and is the candidate of the governing Democratic Revolutionary Party.
Both Panamanians and Americans have fears that future Governments may divert canal money for their own benefit, and Mr. Balladares did little to assuage them when he packed the Panama Canal Authority, the agency that is supposed to govern the canal's operations starting next year, with relatives and cronies. Leaders of the governing party have also been allowed to rent, with an option to buy below market value, some of the best of the reverting properties.
Public outrage over the actions was cited here among the factors leading voters last September to reject a constitutional amendment to allow him to serve a second term.
Since the Panama Canal was completed in 1914, the bulk of its revenue has usually been invested in maintenance and modernization. While the handover of the 569-square mile American canal zone has been seamless so far -- 95 percent of its more than 7,000 employees are Panamanian, working under a Panamanian administrator -- there is great uncertainty about the fate of the valuable property that comes with it.
Only about 4,000 Americans, mostly Army and Air Force personnel, remain of the 10,000 military personnel once stationed here. When they leave at the end of the year, Panama will be left with the task of somehow transforming the American military's property into the centerpiece of a longed-for bonanza.
If all goes according to the plans, or dreams, then barracks, hospitals, schools, airstrips, churches, houses, offices and manicured lawns will become private housing, hotels, a university, sports centers, and industrial parks at the center of an envisaged export boom.
Already, $1 billion has been invested by Panama and other countries, from Spain to Taiwan, mostly in tourism and maritime-related services, Panamanian officials say. The old School of the Americas, for instance, where Latin American military officers trained, is turning into a luxury hotel. Part of the Albrook Air Force Station has been sold to American former canal workers for a retirement community of 147 families.
But most of the really valuable property -- nine military bases -- will only be transferred over the next eight months. The future of that real estate hinges on the ability of Panama to attract more investors, said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, administrator of Interoceanic Region Authority, created in 1993 to manage the property reverting to Panama.
"The property is going to be worth what we make it produce," Mr. Barletta said. Some properties that have already reverted are fallow and deteriorating, even as others are being developed.
Besides the economic questions posed by the handover, some Panamanians worry about losing the American military, whose presence has served as a deterrent against incursions by Colombian guerrillas. Now, the border with Colombia will be guarded only by police, for Panama has no army.

HEADLINE: The Logic of Kosovo

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic's promise yesterday to release three captive American soldiers suggests that he may now be looking to end the war in Yugoslavia. But unless a diplomatic settlement materializes quickly, the war could well extend through the spring, if not beyond. As the American people brace for a sustained military campaign, they deserve a clearer account of America's goals from President Clinton and of how the national interest would be served by achieving them. Anyone who doubts the demand for a compelling rationale for the war need look no further than the House of Representatives, which last week stunned Washington by refusing on a tie vote to support the NATO air offensive.
Though partisan maneuvering by the Republicans was partly responsible for the unfortunate outcome, the deadlocked House was a symbol of national ambivalence that Mr. Clinton cannot afford to ignore. The problem is not that Mr. Clinton has failed to outline military and political objectives for Kosovo. He has done so in some detail. But he has so far failed to connect those aims with larger American interests in a way that convinces a majority of his countrymen that war with Mr. Milosevic is warranted and may have to be waged for months. 
 After 40 days of bombing, the military and political picture in Kosovo has changed in ways that the White House and NATO did not fully anticipate. As a result, some clarification and redefinition of purpose are required.
One of the original objectives of the air war -- protecting the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo from Serbian aggression -- has proved unattainable. Each day brings a new wave of bedraggled refugees to Albania and Macedonia, and with them stories of unspeakable abuses and killing by the Serbian forces. Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, has acknowledged that alliance missiles and bombs cannot stop the bloodletting. Even if NATO wanted to send a ground force into Kosovo, which it does not, it would take two or three months to assemble the troops and weapons, more than enough time for Mr. Milosevic to finish his ethnic cleansing.
That unpleasant fact means that this war is now being fought primarily over the future of Kosovo, a cause that is harder to define and more difficult to sell to Americans than the defense of innocent civilians under brutal attack. It is also a cause that will be difficult, though not necessarily impossible, to advance with air power alone.
The goals Mr. Clinton has enunciated for Kosovo are honorable and desirable. They include the return of the refugees, the restoration of a high degree of political autonomy for Kosovo and the creation of a secure environment in which Serbian forces could no longer threaten ethnic Albanians.
To gain the support of the country, Mr. Clinton has to place those aims in a broader framework. We believe that freedom, human rights and the preservation of a civilized society are critical principles bound up in the conflict in Kosovo, and that Mr. Milosevic's effort to drive the Balkans into a new dark age must be resisted. While Serbia does not present a military threat to the rest of Europe, and unlike Iraq cannot impede the flow of oil, its genocidal assault on Kosovo cannot go unanswered.
With the cold war over, the country needs to devise a new calculus for determining when its security is threatened and the use of force is warranted. Kosovo is a test case. If the United States and its NATO allies are prepared to let a tyrant in the Balkans slaughter his countrymen and overrun his neighbors with hundreds of thousands of refugees, other combustible regions of Europe may face similar upheavals. History teaches that instability in Europe inevitably hurts the United States, and can produce larger conflicts.
Just how Washington and its allies defend these interests in the Balkans will depend on military and diplomatic developments in the weeks ahead. The application of air power, which is now crippling the Serbian economy, may be forcing Mr. Milosevic to seek peace. The bombing must be given time to work. The option of an invasion should be kept open, if only to pressure Mr. Milosevic.
Release of the prisoners to the Rev. Jesse Jackson would be a welcome gesture by Mr. Milosevic. The Clinton Administration, with the assistance of Russia, which is now trying to broker a peace deal, should look for ways to build on Belgrade's apparent interest in containing, if not ending, the conflict. While Mr. Clinton's peace terms should shape a settlement, there may be space within them to work out an accord. NATO has already offered more flexible terms for a cease-fire and Mr. Milosevic has given a little ground on allowing peacekeepers in Kosovo when the war ends. Moscow's apparent readiness to back an armed international peacekeeping force in Kosovo can help advance diplomacy, as can Mr. Milosevic's willingness to accept some kind of United Nations role in the province.
But whatever course Mr. Clinton chooses, the country must be satisfied it is worth the sacrifices that may be required. If Mr. Clinton hopes to prevail in Kosovo, he will first have to secure the support of the American people and of Congress.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE NEIGHBORHOOD;
Front-Line Hungary Feels Anxiety

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, May 1

 BODY:
At night, Attila Chikan's mother, a woman in her 70's whose generation recalls World War II, hears the bombers over Yugoslavia, even though, her son says, "from where she lives, it's physically impossible."
For the generation of Mr. Chikan, 55, Hungary's Economics Minister, the war over Kosovo is a sharp contrast to memories of vacations in Yugoslavia in the 1970's, when Tito's reform Communism inspired restless young Hungarian economists. 
 The minister, a professor of economics, is also in touch with students. That generation, he said, "doesn't understand the war, from the point of view of rationality."
In less than a decade, Hungary has gone from a front-line member of the old Warsaw Pact in a cold war to being a front-line state in NATO's first hot war, and the experience is straining the nation of 10 million -- politically, economically, militarily, and individually.
This week, the first NATO tankers began flying from Hungary, and attack aircraft will soon use its air bases for their sorties. A sense of anxiety hangs over Hungary, a sense of support but not enthusiasm for the war, and even that is not felt uniformly through the generations of a nation that persistently finds itself sitting astride the fault line between East and West.
The war erupted less than two weeks after Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic joined NATO. Hungary's willingness to aid the war effort has angered Russia, its former ally. A visit to Moscow by the Hungarian Foreign Minister was canceled and Moscow recalled its Ambassador for consultations.
The war threatens the Hungarian economy, which only recently began recovering from the financial shock of last year's Russian economic meltdown and which is faced with slowing growth in western Europe, now its major trade partner.
Hungary, its people are quick to point out, is the only NATO state bordering Yugoslavia, and there are misgivings over the fate of the Hungarian minority in Serbia's Vojvodina region, north of Belgrade. Vojvodina Hungarians, some fleeing military conscription in Yugoslavia, others uncomfortable with the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic, are fleeing to Hungary.
They are joined by a wave of Serbs, not impoverished masses like many of the Albanians from Kosovo who have flooded Albania and Macedonia, but middle class people and members of the political opposition, disillusioned after years of peaceful dissent as much by NATO's bombs as by Mr. Milosevic.
Sztojan Vujicsics, a Hungarian writer of Serbian descent (in some of his writings he uses the Serbian spelling of his name, Stojan Vujicic), said Hungarians are intent on fulfilling their obligations to NATO. "But they don't want to destroy Serbian-Hungarian relations, which are very ancient," he said. "The war will end, with all its consequences. But neighbors are neighbors, and we will continue living here."
After five weeks of air strikes, with NATO appearing to stumble politically and militarily, he said, "a dilemma is arising both among intellectuals and the common people."
"There is rising anxiousness," he added.
Like many in this corner of Europe, Mr. Vujicsics' family reflects Hungary's complex historical weave. In the 17th century, his forebears fled Turkish expansion in Serbia. Ever since, his family has remained here, in the heart of a sizable Serbian community. Now he welcomes the latest wave of refugees.
Otto Horvath is the son of Hungarians from Novi Sad, in northern Yugoslavia. Shortly after the bombs began falling there, he and his wife left for Budapest, where he has family. They managed to cross the Yugoslav border on a technicality involving a German visa Mr. Horvath had obtained for academic purposes.
Although Hungarian is his mother tongue, Mr. Horvath, 32, speaks fluent Serbian. Indeed, in 1987, when he was barely 20, his first thin volume of Serbian verse was awarded Yugoslavia's most prestigious young poets' prize.
"Hungary could have been an intermediary," he said, over coffee, with bitterness.
He is no friend of Mr. Milosevic, but the bombs, he said, are destroying civil society in Yugoslavia. "The land is destroyed, there is no money, no economy," he said. He does not intend to return when the war ends.
Compared with Yugoslavia, Hungary is flourishing, and he and his wife quickly found work teaching. Like some other Yugoslavs, ethnic Hungarian and not, they have found the Hungarian Government fairly uninterested in their lack of citizenship.
Last year, growth here was 5.1 percent, and at least 4 percent is expected this year, double the rate in western Europe. The Budapest stock market, battered last summer by the Russian crisis, has sprung back.
Yet when Laszlo Koszonits, managing director of Mahart, Hungary's river shipping company, looks out over the Danube from an office a block away, he sees that it is empty of ships. Earlier this month, NATO bombs destroyed bridges over the river in Novi Sad, paralyzing traffic on one of Europe's longest inland waterways, a vital artery for the Balkans, central Europe and Germany.
"Four ships and 24 barges -- 20 percent of our total capacity -- are stranded," he said. Revenues this year are projected to be a third to a half lower than last year's $20 million.
Cruise liners no longer ply the Danube from Vienna to the Black Sea, hurting tourism. The Dunaferr steelworks, down-river at Dunaujvaros, is scrambling for alternative carriers for the iron ore it hauls up from the Black Sea and the steel rolls and sheets it ships out, said Mihaly Schneider, the marketing director, at an increased cost that make the steel less competitive.
Oddly, said Mr. Koszonits, "the West paid to destroy those bridges, and the West will have to pay to rebuild them."
Hungarian officials fear the war's effects on tourism, which accounts for 9 percent of the economy. And Moscow's anger could lead to cuts in oil and gas supplies, which come mainly from Russia, and would cost more to replace.
While NATO membership has increased Hungary's attractiveness to foreign investors, the effect could be neutralized if investors perceive the war-torn region as inherently unstable.
There are no signs this is happening yet. Nokia, the Finnish phone company, is building a big research center here, and the German car maker, Audi, plans a $335 million factory. But the longer the war lasts, the greater the risk becomes. "I think it grows exponentially, because of the increasing mistrust of this area." Mr. Chikan said.
Tamas Wachsler, the State Secretary in the Defense Ministry, said Hungary has sent a 35-member medical team to Albania, and its military planes are airlifting food and other supplies for the refugees there. But to protect its minority in Yugoslavia, Budapest has told NATO that Hungarian troops will not get directly involved in the war, and that there is no way Hungary could be used as a staging base for a NATO ground invasion of Yugoslavia.
"We would like to avoid Hungarians under the NATO flag fighting against Hungarian conscripts under the Yugoslav flag," Mr. Wachsler said.
Jozsef Kasza, the ethnic Hungarian Mayor of Subotica, the largest Hungarian city in Yugoslavia, recently warned Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, against "toying with the fate" of the Vojvodina Hungarians.
With the expulsion of the Kosovar Albanians, said Mr. Wachsler, the Hungarians are Yugoslavia's last minority, "which is of primary concern to the Hungarian Government, obviously."
For now, at least, there are no signs that Belgrade is moving against the ethnic Hungarian minority. Indeed, Hungarian newspapers have reported promotions of ethnic Hungarian officers in the Yugoslav Army, in an apparent bid for loyalty, although Mr. Wachsler said he could not confirm this.
Surveys in Hungary show 55 percent of the people supporting the air strikes, and 75 percent backing NATO membership, up from 60 percent at the time of accession in March. Yet two-thirds back the ban on using Hungarian troops in action.
With the dismemberment of the old Hungary by the Trianon Treaty of 1920, Hungarian minorities remain not only in Yugoslavia, but also in Slovakia and Romania. Governments in both those countries now include Hungarian ministers. More than anything else, sensitivity to minority rights appears to steel Budapest's resolve in Yugoslavia.
Janos Martonyi, the Foreign Minister, said that "patience and determination" were required.
"In the end, we cannot allow it when a government decides to massacre one part of its population based on religious or ethnic issues," he said. At the end of World War II, he said, "there was fundamental agreement that that could never happen again."
"Everybody has to understand that NATO just cannot lose," he said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: BELGRADE;
An Ordinary Serb, Lost In Air Attack, Is Buried

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, May 1

 BODY:
In one of the ordinary epics of everyday life, they buried Tomislav Mitrovic today.
He was 60 years old, with a wife, Lila; two daughters, Ivana and Jelena; a grandson, Kosta; and an informally adopted son, Dejan, the grown child of his best friend, who had died years before. 
 Mr. Mitrovic was a program director for Radio Television Serbia, the state-run broadcaster that gives the news much as President Slobodan Milosevic wants it given. Mr. Mitrovic was on the overnight shift on April 22-23, when NATO missiles hit the station to silence what the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, had called "as much a part of Milosevic's murder machine as his military."
Mr. Mitrovic, known as Tomi, was the 11th body pulled from the rubble of the station. They found him -- or, more precisely, they were able to identify him -- on April 29, six days after the explosion. He was in the control room that night, coordinating camera positions and tape for the early morning news, roughly where the missile impacted.
Those who died in the 2:10 A.M. strike were people like Darko Stoimenovski, 26, a technician who had helped foreigners transmit their footage; Ksenija Bankovic, 28, a video mixer; Jelica Munitlak, 27, a make-up artist; Milan Joksimovic, a 46-year-old security guard, and Tomi Mitrovic. Sixteen of the 100 people in the building that night are dead or still missing.
Everyone knew the station was a likely target. But the workers had been told by their editor, Dragoljub Milanovic, who was not in the building, that for reasons of patriotism and need they would work their assigned night shifts or they could pick up their work papers and find another job, losing their pensions.
Mr. Mitrovic, well liked in the way congenial, competent people are in any technical profession, was a year away from retirement in a country deformed by years of international sanctions, economic mismanagement, ethnic hatred and civil war.
"You retire in a year, and you're told to work or leave now and lose your pension," said another employee of the station.
"It's less than $100 a month, but it's still something. And in a country broken like this one, you can't afford it."
Mr. Mitrovic was the best man at the wedding of Dejan's father, which brings with it special responsibilities here. He was the "kum" (pronounced koom) of this second family, like a godparent but more. Dejan's father, Mihajlo, had been a lawyer, a sophisticated and cosmopolitan man with important connections in Yugoslavia and big expectations for his son.
But Mr. Mitrovic was the salt of the earth, an easygoing man whose company Dejan's father cherished. And when Dejan wanted to become a journalist, and his father was horrified, it was Mr. Mitrovic who interceded, again and again, and kept a peace between the two.
"He started in television in the early '60's as the guy who delivered the mail," Dejan said. "He had no sons, but there was this little boy who was the son of his best friend." Here, hating it, Dejan's face slowly collapsed, tears surging from his eyes as if a pipe had broken.
"When I talked about journalism," Dejan finally said, "my parents were so embarrassed, but he supported me. He said, 'Do what you care about and the money will come.' "
When Dejan's father died in the hospital in early 1995 after a long illness, it was Mr. Mitrovic who went to identify the body. And it was Mr. Mitrovic who brought the family the wedding ring that he had carried to the nuptials of his best friend many years before.
"Tomi loved America," Dejan said. "He built himself an American house, and everyone joked about it, but they admired it. He built a ranch house, with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. He saw it somewhere and he liked it, so he built one."
The living room and dining room are connected; there is a nice garden and a very un-Serbian lawn: Mr. Mitrovic used to cut the grass short, American-style.
"He had a wife, two daughters, a grandchild, a couple of cats and a dog who appeared one day," Dejan said. "He was just one of the people working there. He had no influence on the programs or on Milosevic. He just switched the cameras and the programs from channel to channel. He was a professional. He worked for his salary. If the political opposition ran the station, he'd work for them, too."
He and Dejan used to talk politics, and after 30 years of being a faithful reader of Politika, then as now the mouthpiece of whatever regime rules in Belgrade, Mr. Mitrovic stopped reading the paper in the winter of 1996-1997. Then, months of pro-democracy and anti-Milosevic demonstrations roiled the country, and state television refused to cover those demonstrations for a month, as if they did not exist.
The demonstrators called the station "the Bastille," and some of the windows still covered with plastic, even after NATO's bombing, were those broken by the stones of democracy's advocates.
"But the West did nothing then," the state television journalist said. "They had a chance to push out Milosevic and did nothing." He laughed harshly. "They certainly didn't bomb."
Mr. Mitrovic became embarrassed by the station's politics. "He was no supporter of Milosevic," said Dejan, now 31. "I had these debates with him. But you know, older people have this distance. They have so much to lose."
Dejan stopped again, busied himself with a cigarette, looking away. "He told me, 'You know, at this age, what can I do?' "
Tomislav Mitrovic was mourned by hundreds today at the Topcider cemetery. He was just one out of the many dead, Albanian and Serb.
The night the missile hit, said Slobodan Novakovic, speaking today at the graveside, Mr. Mitrovic told his subordinates to go home, while he remained on duty. "He showed enormous courage," Mr. Novakovic said.
"He was an ordinary man but a special man," Dejan said, again in tears. "He was my father's best friend, and he became my friend. And he was guilty of nothing."

HEADLINE: W. S. Salant, 87, Economist From the Keynesian School

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Walter S. Salant, who as a graduate student in the 1930's and later as a Government and private economist helped infuse the revolutionary teachings of John Maynard Keynes into Washington policy deliberations, died on Friday at a hospice near his home in Washington. He was 87.
After graduating from Harvard University in 1933, Mr. Salant attended the lectures of Keynes at Cambridge University, two years before he published "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" -- the discipline-shattering treatise that argued that industrialized economies, then mired in depression, were unlikely to recover on their own but could use Government spending and tax cuts to do so. 
 Mr. Salant returned to Harvard and joined the celebrated fiscal policy seminar run by Professors Alvin Hansen and John Williams that explored Keynes's new ideas and trained economists who went on to build a discipline forged in part on the Keynesian foundation.
"It was an economically depressed time," James Tobin, a Nobel laureate at Yale University, recalled in a recent interview. "Most older professors other than Hansen himself had no explanation or understanding of what was happening, and no solution. The idea that Keynes had an explanation and a solution that involved an intellectual revolution but not a proletarian revolution was a pretty exciting thing. Walter was part of the core Keynesian group, a major figure of what became the center of American Keynesianism."
Mr. Tobin calls a short book, "An Economic Program for American Democracy," that Mr. Salant co-wrote with a number of graduate students in 1938 a "Keynesian manifesto" -- one of the first strong polemics in the United States on behalf of more Government investment and other Keynesian ideas that were then revolutionary but would, because of the efforts of Mr. Salant and others, become mainstream.
Mr. Salant left Harvard for a series of Government positions. He served in the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commerce Department in the 1930's, and, in the 1940's, the Office of Price Administration and other agencies that designed the national strategy for wartime price controls. He was a senior staff member for international relations on the President's Council of Economic Advisers from 1946 to 1952. He later served as a consultant to NATO and in the Treasury Department in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. He left the Government in 1954 to become a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, staying until 1976.
Mr. Tobin credits Mr. Salant with helping to "internationalize Keynes." "The General Theory," Mr. Tobin said, "analyzed economies that engaged in no trade. Mr. Salant applied its lessons to a world that increasingly relied on trade and foreign investment -- analyzing how trade surpluses play the same role in an economy to create employment and output as do private investment or Government spending."
Prof. Charles P. Kindleberger of M.I.T. points to an influential report that Mr. Salant prepared for the Truman Administration showing that the proposed Marshall Plan -- a massive aid program for the reconstruction of Europe -- was affordable, financially feasible and would not, as critics feared, ignite a ruinous inflation.
Mr. Kindleberger also cites Mr. Salant's contributions to analyzing America's balance-of-trade deficits, a problem so severe that a senior official in the Kennedy Administration cited it along with nuclear arms as the two biggest issues confronting Government. A report that Mr. Salant wrote with Lorie Tarshis, Emile Despres, Alice Rivlin, now vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and other distinguished economists at the request of President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers laid out the proper economic role of the United States as the world's central bank. Just as central banks need to provide currency to their domestic economies, they said, the United States needs to supply dollars to the international economy. In a controversial article he wrote in 1966 with Mr. Kindleberger and Mr. Despres, Mr. Salant explained that a steady outflow of dollars to pay for the trade deficit was no economic catastrophe. Indeed the outflow was necessary to feed an international economy desperate for liquidity.
Ms. Rivlin says the staff of the Brookings Institution in the 1960's included many distinguished economists who, like Mr. Salant, worked on practical problems of economic policy. His colleagues included Kermit Gordon, Joseph Pechman, Herb Stein, Charles Schultze and Arthur Okun, all of whom served in the Federal budget office or on the Council of Economic Advisers. She also cites Mr. Salant's role as mentor. He was, she said, "one of those people who took you under his wing."
Mr. Salant was born in New York City in 1911 and received his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard in 1962. He served on the Board of Editors of the American Economic Review, the journal of the American Economic Association, from 1956 to 1958.
He is survived by his wife, Edna; two sons, Michael, of Washington, and Stephen, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and three grandchildren.
Referring to his decision to leave university life for Washington in the Depression, Mr. Salant wrote in a reminiscence of the New Deal that the spirit of the Roosevelt Administration brought in young people like himself, "generated ideas, fermentation, energy, a feeling that something was being done, that there was leadership when leadership was needed, that there was a relationship between the government and the people in which the government was the citizen's friend."

HEADLINE: Congress Weighs Bill to Expand the Cartel Letting Northeast Dairy Farmers Set Prices

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
In a fight pitting farmers' incomes against consumers' pocketbooks, Congress has begun a fierce debate over legislation that would allow dairy farmers in New York, New Jersey and other states to charge more for milk.
The bill would enable New York and New Jersey -- as well as Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania -- to join the six New England states in the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a two-year-old federally sanctioned cartel that sets a minimum wholesale price for milk. 
 The legislation, which would also authorize Southern states to create their own compact, would almost certainly raise prices at the cash register by a few pennies a gallon, and perhaps much more.
With 157 sponsors in the House and 39 sponsors in the Senate, the bill is well on its way to winning the 218 House votes and 51 Senate votes it needs for passage.
But consumer groups and businesses that process milk have led a vigorous lobbying campaign against the measure, contending that it would hurt the elderly and the poor. Anti-tax groups have also opposed the bill, saying it would have the effect of imposing a milk tax.
On the other side, environmentalists have joined farmers in asserting that the measure would help small dairy farmers stay in business, keep the region's milk supply steady and prevent the sale and development of pasture land. And Southern conservatives have locked arms with Northern liberals in supporting the bill, saying that, for the dairy industry at least, government regulation might be all right after all.
"The Federal Government already sets minimum prices for fluid milk," said Representative Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who is a lead sponsor of the bill. "I just want to improve the regulatory system."
The debate is immensely important to farmers like Tom A. Borden, a part owner of O. A. Borden & Sons Farms in Washington County, N.Y., 30 miles north of Albany. A sixth-generation dairy farmer who is distantly related to the founders of the Borden Foods Corporation, Mr. Borden, 44, said the legislation would increase his annual income by several thousand dollars, enough to cover part of his property taxes and equipment costs. Most important, he said, it would ease his anxieties about the roller-coaster milk market by guaranteeing a minimum level of revenue from his 160-cow herd.
"Anything that makes us healthier will make it more appealing for the next generation to take on the business," he said.
But Augustine Carson, 74, a retired postal worker from Harlem who tries to drink a quart of milk each day to combat her arthritis, said she feared that the legislation could end up squeezing her already tight budget. "If I had to pay more for milk, I'd have to cut down on other things," Ms. Carson said. "I know farmers work hard and have to make a little more money, but can't it come from some other source?"
The debate on Capitol Hill will be strongly colored by regional alliances, as the South and Northeast unite against the Midwest, and possibly the West, where farmers contend that dairy compacts will hurt their sales. Some urban legislators, including those from New York City, are also expected to oppose the bill.
The issue is particularly significant to New York State, the nation's third largest milk producer. Under intense pressure from the state's 8,300 dairy farmers -- down from 14,200 a decade ago -- Gov. George E. Pataki pushed a measure endorsing the compact through the Legislature last year by tying it to a pay increase for the lawmakers. Here in Washington, the state's Senators, Charles E. Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, both Democrats, support the Federal bill.
The bill would allow New York, New Jersey and Maryland -- whose legislatures have endorsed the compact -- to join the Northeast compact immediately. Delaware and Pennsylvania could also join once their legislatures approve it. And it would make the Northeast compact permanent. Because the system was controversial, the compact was devised as a test and is scheduled to go out of business on Oct. 1.
Sixteen Southern states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, would also be authorized to create a separate regional compact.
The Federal Government has been regulating the milk market since the Depression, and continues to set wholesale prices for drinking milk in most regions. But the Government has been scaling back price supports since the 1980's, causing wholesale prices to fluctuate more. Last month, for instance, the price paid to farmers for milk in New York plummeted to 99 cents per gallon from a record high of $1.50.
Farmers say that such wild changes have made it difficult to plan or get bank loans. They also say that declining consumption, coupled with increased productivity, have kept milk prices relatively low. The compact is intended to address both problems by setting prices that are steadier, and generally higher, than the Federal price.
Under compact rules, farmers receive the higher of the two prices. When the Federal price goes above the compact price, as it did late last year, the compact price goes out of effect, until the Federal price is the lower one. The compact price is set by a 26-member commission appointed by the governors of the six New England states.
Opponents contend that in states that join the Northeast compact, milk prices will rise by 20 cents to 40 cents per gallon. Higher prices, they say, will reduce sales, causing even more small farms to go out of business. The real beneficiaries of the arrangement, they maintain, are large farms, which would receive most of the additional revenue from higher prices. Such critics say the Government should try to emphasize benefits for small farmers by using tax cuts or aid programs that could reduce their utility bills, property taxes and feed costs.
"I am all for helping small farmers in our state, but this appears to be just helping big producers," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat representing Manhattan and Queens, who said she is likely to vote against the bill.
Proponents say that the Northeast compact has raised retail prices only a few cents a gallon and that increases above that have resulted from market forces. While the compact may require milk processors to pay more for milk, those increases will not necessarily be passed on to consumers, they say. And they assert that without the compact, small farms will continue to fail, causing supplies to decline and prices to rise.
"If we don't do this, many small farmers will go out of business and then milk production will be in the hands of a few," said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica who is pushing for the legislation. "And then you'll really see prices go up."
Supporters also note that the Northeast compact has exempted school lunch programs and the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program for low-income families from paying the higher milk price.
Dairy economists say both sides have been guilty of exaggeration.
Several economists say the Northeast compact has had a smaller effect on prices than the critics had predicted. Although prices in the six New England states rose sharply in the first month of the compact, July 1997, they fell back slightly and then leveled off.
Economists also question the central premise that compacts will help small farms avoid being bought out by larger ones. "This does precious little to prevent the structural change that is going on in the dairy industry," said Andrew Novakovic, director of Cornell University's dairy markets and policy program.

HEADLINE: Carolina Bank Robberies Show That Friendliness Carries a Price

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.

 BODY:
It is virtually impossible to drive past a major intersection here without seeing a bank. Some of the nation's largest banks -- including First Union and Nationsbank -- are based here, solidifying North Carolina's reputation as the banking state.
Banks are so numerous that North Carolina is one of the nation's leaders in the number of branches. 
 But if honest North Carolinians have no trouble finding a bank, neither do bank robbers. Even though bank robbery has been declining nationwide, the crime has become remarkably common here. The state's banks, credit unions and savings institutions were robbed 289 times last year, a 38 percent jump from 1997.
While numbers are not yet fully reported, North Carolina's rise in bank robberies last year appears to be near the nation's highest, according to the F.B.I. North Carolina had 38.9 for each million people last year, compared with Illinois and New Jersey, which had 21 and 11 robberies per million, respectively.
North Carolina's tally was so high that the F.B.I.'s field office in Charlotte, which covers the entire state, ranked fourth nationwide last year in the number of reported bank robberies, trailing only Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.
While bank officials are concerned about the rising number of robberies in North Carolina, they have not taken harsh measures to prevent them. In fact, the banks' friendliness to customers -- revered locally as Southern hospitality -- may actually increase the frequency of robberies.
Bank executives say robberies are a hazard of the industry. No one has a good explanation as to why the number of robberies is up one year and down the next. "I don't know how you avoid them," Harold T. Keen, president of KS Bank in Kenly, N.C., said. "This is not something that happens every month. And you don't want to have so much security that you inconvenience your customers."
Long regarded as the home of Big Tobacco, North Carolina has recently acquired another reputation. With so many banks concentrated in its urban areas, North Carolina has become a modern-day version of the Wild West, where holding up stage coaches became a national pastime. The two crimes are remarkably similar, law enforcement officials say, in that they are sometimes so randomly planned that many criminals settle on a target primarily on the basis of convenience.
"Bank robbery is a crime of opportunity," said Mark Rozzi, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Charlotte office. "The banks in North Carolina have a lot of branches that pride themselves on being friendly."
If the trend in North Carolina illustrates anything, law enforcement officials say, it is that robbing banks has changed little since Bonnie and Clyde became household names in the 1930's. Then as now, the number of bank holdups appeared to have less correlation with the economy's health than with the personalities of the robbers themselves.
"Bank robbers are antisocial," Dr. Ken Tardiss, a specialist in violent crime and a professor of psychiatry at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, said. "The economy may be doing well for some people but not for them. Or they may just want more money and have a feeling that they deserve it."
Once a bank robber has experienced the thrill of a holdup, it is difficult to abandon the glare of a security camera. Some 20 percent of the bank robbers who were convicted nationwide last year were repeat offenders; two of the most active were in North Carolina.
One, Mark Vernon Brindell, an unemployed landscaper from Wake Forest, was sentenced last year to five years in Federal prison for holding up seven banks near Raleigh. The other, Isaiah Belcher 3d, was sentenced to 20 years in Federal prison for robbing eight banks near Durham. Between them, Mr. Brindell and Mr. Belcher committed 5.2 percent of the state's bank robberies in 1998.
Even though Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow captured the American public's imagination, some law enforcement officials never regarded them as anything more than common hoodlums, too dumb to pull off more sophisticated crimes. While the F.B.I. maintains that there is no stereotypical bank robber, some crime experts insist that bank robbers are still among the dumbest thugs going. One North Carolina robber several years ago actually wrote the holdup note on the back of his deposit slip, while another tried to rob a bank's drive-through window from the back seat of a taxi.
"These people are not physicists," said Thad Woodard, president of the North Carolina Bankers Association. "A lot of times they are on drugs and need money to support their habit."
Hollywood's take on bank robbers -- including Bonnie and Clyde -- usually has them toting semiautomatic weapons and wearing tailored suits. While some robbers do wear disguises, most enter banks wearing street clothes, hand tellers written instructions and then make quiet getaways.
But there are exceptions. A masked man entered a KS Bank in October and wasted little time terrorizing the place. Hopping over the counter, he pushed the teller aside and yanked open the money drawer. As he grabbed stacks of bills, he shouted obscenities, bank officials said, until he leaped back over the counter and fled.
He has yet to be caught.
There appears to be a simplicity to the robberies. According to statistics compiled last year by the F.B.I. in North Carolina, a majority of bank robberies occurred on Fridays between 9 and 11 A.M. The F.B.I. does not dismiss the timing as happenstance.
"The reason these robberies happened when they did?" Mr. Rozzi said. "The robbers wanted money for the weekend."
Given the aptitude of the typical bank robber, it should come as no surprise that most are caught relatively quickly. The F.B.I. in North Carolina solved 70 percent of the state's bank robbery cases last year, well ahead of the 60 percent rate in the rest of the country.
"The bottom line of this is that bank robberies are just a foolish crime," Mr. Rozzi said. "There are easier ways to get more money."
What may be especially frustrating to most robbers is that few walk out with the amount of money they expected. Bank officials balk at releasing amounts taken during robberies, but crime experts insist that most of the time the loot is insubstantial.
F.B.I. statistics for North Carolina put the average take last year at $11,722, slightly above the nationwide average of $9,266, but the numbers were skewed by several vault robberies. Many robbers get only a few thousand dollars, bank officials said, since they take money primarily out of teller drawers.
Unlike most banks in the United States, branches in the Southeast seldom use common security measures like armed guards or bulletproof glass to protect tellers. Some bank officials say these measures would upset customers, who have grown accustomed to niceties like free coffee and personal greetings by branch employees.
"You have to understand that we have a different way of doing business down here," Mr. Woodard said. "Customers don't want to be frightened or overly stressed by security. Some customers feel so welcome here that they carry the teller a card or cake on her birthday."
Unfortunately, the banks were prone to a few other mishaps. Since the average teller nationwide works only six to nine months before quitting, it is difficult to provide extensive security training. All too often, law enforcement officials say, inexperienced tellers are unable to find the marked bills during a robbery or give the holdup note back when the robber did not ask for it.
"Our tellers go through extensive training," Mr. Keen said. "They are told what things to look for. But when someone sticks a gun in your face, what are you going to do?"
Concerned about the rise in robberies, several banks are experimenting with new security technology. One program that has been particularly successful is the $5,000 reward set up by the North Carolina Bankers Association for information leading to the arrest and indictment of someone who robbed any of its member banks. Association officials note that a prime source of information is the robbers' friends and family.
The new programs appear to be lowering the number of bank robberies in North Carolina, but law enforcement officials remain cautious. In a meeting last month with other agents from the F.B.I.'s office in Raleigh, one senior agent, John Werner, noted that the rising number of bank robberies in the state was finally beginning to decline.
"I may have been speaking for about half an hour," Mr. Werner said. "And by the time I had finished, two more banks had been robbed."

To the Editor:
Bob Herbert (column, April 29) describes the lack of public awareness of the suffering and poverty of millions of people in the United States. Indeed, despite widespread reports concerning our country's economic boom, a staggering 35 million people live in poverty. Those of us who try to draw attention to this statistic find our voices repeatedly drowned out by reports of low unemployment figures and diminishing welfare rolls. 
 Unfortunately, these numbers do not tell the whole story. A recent study by our organization found that large numbers of people leaving the welfare rolls are experiencing the effects of poor nutrition, unstable housing and inadequate health care. This is true whether or not they are able to secure jobs. Moreover, as welfare rolls were dropping, social service agencies reported a significant rise in numbers of unemployed people without government assistance.

As Booksellers Shuffle, Readers Depart

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2

 BODY:
The reviews are in for last year's books and the reading is not pleasant. A new industry study indicates that the popular market for literature declined, with the number of purchases dropping for the first time in seven years despite the growing presence of electronic bookstores and the easy availability of titles.
The widely publicized arrival of on-line booksellers has failed so far to expand the market for popular fiction and nonfiction even as demand has fallen for mass-market paperback books and as affluent, educated readers buy fewer titles, according to the Book Industry Study Group, a trade group that tracks the reading habits of 16,000 households. 
 That conclusion may defy the conventional wisdom of some of the top publishers who gathered today at the Los Angeles Convention Center for Book Expo America, the annual and sometimes uneasy business reunion of independent booksellers and their suppliers.
A day before the release of the survey on Friday, Peter Olson, the chief executive of Random House, the unit of Bertelsmann A.G. that is the nation's largest publisher, appeared on a panel, "Bookselling in the Next Millennium." During the discussion, he insisted that book sales on line amounted to incremental growth rather than a shift of purchases from other traditional outlets.
But the new consumer-research study indicates that sales over all declined almost 3 percent, to 1.04 billion books purchased -- literary spoils that were divided among a shifting group of booksellers.
For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category, on-line stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share, which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent. The large bookstore chains raised their part of the market slightly to 25.3 percent, reflecting their own slowing expansion of brick-and-bookshelf stores. The rest of the bookselling market includes everything from mail order companies to warehouse chains to food and drug stores.
With the widespread availability of books and the plethora of titles on the market, booksellers struggled to understand why they were not reaching more readers. The downturn in sales comes as the economy continues to thrive and the number of small independent publishers has grown in the last 10 years to more than 53,400 companies.
Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to appeal to independent booksellers. By necessity, those booksellers are banding together to create a common electronic bookstore of their own, Book Sense, which has now signed up more than 860 members.
Avin Domnitz, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, said the study reflected other research the trade group had conducted to prepare for the August start of the Book Sense site on the World Wide Web.
"Young people, in particular," Mr. Domnitz said, are "so busy and so mobile that the acquisition of these things are just not on their priority list."
That group is reading, he noted -- not necessarily traditional books but perhaps information on line.
Much of the softness in the market is attributable to the falling popularity of paperbacks; those books once ushered in a revolution in popular reading because of their modest cost and easy portability. The weakness of paperback sales took their toll on used bookstores, book clubs, mail-order companies, even drugstores -- all of which experienced declines in their shares of the market.
Mass-market paperback sales sagged more than 21 percent at drugstores and 17 percent at used bookstores -- reflecting a shift in American reading habits by customers who may prefer the larger type of discounted hardcovers or more expensive trade paperbacks. Cost may also have driven away potential customers: the average price of a paperback book outpaced the rate of inflation over the last five years, rising to $4.56 from $4.12 in 1994.
To deal with the age issue, the Association of American Publishers has created a publicity campaign featuring celebrity bookworms and a slogan, "Get Caught Reading," to try to reach the young, but there is heavy work ahead. In particular, readers younger than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20 percent. Older customers between 55 and 64 remained loyal, the study showed, buying 15 percent more books.
Readers with annual incomes of more than $75,000 are usually big book buyers, but last year they also cut back. In general, readers bought fewer fiction titles and pared even more on nonfiction, like biographies and history, which had a 12 percent decline in sales.
The customers younger than 40 who did shift to on-line book shopping displayed rather different reading tastes from those of the general market. Popular fiction topped E-commerce sales at 33 percent, followed by 14 percent for technical and science books, 12 percent for cookbooks and crafts titles and 11 percent for psychological and recovery books. In the general market, popular fiction has a much more commanding presence -- 51 percent -- followed by religious titles at 10 percent and cookbooks at 9 percent.
The study noted that buyers of religious books did not seem to respond to electronic bookstores, but did buy enough titles in other outlets to expand the segment's share of the market by more than 1 percentage point. Over all, customers bought fewer books in every category except travel and religion.
Mr. Domnitz, whose organization helped finance the study, still said the potential exists for expanding the market.
"The problem is that about half of the population is not going to purchase books in the course of a year," he said. "And so we have to concentrate on those who do."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Thompson and Kirshenbaum Bond are forming units to focus on the entertainment industry.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TWO agencies are joining the growing chorus along Madison Avenue singing "That's Entertainment."
At J. Walter Thompson New York, an executive from the William Morris Agency, Marina Hahn, is arriving in the new post of executive vice president for strategy and entertainment. And Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York is forming a division to specialize in film, television and theatrical accounts. The division, named KBE, opens with assignments that have billings estimated at $15 million to $20 million. 
 The moves are indicative of the increasing attempts by agencies to broaden their missions beyond conventional advertising and enter fields that are fresher and faster-growing. The enormous opportunities presented by what Michael J. Wolf, in his new book, "The Entertainment Economy," calls "the E-factor" -- the voracious appetite among Americans to be amused -- are too potentially lucrative to ignore, particularly after Hollywood talent agencies have sought to muscle in on the tasks that agencies have long performed for marketers.
"Agencies can't just develop 30-second TV spots anymore," said Bob Jeffrey, president at Thompson New York, part of the J. Walter Thompson unit of WPP Group P.L.C.
"We have this big responsibility to form marketing partnerships with clients in more aggressive ways and grow brands with the total spectrum of communications," he said. "Entertainment is global, ubiquitous, contemporary and sets trends."
Ms. Hahn, 40, had been vice president and head of the East Coast corporate advisory group at the New York office of William Morris. She has also worked for the Sony Corporation of America, the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico Inc. and what is now DDB Worldwide in New York, a unit of Omnicom Group.
"It's all about using entertainment as a strategic tool," Ms. Hahn said, "combining the creativity and clout of the entertainment industry with the resources of corporate America and figuring out how to build brands in innovative ways."
And "it's more than creating the next sponsorship or product placement or hiring the next celebrity endorser," she added. "You have to think about the experiences, not just the brands." Among marketers praised by Ms. Hahn and Mr. Jeffrey were the Walt Disney Company; the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation; Nike Inc., for the Niketown retail stores, and the Starbucks Coffee Company.
Ms. Hahn will form and lead a group at Thompson New York that will combine what had been separate operations handling account planning and media planning with a new entertainment unit, which, like KBE, will seek clients in Hollywood, book publishing, music and theater. Another goal is to use entertainment expertise to sell the packaged goods of clients of Thompson New York and other Thompson offices.
At KBE, one initial assignment comes from a partnership between the Columbia Tristar Television Group, a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Children's Television Workshop, the nonprofit company that developed "Sesame Street." KBE is working on projects for "Sesame Street" and will provide services including advertising, interactive marketing and promotions for "Dragon Tales," a new animated series aimed at preschool children that is to be broadcast by PBS in the fall.
"This is about developing a brand, not just a successful show," said Sherrie Rollins Westin, executive vice president for marketing, communications and research at the workshop in New York. "The launch of KBE speaks to bringing brand-building sensibilities to entertainment and media."
"Dragon Tales," featuring cartoon characters with names like Cassie, Ord, Quetzal and the two-headed Zak & Wheelie, is being produced by a new group at Sony Pictures Entertainment in Culver City, Calif., devoted to television shows, movies and videos for children and families.
"With the continuing fragmentation of the marketplace, producers will have to take on more responsibility to supplement the networks' efforts with their own show promotion," said Sander Schwartz, president of the new group.
"The folks at Kirshenbaum Bond have shown an ability to distinguish products of clients from the clutter and the competition," he added, referring to work for Snapple and Target. "I'm excited about them doing the same for 'Dragon Tales.' "
Another initial assignment for KBE comes from Radio City Entertainment in New York, part of the Madison Square Garden division of Cablevision Systems; Kirshenbaum Bond has handled assignments for the company's Broadway musical, "The Scarlet Pimpernel." KBE's work will include campaigns for productions of "The Wizard of Oz" and "A Christmas Carol" and a Halloween attraction with the entertaining name of Madison Scare Garden.
KBE begins with about 10 employees under the direction of Jeff Peters, 39, vice president and account director, and James Hitchcock, 35, vice president and creative director. Mr. Peters joined from (coincidentally) Thompson New York, where he had been a vice president and marketing manager. Mr. Hitchcock had been a vice president and associate creative director at Kirshenbaum Bond on accounts like Target.
Mr. Peters and Mr. Hitchcock will report to Jonathan Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum, the co-chairmen at Kirshenbaum Bond.

HEADLINE: T. Justin Moore Jr., 74, Ex-Chief Of the Virginia Power Company

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
T. Justin Moore Jr., a retired chief executive of the Virginia Power Company and a founder of an economic development group that sought to break down racial barriers in Richmond, died of cancer on April 24 at his home in Richmond, a family spokesman said. He was 74.
Mr. Moore was as well known in Richmond for his attempts to ease racial tensions in the city in the 1980's as he was for his career at the utility. He had a knack for dealing with different groups, including politicians, consumers, state agencies and his own employees. 
 He founded the development group Richmond Renaissance in 1982 along with Henry L. Marsh 3d, a Democratic state senator who also served as Mayor of Richmond.
The group, which is still active, was a biracial partnership that brought together public and private groups to spur economic development. It succeeded in attracting new business into the area.
Mr. Moore served as the first chairman of Richmond Renaissance, helping to develop the Sixth Street Marketplace, a pedestrian mall area. Acting on Mr. Moore's idea, the group built a bridge over Broad Street as a symbolic as well as practical way of bringing the black and white areas of the city together. Before it was built, Mr. Marsh said, Broad Street had separated the two communities like a Berlin wall.
Concerning the increasing demand for energy, Mr. Moore expressed faith that technology like solar power would eventually meet the challenge. "I'm a great believer that new technology is going to keep on saving our necks," he said.
Mr. Moore served as an officer in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II. After graduating from Princeton University in 1947, he attended Virginia Law School, graduating in 1950. He then joined the firm of Hunton & Williams.
He was named assistant general counsel for the Virginia Electric and Power Company in 1956 and joined the company as senior vice president and principal financial officer in 1967.
He was promoted to president in 1970 and was named chairman and chief executive in 1978. He retired from Virginia Power in 1985 but continued to serve on the board of Dominion Resources Inc., the parent company, until 1994. He also served as a director of the Philip Morris Companies, the GTE Corporation and the Conference Board.
His first wife, Mary Elizabeth Pearson Moore, died in 1983. He is survived by his wife, Jeanette Bray; a son, T. Justin Moore 3d, and a daughter, Mary Moore Wilkinson, all of Richmond.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
A Great Defender of the Old Social Security Battles On

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE conventional wisdom these days is that any major change to Social Security is unlikely before next year's elections, but Robert M. Ball remains ever vigilant. In the unending debate over the nation's pension system, Mr. Ball stands as the great defender of traditional Social Security, the genius of its basic principles, the soundness of its basic approach.
"Though I feel good about our position," he said in a lull in the struggle on a lazy spring afternoon, "people who think like I do better be very careful, and we better have good proposals and we better be alert. Or something may happen that we don't like." 
 Mr. Ball comes by his passion honestly, having been at the Social Security wars for a very long time. He went to work for Social Security in 1939, ran the program as Commissioner from 1962 to 1973, and has since played a principal role on some of the important advisory commissions. He is a regular source of advice for leading Congressional Democrats, has sent a series of memorandums on the issue to the White House over the last few years and, yes, is a Social Security beneficiary himself.
Mr. Ball, who is 85, said he had no complaints about life on the other end of the Social Security check. "They do a good job," he said, happily settled for the moment like any other cardigan-clad retiree in the living room of his ranch house in Alexandria, Va.
For many Democrats engaged in the issue, Mr. Ball is an irreplaceable link with 60 years of history. "There's a reason why the program is what it is," said Representative Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, a Democratic point man on Social Security in the House. "And Bob Ball can explain it to you."
For the last few years, Mr. Ball's consuming cause has been beating back the forces of privatization: the notion that at least part of Social Security should be replaced with individual accounts that workers could invest as they see fit.
He sees privatization as a "slippery slope," a dangerous step away from the guaranteed benefits of Social Security. He contends that the system can be shored up for the next century by far less radical measures, like raising the maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security taxes.
Mr. Ball acknowledges that his views are shaped by a very different world than that of the young privatizers. One of three children of a Methodist minister, he grew up in northern New Jersey and graduated from Wesleyan University with a master's degree in economics during the Depression. There were no jobs.
For help, he turned to his thesis adviser, who happened to have a friend involved in the new Social Security program. "He said, 'Well, this program is just starting up. It's going to be a big program. It's an attractive program and an important social program, and it would be a good thing if you got in on it in the beginning.' "
So Mr. Ball took the Civil Service exam during his honeymoon (he spent the rest of the time on a camping trip with his wife, Doris) and began work as a field representative in the Newark office of Social Security for $1,620 a year.
He spent his early years visiting employers, trying to straighten out wage records and, along the way, proselytizing for a program that seemed quite revolutionary at the time. On the wall of his office at home, he has a picture of that Newark field staff, earnest young foot soldiers of the New Deal.
There are other pictures on that wall: President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the law creating Medicare, which Mr. Ball helped put into effect. The Presidential commission, signed by John F. Kennedy, that named Mr. Ball head of Social Security. (Mr. Ball noted that it mentioned more than once that he served at the pleasure of the President.) A picture of the Balls with President Richard M. Nixon in 1973, when Mr. Ball was leaving office. The newspapers at the time said he was "pushed out." Mr. Ball says: "I was perfectly happy to go, but I couldn't have stayed if I wanted to. I lasted for the first term."
Along the way, the Balls brought up two children: their son is a psychotherapist; their daughter, an art therapist.
Mr. Ball acknowledges that his retirement has been less than restful. He does do a lot of reading, and not just on social insurance issues, he said a trifle defensively. Mostly novels and Romantic poetry.
BUT the care and tending of Social Security keeps pulling him back.
"There was a time when I felt a lot of pressure on the basis that there wasn't anybody else really working on it very much," he said. "Now there's a whole group. They'll carry on whether I die tomorrow and do as good or better job."
That was the idea behind the National Academy of Social Insurance, a nonprofit organization that does research on social insurance and tries to "enhance public understanding" of the issues; Mr. Ball was one of its founders 11 years ago.
Still, it is not at all clear that Mr. Ball is ready to pass the torch and enter the land of retirement he helped create.
"My wife and I had dinner with him and Doris two nights ago," said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "I don't know of any other 85-year-old who's wrestling with what he's going to do, new. But Bob is wrestling with that. I think he sees the health care issue emerging anew."

HEADLINE: Low-Wage Businesses Add to Number of Uninsured Workers

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
A long-spreading gap between the wages of undereducated workers in menial jobs and those of skilled college graduates is contributing to another gap, in workers' health benefits, a research journal reports.
Lending a new perspective on the swelling numbers of Americans without health insurance, an article to be published on Monday in the journal Health Affairs says that a phenomenon feeding the benefits gap is the proliferation of low-wage businesses, like stores and restaurants. 
 "Our findings," the authors say, "strongly suggest that low-wage families" can often protect themselves from losing health insurance "if they find work in firms where a substantial share of the employees earn more than they do."
John Gabel, the lead author, an economist and benefits specialist at the Hospital Research and Educational Trust, said in an interview, "The pattern we see is that employers that have a high-income work force offer better benefits, no matter how you choose to look at it."
The article notes that after taking inflation into account, wages for high school graduates fell 11 percent from 1973 to 1997, while those of college graduates rose 17 percent.
The journal says that the rise in the numbers of uninsured Americans, from 38 million in 1992 to 43 million in 1997, has touched most segments of the population, but the poor especially.
Over the five years, the study says, the percentage of heads of households with high school diplomas who lacked coverage rose to 28.6 percent, from 26.2 percent. But for those with college degrees, the percentage was much lower and barely budged, to 8.1 percent from 7.8 percent.
The authors looked in particular at relationships showing that low-paid employees of companies with high proportions of well-paid employees were more likely to be offered benefits, and to get more choices in coverage, with smaller deductions from their pay, than those at businesses with few well-paid employees.
The article does not identify the 2,763 private and public employers the authors examined. But the authors show that low-wage workers serving hamburgers in the cafeteria of, say, a General Motors or a Merrill Lynch, which have relatively few such workers, are more likely to have health benefits than those at McDonald's or Burger King, which have many low-wage workers.
For the article, the authors used two surveys conducted last year. One, by KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting firm, surveyed 1,583 small and large employers. The other, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, surveyed 1,180 small businesses employing from 3 to 199 workers.
For each employer, the authors weighed the numbers of well-paid workers -- those earning more than $75,000 a year -- against those earning less than $20,000.
The authors put those employers with the highest proportion of the lowest-paid workers into a "low wage" category and those with the highest proportion of high-paid workers into a "high wage" category. Workers at the high-wage companies -- whether poorly paid or well paid themselves -- got the better deal. They paid 21 percent of the employers' premiums for individual coverage, compared with 24 percent at low-wage firms. And for family coverage, workers at high-wage firms paid 27 percent of the cost, compared with 41 percent for low-wage firms.
Among the smaller companies, the authors found that only 39 percent of the low-wage companies offered health benefits, compared with 82 percent of the high-wage firms.

HEADLINE: Pataki Tests National Waters, but Barely a Ripple Is Seen

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki had just finished a 50-minute speech at Georgetown University about the Balkans when a student interposed a question that had little to do with Mr. Pataki's views on foreign policy: Why was a New York governor offering a major address in Washington on global problems in the first place? "Normally, those are handled by Presidents and Vice Presidents," Matthew Payne, a government major, observed dryly.
Mr. Pataki paused as a rustle of laughter rose from the seats. "I'm sure that we have many New Yorkers involved in the air strikes," he said. Besides, the Governor asserted, "The national policy debate -- the decisions that are made here in Washington -- have an enormous effect on New York." 
 As the question posed at Georgetown last week suggests, Mr. Pataki's campaign to establish himself as a leading influence within his party -- shaping the Republican Party's platform and earning consideration as a top-tier candidate for national office -- apparently has yet to take hold. Three months after Mr. Pataki began offering his views of the world beyond Albany with a series of speeches across the country, Republican politicians and strategists say he remains largely a New York State figure, respected for his accomplishments in that state, but still not considered among the leading forces in his party.
Mr. Pataki's signature argument that his party should turn away from such issues as abortion rights and embrace the Reagan-era platform of cutting Government spending and taxes has yet to inspire the kind of debate that the Governor might have envisioned. Even Republicans who praise his record say he is rarely mentioned in discussions these days about potential Presidential or Vice Presidential candidates.
"The truth is that he is not a serious candidate," said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who worked for Bob Dole's Presidential campaign in 1996. "His Presidential ambitions are writing checks that his political muscle can't cash. There is no opening for him."
Doug Bailey, a former Republican consultant who is now the publisher of a daily political digest and tip sheet, said: "I don't think he's on anybody's list. I don't think anybody seriously thinks that he's planning to run. I don't think he's a household name anywhere."
Notwithstanding his apparent lack of success to date, Mr. Pataki has a history of emerging unexpectedly at the top of the political heap. He was, after all, the little-known Republican legislator from Westchester who toppled Mario M. Cuomo, and he is nothing if not a persistent candidate.
His nomination in 1994 came after years of steady if unnoticed work in New York political circles, traveling the state and giving speeches, preparing himself should the political opportunity arise, as it did when Republican leaders recruited him to run against Mr. Cuomo. He is now executing the same kind of strategy on a national level, his aides say.
And Mr. Pataki said that he was satisfied with his success so far, asserting in an interview that his speeches on national politics and the future of the Republican Party -- in Illinois, Missouri and New Hampshire, among other places -- have drawn attention both to his record in Albany and to his views on how his party can become more competitive in national elections. "I really believe this stuff," he said. "I really believe in these principles."
"I am amazed at the level of attention," Mr. Pataki said. "When you have seven or eight candidates -- and I'm not a candidate -- to have obtained the level of attention that we've gotten is, to me, very surprising. I didn't expect it to be as widespread."
That is a view, though, that is not widely shared among Republicans these days. Several contrasted Mr. Pataki's trips with those of his predecessor: In particular, Mr. Cuomo's 1984 speech about abortion rights at the University of Notre Dame, when he was a first-term governor, which drew extensive national attention and helped stir the talk among some Democrats about Mr. Cuomo as a potential Presidential candidate.
Mr. Pataki's advisers describe what he is doing as, in effect, a should-lightning-strike strategy: establishing his credentials in case one of the Republicans more commonly mentioned for national office should falter. But that is an eventuality that even Mr. Pataki's advisers see as increasingly unlikely.
The Governor's attempt to use the 2000 Presidential campaign to raise his own profile -- following a long line of Governors from New York who have done the same thing to great success, whether Thomas E. Dewey or Mr. Cuomo -- has been, to some extent, undercut by events beyond his control.
When Mr. Pataki began earlier this year, it was far from clear who the Republican Party might nominate for President. That has changed with the rise of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas as the party's leading Presidential contender, to Mr. Pataki's clear disadvantage.
"I don't think he's actually looked at as a candidate by very many people because the movement to Bush is unabated," said Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan, an early supporter of Mr. Bush. "There is a settling in that's taking place that in all likelihood, George W. Bush is going to be our nominee."
And Mr. Pataki's hopes of being considered for Vice President are complicated by, among other things, his support of abortion rights, which will certainly be a contrary position at the next Republican convention, and the fact that he is from New York.
"The first thing Republicans are concerned about is reinforcing their base in the South and the Southwest," said Adam Goodman, a Republican consultant. "The Northeast is not at the top of the priority list."
Still, Mr. Pataki has succeeded in distinguishing himself ideologically in his party, with his emphasis on economic issues combined with his support for abortion rights and gay rights. Several advisers said that such ideological positioning could prove fortuitous in future Presidential elections if the Republican Party moves to the center. In that event, what Mr. Pataki is doing now could pay dividends in 2004 or 2008, much the same way his work in New York in 1990 paid off in 1994.
In the meantime, Mr. Pataki said he intends to continue traveling the nation, presenting himself as a noncandidate concerned about the future of the Republican Party.
"He is doing what you can do when you are the Governor of New York, which is to monkey around in the primary season," Mr. Murphy, the Republican consultant, said. "There is no such thing as too much exposure."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Diplomatic Initiative Helps Strengthen Both Yeltsin and Russia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 2

 BODY:
By dispatching his special envoy to Washington for talks on ending the Yugoslav conflict, President Boris N. Yeltsin has put Russia at the center of international diplomacy, reviving relations with Washington and NATO. Perhaps more to the point for Mr. Yeltsin, it also plays well at home.
The move has quieted the hard-line critics who have lamented Moscow's dwindling influence, and has even enabled the President to settle a few scores with some of his political rivals. 
 The trouble is that it remains unclear whether the Kremlin has real influence over the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and whether it is willing to use it.
"The Russians have been knocking at the door and demanding to be treated as an important player," said Toby T. Gati, a former senior State Department official. "Now they have got the biggest welcome they can have: the welcome at the White House. But this is a high-stakes game. The question is whether they can deliver."
An initial answer may come Monday afternoon when Viktor S. Chernomyrdin -- the former Prime Minister whom Mr. Yeltsin fired last year and then tried unsuccessfully to rehire -- meets with President Clinton. Mr. Yeltsin suggested the meeting in a 15-minute telephone call to President Clinton today.
Certainly, Mr. Yeltsin had compelling reasons to plunge into Balkan diplomacy. Since NATO's bombs first started raining down on Yugoslavia more than five weeks ago, the Kremlin has been on the political defensive.
The Communists have charged that the NATO raids show how weak and marginalized Russia has become on Mr. Yeltsin's watch. Hard-liners have demanded that the Kremlin provide military assistance to Belgrade.
Such a step would frustrate Mr. Yeltsin's longstanding policy of maintaining a good working relationship with the West, no small consideration for a nation still sorely in need of billions of dollars in credits from the International Monetary Fund.
At first, Mr. Yeltsin sought to fend off his critics by turning up the anti-NATO rhetoric. Russian officials denounced the allied air strikes in vitriolic terms, warning that the military campaign might even spark a third world war. When it came to deeds, however, the Kremlin was careful to stay clear of the conflict.
Ultimately, however, that approach merely reinforced the perception that Russia was powerless to end the fighting. Neither NATO nor Belgrade seemed to care very much what Moscow thought.
So Mr. Yeltsin switched his strategy. He appointed Mr. Chernomyrdin special envoy on the Yugoslav conflict and sent him to Belgrade in search of a settlement.
In a cut-throat world of Russian politics, the Chernomyrdin appointment also served another purpose. It enabled Mr. Yeltsin to diminish the political role of Yevgeny M. Primakov, Mr. Yeltsin's current Prime Minister and a former Foreign Minister.
Mr. Yeltsin has become increasingly unhappy with the ambitious Mr. Primakov, who has done little to pull Russia out of its economic morass while seeking to position himself as a potential successor to the ailing President.
This is not to say that Mr. Chernomyrdin's diplomacy is simply a matter of political theater. Russia has a genuine stake in brokering a settlement on Kosovo.
As NATO's air strikes have dragged on, there has been increasing talk in allied capitals of a possible land offensive. A NATO ground assault to seize Kosovo would further inflame anti-Western opinion in Moscow and renew the bitter criticism at home of Mr. Yeltsin's policies.
Brokering an agreement, however, is the hard part. As Russian officials see it, Mr. Chernomyrdin has several important strengths, including a good working relationship with Vice President Al Gore.
Negotiating a settlement might also help Mr. Chernomyrdin revive his moribund political career, though almost certainly not to the point where it would make him a plausible presidential candidate.
Still, Mr. Chernomyrdin's mission is heavy with political risks. Having claimed the world spotlight, Russia has staked its prestige on diplomacy. If it fails to make headway, Russia may soon find itself back on the sidelines.
By all accounts, the issues are still formidable. NATO and Belgrade have been far apart on the main issues, including the alliance's demand that NATO troops be deployed in Kosovo to protect ethnic Albanians and that all Serb forces be withdrawn.
Another divisive question concerns the final political status of the Kosovo region. NATO is proposing that it be an "internationally protected area" that is only nominally within Yugoslavia. Belgrade wants clearer administrative responsibility over the region.
Nor is it clear that Moscow and Washington agree on how Russia should go about its mediating role. Russia has tended to cast itself as a sort of marriage counselor that expects concessions from NATO, as well as Belgrade. The United States, however, insists that NATO's demands are firm and that it is the Milosevic regime that will have to make the major concessions.
Mr. Chernomyrdin, for his part, met on Friday with Mr. Milosevic. He left without declaring a breakthrough and was careful not to promise one today.
"We consider the situation to be far from simple," Mr. Chernomyrdin said. "But it gives us hope that efforts which Russia has taken and will take are significant."

HEADLINE: Stanley D. Canter, 75, an Adviser to Corporations

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Stanley D. Canter, who advised many of the world's best-known corporations on marketing and advertising matters during a career that spanned more than 40 years, died April 24 at the Jacob Perlow Hospice at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, according to a longtime business associate. The cause was cancer. He was 75.
Until his retirement in 1989, Mr. Canter was president and treasurer of Canter Achenbaum Associates, Inc., a consulting firm that specialized in advertising and marketing. He and his partner, Alvin Achenbaum, created the agency in 1974, and it became known for being instrumental in changing the way client companies select and compensate agencies. During Mr. Canter's tenure, the firm conducted more than 40 agency searches for many of America's blue-chip manufacturers, as well as for the largest Japanese and Korean automobile companies. 
 Canter Achenbaum, now called Achenbaum Bogda Associates, was included in a recent issue of Advertising Age, the trade publication, commemorating 100 executives who had a significant impact on advertising during the last century. Mr. Canter was mentioned for his contribution along with Mr. Achenbaum for changing the relationship between clients and agencies.
While working for the Toyota Motor Company's United States division in 1974, Canter Achenbaum helped develop a systematic competitive process for choosing its advertising agency and agreeing on compensation. The approach was a departure from the industry practice in which agencies received 15 percent commissions on media billings. This helped lead to the present practice of companies' using a variety of compensation structures for agencies, including pay-for-performance fees.
Mr. Canter began his career in 1945 at Econometric Institute, a firm, now defunct, that conducted economic forecasting using statistical models. He moved into advertising two years later when he became head of the media research department and later led the marketing research division of McCann-Erickson, now part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
In 1957, Mr. Canter joined Ogilvy & Mather as head of the research department for what was then a fledgling operation. He once said of his work there that it involved research that often employed "a statistical technique for classifying individuals into subcategories depending on their response patterns to a series of questions."
He remained at Ogilvy & Mather for 13 years, rising to senior vice president and director of marketing services. He had also been a senior account officer responsible for the Shell Oil and Sears, Roebuck accounts.
Mr. Canter left the agency in 1974 when he and Mr. Achenbaum started their business. In addition to its work in advertising agency search and compensation, the firm provided strategic marketing counsel to many marketers, including Hallmark Cards, the American Express Company and Citicorp.
In an article announcing his retirement in 1989, Mr. Cantor reflected on the industry and said that agencies were groping for a "new type of marketing specialist -- a person familiar with several different kinds of media."
Mr. Cantor was born in New York City, where he lived his entire life. He is survived by his wife, Florence Sanoff of New York City; two sons from a previous marriage, Leonard, of Redding, Conn., and Robert, of Santa Monica, Calif., and two grandchildren, both of Redding.

HEADLINE: The Widow Of Ex-Leader Wins Race In Panama

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: PANAMA, May 2

 BODY:
Mireya Moscoso, the widow of a Panamanian President who stepped out on her own politically to become the main opposition leader here, narrowly defeated her main opponent tonight, electing her the country's first woman President.
With just 55 percent of the vote counted, official tallies showed Ms. Moscoso, 52, with 43 percent. Martin Torrijos, the 35-year-old son of the late Panamanian strongman, Gen. Omar Torrijos, followed with 38 percent. 
 Alberto Vallarino, 47, of a third political alliance, trailed with 17 percent. He conceded defeat shortly after 8 P.M. and wished Ms. Moscoso "success in leading this country in one of the periods of major challenges but also of major opportunities in our history."
About an hour later, Mr. Torrijos publicly congratulated the winner and announced to his supporters that he would seek to become secretary general of the Revolutionary Democratic Party, reorganize the party and prepare to run again in the 2004 elections "for the benefit of the motherland."
"You can be sure that we have a future and that time does not stop at this moment," he said to wild cheers.
Shortly before 10 P.M., Ms. Moscoso was welcomed by supporters at a hotel here with shouts of "Mireya! Mireya!" while caravans of honking cars could be heard around the city. She then promised to given an address from her party's headquarters later tonight.
"Today Mireya Moscoso didn't win," she said. "The Panamanian people won. We have a commitment with this country and thousands and thousands of people."
Ms. Moscoso will lead the administration that acquires the Panama Canal from the United States at the end of the year under the 1977 Canal Treaties negotiated by General Torrijos with President Carter.
The President is elected by a simple majority for a five-year term starting Sept. 1.
Panamanians also chose two Vice Presidents, 71 legislators for the unicameral Legislative Assembly and 74 mayors in tranquil elections that appeared to be the third clean vote of recent years, solidifying a break from a history of massive election fraud and political coups.
Turnout among the 1.7 million registered voters was 74 percent, and in many polling places the mood was relaxed, with little partisan euphoria evident in or outside the buildings.
Ms. Moscoso, owner of a coffee business inherited from her late husband, Dr. Arnulfo Arias, for whom the Arnulfista Party was named, ran on a populist platform that promised to end Government corruption and privatization policies that have left Panamanians grumbling about higher rates for telephone and other services. This was her second try at the presidency; she lost 1994 elections to current President Ernesto Perez Balladares.
This time, Ms. Moscoso had to overcome early polls that showed her behind, criticism over her lack of college degrees and government experience, and the ghost of General Torrijos. Memory of the general still resonates with many voters and his name was constantly invoked by her opponent. To retaliate, she often referred to Mr. Torrijos, the candidate, by the diminutive "Martincito."
Mr. Torrijos, an economist with degrees from Texas A&M University who served as Deputy Minister of Government and Justice in the Perez Balladares administration, did not differ widely with Ms. Moscoso on policy. The main thrust of his campaign was to offer a cleaner, less arrogant image for the party once led by Gen. Manuel Noriega, who was ousted in the American invasion of Panama in 1989 and is serving a prison sentence in the United States on a drug-related conviction.
In her campaign, Ms. Moscoso drew on the memory of another charismatic politician: her husband. Mr. Arias died in exile in Miami in 1988 after a long career in which he won three elections as President, but each time was removed from office by opponents, the last time in 1968 in a military coup that installed General Torrijos as ruler.
While some Panamanians quipped that the campaign was thus a race between "two corpses," many voters expressed a desire to break with the past, which Ms. Moscoso said she would offer.
"Today, the selfish leadership in the Government has appropriated the riches and national assets while the great majorities are increasingly impoverished," she said in a fiery speech at her own campaign closing rally last week. "I promise you a different Government."
With poverty and unemployment widespread, and a judicial system in need of serious reform, many Panamanians hope for a break with the Government corruption and nepotism of the past.

HEADLINE: Doctors Face the Business of Medicine

BYLINE: By ERIC NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
No one had ever said that starting her own allergy practice would be easy, but Dr. Cheryl Lynn Walker was not prepared for the anxieties that beset her after she opened her doors to patients.
"I would get up in the morning, and I would just feel overwhelmed," she recalled. 
 The problem with the practice of medicine, she found, was not the medicine but the practice. Like many physicians, Dr. Walker, who opened her practice in Chicago in 1990, felt under siege in the changing landscape of health care, where managed care and corporate medicine now rule, and doctors often need to be as conversant in the language of business as they are in healing.
So Dr. Walker did what a growing number of doctors are doing: she went back to school -- for a master's in business degree.
Authorities say more and more doctors are doing just that, as universities add or adapt programs to meet doctors' needs. The University of Tennessee, for one, started a program last year; the Boston University School of Management is starting another one in the fall.
Meanwhile, medical schools have created programs for students who want to study for a business degree simultaneously.
The kind of doctor who seeks an M.B.A., moreover, appears to be changing. While the degree is still a pedigree for doctors who aspire to run a hospital or a health maintenance organization, where they may never lay hands on a patient, it is now increasingly attracting doctors who intend to keep practicing.
Some solo practitioners, part of a dwindling breed, also hope a business degree will give them the financial acumen to allow them to survive by teaching them how to run their practices more efficiently. But the investment is considerable, with tuition alone in the tens of thousands of dollars.
Dr. John A. Fromson, vice president of professional development for the Massachusetts Medical Society, said last week that when his organization polled its 17,000 members about whether to begin a business degree program, 10 percent expressed strong interest. The medical society, after fielding inquiries from dozens of business schools, decided to enter into a partnership with Boston University.
"The message was clear that physicians did, indeed, want some sort of business management training," Dr. Fromson said.
Doctors cite numerous reasons for the change. Where once those in small or medium-size practices spent most of their time with patients while clerical staff members handled billing and filed insurance claims, doctors now find themselves having to make business decisions on which the survival of their practices could well hinge.
They must decide, for example, which contracts to accept from managed-care companies. To determine whether the fees offered in a contract will cover their costs, doctors often must do the kind of analyses of their own practices that have more traditionally been used in business settings.
Business schools teach doctors not only the basic principles that allow them to make these calculations, but also about the overall economics of health care and how to work in teams.
Andrew McLean Thomas, an internist from Columbus, Ohio, who graduated from medical school in 1995, decided two years later to get an M.B.A. He is now enrolled at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University.
Dr. Thomas said patients could be better served if administrators making broad policy decisions in large health care organizations had not just business degrees but medical ones.
Dr. Thomas, who hopes to treat patients and to work as an administrator, said it was essential in the current changing medical climate for doctors in management positions to have training in business to make decisions that resulted in the best care.
"When it comes to making business decisions, the days of 'I am doctor, therefore I am right, and cost be damned' are out the window," Dr. Thomas said. "Everyone has to understand we're living in an era of constrained resources."
Still, not every doctor is enamored of the trend toward combined degrees.
Leonard Laster, chancellor emeritus of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, expressed concern about the growing number of doctors who go back to school for business training, questioning whether practicing doctors should adopt the philosophy of business executives.
"The expectation that a single individual can espouse and live by the two incompatible creeds appears unrealistic," Dr. Laster wrote in a 1998 issue of American Medical News, published by the American Medical Association, "and I will not allow my family members to be guinea pigs for testing whether these professional polarities can be successfully used. I say let businessmen be businessmen and pursue profits, and let doctors be doctors and care for patients."
For Dr. Walker, 40, going to business school did present a kind of culture shock. She was the only doctor in the executive M.B.A. program at the University of Chicago, and she quickly had to learn a new way of thinking.
But within a year of graduating from the part-time program, she said, she had recouped the cost of the degree, about $25,000, largely through improved billing and administrative practices.
Dr. Walker says the business training has not affected how she handles her patients.
Instead, she said, by teaching her to be more efficient, the training allows her to use her time the way she wants: spending longer with patients and working two days a week in research.
Still, while she is glad she went back to school, Dr. Walker sounds anything but sanguine about the future.
"I love my small practice," she said. "And so I've decided that I'm just going to give it the best that I can, until I can't do it any longer. And then at that point I will need to join up with a larger group."

HEADLINE: A Familiar Skin Hides an Evolving Space Shuttle

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., April 30

 BODY:
America's aging space shuttles, often criticized as monuments to 1970's technology, are slowly being replaced by much more modern spacecraft -- themselves.
With the possible exception of a few science fiction counterparts, the nation's fleet of space shuttles, which began flying humans into space 18 years ago, have become the most recognized spaceships in the world. The stubby-winged spaceplanes, with twin rocket boosters and giant fuel tanks strapped to their bellies, appear little changed since the first one flew in 1981. 
 But appearances can be deceiving. The shuttles have been steadily modified during their lifetimes, NASA engineers and managers say, and are much more modern beneath their familiar skin than most people realize.
The shuttles underwent numerous, highly publicized safety modifications after the Challenger explosion in 1986 took the lives of seven crew members. These changes, among thousands of major and minor design modifications that were made since the shuttles started flying, included redesigned solid-fuel booster rockets, more spacecraft sensors and a parachute escape system for the crew.
But later improvements that have not drawn as much attention include new main engines that engineers say are safer and more reliable because they have far fewer welded parts and operate under lower pressures; external fuel tanks made of a new, lighter aluminum-lithium alloy, providing a 7,500-pound weight reduction that translates into increased cargo capacity; improved brakes and the addition of tail parachutes for surer, shorter landings, and added protection against the impact of orbital debris to the leading edges of the wings and heat radiators inside the cargo bay doors.
To illustrate the evolving shuttle, officials at the Kennedy Space Center here showed off the shuttle Atlantis on Thursday, giving journalists unprecedented access to the orbiter, which recently completed a major upgrade. During a 10-month, $70 million overhaul, the Atlantis was taken out of flight rotation and given more than 130 major modifications while being disassembled, cleaned, tested and put back together again. Such reconditioning typically occurs every four or five years.
The 86-ton spaceplane returned to Kennedy last September from a Boeing plant in Palmdale, Calif., weighing 1,000 pounds less and full of enhancements, including a modern cockpit with digital display screens and a new navigation system and other electronics that rival the latest airliners.
"This new cockpit is a major improvement and should make the shuttle much easier and safer to fly," said Col. James D. Halsell Jr. of the Air Force, who will command the Atlantis on its first mission after the overhaul, a supply flight to the international space station tentatively set for December.
Dressed in a white "clean room" suit that includes a hood over his head to prevent stray hairs from contaminating the Atlantis's near-sterile environment, Colonel Halsell showed similarly clad visitors the shuttle's new "glass cockpit." Gone are four black-and-white cathode ray television screens and numerous mechanical instruments and gauges, replaced by an array of color active-matrix displays like those found on portable computers. The nine flat-screen displays in front of the pilots, plus two more in the rear cockpit, can be programmed to show all kinds of flight information and sensor data.
Shuttle pilots said the new displays, each with a square 6.7-inch viewing area showing better organized and color-coded data, should help them to obtain and understand information more quickly during the critical eight-and-a-half-minute trip from takeoff to orbit and subsequent landing.
"The cockpit displays are the most visible sign of changes in the shuttles, but a lot of the other modifications will be of huge benefit to the crews," said Lieut. Col. Scott J. Horowitz, who will pilot the Atlantis on its next flight. "The shuttle will be flying for a long time because nothing else can do its job. This thing will outlive my career and a lot of other people's, too."
With continued updating, officials say, these shuttles could conceivably fly for another 20 or 30 years.
Elric McHenry, the shuttle program development manager, said Congress and the Clinton Administration would soon decide what to do about a replacement for the shuttle. But whatever the decision, he said, the shuttle fleet would continue to fly for at least a decade, and probably longer, because there are no alternatives on the immediate horizon.
"It's prudent for the shuttle program to assume that for the next 10 years, we will be it," Mr. McHenry said at a news briefing, "and I personally believe we will fly much longer than that."
Other space experts agree. Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in Washington, said that the only shuttle alternatives that existed were on paper and that he believed the current spacecraft would continue flying for 15 to 20 years. "The shuttle is the only re-usable, manned spacecraft that we've got," he said.
John E. Pike, space policy expert for the Federation of American Scientists, said the shuttle could be the spacecraft equivalent of the much-modified B-52 bomber, which the Air Force recently said could remain in service more than 70 years after its introduction. "The shuttle could continue flying like the B-52, with the only limit being its airframe life," Mr. Pike said.
Daniel S. Goldin, the administrator of NASA, said the versatility of the shuttle made it difficult to find alternatives, particularly for servicing the international space station now being constructed in orbit. People have suggested alternative vehicles that would only carry crews to and from the station, or that would serve as unpiloted cargo haulers, but no proposal is up to all the shuttle's jobs, he told reporters last month.
"The shuttle is a rocket for eight-and-a-half minutes capable of carrying a crew and cargo, but the shuttle is also a spacecraft that can operate independently in space for 8 to 14 days," Mr. Goldin said. If a major problem occurred aboard the space station that required outside repairs, he said, there would be a need for a craft like the shuttle, in which crews could live and work for long periods.
Officials noted that the shuttle fleet was still less than one-fourth of the way through its design lifetime and that continued modernization was making it safer, more capable and less expensive to fly with each year. Each of the $2 billion shuttles was designed for 100 flights and the most used orbiters, the Columbia and Discovery, had so far flown 25 missions each.
While the shuttles technically could fly for 30 more years with updating, Mr. McHenry said the program probably would not last that long for economic reasons. As new technology, like different types of engines or electronics, emerges for better, cheaper spacecraft, he said, it might make more economic sense to apply it to a new vehicle rather than adapt it to the shuttles.
NASA spends about $100 million a year to develop and install modifications and upgrades for the orbiter fleet, Mr. McHenry said. For example, the agency spent about $200 million to develop the equipment and software for the new cockpit, he said, including $9 million to install it in Atlantis. It should cost slightly less to put the new flight deck into each of the other shuttles as they come up for refitting.
Mr. McHenry said NASA was considering numerous other modifications, including installing a new system of jets, using less toxic fuels, to control the shuttles in space, improving the life of the fuel cells that generate electricity on missions and developing a new front landing gear for better safety under hazardous landing conditions.
Even more radical changes have been suggested, like replacing the solid-fuel booster rockets with safer, liquid-fuel boosters designed to fly back to their launching site. But with a projected development cost of more than $5 billion, experts question whether the investment would be worth it.

HEADLINE: Can Russia Be an Ally We Can Depend On?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A May 2 Week in Review article asks whether the United States wants a strong or a weak Russia. The answer should be that we want a Russia -- weak or strong -- that will be a responsible international player. 
 NATO's war with Serbia comes at the same time as Russia's economic collapse and NATO's expansion. Thus, we must take particular care not to wind up with a new cold war. To that end we should facilitate and enhance Russia's role as a peacemaker in Kosovo. The best end would be similar to Bosnia, where Russian troops participate in a peacekeeping operation.
After Kosovo, we should strengthen Russia's ties to NATO while recognizing that our interests and Russia's will not always coincide. In the Caspian region we should include Russia in the pipeline networks, thus diminishing incentives for Moscow to destabilize other Caspian states.

HEADLINE: Debt Relief for Poorest

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Poor Nations and the Debt Trap" (editorial, April 30):
Providing debt relief to the poorest countries would not only increase primary school enrollment, but it would also save lives. Fourteen percent of children in Tanzania reportedly die before age 5, and 40 percent of Tanzania's population dies by age 35, yet the country spends nine times more on foreign debt payments than on health care. 
 The debt relief bill introduced in Congress would require each country receiving debt relief to establish a human development fund to hold the debt relief savings. The use of the fund would be restricted to reducing the number of people living in poverty, expanding access to education and health care, and preventing environmental degradation. The bill excludes countries that support international terrorism or that have excessive military spending, gross violations of human rights, or drug trafficking.

HEADLINE: Several Big Auto Makers Posted Robust April Sales

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 3

 BODY:
In a further sign of consumers' willingness to keep spending in a robust economy, auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April.
The Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., Toyota, Honda and Nissan, along with a number of smaller auto makers, reported strong sales today, and the industry as a whole is on track to match or beat its vigorous sales pace of last April. 
 Ford said its sales rose 6.6 percent last month to 345,672 compared with the corresponding period a year ago. Those figures included Volvo sales, since Ford's acquisition of the Swedish car maker was completed March 31. Excluding Volvo's results, Ford's sales rose 4.1 percent, with car sales falling 1 percent and sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks rising 7.8 percent.
DaimlerChrysler said sales at its American unit, Chrysler, rose 2 percent, to 225,195. Mercedes-Benz sales dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent in the United States last month. Excluding the Mercedes results, DaimlerChrysler's car sales rose 5.9 percent and its truck sales edged up four-tenths of 1 percent to record levels.
Honda sales have set records each month this year. In April, sales rose 4 percent, to 90,352. Honda's car sales fell 3.1 percent but were offset by a 52.9 percent rise in truck sales. "Confidence in the economy remains strong and continues to drive consumer demand for big-ticket items," said Dick Colliver, executive vice president for American Honda.
Toyota sales rose 9.6 percent, to 118,833. Nissan sales rose 21.5 percent, to 47,243. "There's a lot to celebrate," said David Bradley, an auto analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc.
Auto stocks generally rose today. Ford was up $2.75, to $66.6875, and DaimlerChrysler increased $1.9375, to $100.125.
The General Motors Corporation is scheduled to report its April sales results Tuesday. G.M. put on hefty discounts last April, which jump-started its sluggish sales, and will have a tough time improving on its results year-over-year. Indeed, Wall Street analysts expect G.M.'s sales to drop as much as 3 percent. Mr. Bradley said that "even if the numbers are down a bit, they would still be very strong numbers." Shares rose $4.6875, to $93.75.
Month after month, this year's auto sales results have surprised even the experts: auto industry economists have repeatedly raised their industry sales forecasts.
"I've been doing it pretty much every month this year as the results kept coming in stronger and stronger," said W. Van Bussmann, corporate economist at DaimlerChrysler. In December, he predicted the industry would sell 14.8 million cars, trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles this year. He has raised his forecast four times since then, to 15.6 million cars and trucks.
Economists at Ford and General Motors have also increased their estimates. Ford began the year predicting the industry would sell between 14.6 million and 15.1 million cars and light trucks this year. In mid-March, it added a half-million vehicles, and just a few weeks after that said sales would likely fall at the top end of the range, or 15.6 million, in line with Chrysler's predictions.
G.M.'s forecast mirrored Ford's at the beginning of the year, and economists there now expect the industry to sell between 15.3 million and 15.9 million cars and light trucks this year.
During the first quarter, sales reached an annual pace of 16.6 million, well above last year's first-quarter sales of 14.9 million. Even if the pace slows somewhat later this year, the industry could break its all-time sales record of 16 million cars and light trucks, set in 1986. "It certainly is a possibility that we'll exceed that 1986 record," said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a senior economist at Ford.

HEADLINE: Still Opposed, Planners Let Airport Link Go Ahead

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
After voicing nearly unanimous disdain for a Port Authority plan to build a rail link to Kennedy International Airport, the New York City Planning Commission authorized the city yesterday to acquire several properties that will allow the project to proceed.
The commissioners expressed many concerns about the $1.5 billion light-rail plan, including fears that it would cost too much to build and to operate. Some commissioners also said they were afraid it would not appeal to nearly as many riders as predicted, because Manhattan passengers would have to switch trains at the Long Island Rail Road station in Jamaica, Queens. The commission said the proposed $5 ticket price would also discourage use. 
 Then, speaking just as firmly as when they were stating their reservations, 12 of the 13 commissioners said that the Kennedy rail line was of critical importance to the city's future and that therefore they would not deny the city's application to acquire the several properties between the railroad station and the airport and turn them over to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Instead, they urged the Port Authority to rethink the plan.
The chairman, Joseph B. Rose, and other members said the panel was primarily responsible for determining whether the city was justified in seeking to acquire the properties, which left the commissioners room to approve the plan despite their serious reservations.
"This is without question the most difficult vote that I have been asked to make in my five years as a member of this commission," Mr. Rose said at the commission's meeting yesterday. "The Department of City Planning, this Planning Commission, myself personally, this administration, believe that meaningful access to our airports, especially J.F.K., is one of the most important single things that can be done for our economic future."
Mr. Rose said New York was perhaps the world's only major urban center without a direct train link to its major airports. But he added, "At the same time, this project as currently conceived is clearly not a successful project. It will not provide the level of service, it will not provide the access to the airport that this city, that this region, has a right to expect."
Explaining his reasoning for voting to let the project go ahead, he said, "We have the procedural good fortune, I think, on this commission to be asked to vote not on whether we think this project is a good project, but on whether it is appropriate for the city to convey the properties." Only one commissioner, Kathy H. Chin, voted against the plan.
The Planning Commission's vote means that the City Council can consider the rail plan, and the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said he would call it up next week.
"The massive size and scope of this project warrants our full attention and review, and its impacts must be examined and discussed openly and publicly," Mr. Vallone said in statement yesterday.
The Port Authority plan calls for a 3.4-mile rail line joining Kennedy's nine terminals to one another. A three-mile line would connect the terminals to parking lots, rental car agencies and the Howard Beach station of the A subway line.
The most controversial part of the plan is another three-mile line, elevated 55 feet and running down the center of the Van Wyck Expressway and connecting the airport with the Jamaica station, where passengers could transfer to the Long Island Rail Road, the E, J and Z subway lines and to various bus lines.
Queens civic groups are almost universally opposed, fearing noise and traffic disruptions from years of construction, but the plan has received some community support because it is to include renovation and expansion of the Jamaica station.
Neither Mr. Vallone nor his aides would speculate on what the Council will do at next week's meeting, but a Council report issued last month raised a number of concerns about the project, including the suggestion that a rail link to La Guardia Airport was needed more.
The report also concluded that the Port Authority's "assumption that the Van Wyck el would stimulate development where none had existed before is unsupported by any previous experience in New York City."

HEADLINE: 3 Sets of Data Are Positive For Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Manufacturing grew in April for the third consecutive month, and personal income and spending and construction spending all rose in March, a private industry survey and Government reports showed today.
"The economy looks like it still has lots of momentum," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. "Manufacturing looks reasonably good. Consumer spending is rising. Housing is strong." 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index was 52.8 last month. While that was down from a March reading of 54.3, it was still the third consecutive monthly reading above 50, indicating more businesses reported improved conditions than showed declines.
Personal incomes of Americans rose four-tenths of a percent in March after rising five-tenths of a percent in February, the Commerce Department said. Personal spending also rose four-tenths of a percent in March after increasing eight-tenths of a percent in February.
In another report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose five-tenths of a percent in March, to a record $708.1 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, paced by record spending on residential and road projects.
The March rise in personal spending was restrained by a drop in demand for automobiles, while consumers bought more nondurable goods like clothing. The gain in income for the month was limited by a rise of three-tenths of a percent in wages, the smallest since September. That was partly attributable to the first drop in wages for manufacturing, mining and agriculture jobs since June 1998.
The cooling of the purchasing managers' index in April was attributed to small declines in new orders and production. Still, the decrease was the first this year and came after a nine-point increase during the first quarter. That was the largest increase since the second quarter of 1991, when the current economic expansion was just beginning.
Much of the strength of the expansion, now a record for peacetime, comes from growing consumer demand. With an abundance of jobs and rising incomes, consumers spent at the fastest pace in 11 years during the first quarter. That propelled the economy to a 4.5 percent annual growth rate in the first three months of the year after a 6 percent gain in last year's final quarter.
Still, the rebound in manufacturing in the first quarter is expected to take some time getting on its feet. Last year's slump was caused in part by a drop in exports, the first in 13 years. Recessions in Japan and elsewhere cut international demand for American-made products.
"Manufacturing was so badly beaten up last year that manufacturers aren't going to make a big commitment" to adding workers or increasing output, said Christopher Low, an economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
On the inflation front, the purchasers association reported its index of prices paid rose to 49.9 in April from 43.2 during March, an indication that more companies reported price increases during the month.
Oil prices rose for a second month in April, topping $18 a barrel for the first time since February 1998, after petroleum exporters agreed to production cuts. In New York today, oil rose 19 cents, to $18.85 a barrel.
Rising oil prices will add to manufacturers' production costs, hurting profit margins and pushing customer prices higher, Ms. Latta said.

Succession Fight Roils World Trade Organization

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 3

 BODY:
A leadership crisis disrupted operations of the World Trade Organization today after weekend negotiations collapsed, with no breakthrough in sight.
Supporters of the New Zealand and Thai finalists for the post of director general at the 134-nation group both insisted their candidate should win. 
 Diplomats fear that the brawl at the four-year-old organization, which makes rules and arbitrates disagreements in international commerce, could stall resolution of many trade disputes and jeopardize preparations for new trade talks set for Seattle in November.
"Whether this is resolved quickly or without blood on the floor, it could impact on the climate for preparations," said Pakistan's trade envoy, Munir Akram, whose country backs the Thai candidate. Carlos Perez del Castillo, Uruguay's top trade delegate, who backs the candidate from New Zealand, said, "The W.T.O. is absolutely paralyzed."
Under the organization's rules, the term of the outgoing Director General, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, which was to expire Friday, was extended through today because a successor had not been chosen. He appointed a caretaker administrator to handle routine chores, but only a new director general can make important decisions, such as selecting arbitrators for disputes and admitting new members.
Animosity over who would replace Mr. Ruggiero first broke into the open Friday when the organization's selection committee said one candidate, Mike Moore, a former New Zealand Prime Minister, had the highest and broadest geographical support among member nations. Supporters of Mr. Moore's rival, Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister, furiously rejected the choice, contending that the 62-to-59 vote tally among member countries was dubious and too close to declare Mr. Moore victorious.
 Groups of countries supporting each candidate caucused today, each accusing the other of hardball tactics. On Sunday, countries backing Mr. Moore urged delegates not to resort to a precedent-setting and potentially divisive vote that Mr. Supachai's supporters are demanding.
 The trade organization has sought to avoid a formal vote for fear that it could set big trading powers like the United States and the European Union against the smaller, but more numerous, developing countries, creating polarizing frictions that would undermine its legitimacy. Traditionally, the organization tries to make important decisions by consensus.
Both finalists insisted they would fight to the end, suggesting there was no room for compromise. "We are not pulling out," Mr. Supachai said. Mr. Moore, in a telephone interview from New Zealand's mission in Geneva, said: "We're stronger than before. The issue now is whether you support the rules or not."
A group of countries backing Mr. Moore, which included Uruguay, Venezuela, France, Turkey and Sweden, issued a statement urging Mr. Supachai to withdraw. "If Moore is vetoed, there is no way Supachai will be the next director general," said Mr. Perez del Castillo of Uruguay.
 Mr. Supachai's backers, led by developing countries, have become increasingly angry over what they view as a bias against him by the large trading powers, particularly the United States. Zimbabwe's envoy, T. J. B. Jokonya, complained Saturday that a "most deadly arsenic diatribe was unleashed on those who dared to oppose the wish of the anointed." He was referring to efforts by supporters of Mr. Moore to defeat Mr. Supachai..
 Many nations supporting Mr. Supachai were stunned at the choice of the selection committee because the 52-year-old Thai economist had reportedly been ahead since the process of country-by-country consultation got under way last fall. Many believed the selection was purposely delayed in order to garner more support for Mr. Moore, 50.
"The big boys thought it would all be decided behind closed doors, like last time," Mr. Akram of Pakistan said. "But the W.T.O. has evolved and it's time for a developing country choice."
 In Bangkok, politicians argued that it was time to review ties with the United States.
 Japan, an influential supporter of Mr. Supachai, was sticking by its candidate. Yoichi Suzuki, a trade diplomat from Japan, said, "We have more problems with the process than the candidate."
 Mr. Suzuki said the vote tally announced Friday "shows that it's finely balanced," adding, "You can't tell who is winning."

HEADLINE: Ernest Gross, a Key Diplomat During Cold War, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Ernest A. Gross, a diplomat and an international lawyer who was closely involved in issues of war and peace from the Korean War to decolonization and disarmament, died on Sunday at his home in New York City. He was 92.
Mr. Gross, whose life as a diplomat began in 1931, when he joined the State Department as legal adviser, went on to serve as a delegate to the United Nations during a particularly tense period in 1950. Later, he was legal counsel to Ralph Bunche, then Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations, who was called before panels investigating his loyalty during the McCarthy period, and to the United Nations Secretary General, Dag Hammarskjold. In 1948, Mr. Gross was among those who introduced a convention against genocide to the United Nations, and in the 1960's, while in private practice, he brought a suit in the World Court against the South African Government for its policies of apartheid. 
 But the most dramatic period in Mr. Gross's long public career took place soon after he was appointed by Secretary of State Dean Acheson to be America's deputy delegate to the United Nations on Oct. 11, 1949. Two months later, Warren Austin, the chief delegate, took a leave of absence and Mr. Gross, a soft-spoken and scholarly professional, took over the effort to parry Soviet attempts to transfer China's United Nations seat to the Communists, who had just won the civil war, from Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who had just fled the mainland for Taiwan.
It was on Jan. 13, 1950, when Mr. Gross was attending his first meeting of the Security Council, that Jacov Malik, the Soviet delegate, walked out of a discussion over China's representation. For reasons that have generated wonder and debate ever since, Mr. Malik stayed away from the Council in protest for months. He was still absent on June 25, when North Korea invaded the South. By the end of that day, the Security Council, unrestrained by the threat of a Soviet veto, condemned the North Korean attack and called for the withdrawal of Kim Il Sung's forces.
Many years later, Mr. Gross discussed what seemed to be Mr. Malik's extraordinary blunder, which allowed the United Nations not merely to vote for a peacekeeping force, but to brand one warring party as the initiator of conflict and commit unequivocal support to the other side.
"I think the Soviets felt they had very little, if anything, to worry about," Mr. Gross said in 1975. "They did not anticipate that the Security Council would take action."
In the fall, Mr. Austin returned to take over the American delegation again and Mr. Gross resumed work as his deputy, leaving in 1953 to enter private practice as a partner in the law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle. He remained affiliated with the firm until his death.
Mr. Gross was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 23, 1906. He attended De Witt Clinton High School in the Bronx and went on to Harvard College, where he graduated in 1927. After studying and rowing at Oxford University, he returned to Harvard for Law School and met Kathryn Watson, the daughter of Senator James Watson, Republican of Indiana. They were married in 1933.
That same year, Mr. Gross left the State Department and signed on as a division counsel for the National Recovery Administration, the agency coordinating President Franklin D. Roosevelt's anti-Depression strategies. A year later, Mr. Gross left Government service and served as counsel for the National Association of Manufacturers. In 1940, he returned to public life, as associate counsel for the National Labor Relations Board.
"I was the only living man who ever went from the N.A.M. to the N.L.R.B.," said Mr. Gross, speaking of the two organizations, the first of which scorned labor unions while the other empowered them.
In 1943, he was commissioned as a captain in the Army, and then promoted to lieutenant colonel when he served the chief of the economic section of the Civil Affairs Division of the War Department General Staff. With peace he returned to the State Department, serving as deputy to the Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas. From 1948 until 1953, he was with the United Nations.
But some of that involvement with the world body spanned a much longer time. For example, it was Mr. Gross who, representing the United States, signed the United Nations Genocide convention in 1948. On the eve of the General Assembly vote, he had urged approval for the treaty "before the memory of recent horrifying genocidal acts has faded from the minds and conscience of man."
The vote passed but it would take another four decades years before the United States would ratify the convention. In 1985, Mr. Gross, a prolific and lifelong writer of letters to editors, felt impelled to write a letter to The New York Times rejecting the reservations to ratification that had been raised in an Op-Ed article by Senator Orrin G. Hatch. "The convention should have been ratified long ago," Mr. Gross wrote.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children, Suzanne Wolff of Baltimore, Peter W. Gross of San Francisco and Catherine Gross of New York, and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: With Budget Cutting, Medicare Spending Fell Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
New Government data show that Medicare spending actually declined in the first half of the current fiscal year.
Congress and President Clinton clamped down on Medicare spending in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, curbing payments for many services. They expected to slow the growth of Medicare. But for the six months ended March 31, Medicare spending was in fact $2.6 billion less than the $106.5 billion spent in the similar period the previous year, according to data from the Treasury Department. 
 With cuts proving deeper than Congress intended, health care providers of all types are furiously lobbying Congress to restore money cut from their payments. They are competing with Medicare beneficiaries who want to use the same pot of money for new benefits, especially coverage of prescription drugs, now a major out-of-pocket expense for the elderly and disabled.
Medicare spending has risen continually since the program began in 1965, and Federal officials had predicted that the growth would pick up again this year after it slowed to 1.5 percent last year. But so far the predictions are wrong.
Hanns Kuttner, an expert on health policy who worked in the Bush Administration, said, "This defies the first principle of Medicare policy analysis: that Medicare costs will always rise faster than the rate of inflation."
Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who headed a bipartisan commission on the future of Medicare, said, "We're now starting to feel the pinch from the Medicare cuts required in the balanced budget agreement, and I fear the worst is yet to come."
Doctors, hospitals, physical therapists, home health agencies, nursing homes and health maintenance organizations have deployed a small army of lobbyists, seeking to persuade Congress to rewrite or repeal parts of the 1997 law. Home health care and nursing homes have been hit particularly hard. As a result of the cuts, they contend, patients have less access to some types of care, like home health services in some parts of the country, and the quality of care has begun to erode.
Medicare is clearly spending less than Congress anticipated. In the spring of 1997, before passage of the Balanced Budget Act, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that Medicare would spend $1,348 billion on health care for the elderly and disabled from 1998 to 2002. About 39 million people are now enrolled in Medicare. After the law was signed, in a spirit of bipartisan celebration in August 1997, the budget office revised its estimate, predicting that Medicare spending would total $1,249 billion in that five-year period.
Now the budget office is predicting that Medicare will spend $1,146 billion in that period, a huge amount of money but much less than anticipated just two years ago.
Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said, "There was a gross underestimate of the savings from the Balanced Budget Act."
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said, "Congress really overshot the runway when it passed the law."
Several other factors have helped stop the growth of Medicare. A Federal crackdown on fraud and abuse has made doctors, hospitals and home health agencies more cautious in the claims they submit to Medicare, so they are less likely to overcharge the Government.
In addition, Medicare and its contractors are taking more time to review and pay claims. The contractors are moving more slowly because they have adopted new safeguards to detect fraud, and because they are preoccupied with getting Medicare computers ready for the year 2000.
In the past, when Congress cut Medicare payments for one service, health care providers often responded by providing more of another service, for which money continued to flow freely. But this has become difficult because Congress in 1997 cut back Medicare payments for almost all types of health care services.
"The law had more synergy than we expected," said Gail R. Wilensky, chairwoman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent body that advises Congress.
Medicare spending for home health care fell nearly 15 percent last year, to $14.9 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office now says home health agencies will get a total of $79 billion from 1998 to 2002, or $48 billion less than the office predicted in January 1997.
Medicare payments to skilled nursing homes rose 8.9 percent last year, to $13.2 billion, but the budget office foresees a decline of 3.8 percent this year. The budget office now says nursing homes will get $66.7 billion from 1998 to 2002, or $16.6 billion less than the office predicted in January 1997.
Federal officials have drafted a letter to state officials saying that some nursing homes face "drastic declines in revenues" and "may suddenly close their doors, potentially placing residents at risk." Spokesmen for nursing home chains agree and are pleading with Congress for more money. But an increase for any group will be difficult.
"In a political sense, there's only a certain amount of money available for Medicare," said John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons. "To the extent it goes to providers, then it's not available for additional benefits."
Asked whether the 1997 law was squeezing Medicare payments more than expected, Dr. Wilensky said, "In the short run, the answer is definitely yes."
The Congressional Budget Office predicts that, despite "the sudden flattening of Medicare expenditures" in the last year, annual outlays will more than double in the next decade and will exceed $400 billion by 2008. By then there will be more than 44 million beneficiaries.
"The anticipated growth," it said, "reflects advances in medical technology that are expected to raise health care costs and a continued increase in the use of services by beneficiaries."

HEADLINE: TRACK AND FIELD;
Taking the Long Way

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
Haile Gebrselassie, the world's greatest distance runner, arrived in Manhattan yesterday after a 16-hour flight from Ethiopia and made plans for an easy jog to stretch his legs. Of course, for him, easy means an hour running the roller-coaster hills of Central Park.
"I know Central Park is where the New York Marathon ends," the 26-year-old Gebrselassie said. "I want to run the marathon here. If you win New York, it is like winning the Olympics." 
 This season, Gebrselassie will embark on an ambitious, unprecedented campaign to eventually gain world records at every distance from 3,000 meters to the marathon. Already, he has run the fastest times ever at 5,000 and 10,000 meters. By late June, he would like to add the 3,000 and two-mile records to his resume. And after the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, where he figures to defend the gold medal at 10,000 meters that he won in Atlanta in 1996, Gebrselassie will turn to the event that means everything in Ethiopia -- the marathon.
Until he wins a marathon -- as Abebe Bikila did at the 1960 Rome Olympics and the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, as Mamo Wolde did in Mexico City in 1968, as Fatuma Roba did in the women's race in Atlanta -- Gebrselassie jokes that his countrymen will consider him a mere sprinter. "I have to run the marathon because of the people," Gebrselassie said. "That's all they think about, the marathon. They don't understand the 5,000 and 10,000. When I win, they say, 'Haile, where did you get that record in the marathon?' That is their race."
He has interrupted his training this week to promote an autobiographical movie called, "Endurance," which was made by Disney and directed by Leslie Woodhead. It opens May 14 in New York and Los Angeles under the billing of a "nonfiction feature."
The movie features not actors, but members of Gebrselassie's family, who portray their own lives or stand in for close relatives. A nephew of Gebrselassie plays him as a youngster; he plays himself as an adult. An older sister plays his late mother. His father is in the movie, along with his wife, Alem. As actors they are remarkably natural, having grown up in a culture without television. Not trained how to act like someone else, they act inconspicuously like themselves.
The film's title refers not only to the stamina of distance running but to the harsh subsistence living in one of the world's poorest countries. Athletes from developing nations now dominate everything beyond the sprints, perhaps, in part, because they are unaccustomed to affluence and willing to accommodate suffering and deprivation. The movie recounts, with spare dialogue and lush cinematography, Gebrselassie's upbringing on a peasant farm in East Africa -- running six miles to school, walking three hours round trip to find water, living in a hut made of mud and cow dung, ignoring a stern father who wanted him to be a clerk or a lawyer, losing a loving mother who died when he was a boy.
The funeral of his mother -- who was carried from home on a bed to a bus, which took her to a hospital and away from her family forever -- was so real and painful for Gebrselassie's father, that he asked that it not be included in the film.
"We still have not shown him that part," Gebrselassie said.
The movie's climax consists of suspenseful footage of Gebrselassie's victory in the 10,000 meters at the Atlanta Olympics, shot by the Olympic documentarian Bud Greenspan. The 25-lap event was ignored by NBC, which apparently doubted its audience's long-distance attention span, but on the big screen the audience is allowed to hear the runners breathe, to sense their determination and to watch the sweat-drenched strategy unfold.
The 5-foot-3-inch Gebrselassie bided his time, running on the balls of his feet, his head perfectly still, his arms carried high and pumping economically, his barrel chest extended, a fluttering lower lip the only sign of exertion. Then, on the final lap, he broke into a sprint, and a sort of death-mask smile creased his face as he neared the finish, looking repeatedly over his shoulder and realizing that his Kenyan challenger could not catch him. His feet were so blistered by the hard running surface that he took the victory stand wearing shower clogs.
This is the form that has carried him to world records in the 5,000 (12 minutes 39.36 seconds) and 10,000 (26:22.75), and that will challenge the records of Daniel Komen of Kenya, who has run the 3,000 in 7:20.67 and two miles in 7:58.61. At high altitude in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, Gebrselassie has been honing his speed work -- 3x2,000 in 5:05; 4x1,000 in 2:26; 3x800 in 1:53; 3x600 in 1:25; 3x400 in 53 seconds; 5x200 in 24 seconds.
"The two-mile is not so hard, but the 3,000 is a tough record," said Gebrselassie, whose best of 7:25.09 in the latter is nearly five seconds slower than Komen's best. "Maybe it is easier for a 1,500-meter runner moving up."
After Sydney, he said, he will dispense with the track to concentrate on the marathon. The possibilities of Gebrselassie in the marathon have the sport hyperventilating. He said he will likely run first in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in the spring of 2001, and that he would also like to run New York, Boston, Tokyo and London. The marathon at the 2004 Olympics in Athens "will be my last competition," Gebrselassie said. "I will be 32; I will have to stop."
 There are those who believe that he can chop two minutes off the world record of 2 hours 6 minutes 5 seconds, held by Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil. Gebrselassie agrees that he will have to alter his style, that he cannot run like a sprinter, on the balls of his feet, for 26.2 miles.
"I'm sure I can change," Gebrselassie said. "When you run longer and become more tired, you use your whole foot. In my opinion, I can run a very good marathon."
He has run one before, at age 16, when he arrived in Addis Ababa from the countryside for the first time, carrying all of his belongings in a plastic bag. He struggled across the finish line in 2:48, his legs chafed and unable to carry him another step. "My coach tried to stop me during the race," Gebrselassie said. "At the end, he said, 'This is what you want. Are you crazy?' "
Acutely aware of his place in running history, he has collected film dating to the 1908 Summer Olympics. And though he has learned to drive, to keep from being mobbed on the streets in Addis Ababa, he does so sparingly. "Driving makes you lazy," Gebrselassie said. He prefers to travel by foot.
"It is important to get the records if it is possible," he said. "It means you are one of the best."

HEADLINE: De Niro and Miramax Face Problems in Film Studio Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Although Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the actor Robert De Niro and Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films announced a tentative agreement yesterday to build a movie studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, major elements of the deal to transform the cavernous shipbuilding complex into a glamorous film factory are not in place.
The proposed $150 million project would turn a 15-acre site on Wallabout Bay into 12 huge sound stages for film and television production and revive the home of Brooklyn's oldest industry, the long-closed 129-year-old Navy Yard. But the economics of such a project and the vagaries of the film industry are daunting. 
 Even as a news conference got under way yesterday near the dry docks at the Navy Yard, Mr. De Niro's company, TriBeCa Productions, and the developer for the project, Vornado Realty Trust, had not signed a letter of intent with city officials, despite repeated attempts during a series of meetings last weekend and yesterday.
Nor had Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado, been able to sign a separate agreement with the movie makers, Mr. De Niro and Mr. Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, that detailed the extent of their involvement in the project.
The financing is not quite in place and two men who started the project, Louis Madigan and Cary Hart, are objecting to the city's proposed deal.
That did not stop Mayor Giuliani, Mr. De Niro, Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Roth from declaring their allegiance to Brooklyn and their intentions to build a Hollywood-style studio where tens of thousands of workers once labored. The Mayor, like nearly every other executive or city official who went to the microphone, noted his birth in Brooklyn.
"This facility will allow producers to shoot an entire movie, from start to finish, right here in New York City," Mr. Giuliani said. "It will not only encourage new film production in the city; it will also help revitalize an area that has long been under-used."
Mr. De Niro, whose company produces about five films a year, was equally ebullient. "Everything we would do, we would do here," he said. "That's the whole point. Being part of this is very exciting for me and great for New York."
Sounding a little like the mobster-turned-therapy patient he played in his latest film, "Analyze This," Mr. De Niro added: "I could be wrong a little bit here and there. But you cannot fail in this."
Under the terms of the still-unsigned deal, the venture led by Vornado would invest $35 million. The Fisher real estate family, which owns Plaza Construction, would build the project and become a partner in the deal. The city, in turn, would provide a $25 million low-interest loan, while Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation would put in $8 million more.
The Union Labor Life Insurance Company is considering investing and providing about $82 million in financing, although it has not yet made a commitment. Keyspan Energy, which will build the electrical system, may also invest.
A copy of the proposed letter of intent obtained by The New York Times specifies the role of the city and Vornado but says nothing about the obligations of TriBeCa Productions. Miramax, which shoots 10 to 15 films a year, is not even a signatory.
Randy L. Levine, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, acknowledged that there was still lots of work to be done, including environmental studies and other reviews. "Hopefully," he said, "we'll be back in a year to break ground."
In the last year, nearly a dozen film or television projects have been announced, but nearly all of them have foundered. Sound stages are expensive to build, but film producers, unlike office tenants, rent a studio only for several months and are not willing to pay top dollar.
City officials boast of the surging number of films and television series shot in New York in the last five years, but industry executives contend that many of the major film companies are in the midst of cutbacks. Competition with Toronto and Vancouver has only intensified.
The executives said that the Brooklyn Navy Project might work because it joins real estate executives with film makers.
"It's an expensive business to run and the profit margins are notoriously thin," said Mitchell Brill, executive vice president of the New York Production Alliance, a trade group. "That being said, there are ways to make studios lucrative."
According to executives involved in the Navy Yard project, Mr. Madigan and Mr. Hart have not come to terms with Vornado.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Madigan and Mr. Hart, who were given a 5 percent stake in the latest deal, tried to oust Vornado, which, according to city officials and executives on both sides, had offered them only $2 million. The two men have told friends that they had spent nearly $2.5 million. Last weekend, Mr. Madigan demanded at least $3 million and refused to sign the letter of intent. But a senior City Hall official said the deal would go forward with or without them.

HEADLINE: Some Companies Derail the 'Burnout' Track

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Linda Davis, the Great Lakes-area sales manager for Hewlett-Packard, realized she had a crisis on her hands. Her sales team had been chalking up impressive revenues, but the strain of long work hours was showing. There were too many broken marriages, the attrition rate had risen to 20 percent in a tight labor market, and when asked on the annual company survey if they were "experiencing excessive pressure" on the job, more than 50 percent of her workers had said yes.
So when headquarters sought volunteers for an experimental program to reduce and redesign workloads, Ms. Davis jumped. Employees are now asked to set annual goals not only for productivity but for leisure as well. They are expected to meet both, and if they fall short, their supervisors have to answer for it. At monthly meetings, team members are asked to list three business goals and three personal ones. And when a staff member achieves a milestone, such as leaving at 2 P.M. to take a daughter ice skating, co-workers are encouraged to applaud with the same gusto as they would for someone landing an order for laser printers. 
 After nearly a decade of piling on the responsibilities, a smattering of American companies like Hewlett-Packard are beginning to worry about the consequences. Concerns ranging from a lack of creativity to "burnout" -- the point at which an employee becomes too tired to work effectively, or even at all -- have emerged as among the most urgent topics at human resources forums.
The movement to do something about the problem is inchoate -- many companies are talking about it but do not know how to move from their old ways -- but some companies are experimenting with ways to alleviate workloads: everything from limiting work to 40 hours a week to discouraging employees from checking their E-mail and phone messages over the weekend.
At Hewlett-Packard, Ms. Davis acknowledges that the emphasis on leisure has had a noticeable effect on the work side of the equation. Some tasks have been reorganized so they can be shared by 9-to-5 administrative assistants. On the whole, she says, referring to how much an employee can accomplish in a day, "expectations have been lowered." Still, she says, productivity has not suffered where it counts. The Great Lakes area remains a top sales region, and out of a staff of 74, she lost only two people last year, and both of them were promoted within the company. Moreover, several staff members who received outside offers have stayed put, and one top performer who had been lured away by a start-up actually returned.
Unlike the last wave of corporate initiatives aimed at helping employees balance work with their personal lives -- flexible hours, telecommuting, and concierge services -- new programs like Hewlett-Packard's aim for more than convenience. At their most ambitious they address the fundamental problem of how much time a job demands and how to build a life beyond work.
The incidence of burnout has not been measured in any meaningful way, but since the corporate downsizing of the 80's, American workers report feeling more pressed at work. Professionals and managers said they clocked an average of 48 hours a week, according to a 1997 work force study conducted by the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in New York.
But to judge by anecdotal evidence, a significant subgroup toils upward of 55 hours a week, while part-timers often find themselves putting in more than 35 hours a week. In the automobile and communications industries, hourly wage earners have also seen their week grow as mandatory overtime has become more prevalent.
The main impetus for the current effort to re-evaluate growing workloads is the drum-tight labor market, in which unemployment is at a 30-year low. "These days," says Peter Cappelli, author of "The New Deal of Work: Managing the Market-Driven Workforce" (Harvard Business School Press, 1999), "employees are able to push back a lot more and are much less willing to work themselves to death."
Adjusting to the new environment has been especially difficult for the most demanding employers. The Big Five accounting firms, which are notorious for their grueling hours and travel schedules, have suddenly found that their young, intensively trained staff members are being snatched away. Deborah K. Holms, director of the office for retention at Ernst & Young, hopes the firm's new emphasis on "empathy and humanity" will build loyalty. Pilot programs being tested at the company include "permission" for employees not to answer their voice mail and E-mail over weekends and while on vacation, and "utilization committees" that monitor employee overtime and redistribute work when the total workload consistently registers more than 50 to 55 hours a week.
Beyond the straightforward problem of retention, corporations are motivated by a growing body of research that shows that working long hours over long periods is not necessarily cost-effective. Mindy Fried of the Center for Work and Family at Boston College has been trying to quantify how much money companies lose because of the errors and additional medical claims that result from overly long hours. "The research is pretty clear that as people work over a certain number of hours, productivity goes down, stress goes up, and work isn't as good," she says.
SAS Institute Inc. in North Carolina is a privately held software company that has experienced double-digit sales growth for two decades. It is also something of a workers' paradise, where full-time employees, starting with the chief executive officer, Jim Goodknight, clock in for just 35 hours a week. The company switchboard shuts down at 5 P.M., and the main gate is shut an hour later. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford Business School, recently studied SAS, which is based in Cary, outside Raleigh. He concluded that not only did the company save tens of millions of dollars each year because its turnover rate was a fraction of the industry average, but it also gained by having more alert, less error-prone programmers.
David Russo, SAS's vice president for human resources, says that five years ago rivals considered the company's 40-hour workweek freakish and impractical, but "in the last two years, we've had 20 companies -- some really big companies -- come down and study what we're doing here."
In Silicon Valley, intense pressure to stay on the technological cutting edge and to maintain high growth rates has made 16-hour days a norm. But after years of trying to entice programmers with idiosyncratic benefits like gourmet kitchens and pet-friendly office spaces, some companies are beginning to create a work pace that is more sustainable over the long term.
John Gage, the chief engineer at Sun Microsystems, the manufacturer of work stations and compatible software, describes his programmers as "lone poets" who get so involved in their work that they often will not leave their screens until the company pries them away. To sway these workaholics, Sun, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., has developed an informal buddy system under which programmers monitor each other. "That way, if someone disappears into his office for a few days, someone will go rescue him," Mr. Gage explains. The company has also hired a slew of what he euphemistically calls "get a life" counselors, whose job it is to coach code writers on the joys of the real world -- sunlight, bike riding, children.
Nor is the hours backlash limited to professional and managerial employees. Unions say that reducing mandatory overtime has become increasingly important to their members. The United Automobile Workers has made it one of the pillars of its official negotiating platform, proclaiming that "heavy and steady overtime work can lead to depression, fatigue and confusion."
Last year, the Communication Workers of America went on strike against US West until the telephone company agreed to a pay increase and to cut mandatory overtime in half, to a maximum of eight hours a week, by January 2001. Mike Withrow, vice president of C.W.A. Local 7777 in Englewood, Colo., said the time-and-a-half compensation did not make up for the fact that members felt "they didn't have a life."
Still, many workplace experts say they are seeing a lot more talk than action. Jeremy Rifkin, author of "The End of Work," laments, "We still have too many employers who have bought the idea that the only way you get ahead is by chaining your workers to their chairs until they drop."
Sue Meisinger, senior vice president of the Society of Human Resource Managers, says that the same tight labor market that makes companies consider reducing hours also makes them pile on the work. After all, the job has to get done somehow. "Companies see the problem, but they don't know how to fix it," she says. "There is plenty of wringing of hands, but if an employee goes on vacation and there is an emergency, you will call him." The only difference now? The company will "feel guilty" about the intrusion.

HEADLINE: Two Parties Seek to Exploit a Relentless Boom in the Suburbs

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Anyone perplexed by the amount of time Vice President Al Gore has recently devoted to traffic jams and suburban sprawl should consider this: Fifty years ago fewer than a quarter of Americans lived in the suburbs; now roughly half do. Every 10 years, another 10 members of Congress represent predominantly suburban districts.
As the battle for the Presidency and control of Congress gets under way, that growth is having a more profound effect than ever before on the language and policy proposals of the parties. The focus ranges from education and child rearing, central to the family life that political consultants have identified as a suburban cornerstone, to the interest in controlling sprawl and a search for ways to appeal to the high-technology workers who populate office complexes along suburban beltways. 
 So Al Gore looks at suburban land-use policies. Elizabeth Dole courts suburban women by braving jeers in New Hampshire to defend the ban on assault weapons. And Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, the new chairman of the House Republican re-election effort, looks for candidates tailored for just such fast-growing areas as his own affluent Virginia district, the 11th, in Fairfax County.
"Clearly where the rubber is hitting the road today is the suburbs," Mr. Davis said.
To show what that could mean to Democrats, whose core voters are in the cities, Al From, president of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, points to Illinois.
When John F. Kennedy narrowly won the state in the 1960 Presidential election, Mr. From noted in an article in the council's magazine, The New Democrat, Chicago cast 35 percent of the Illinois vote; 26 percent came from the suburbs. In 1996, when President Clinton was re-elected, the suburbs cast 40 percent of the state's vote, Chicago only 20 percent.
"The electorate of the 21st century," Mr. From told Democrats in Idaho recently, "will be more educated, more affluent, more suburban, more independent, less unionized -- unless we can turn that around -- and less urban than the electorate in the 20th century."
But the political alignment of suburban voters also seems to be shifting. Two decades ago suburbanites were considered bedrock Republicans, drawn to the party's message of lower taxes and fewer handouts. Now, as the nation's Levittowns age and events like the shootings in Littleton, Colo., demonstrate that the suburbs are not immune to violence and other problems long familiar to the cities, suburbanites have become more willing to vote Democratic. Mr. Clinton defeated President George Bush in the suburbs in 1992 and made even stronger inroads in 1996, winning crucial suburban counties all across the industrial Midwest and the Northeast.
Suburbs vary immensely, of course, ranging from older communities near the cities to the new strip malls and subdivisions rising from more distant farm fields. But politicians use the term as collective shorthand for key groups of swing voters: married couples with children, the "soccer moms" who were so sought after in the 1996 election, affluent independent voters and the high-technology employees who work miles from any city.
Linda DiVall, the pollster for Mrs. Dole, says the crucial demographic group is parents who have children under 18 living at home.
"They are a little more Republican than Democrat," Ms. DiVall said, "and the candidate that wins this group tends to win the election."
Given all this, politicians are listening closely to voters like those in Montgomery County, a Republican stronghold outside Philadelphia that is home to densely packed brick houses and the swanky Main Line as well. The county backed Mr. Clinton twice and ousted a Republican Congressman last November in favor of Joseph M. Hoeffel, a Democratic county commissioner.
Mr. Hoeffel was sounding out constituents in supermarkets the other day when Joyce Wilson confronted him by a vegetable counter to talk of the school shootings in Colorado.
"I think this country is just kind of crazy the way it is handling guns," said Ms. Wilson, a pastor's assistant. She also deplored the growth in the area's Delaware Valley. "A lot of our town commissioners," she said, "are reluctant to stand up against the builders."
At another supermarket, Lynne Hall, a 52-year-old manager for a medical office, was evidence of how precarious the Democrats' hold on voters like her might be. "I voted for you," she shouted to Mr. Hoeffel, "but I still don't like that President!"
Issues like education, transportation and health care have long been on the national agenda, of course, and have an appeal stretching beyond the suburbs. But the focus on the suburbs -- and thus broadly on middle-class families -- has subtly changed how the issues are discussed.
"It's hard to separate class from geography," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "Think of where the health care debate has gone. It's not about insuring the uninsured. It's about H.M.O.'s. The debate is about how to treat people who already have insurance."
The same is true with education. Democrats once emphasized education programs for poor children, and Republicans spoke of eliminating the Education Department. Now both parties are gearing the debate toward interests of middle-class families, the Democrats stressing class size and the Republicans offering tax credits for parochial- and private-school tuition.
New this year to the national agenda are issues that appeal almost entirely to suburbanites. Mr. Gore and Democrats like Mr. Hoeffel (pronounced HUFF-uhl) are talking of suburban sprawl, traffic congestion and a need to preserve open space -- matters that are already playing prominently in state and local political races.
With the Vice President at the fore, the Clinton Administration has proposed a $10 billion "livability agenda" that would provide mass transit subsidies and tax credits to support bonding authority for protecting farmland and cleaning up abandoned industrial space.
"The livability issue is huge here," Mr. Hoeffel said, using a map of the county in his district office to point out traffic trouble spots and new development. "The suburban sprawl that we're experiencing is happening all over the country, and suburban people are up in arms."
At least one Republican strategist, Christine Matthews, thinks her party is underestimating the resonance of the issue. "You need to be empathetic to the fact that people are going a little crazy," she said. "You're going out, and all you see are these giant Wal-Marts. They are every few blocks, and it's not the kind of environment people want to live in."
For both parties, the focus on suburbanites poses challenges.
The Republicans' problem, political strategists say, is that many of these voters have been alienated by the religious right's influence on the party. It is no coincidence that a number of the leading Republican Presidential candidates are trying to keep an abortion ban far from the top of the party's 2000 agenda.
Congressman Davis said the party should reach out to the "new economy" workers through free-trade policies and legislation sought by the high-tech industry, including a bill, blocked by Senate Democrats last week, that would limit lawsuits arising from year 2000 computer breakdowns. The measure is opposed by trial lawyers, who are among the Democrats' biggest contributors.
"Instead of putting up issues like gay rights and abortion that split our constituencies," Mr. Davis said, "let's put up issues that split labor from the high-tech sector, lawyers from high tech."
The Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to emphasize their longtime issues like Social Security and Medicare. But they too are placing special emphasis on the suburbs.
"You're talking fundamentally about a suburban voter built around a family life style," said Mark Penn, the pollster for both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, "because people until they have children are much more likely to live in urban areas and then resettle once they have children."
So when Mr. Gore talks of reducing traffic, he frames road congestion as a family issue, speaking of parents "on the car phone talking to their kids, explaining why they can't get home for dinner."
Democrats battled in the last Presidential campaign over whether to stress values or economic issues, and some of them want to make sure that the emphasis on suburban voters does not eclipse the party's traditional concern for the less well off.
"I think we've got a lot of good issues to go after suburban voters," said Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, "and I think Gore is particularly well positioned to do that. But he ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. I don't see anything that makes it a mortal sin to talk about minimum wage, to talk about health care, to talk about tax fairness, loopholes and all the rest -- the stuff we used to take for granted that Democrats believed in."

Dow Crosses 11,000 Mark Just 24 Days After 10,000
The Dow Jones industrial average blew past the 11,000 mark, just 24 trading days after it topped 10,000 for the first time. The 10 percent move from March 29 was not the fastest such rise in market history, but it was the quickest jump of 10 percent to come during a period of prolonged market strength.
The Dow rose 225.65 points, or 2 percent, to 11,014.69, led by cyclical stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 19.45 points, to 1,354.63, but the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.27 points, to 2,535.58, as money moved out of technology shares. Page A1. 

Some Companies Easing Workload
After nearly a decade of piling responsibilities on workers, a smattering of American companies are beginning to worry about the consequences, ranging from a lack of creativity to burnout. And several companies are experimenting with ways to alleviate outsized workloads, including everything from explicitly limiting work to 40 hours a week to discouraging employees from checking their E-mail and phone messages over the weekend.

Bryant Gumbel's long-anticipated return to morning television will become official today when CBS announces that he has agreed to become the anchor of a revamped "CBS This Morning" program, which will be in a new studio on Fifth Avenue in New York City at the entrance to Central Park. The new program, with Mr. Gumbel and a still-to-be-named woman co-anchor, is scheduled to start sometime in the fall. C8.
 
Clinton and Obuchi Talk Strategy
President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan professed to be in agreement on strategies to pull Japan out of a seven-year slump and deregulate its economy. But their meeting underscored how many of Mr. Clinton's initiatives with Tokyo have been sunk by the Japanese recession. A3.
 
Ford Gain Leads Sizzling Auto Sales
Auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April. Ford reported a 6.6 percent rise, and gains were also reported by DaimlerChrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and several smaller auto makers, putting the industry on track to match or beat its vigorous sales pace of last April. G.M. is to report today. C2.
 
Manufacturing and Income Rise
Manufacturing grew in April for the third consecutive month, and personal income and spending and construction spending all rose in March, a private industry survey and Government reports showed. Personal incomes rose four-tenths of a percent in March after rising five-tenths of a percent in February, the Commerce Department said. C6.

HEADLINE: Japan Recession Stifles Trade Climate, if Not Summit Talk

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan professed fundamental agreement today on strategies to pull Japan from a seven-year slump and deregulate its economy. But their daylong meeting underscored how many of Mr. Clinton's once ambitious economic initiatives with Tokyo have been sunk by the Japanese recession.
Mr. Obuchi, the sixth Prime Minister Mr. Clinton has dealt with in six years, spent all morning at the White House, talking about the containment of North Korea, deregulation and Japanese aid to Kosovars. 
 He and the President then announced agreement on deregulating a range of Japanese industries, from telecommunications to medical equipment. For example, foreign companies will now be able to own 100 percent of cable television operations in Japan, and foreign telecommunications companies will be guaranteed more fairly priced rates to connect into Japan's domestic telephone network.
At a news conference, Mr. Clinton went out of his way to praise Mr. Obuchi while pressing him to "use all available tools to restore solid growth."
Mr. Clinton's aides said they feared that any of the benefits of Japan's Government spending program to spur the world's second-largest economy has been undercut by the unwillingness of many Japanese companies and consumers to spend. And they acknowledged that today's deregulatory accord would mean little if Japan's economy kept contracting.
In fact, the Japanese recession has changed the nature of meetings between Japan's leaders and Mr. Clinton. The President came into office promising to exert great pressure on Japan, open its markets and invoke sanctions if Japan's bureaucracy stood in the way. But that energy was spent after the United States and Japan battled over an accord on automotive trade in 1994, and it has never really recovered.
The auto agreement was the first big effort by the Clinton Administration to clear away regulatory hurdles that American manufacturers had complained about for years. But although the agreement led to some changes in Japanese regulations, the economic benefits Mr. Clinton had envisioned never materialized.
For example, under that agreement the Administration once boasted that the Big Three auto companies would be displaying their cars in more than 1,000 Japanese showrooms by this year. They are now in 193 showrooms, the United States Trade Representative's office says -- scarcely more than when the accord was signed. Sales of cars manufactured by Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler are down by 34 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same quarter in 1998. That is a far steeper falloff than the one in overall Japanese car sales -- yet President Clinton, who was briefed on the decline, never mentioned it in today's meeting, according to participants.
"There's a lot of Japan fatigue around here," one senior Administration official said today, "and it was evident in the meetings. There comes a moment when you recognize that while you've made some progress, it's hard to provide much proof that American workers or companies are going to benefit anytime soon."
In fact, the most notable shift in recent times is the absence of pressure from the business community for more openings into Japan.
American auto executives are virtually silent about Japan these days, and DaimlerChrysler walked away recently from a chance to take a big stake in the ailing Nissan Motor Corporation, the second-largest Japanese manufacturer. Estimates from private economists that Japan will be lucky to grow at 1 or 2 percent annually over the next decade have scared away many American companies, even though the cost of buying land for factories in Japan has not been this low in decades.
The result is an astounding turnaround: American companies are turning their backs on 120 million of the world's richest consumers, at the very moment that the Japanese Government says, for the first time since before World War II, that it is actively seeking American investors.
Mr. Obuchi argues that deregulation is critical to reviving Japanese industry, and many Japanese executives agree. His Economic Strategy Council -- made up of business executives, former bureaucrats and other influential Japanese -- recently circulated in Japanese and English a report detailing laws and regulations that should be swept away. They ranged from proposals to establish high-technology businesses to the development of bankruptcy laws that would allow the sell-off of assets of unsustainable businesses.
Japan experts note that similar reports have been prepared in Japan since the early 1980's -- and resisted by bureaucrats who did not want to lose control over every aspect of the economy, and by businesses that feared competition.
Administration officials acknowledge that deregulation has been extremely slow but say that each agreement maintains pressure on Japan to keep moving. And there are signs now that Japan's prolonged pain has in fact resulted in a rethinking, in which the deregulation of American industries has become a model.
As Richard Fischer, the Deputy Trade Representative, explained it, "There are a lot of Japanese firms who now realize that bringing down their costs -- their energy costs, their telecommunications costs -- is critical to their survival."
Despite the clear effort by the White House and Mr. Obuchi's handlers to portray this as a harmonious meeting, there were two areas of clear disagreement.
Mr. Clinton warned Mr. Obuchi, first in private, then more mildly in public, that he would begin a trade action against Japan if its shipments of steel to the United States did not soon return to the levels that existed before the onset of the Asian economic crisis.
A flood of low-cost foreign steel has already resulted in some job losses in the steel industry, leading to a Commerce Department action to penalize Japan and other countries for "dumping" steel at prices below the cost of production. While Japan's shipments to the United States have fallen in recent months, Mr. Clinton vowed stiffer action unless the levels declined.

HEADLINE: Woman in the News: Mireya Elisa Moscoso;
Earnest Icon For Panama

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: PANAMA, May 3

 BODY:
For more than 20 years, Mireya Elisa Moscoso lived in the shadow of a man 45 years her senior who, she says, even told her how to wear her hair. But by the side of that man, her late husband, Dr. Arnulfo Arias, three times President of Panama, she also gained a political schooling that on Sunday helped transform her into "Senora Presidenta," the first woman to become President of this country of 2.8 million people.
"The triumph of Senora Mireya is a triumph for the Panamanian woman," Dominador Kaiser Bazan, one of two Vice-Presidential candidates on the winning ticket of her Arnulfista Party, said at an impromptu victory rally on Sunday night. 
 Ms. Moscoso, 52, became one of the few female Presidents in Latin America in what many Panamanians regard as the most important election in their country's short history. Her administration will oversee the transfer of the Panama Canal from United States to Panamanian control this year under treaties signed in 1977. She will also preside over the withdrawal of American troops for the first time since Panama was carved out of Colombia in 1903 in a move engineered by the Americans to build the canal.
Ms. Moscoso said last week that her goal for the canal was to insure that "users feel that it is as well taken care of as when it was with the United States." But throughout her campaign, Ms. Moscoso said her first priority would be to work on poverty, which affects more than a third of the population, and the 12 percent unemployment rate. She also wants to slow changes like privatizing state utilities and has promised to end corruption and nepotism.
"I won't forget my roots or my commitment to fight unemployment, poverty and its consequences," she said on Sunday night, after winning with 44 percent of the vote. "I want for this country what I want for my son Ricardo, that he have the right to grow up in a democratic country, with guaranteed freedoms, with judicial stability and with social justice."
Ms. Moscoso was born on July 1, 1946, in Panama City to a rural family of six children that sank into poverty with the death of her father, a schoolteacher, when she was 10. She was 17 and working as a secretary after graduating from high school when she met Dr. Arias, at a friend's birthday party in the early 60's. Dr. Arias, 62, a widower, was a physician who had been President twice, ousted both times by political opponents.
Ms. Moscoso worked in his campaigns and in the coffee business that she has managed since Dr. Arias's death in 1988. In 1968, after Dr. Arias had been removed from the presidency the third time, in a military coup, she joined him in exile in the United States, where she married him the next year and remained until he died in Miami.
A later marriage ended in divorce after five years. She has a 7-year-old adopted son.
Ms. Moscoso said she had initially rebuffed requests to continue Dr. Arias's work. But in 1990 she coordinated the creation of the Arnulfista Party to replace her husband's old party. In 1991 she took over as party president.
By 1994, when she ran for president, coming in second, Ms. Moscoso was the main opposition leader. She took on the Revolutionary Democratic Party, which had ruled Panama with a succession of military Governments and yielded power to the Arnulfistas only from 1990 to 1994.
Some Panamanians have cited her lack of a college degree -- she studied interior design at Miami-Dade Community College -- and a possibility that she might be easily manipulated as major drawbacks. And not everyone remembers Dr. Arias with fondness. Although he created a social security system, strengthened labor laws and let women vote, his views included a curious mix of fascism, racism, mysticism and nationalism.
In her campaign, in which she defeated two other candidates, including a son of Gen. Omar Torrijos, who ruled after the coup in 1968, Ms. Moscoso said, "My biggest university was that of Dr. Arias."
She called sexism an even bigger obstacle to her political career.
"Although they say Mireya doesn't have the capacity," she shouted at the final rally, "although they say that because she is a woman she can't be president, I tell you here, I can wear pants just like the men in this country! And I know when to put on skirts and when to put on pants, too!"
Panamanians look to her to exploit fairly the the canal property, worth an estimated $4 billion. She will have to contend with a 72-seat legislature dominated by the opposition.
"She comes from way below," Ronald Luque, 25, a waiter who went to one of her rallies, said. "The hope is that someone who came from below will help more."

HEADLINE: An Uneasy Coexistence;
Tensions Between Town and Shelter Flow Both Ways

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: CHESTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
The 13 homeless men stood apart from one another in the parking lot of the Chester Mall, afraid, one said later, of drawing hostile attention. So they tried to blend in, clutching their purchases of crackers, soda and instant soup, and anxiously scanning the horizon for the van back to Camp La Guardia, a 365-acre outpost of the New York City shelter system in Orange County.
But such men do not escape the notice of local people like Glenn Karch, of the nearby town of Warwick, who stopped at the mall to buy wine on a gray April Friday. 
 "There's like a lot of lowlifes walking the road when you come off the exit," he complained. "We moved here to get away from people like them."
Men from camp also have reasons to try to keep their distance, Mr. Karch, 44, a manager at a trucking company, acknowledged. He confirmed a complaint that local drivers sometimes swerve at homeless men hiking the three miles between the mall and camp along a shoulderless highway.
"My older daughter's friends, I've heard them talking," he said. "It's a game they play, like smash the mailboxes -- you know, bored country kids."
Tensions between camp and community gained new attention in April when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spoke at a Republican fund-raising dinner in Orange County and was confronted with complaints about the 1,031-bed shelter. Local officials said that men from camp frightened residents with offensive behavior and petty crime, and that some were wanted for arrest on serious offenses elsewhere.
But a closer look at the relationship between residents of the town, about 70 miles northwest of Manhattan, and the camp reveals that the fear and resentment flow both ways.
"This is a clash of cultures," said Gary Abramson, chief attorney for Legal Aid of Orange County. "You're talking about the victims of New York City's housing difficulties, mostly minority men, coming to a community of people who in many cases came to Chester to escape."
Susan McCabe, a local resident, voiced common community concerns when she told Mr. Giuliani during his visit that police sweeps to get the homeless off New York City's streets and subways were turning the camp into a dumping ground for criminals and polluting the quality of life upstate.
A county lawsuit making similar charges against the city is set for trial in June, and Mr. Giuliani -- who will need local votes if he runs for the United States Senate -- promised a crackdown.
But though the community has been subjected to some distasteful or disturbing incidents -- like the time Ms. McCabe says she caught a homeless man masturbating at the end of her driveway -- the police could recall no serious crime against a local resident by a La Guardia man.
Michael W. Farrell, who has been Police Chief in Chester for 18 years, said the sole local murder in recent years was by a prominent lawyer who shot his business partner, and the armed robbery of a gas station was also by a local fellow.
And while two shelter residents were arrested at the time Mayor Giuliani was speaking to the Orange County Republicans, Mr. Farrell said, the charge was shoplifting three packs of cigarettes.
The camp residents, however, have some factual basis to fear harm living in Chester, the police said, particularly in their need to walk to town when the shelter's 13-seat van is full. Two weeks before Mr. Giuliani's visit, a 47-year-old homeless man from camp named Boris Ivanov was run over and killed by accident as he tried to cross the highway.
And while the police recalled that at least two other camp residents died in similar circumstances in recent years, officials here denied a request by the Coalition for the Homeless to install street lights.
The relationship between shelter and town was not always so antagonistic. During the Depression, the camp was hailed for taking demoralized men and turning them into farm workers running their own enterprise for pay. Later, after wartime prosperity shrank the numbers of able-bodied homeless men and the camp became a more custodial refuge for elderly alcoholics, the community barely noticed it.
But in the 1980's, thousands of middle-class families moved from the New York City area to semirural Orange County, propelled by a growing gap between housing costs and income, deteriorating city neighborhoods and expensive suburbs. Their arrival paralleled a new wave of homelessness that engulfed city shelters by 1981, bringing to the camp younger men and more drug abusers.
For a time, the camp continued keeping a low profile by confining the men largely to the grounds. But by 1990, the city acknowledged that legally the men were free to come and go.
Some episodes that followed have had long-lasting resonance, like the "dial a drug" ring, in which local residents called orders into pay phones at the camp and had crack cocaine delivered by shelter residents on bicycles. The camp now bans bikes.
Another case involved a homeless man who allegedly strangled a family's pet rabbit in 1994. Legal Aid maintained that the rabbit was wild, and that the man killed it for food.
The men waiting for the van on this day did not fit the frightening public images. One, florid-faced with silver hair and blue eyes, said he lost his job as a doorman at a theater in Times Square that was shut down as part of the cleanup of the area. Before entering the shelter system, he said, "I was living on the street in Flushing, under a bridge."
When the van finally arrived, it brought a man who identified himself only as Ramon, 42, heading to his part-time job at the Ames store in the mall.
For six years, he said, he worked at a Pergament Home Center in Queens and lived with a cousin, but he lost both job and home because of worsening epileptic seizures.
"They say, 'Why you don't look for disability?' " he recalled, his speech slurred by a cleft palate, his right hand crippled. "No," he answered himself. "I'm still strong. I can work."
City policy holds that the homeless elderly and disabled should be moved to permanent housing, not kept in shelters, especially ones far from their medical care. But older men, seen as more benign, are the kind of shelter residents the community wants to keep, said Nancy Calhoun, a Republican Assemblywoman who has been active in local politics since 1982.
"Raising the age to 55 would do wonders," she said as she drove to the camp, hoping to give a tour to a reporter. Earlier, Ms. Calhoun had called La Guardia "the Cadillac of homeless shelters."
But Patrick Markee, a social policy analyst for the Coalition for the Homeless, disagreed. "Maybe a rusted-out 1972 Cadillac," he said, pointing to state inspection reports that repeatedly found conditions wanting.
Verifying either description proved impossible. At the camp's guardhouse, the Assemblywoman was told she could only circle the grounds on the public road until the visit was approved by the Giuliani administration, which denied the reporter's previous requests for a visit and refused permission this time, too.
On the highway, under a chill spring rain, a few homeless men were walking back to camp from a day's manual labor. Some had fortified themselves at the mall liquor store, which sells cheap pint-sized vodka its clerks call "the campee special," and 99-cent miniature bottles of brandy.
"They talk all this mess about us, but they have no trouble taking our money," said Warren Thompson, 46, a camp resident and member of its advisory council.
Local residents looking for casual labor hire "campees" for as little as $4 an hour, Mr. Thompson said. Some do demolition, work in the slaughterhouse of a nearby Hasidic community, or in the kitchens of summer camps.
Inside La Guardia, some work as orderlies in the infirmary for a stipend that amounts to 62 cents an hour. This work is considered training, and many, including Mr. Thompson, are happy to supplement a public assistance check of $22.50 every two weeks, although they point out that city employees at the camp make $11 an hour for the same work.
These days, many city employees at the camp fear losing their jobs because the city plans to privatize the camp's operation. It is in the midst of negotiating a contract with Volunteers of America, one of the nonprofit groups that now run most city shelters.
A city analysis prepared in 1995 for those interested in taking over the camp showed the population to be similar to that in the overall shelter system, though somewhat older. Of 1,552 men who passed through the camp between October 1994 and the end of March 1995, more than 534 stayed all winter, many of them sick, disabled or frail.
About a quarter reported a history of alcohol abuse, a third reported using drugs in the past, and 7 percent reported recent use. While 2 percent were on probation or parole, more than 70 percent had never had legal problems.
"My sense of the camp is that it's a lot of really down-and-out men who are not criminals, who are just really at the bottom of our economy," said Mr. Abramson of Legal Aid of Orange County.
Not all local residents condemn the camp residents. "I haven't personally had any problems, so it's hard to get on the bandwagon," said Laura Mosher, 35, of nearby Whispering Hills. "There's a level of uncomfortability because a lot of these men are a different race. It's easy to stereotype; it's hard to form a personal bond."
Over a hamburger at the local McDonald's, Mr. Thompson explained how easily homeless men can get into legal trouble.
Alcohol is forbidden in camp, so if a homeless man buys a beer in a store, he said, he risks arrest for drinking in public. Should he go into the woods to relieve himself on the long walk back, he will court community disgust, and possibly charges of trespass or indecent exposure.
A few years ago, a homeless man was even arrested in Chester under an open-container law for drinking a Sprite; he sued and won a $30,000 settlement after showing that the law was enforced only against camp residents.
Worse than arrest, however, is fear of being transferred, Mr. Thompson said, shuddering at the recollection of a Brooklyn armory shelter where another homeless man was murdered for $20 last fall.
Back on the highway, about 5 P.M., a police car let out three camp residents who had been escorted out of Chester. One, a 50-year-old African-American man in a faded N.Y.U. sweatshirt, was at a loss to explain what had happened.
"Somebody in town complained that we were laughing and making a lot of noise," he said, shaking his head. "I'm new here. I'm not saying they're not used to seeing minority people, but I guess they're not used to seeing minority people in a group."
Slowly, he added: "These people got to understand, this is not their world. We've all got to live here."

CERIDIAN AGREES TO BUY ABR INFORMATION SERVICES

BYLINE: Bridge News 

 BODY:
The Ceridian Corporation, an information services provider, said yesterday that it would acquire ABR Information Services Inc. for $25.50 a share in cash, or about $750 million. ABR, based in Palm Harbor, Fla., provides benefits administration, payroll and human resource services. The Minneapolis-based Ceridian said the deal would slightly dilute earnings in 1999 and 2000 but was expected to increase the growth rate of Ceridian's human resources business. ABR projects revenues of around $120 million for its current fiscal year and employs some 1,500 people. Its shares soared 43 percent, or $7.50, to $25, while Ceridian slipped 50 cents, to $36.125.

Cuba Game Could Open Some Doors

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
THE orange and black banners were hanging downtown, giving a festive feel to a soggy day.
Baltimore Welcomes Cuba. 
 This was not New York or Cleveland coming in for a big game. This was the national team of Cuba. Salsa music danced out of the loudspeakers, turning the arcade and the old brick factory behind right field into a Latin plaza.
When they hang out the bunting for the World Series, they don't mention the opponent. It's just generic decoration. This was different. This was one of the grand old baseball cities -- Wee Willie, The Babe, Earl, Frank and Brooks -- playing host to a baseball nation.
It's a good thing they don't have automatic relegation in baseball, the way they do in world soccer leagues, because the inept Orioles would be good candidates for demotion after last night's embarrassment, a 12-6 Cuba victory that more than made up for the taut 3-2 Orioles victory on March 28.
"I believe we all will win," said Omar Linares, the superb Cuban third baseman.
But who really wins from this strange little sequence? You could almost hear the baseball scouts salivating over the talent that Cuba saw fit to load onto the plane. They would love to pick off a few, to slip a few business cards into a few willing palms, but what does that prove? Is there some bigger picture here?
Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
Cuban-Americans with memories of their homeland may fear that a baseball relationship will only strengthen Fidel Castro. It is easy to say that a mere game or two cannot balance out four decades of political repression in Cuba, economic sanctions that the United States has imposed on Cuba, mutual bad blood.
But there they were, big-timers with more than a bit of swagger, in glittering blue jackets, white pants and bright red caps, a trifle more solemn than visitors for a World Series.
At times, it sounded just like any other big sporting event, with American sportswriters asking Alfonso Urquiola, the roly-poly Cuban manager, why he had omitted this player or that player from the road squad.
Just the words "Los Hermanos Hernandez" -- "the Hernandez Brothers" -- conjures up the specter of defection, but Urquiola sounded like every other touchy manager when he said, "I thought I already explained that." Still, it was more than a game, it was a gesture.
Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
There is something to be said for gestures -- the nod, the smile, the word, the phrase that just might lead to something better. There is something to be said for gestures like Preacher Jackson going into Serbia and bringing back three captured American soldiers, making sure they are safe at home, and then letting the politicians argue about who is using whom.
What is the endgame for this little home-and-home gesture? Why would Fidel Castro even permit the American professionals to play his state-supported amateurs? What could be worth the intense security, the fears of defection, even the possibility of ignominious defeat? What's in it for Fidel?
Here they were, the cream of the international circuit, big-timers who play teams from Japan, Mexico, the Dominican Republic. This summer they will go to the Pan-American Games. These guys get around.
Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
If they were flabbergasted by the amenities of a chain hotel alongside the glitzy renovated harbor, they were not about to let on. Did they glance at the varieties and the prices of a room-service menu? On the other hand, did they catch a glimpse of America's poverty outside their bus window? They were not saying, but they did not shy away from the impulses of their baseball hearts.
"There are changes taking place," said Luis Ulacia, an outfielder with a firm jaw and an appraising glance. "We do not rule out that Cuban players will play professionally some day.
"We wish not to be forced to defect," he said, talking about joining the major leagues some day. "It would be a beautiful experience."
Asked if he would play for free, just to prove himself, Ulacia brought up the American sanctions: "Because of the blockade, I believe it would be difficult. If they gave us the opportunity to play, I believe the Treasury Department would not let us get paid."
Ulacia was making propaganda. There is plenty of that between the countries. What is needed is the next step -- a series in November, maybe, or a few Cuban players allowed to earn salaries in the majors. There is something to be said for gestures.
Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.

HEADLINE: List of Final Witnesses Released in Microsoft Trial

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation and the Government both released the names today of the final witnesses each intends to call when the antitrust trial resumes later this month. The list indicates that the Government hopes to shore up its case, while Microsoft's goal, at least in part, is to change the subject of discussion to one that might make the Government's case seem irrelevant.
The most surprising announcement came from Microsoft. The company is summoning David Colburn -- a senior executive for America Online and an important Government witness earlier in the trial -- to testify as a hostile witness in the final, rebuttal stage of testimony. 
 Mr. Colburn will be questioned about "the completeness and candor of prior testimony," Microsoft said, and as part of the company's effort to argue that America Online's purchase of the Netscape Communications Corporation undermines the Government's case.
"Our rebuttal witnesses will show that the $10 billion merger of AOL and Netscape completely undercuts the Government's case" by showing that "competition and innovation are stronger than ever in the software industry," said William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs.
Microsoft will also call Gordon Eubanks, the former chairman of the Symantec Corporation, maker of the Norton Utilities programs for Windows, and Richard Schmalensee, an economist and dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. Mr. Schmalensee was Microsoft's economic witness earlier in the trial.
The Justice Department is also recalling its chief economic witness, Franklin M. Fisher, another M.I.T. economist. It will also recall Edward Felten, the Princeton University computer scientist who served as a Government witness earlier in the trial, and Gary Norris, an International Business Machines Corporation executive who was for several years director of I.B.M.'s software strategy division.
Government officials said they were confident of their case and hoped their rebuttal witnesses would shore up areas of weakness exposed during the earlier part of the trial.
One witness, Mr. Felten, is being called in part to rebut any technical statements Microsoft might make that Government lawyers find questionable. He and his staff found several of the technical flaws in Microsoft's demonstration tapes played in court earlier.
The overarching goal, Government officials said, is to keep the strong legal advantage they believe they have already gained.
A senior I.B.M. executive, John Soyring, has already testified for the Government, and there is some overlap between the areas he discussed and the ones Justice Department lawyers intend to raise with Mr. Norris. But they also intend to question him about Microsoft's efforts to stop I.B.M. from offering software on its computers made by Microsoft's competitors, according to a filing with the court.
With its witnesses, Microsoft wants to open up new areas of evidence. A filing with the court shows that the company wants to use Mr. Colburn to help make the case that Netscape, America Online and the Government plotted, in effect, to hide for two months the developing deal between Netscape and America Online because they were afraid news of it would hurt the Government's case.
A Justice Department official called that "a desperate attempt to distract attention from Microsoft's illegal behavior.
"Nothing about the transaction has any relevance to the case," the official added, "and nothing about it will break Microsft's stranglehold on the operating system market."
Mr. Eubanks, now the head of Oblix, a business-directory software manufacturer, led Symantec during the years when the company sold utilities that Microsoft later incorporated into the Windows operating system. But Microsoft wants to show that Symantec then came up with new ideas, like antivirus software, to replace the lost business and continued to prosper.
Microsoft describes Mr. Eubanks as a friend and competitor. In a filing with the court today, Microsoft said Mr. Eubanks would testify about "the rapid pace of change in the software business, and the inability of anyone to predict the directions in which computer and communication technology would evolve over the last 10 years," and "the expansion of the concept of an operating system through the addition of new features and functions."
In a recent interview, Mr. Eubanks said, "Microsoft has done some bad things," but added that the company and its chairman, William H. Gates 3d, had been victims of the American tendency to tear down those who are too successful.
Both Mr. Fisher and Mr. Schmalensee will have to repair damage they did to Government and Microsoft cases during earlier cross-examination.
Mr. Fisher said he did not think Microsoft's behavior had harmed consumers, a statement he later tried to modify. And Mr. Schmalensee was shown to have offered opinions in previous years that were opposite the ones he was espousing in court, leading Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to question his credibility.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the lists of witnesses in the Microsoft antitrust trial referred incorrectly to comments by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson about the earlier testimony of a witness, Richard Schmalensee of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The judge questioned an apparent contradiction in Mr. Schmalensee's testimony; he did not question his overall credibility.

8 European Stock Exchanges Form Alliance

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 4

 BODY:
Edging closer to the vision of a unified European stock market, eight stock exchanges agreed today to develop a common trading system for stocks in Europe's biggest companies.
The eight exchanges are those of Frankfurt, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Madrid, Zurich and Milan, Italy.
The agreement is a step toward eliminating the inefficiency of Europe's stock exchanges, which play a much smaller role in the overall economy than their counterparts in the United States. 
 But despite the allure of creating one big market and taking advantage of Europe's single currency, the euro, the exchanges are still divided by rivalries and are feuding over the kind of system to develop.
Indeed, today's agreement was an attempt to soothe the anger of France and several other countries, which were shocked last July when the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges -- the largest and second-largest in Europe by market capitalization -- announced their plan for a joint-trading system and merely "invited" others to join.
The move was particularly galling to executives at the Paris Bourse, the third-biggest exchange in Europe, who did not learn about the Frankfurt-London deal until it was publicly announced. It was also troubling that Frankfurt was teaming up with an exchange outside the 11 nations that use the euro.
Since then, the smaller exchanges have vacillated between the anxiety of being left out and the fear of being swallowed up. Today's agreement was the most concrete step toward reconciliation, but those involved offered no clues about the exchange's structure, trading hours, common rules, preferred stock index benchmark or timetable, all key issues that must be resolved.
In a brief signing ceremony in Madrid, the eight exchanges "underlined their commitment" to bring their rules into agreement and eventually develop a single electronic-trading system for stocks of Europe's largest companies.
"We are facing a complex project, but it is possible and necessary," said Antonio Zoido, chairman of the Madrid exchange.
The pact is essentially an endorsement of common goals, and it is limited to trading in a fairly small universe of Europe's biggest companies. It does not include Europe's fast-growing "new markets," the exchanges, affiliated with the older ones, that were created primarily for newer technology companies.
Meanwhile, the French, Swiss and Italian stock exchanges said they were continuing with plans for a "virtual market" that would probably compete with the Frankfurt-London alliance.

Bean Paste vs. Miniskirts: Generation Gap Grows

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: HANOK, South Korea

 BODY:
A blast of steam caught Park Ki Soon in the face as she peered into the caldron of beans and began stirring, feeling ever more sorry for herself.
"When I was young I did what my mother-in-law said," Mrs. Park, 70, said morosely as she used a wooden paddle to churn the beans. "But now my daughter-in-law doesn't listen to me. 
 "So now I'm making this bean paste, and I'm feeling miserable because I'm an old woman and she's using me. I don't know why she doesn't make bean paste herself. I think she just wants to be comfortable. She never likes hard work."
The small group of women clustered around Mrs. Park, here in the village of Hanok about 30 miles northwest of Seoul, nodded their heads in agreement. Young Koreans, they concluded, are incomprehensible and insufferable.
"When I go to the cities, I look at young people, the way they dress, the way they behave, and they aren't Korean," said Choi Sam Soon, 55, who was also making bean paste. "Young people always carry credit cards, and they get money from machines! They always spend money so recklessly."
"And young people abandon things that are still usable," Mrs. Choi added, shaking her head at the idea. "Some people throw out old kettles, so I pick them up and take them home and use them."
The problem, of course, is that young people are not thrilled about having their mothers or mothers-in-law rifling through other people's garbage to rescue battered old kettles. And such skirmishes are only one facet of a generation gap that many South Koreans say is greater than almost anywhere in the world.
Korea was one of the last places to open up to Western influences, for until a century ago it was an ancient kingdom that operated on Confucian traditions and deeply regimented customs. Those customs -- especially respect for the elderly -- permeated Korean society until the last few decades.
Since the 1960's, South Korea has been one of the fastest-changing societies in the world. The economy grew at a blistering pace, the country industrialized and urbanized, a middle class emerged, and these days respect tends to go to those with money and E-mail accounts, not to the old men and women who make great bean paste.
"Generation gaps exist everywhere, but the gap is wider here, because Western culture is pouring in at an amazing speed," said Annette E. Y. Ahn, 28, a Seoul interpreter who grew up partly in the United States and Europe. "I also think it's wider here because looking back in history, we were the last country to open up to Western culture, and now the doors are open and it's pouring in."
These gaps seem to cause misunderstandings and sadness, but fewer open explosions than one might expect. Young and old alike may stew inside at the foolishness of the other, but they also describe how they go out of their way to accommodate.
"It's a constant bother to live with the old folks," said Chong Kum Sook, 38, who lives in the same house as her husband's parents. "It's very hard. It's not that they complain, but I feel the burden on myself.
"My in-laws are early risers, so I try to get up when they do. And in the summer I can't wear skimpy clothes, because I have to dress cautiously so as not to disturb them. I should be careful not to make them unhappy."
Korean women were traditionally expected to dress very primly, and indeed a young woman was arrested for indecency just four years ago when she wore a T-shirt that exposed her navel.
"When I see girls exposing themselves in short dresses, I'm shocked," said Koh Kap In, a 79-year-old matriarch who was sitting outside her house. "But I've never said a word to my granddaughters. It's the times. All the young women are in those clothes."
Most elderly Koreans say that they are often shocked privately at the laziness or immorality or extravagance of young people, but that mostly they bite their tongues.
"If I complain, would they listen?" asked Kim Hae Song, 78, a stooped woman who was outside weeding her garden. "No. That would only put them on bad terms with me. In my heart I feel upset at what goes on, but I don't say anything."
Mrs. Kim and her husband, Kwon Sang Mook, 81, are most offended at the disappearance of traditional etiquette, which young people often breach without even realizing it.
"I see young people smoking in front of their elders," Mr. Kwon said, shaking his head. "Young people say they are so smart, but what is the point of knowledge if you don't know how to behave?"
The elderly often seem particularly poignant because, mixed in with the outrage at the way their grandchildren or daughters-in-law behave there is also often pride at their education and worldliness.
Sitting in her kitchen, Lee Hee Ja, 58, a housewife, served coffee and a 40-minute denunciation of young people. She fretted that her eldest daughter-in-law will not carry on the family rituals, that her second daughter-in-law has not minded her advice to dress modestly, that neither can cook properly and that none of the young people are attentive enough to her own needs. But then Mrs. Lee paused, smiled and sighed.
"Maybe I'm wrong," she said. "Young people now are very bright. So smart! So I don't know. Maybe in the end my daughters-in-law will be better than I was."

A Co-Finalist For Trade Post May Be Out

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 4

 BODY:
The diplomatic struggle over who should be the next head of the World Trade Organization continued unabated today while most work at the global trade forum seemed to grind to a halt.
After putting off deliberations for a day, the chairman of the search team jolted delegates at a meeting today by declaring that the candidacy of Suphachai Panichpakdi of Thailand was over and that the group should consider only his rival, Michael Moore of New Zealand. 
 The announcement by Ali Mchumo, Tanzania's trade delegate, set forth vigorous protests from Mr. Suphachai's supporters, led by Asian countries, as the meeting stretched late into the evening with no final decision. Delegates will meet again, after taking "time for reflection."
In an interview today, Mr. Suphachai declared that he was "confident of the outcome" but criticized the selection process as taking too long. "I won't say that I feel cheated, but a number of countries seem to feel the whole process was not consistent," he said. In Thailand, where Mr. Suphachai is a Deputy Prime Minister, there has been an outcry against the United States, which was seen as the chief obstacle to his winning the international post.
After six months of reviewing four initial candidates, the field was winnowed to the two recent candidates. Mr. Mchumo, who heads the trade organization's decision-making General Council, announced on Friday that Mr. Moore had edged out Mr. Suphachai, by 62 votes to 59, among the members and should be nominated as the new Director General.
Meetings over the weekend, some vitriolic, among envoys of the 134-nation trade forum, failed to come up with a choice or even agree on a method of proceeding.
Mr. Mchumo urged the delegates to wrap up the selection or, he said, "we shall see the intensification of the already unhealthy divisiveness, recrimination, mistrust and erosion of friendships which has already taken its toll."
However, when he declared that the process was over for Mr. Suphachai, representatives of two dozen countries took to the floor to disagree and to argue that the race was too close to count him out. Kenya's envoy proposed that Mr. Mchumo sound out delegates on Mr. Suphachai's acceptability as the new W.T.O. chief, and Mr. Mchumo eventually agreed to consider it.
There is still the option of a vote to decide between the two candidates, although many countries oppose this as contrary to the four-year-old organization's way of doing business by consensus.
If the deadlock continues, diplomats increasingly were entertaining the possibility of jettisoning both candidates and starting over.
Soon after the meeting got under way, Renato Ruggiero, the outgoing Director General, whose selection four years ago had been marked by bitterness, officially left his post and drove off, foreclosing the option that he might stay on to tide the trade group over until it resolved its leadership crisis.

HEADLINE: Harry L. Kavetas, 61, Kodak's Finance Chief

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Harry L. Kavetas, the chief financial officer who helped lead the Eastman Kodak Company through a huge financial upheaval that involved sweeping job cuts over the last few years, died yesterday at his home in Rochester. He was 61.
The cause was an apparent heart attack, the company said. 
 Although he had been with Kodak only since 1994, Mr. Kavetas was credited with helping to engineer the strategies that helped the company dig out from under a huge debt load and stem a precipitous drop in its share of the American film market. As part of the management team of George M. C. Fisher, Kodak's chief executive, Mr. Kavetas helped the company capitalize on the growth of digital photography. He was also deeply involved in Kodak's wrenching decision, announced in 1997, to cut 19,000 jobs.
"It's terrible to lose someone of Harry's quality at a time when the company has so many balls in the air," said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst who follows Kodak for Prudential Securities Research.
On joining Kodak, Mr. Kavetas began finding ways to pay down more than $5 billion in debt from Kodak's 1988 purchase of Sterling Drug.
He helped spearhead Kodak's decision to divest itself of huge chunks of its health business and, just this year, to sell its copier business. He was also very involved in the decision, announced in 1997, to pare as many as 19,000 jobs -- a decision that would be painful for any company but that was excruciating for Kodak, which had run so paternalistic an organization that its nickname in its home town, Rochester, was "Great Yellow Father."
Mr. Kavetas, a native of Springfield, Ill., had a bachelor's degree in finance and economics from the University of Illinois.
Before joining Kodak, he spent 32 years with the International Business Machines Corporation, rising steadily up the ranks. When he took early retirement from there in December 1993, he was chief executive of the I.B.M. Credit Corporation. Kodak hired him two months later.
Mr. Kavetas was elected a Kodak executive vice president in September 1994, just seven months after joining the company. In May 1997 he was elected to Kodak's board.
Mr. Kavetas is survived by his wife, Sue; two daughters, Betsy Kavetas and Kathy Rothchild; a son, James, and three grandchildren.

Drivers face a summer of rising gasoline prices
as the nation's refineries run at top capacity.

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
WITH the summer driving season approaching, the price of gasoline across the country has jumped sharply from historically low levels as major oil producing countries cut supplies of crude oil.
The supply of crude remains the most crucial factor affecting gasoline, but many experts warn that a shortage of another kind may push prices at the pump higher in the months ahead: tight supplies of refined gasoline in the United States. 
 Demand for gasoline has been increasing steadily, spurred by the economic boom of the 1990's, by the growing popularity of big sport utility vehicles that have relatively poor gas efficiency -- and by the low price of fuel. In February, at 87.8 cents a gallon for regular nationwide, gas was as low, on an inflation-adjusted basis, as it had been since the 1920's.
Even with price rises since then -- almost 29 percent, to an average of $1.13 a gallon nationwide -- energy prices remain relatively modest in most parts of the country.
Predicting oil and gas prices is an inexact science at best. During the summer, the Energy Department says, the likelihood is that gasoline will range from $1.08 to $1.18 a gallon, 9 to 10 cents higher than the unusually low prices seen last summer. Since the average motorist drives 15,000 miles a year and gets 21 miles a gallon, and would spend $821 a year on gas at $1.15 a gallon, according to AAA, such prices would not pose a huge financial burden.
But two factors may drive prices higher. The first, the supply of crude oil, has received most attention. Two announced cutbacks in production by a coalition composed of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC members like Norway, Mexico, Russia and Oman have driven prices up from a low of $10.35 a barrel in December to $18.92 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil prices have risen in anticipation of actual production cuts. If the cutbacks do not stick, the price of oil, and of gasoline at the pump, could decline again.
But it is the declining capacity of refineries to process crude oil and convert it into gas and other products that has recently come under scrutiny on the West Coast, and is likely to become more of an issue across the country, many analysts say.
From 18 million barrels of crude oil a day in 1981, refining capacity across the country declined sharply during the next 15 years as the industry underwent a period of low profit margins, consolidation and investment in equipment to meet more stringent environmental regulations. Capacity began to rise modestly four years ago. Still, it now stands at only 16 million barrels a day and demand is growing faster than supply.
For the last three years, refineries have been running at top production levels. "Refiners have to work full blast just to keep up with demand," said Fred Leuffer, an analyst for Bear, Stearns. "There is no more room for error."
Shortfalls are being made up by imports of gasoline, which are more expensive and have been less reliable than domestically refined fuel.
Under these circumstances, when production at refineries is disrupted, as occurred recently in California, spikes in gasoline prices are likely to follow. In a case now under investigation by the California State Attorney General's office, prices jumped by more than 40 percent after two fires shut refineries there.
Meanwhile, over the next several years, new regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency to greatly lessen the amount of sulfur in gasoline would require considerable investment by refineries just to make existing quantities of gasoline environmentally acceptable. Under new rules proposed by President Clinton on Saturday the agency would require the industry to produce gasoline with no more than 30 parts per million of sulfur, about a 91 percent reduction.
All these factors are likely to put pressure on prices at the pump nationwide.
"People will still get what they want to buy," said Larry Goldstein, with the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a research group for the industry in Manhattan. "There will just be times when they will have to pay more for gasoline."
No one is predicting a return to the gas lines of 1973 and 1979, which were the result of big cuts in the supply of oil by OPEC. Barring unforeseen disasters, oil supplies are generally believed to be too abundant and diversified to allow critical shortages that might require rationing or long lines at gas stations.
"It's worth raising the concern," said Jeff A. Dietert, an analyst who covers refining for Simmons & Company International of Houston. "But I don't think that the world is about to come to an end."
More likely are occasional price spikes, most analysts say. In California, the refinery fires cut production by about 15 percent. Prices for regular unleaded gasoline in the state jumped from an average of $1.11 a gallon in February to nearly $1.60 in March before starting to recede in recent weeks to the current level of $1.47 a gallon. Shipments from the Gulf Coast and from as far as Korea eventually helped to ease the state's shortage.
Last Friday, some California municipalities and consumer groups urged drivers not to buy gasoline in protest.
John Gioia, a member of the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors, which supported the boycott, said that while the effort had little economic impact it was a "symbolic statement of concern over the action of the oil companies."
California's geography and its stringent environmental regulations have made the state's gas more expensive than in the rest of the nation. Even if gasoline could be shipped from the East Coast to the West economically, it would not meet California's regulatory standards.
But across the country, demand for gasoline grew at a pace of about 3 percent last year, with another 2 percent expected this year. Refineries nationwide are expected to be hard pressed to meet demand.
"They're going to have to run harder and harder because demand is outstripping supply growth, " said Mr. Leuffer of the Bear, Stearns.
In the long run, Mr. Leuffer said, refiners and retailers will be able to impose higher prices for gasoline.
While the current tightness in refining capacity may impose burdens on motorists, it represents a welcome change for the industry. Overcapacity led to years of shrinking profits, and inefficient refineries were abandoned. From 300 refineries in the early 1980's, there are only about 160 refineries.
Last year's collapse of the price of crude oil, which cut profits of oil companies and independent refiners alike, led to belt tightening and low capital spending. For most companies, the profit decline continued into the first quarter of this year and capital spending remained low. Most companies say they are waiting to see if the crude oil price remains at current levels.
Refining capacity is due to grow at a little more than 1 percent this year and probably not much more in the next few years, industry analysts say. This compares with an increase of 2.6 percent last year and an average of 2.2 percent in the last five years.
"With capacity going up 1.8 percent and demand growing at more than 2 percent you are going to get higher prices over time," said Michael Mayer, an analyst with Schroder & Company.
Still, there is a check on the industry. Often when prices in the United States climb, refiners in Europe and Latin America, who still have extra capacity, begin to ship extra supplies. In the first quarter of this year, for example, imports of gasoline were up sharply, rising 7 percent over last year and accounting for 5.3 percent of total supply. For all of last year, imports amounted to just 3.6 percent of supply.
But the gasoline shipped here is more expensive. Transportation costs add about 3 to 4 cents a gallon. Overseas refiners tend to hold off, waiting to see whether United States shortages, and price increases here, stick. That uncertainty often causes spot prices for gasoline in the United States to run up even more in futures markets. If sustained, those increases eventually get passed on to the motorist.
"The movement across the Atlantic is fairly expensive to justify shipping a lot of gasoline," said Eric Leon, the London-based general manager for the chemical and petroleum industry for I.B.M., and a close observer of European refining.
In August 1997, the price of gasoline in the United States jumped about 10 cents a gallon when strong demand combined with problems at several American refineries. The price surge, which was ultimately alleviated by European imports, came even though crude oil prices were dropping.
Such short surges in prices, however, are not expected to cause oil companies and independent refiners to ease their purse strings.
"Brief peaks in prices will not get a lot of investment going," said John Cook, the director of the petroleum division of the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.
The challenge is to meet new environmental standards while maintaining adequate gasoline supplies, he said. He expects that imports of gasoline are likely to play a larger role in the future.
"There is concern about making the transition," Mr. Cook added. "How do you get from here to there without disrupting the marketplace?"

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Investor Shift Is Suggested As Prices Drop For Treasuries

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Bond prices dropped sharply yesterday, pushing long-term interest rates to their highest level in nine months.
There was no significant economic news to prompt the selling, said traders and analysts, who instead cited a shift in view among bond investors. 
 The selling has pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up almost a quarter of a percentage point in just three trading days.
In late trading in the Treasury market yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond dropped 25/32 to 93 15/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 5.71 percent, from 5.65 percent on Monday.
Increasingly, investors are losing the conviction that the United States economy will slow this year, with inflation remaining in check; instead, a growing number worry that a rebound in the rest of the world will keep growth strong here and -- combined with a rise in the prices of oil and other commodities -- will nudge inflation higher.
The jump in prices should not be large -- from the 1.6 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index in 1998 to an expected rise this year of 2 percent or more. But investors appear to fear that this acceleration may still be enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to slow economic growth.
"Investors are becoming increasingly aware that the global economy is improving and that the prospect for low inflation is less, while the prospect for higher inflation has increased," said Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
This outlook on inflation and growth, he added, means that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates by the first quarter of next year, if not sooner.
Higher interest rates, and the fear of inflation that would cause them, are a threat to the stock market, which retreated yesterday after the Dow Jones industrial average topped 11,000 points for the first time on Monday. Yesterday, the Dow dropped 128.58 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,886.11.
So far this year, equity investors have ignored the rise in rates, which has seen the 30-year bond yield shoot up from a low of 5.05 percent in January. But at the current level, according to the valuation model used by Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the stock market is overvalued by 30 percent.
In a sign of concern about an impending rise in the Federal funds rate, the central bank's interest rate target, the yield on the Fed funds futures contract for December has jumped to 5 percent since Thursday. The Fed funds target is now 4.75 percent.
Thomas Connor, the head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities, said a Morgan survey showed that money managers, who had been betting on an economic slowdown here and a bond rally, were changing their view.
Just two weeks ago, he said, 89 percent of the money managers surveyed were at or ahead of their performance benchmarks in terms of their bet on bonds -- meaning many were expecting a rally. But now the survey shows the percentage has dropped to 75 percent. Reducing bond exposure in this direction means selling.
Mr. Connor also said there was a lot of selling because investors were switching from Treasury securities to corporate and other bonds, which offer higher yields.
"It is a wake-up call for a bond manager," said N. Graham Allen, managing director of global fixed income for Wells Capital Management. He still believes that this is just a wide swing in a trading range that will see bond prices rally and yields fall again. But he acknowledged that the bond market "is a little shaky at the moment."
Stephen D. Slifer, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, also argues that investors are overreacting. He said that the 1.4 percent rise in the inflation measure for the gross domestic product was overstated. It was the report of that rise on Friday, along with the news that the economy grew at 4.5 percent during the first quarter, a rate much stronger than expected, that set off the latest round of bond selling.
He also said that while some commodity prices have risen recently from their lows for the year, they have not had the kind of surge that amounts to an inflationary threat.
But he acknowledged that right now this analysis does not matter in the bond market. "While I may kiss this off," he said, "there is nothing that says that interest rates can't go up in the near term."

HEADLINE: April Auto Sales Impressive Despite LowerG.M. Results

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 4

 BODY:
Car and truck buyers were out in force in April, and as a result the auto industry turned in strong sales results just as it heads into the crucial summer selling season. Sales rose 3.9 percent over all in April, and the industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans at a brisk seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.3 million.
The impressive results came despite lower-than-expected sales at the General Motors Corporation. G.M. said its sales fell 4 percent in April, with car sales falling 4.5 percent and truck sales falling 3.5 percent compared with results in the month a year earlier. Wall Street analysts cautioned that the G.M. results were not as weak as they seemed because G.M. had blockbuster results last April when it was offering particularly hefty rebates. Still, analysts expected G.M.'s sales to decline no more than 3 percent. 
 But G.M. executives were upbeat. "April was a very good month for us," said Roy S. Roberts, vice president and group executive for North America Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing. "Our market share is north of 30 percent for the first time in seven months." G.M.'s market share in April was 30.6 percent, down from 33.2 in April of last year. Much of the decline came from G.M.'s largest division, Chevrolet, where sales dropped 10.9 percent in April.
The sales came at a price. G.M. offered hefty rebates and other incentives on many of its vehicles in April. For instance, current Cadillac owners are entitled to $1,000 off the price of any new Cadillac except the Escalade sport utility vehicle. Pontiac will lease its Grand Am sedan for $219 a month. And Buick is offering three-year, zero interest leases on four of its models, as if it were borrowing the money at Japanese interest rates and passing on the savings to its customers.
Nevertheless, with nearly a year of especially strong sales results, auto makers are considering building factories in the United States to help meet demand. G.M.'s board tentatively approved plans to build a new factory in Lansing, Mich., to produce rear-wheel-drive luxury vehicles. G.M. is still negotiating agreements with the United Automobile Workers union and state and local governments but could begin construction for the factory as early as this summer, said Kyle W. Johnson, a company spokesman.
Honda, which said on Monday that its sales rose 4 percent last month and 8.3 percent so far this year, is considering building its third American factory and is looking at sites in Alabama and Georgia. Alabama is considered the front-runner for the factory, which would build sport utility vehicles.
Wall Street analysts said the industry's strong sales reflected a buyer's market. "There are a lot of really interesting products out there for people to buy, and people are getting good prices," said Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Economists concur that the strong sales are fed by several factors: strong economic growth, a surging stock market, low interest rates, tax refunds and hefty rebates and other sales incentives. Auto executives agree but add that some of the strength in sales can be predicted by reading demographic tea leaves.
David P. Bostwick, director of corporate market research for DaimlerChrysler A.G., said auto makers were selling more cars and trucks because the leading edge of the baby boom had reached prime car-buying age. "This is basically the time when you buy more cars more often than any time of your life," Mr. Bostwick said.
Other auto makers also reported strong sales. On Monday, the Ford Motor Company said its sales rose 6.6 percent, DaimlerChrysler sales rose 3 percent, Toyota sales rose 9.6 percent and Nissan rose 21.5 percent.
Mazda sales rose 16.7 percent in April, to 21,989. Kia sales nearly doubled, to 10,606, and Hyundai sales nearly doubled, to 10,685.
Daewoo, the Korean company that began selling cars in the United States last September, sold 2,006 cars in April. Volkswagen A.G. said its April sales rose 29.5 percent. Audi said its sales rose 29.3 percent, to 5,592, because of strong sales of the Audi A4 and A6 models. Subaru sales rose 12 percent, to 12,331, because stronger sales of the Forester offset weaker sales of the Impreza. Isuzu said its sales fell 5.8 percent, to 7,011.
BMW sales rose 14.1 percent, to 14,225. Mitsubishi sales rose 21.3 percent, to 16,370, and Porsche sales rose 11 percent, to 2,198.

HEADLINE: Gore Pushes Mass Transit in the Heart of Automobile Country

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 4

 BODY:
Pursuing the suburban voters who may prove crucial in next year's Presidential election, as well as traditional Democratic constituents in cities, Vice President Al Gore called today in a speech here for reviving urban centers and reducing traffic congestion.
Speaking in the heart of the nation's auto industry, Mr. Gore called not only for better schools and the redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites but also for shifting spending from highway construction to mass transit systems. 
 "If you want to build subways instead of highways, you ought to be able to make that choice," he told nearly 3,000 local politicians and community advocates from across the country.
Mr. Gore's comment's provoked scowls and whispers among the handful of auto executives in the audience, not one of whom was willing afterward to criticize the Administration. With nearly five million people, Detroit is the nation's largest metropolitan area without a subway.
Asked about the executives' skepticism, Mr. Gore replied: "That's not universally the case. They know that mass transit has a legitimate and larger role to play."
Spending on mass transit has barely kept pace with inflation in the Clinton Administration, rising to $5.39 billion this fiscal year from $4.58 billion in the 1994 fiscal year, the first for which the Administration set the budget. By comparison, Federal highway appropriations have soared to $27.37 billion now from $18.99 billion in 1994.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater blamed Republicans for the disparity, saying the Administration had sought higher mass transit spending only to see Congress devote more money to highway construction instead.
But even though many Republicans have been hostile to mass transit programs, which tend to benefit big, heavily Democratic cities, the Federal budget is a result of a series of compromises between Congress and the Administration in which both sides share responsibility for the final spending decisions.
The Vice President, Mr. Slater and other senior Federal officials spoke on Monday and today at an Administration conference here on ways to improve the quality of life in communities and protect the environment while still encouraging economic growth. The officials' comments, at the Town Hall Meeting for a Sustainable America, were transmitted through satellite video links to 60,000 local advocates and officials at more than 100 sites around the country.
Responding to critics who have suggested that issues like traffic congestion and suburban sprawl are not big enough to justify so much attention from a Vice President and Presidential candidate, Mr. Gore said, "I think it's good that people tune in to the fact that this is a huge issue for Americans who live in the suburbs, and at long last they're shedding this misconception that it's somehow a small issue."
Mr. Gore met with top auto executives today as part of an effort to persuade them to work with the Government on ways to improve the fuel efficiency of sport utility vehicles. The big, off-road vehicles account for a fifth of family vehicle sales and outsell cars in the luxury market for automobiles costing $28,000 or more. They are allowed a much lower Federal fuel-economy standard than cars, a legacy of the days when sport utility vehicles and other pickup truck-based vehicles were used mainly by small businesses.
Today's meeting, the latest in a series between the Administration and the auto industry, did not produce any immediate decisions. But after years of mainly studying whether batteries, natural gas and other alternative power sources may someday be used in cars, auto makers are beginning to look at whether these technologies may also have applications in sport utility vehicles.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Weakening Treasury Issues Cause Drop in Most Indexes

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Further deterioration in the bond market gave equity traders an excuse to sell stocks yesterday, and major market averages fell sharply.
One day after setting a new high, the Dow Jones industrial average recorded its sixth point decline in five weeks. Interest rate-sensitive stocks like American Express, J. P. Morgan and Citigroup were among the Dow's biggest decliners. By the close, the blue-chip index was down 128.58, or 1.17 percent, to 10,886.11. 
 Broader indexes also fared poorly.
A big selloff in popular technology stocks like Microsoft, Cisco Systems, America Online and EMC helped drag down the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index by 22.63, or 1.7 percent, to 1,332.00. The Nasdaq's composite index fell even more sharply, dropping 50.46, or 2 percent, to 2,485.12. And the Street.com's Internet stock index fell 17.84, or 2.8 percent, to 615.13.
Although few sectors of the market managed to post gains yesterday, transportation stocks were an exception. For the second straight session, the Dow Jones transportation average set a new high.
The overall market's slide yesterday was attributed not only to profit-taking after Monday's big advance, but also to recent developments in the bond market.
Long-term bond yields have risen to their highest levels in nine months, reflecting traders' fear of inflation, a result of fresh evidence of economic buoyancy. The Conference Board reported yesterday, for example, that its index of leading economic indicators rose for the sixth straight month in March, and the Government said that conditions in the housing market remained strong.
"I think the stock market is right to be worried about rising interest rates," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
With signs of economic improvement popping up in a number of countries and industries, fixed-income investments may again become competitive with stocks.
Responding to these changing conditions, Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, signaled a shift in his group's model portfolio yesterday to 40 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 30 percent cash, from 40 percent stocks, 50 percent bonds and 10 percent cash.
"This started with an equity call, where we think it is time to start rotating out of large-cap, high-quality growth stocks and move into value and small-cap stocks," he said.
"Some of our profit indicators in those areas are popping up, signalling it is time to move. But value stocks tend to rise when interest rates go up. So we shortened our bond position as well."
With the exception of Goldman, Sachs, the rise in interest rates hurt the stocks of financial service companies yesterday. Goldman, whose stock was freed to trade for the first time yesterday, saw its share price soar 17 3/8 to close at 70 3/8.
But J. P. Morgan, a rival and a Dow component, fell 4 1/16, to 133 1/2. Merrill Lynch shed 6, to 81 1/4. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette declined 3 3/16, to 63 15/16. Charles Schwab lost 5 11/16, to 101 3/4. Citigroup fell 2 3/4, to 72 1/4.
Big technology stocks also slid broadly. Microsoft fell 1 13/16, to 78 1/16. Cisco Systems dropped 5, to 108 5/8. Lucent Technologies declined 1 5/8, to 57 7/8. EMC fell 7, to 100. And America Online lost 6 1/16, to 127 1/16.
Trading was active. On the Big Board, 933.2 million shares changed hands. Volume on the Nasdaq was 921.7 million shares.

HEADLINE: Preserving Montenegro

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic is using the war in Kosovo to try to sabotage his most formidable political rival, Milo Djukanovic, the President of Montenegro. Mr. Djukanovic has brought economic reform and ethnic tolerance to his part of Yugoslavia, and calls the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo "insane." The West should do everything possible to help him.
So far, Mr. Djukanovic's popularity has discouraged Mr. Milosevic from using his Second Army, stationed in Montenegro, to attempt a coup. Instead he is trying to undermine Mr. Djukanovic by creating ethnic instability and worsening the economic crisis brought on by the war. Belgrade has driven 70,000 Kosovars into Montenegro, where they are resented by the Slavic population. It has made Montenegro into a NATO target by shooting at alliance planes from there. Although NATO has responded with restraint, each bomb undermines public support for Mr. Djukanovic. 
 Mr. Milosevic has also tried to use the army to take over Montenegro's border posts, television transmitters and its main port -- Yugoslavia's only outlet to the sea. He has replaced commanders with his loyalists, and brought in troops from Serbia. So far Mr. Djukanovic's police have kept control.
Washington has made the crucial pledge that ships carrying oil bound for Montenegro will be exempt from the planned embargo on Serbia. It has also sent Montenegro $10 million, which will help pay pensions and salaries this month. Congress should approve an additional $20 million requested by the White House, but more is urgently needed.
Montenegro also needs more aid to help the Kosovars it has taken in. It has treated them well, but some have now been killed by the Second Army. If these measures fail to keep up support for Mr. Djukanovic and the army does attempt a coup, NATO ought to retaliate from the air. NATO should do whatever it can to protect this democratic enclave from Mr. Milosevic.

HEADLINE: Milwaukee High School Team Wins Annual Test of Economic Wits

BYLINE: By JOHN FILES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Seated around a vast conference table in the intimidating, vaultlike chambers of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, tomorrow's would-be Alan Greenspans gathered this week in a battle of economic wits.
The fourth annual Fed Challenge national championship, sponsored by the Federal Reserve, required the high school students to consider a range of economic data, analyze daily financial figures and then argue for a specific American monetary policy. The nine teams of five members each were judged on their knowledge of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve and on the quality of their presentations, research and analysis. 
 The winners -- the team from the University School of Milwaukee -- will take home a total of $100,000, provided by Citibank: a $10,000 scholarship for each team member; $40,000 for their school (to develop an in-school economics lab) and $10,000 for their faculty adviser, John Stephens. Each of the other eight teams received $35,000.
Although most of the 45 students have taken economics courses, and some of their schools offer college credits for courses that prepare students for the competition, the Fed Challenge is mainly an extracurricular activity, said Lloyd Bromberg, director of educational programs for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
In some schools, Mr. Bromberg added, the Fed Challenge is treated like an interscholastic sport, with tryouts and weekly practices or lectures.
The University School team had been preparing since February, meeting twice a week for a couple of hours and for three or four hours on weekends. The students said they relied on newspapers, 24-hour cable news and the Internet for information and up-to-date financial statistics.
"There is no opportunity like this in any other academic field," said one member of the team, Mary Broydrick, an 18-year-old senior. "The information we exchange in class, and in preparation for the competition, correspond to real life."
A member of another team, Juan Carlos Rasco, a 17-year-old senior at Belen Jesuit Preparatory High School in Miami, said the Fed Challenge "became our eighth class."
"I'm not taking an economics course right now," Mr. Rasco said. "Most of the work is done on our own -- assessing financial indicators and paying attention to the news."
Ted Hartsoe, an economics teacher who is the faculty adviser for the team from Choate Rosemary Hall, a private school in Wallingford, Conn., said he had made assignments for his team on issues of macroeconomics and the functions of the Fed. "The kids stayed committed and involved with weekly presentations," Mr. Hartsoe said.
In welcoming the students, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said dryly that he would wish them luck but that luck was not involved in the board's decisions. He did acknowledge that the Fed had "sneaked a look" at what the students were doing and saying over the years. And two years ago, board officials say, Mr. Greenspan went so far as to borrow an analogy -- likening higher interest rates to vaccination -- from a three-time winner of the Fed Challenge, Bryan High School in Bryan, Tex.
The program was created in 1995 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and became a national competition in 1996. Federal Reserve Banks conduct their own regional competitions, sending the district winners to Washington. This year more than 300 students took part around the nation, with 9 of the 12 Federal Reserve districts represented at the final competition.
Each team offered a 15-minute presentation before a three-judge panel in a mock meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting body. The students analyzed current economic data and forecast trends that can be important in setting monetary policy: inflation, unemployment, trade balance and stock market fluctuation.
After the presentations, the teams faced a 10-minute question-and-answer session led by the judges: William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chairman of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee; Edward M. Gramlich, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and Jack Guyan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta.
Of course, it did not hurt that the high school students and the central bankers were on the same wavelength. All four teams in the final round made recommendations to the Federal Reserve to maintain current policy, including leaving interest rates unchanged.
"The quality of the presentations was outstanding," Mr. McDonough said. "The students showed a remarkable ability to provide a quick and accurate assessment of the questions asked of them and thoughtful answers."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE NEGOTIATORS;
Gore and Chernomyrdin, Familiar Partners in Talks, Seek Balkan Solution

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the stolid former Russian Prime Minister, and Al Gore, the stolid American Vice President, are engaged in an intensive search for a diplomatic exit to the bloodshed in the Balkans, an effort that brings some risk to both men, but potentially large benefits.
Over the past two days, Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin conducted a movable meeting that migrated from Mr. Gore's small quarters in the West Wing of the White House to the Oval Office to the exercise room of Mr. Gore's official residence. 
 While the sessions were "constructive," the leaders said, there has been no breakthrough. Aides said that substantive progress on the diplomatic front would not come for weeks, if ever.
But the two men, lifelong party apparatchiks and loyal lieutenants to more charismatic leaders, do not traffic in breakthroughs. Their speciality is dialogue; their advanced degrees are in "process."
The Gore-Chernomyrdin discussions may in the end yield nothing.Nevertheless, both men stand to gain from these high-profile sessions. Should their talks bear fruit, each would be seen as a peacemaker, an effective negotiator and a credible leader.
But Mr. Gore is engaging in a calculated gamble, as well. Failure in a high-profile diplomatic venture could undercut his argument that his foreign policy experience makes him uniquely qualified among all the current candidates for the White House.
Advisers to Mr. Gore said there was no conscious effort to position him as the seeker of peace in the Balkans, in contrast to President Clinton, the maker of war.
One Gore adviser said that given the hawkish sentiments in the Democratic Party today, Mr. Gore would benefit more from an aggressive pro-war position. Mr. Gore could suffer if he is associated with a Russian-brokered peace deal that comes to be seen as too easy on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, this adviser said.
The Gore-Chernomyrdin dialogue, first opened six years ago, has been an invaluable high-level channel for addressing issues that their bosses do not have time for and their subordinates cannot deliver on. They are able to conduct talks without the pomp of summitry or the indecision of staff-level work. And their personal connection, groomed over years in high office, creates a bond of trust unrivaled anywhere else in the American-Russia relationship.
"There's just no doubt that we have the ability to talk with one another in total candor and in total confidence that neither is trying to pull the wool over the other's eyes," Mr. Gore said in an interview today.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin have been negotiating partners since early 1993, when Mr. Chernomyrdin was the newly appointed Russian Prime Minister under President Boris N. Yeltsin and Mr. Gore took office as Bill Clinton's Vice President.
In 10 formal sessions of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission on Economic, Security and Scientific Issues (pretentiously referred to by Roman numerals, like Super Bowls), the two leaders tackled some of the thorniest issues dividing the United States and Russia. They took on Russian missile sales to Iran, lax controls on Russian weapons-grade plutonium, competition for Russian oil and gas resources, international loan commitments, and cooperation in space between the two countries. Their discussions were technical and detailed, without much bluster, said an aide to Mr. Gore.
The formal sessions ended when Mr. Yeltsin dismissed Mr. Chernomyrdin in March of last year as the Russian economy was imploding, but Mr. Gore maintained informal contacts with his former negotiating partner.
The link was re-established this year when Mr. Yeltsin named the former premier Moscow's special envoy for the Balkans, dramatizing Russia's interest in aiding its historical ally, Serbia, and enhancing its own prestige.
Russia strongly opposed NATO's use of force against Yugoslavia when bombs started falling on March 24, provoking one of the deepest crises in Russia's relationship with the West since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Moscow has offered itself as a negotiator in hope of reasserting its influence and international relevance.
Thus it was natural to turn to one of the oldest and deepest ties in American-Russian diplomacy, the Gore-Chernomyrdin channel. Mr. Chernomyrdin was seen as an ideal interlocutor because he did not have confining governmental responsibilities, but he carried the full authority of President Yeltsin. He had also earned a reputation over the years of dealings with the Vice President as someone who backed up his promises with action.
"This is a very good, very well-established working link with a very practical side to it," said Leon Feurth, Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy adviser. "Both of the people involved are accustomed to working out problems with each other."
Administration officials who attended the Gore-Chernomyrdin meetings this week were reluctant to share details of their discussions. The Americans tried to make clear to Mr. Chernomyrdin the conditions the allies are demanding before they will consider halting hostilities against Belgrade. Mr. Chernomyrdin was relaying Mr. Milosevic's own position, which so far remains wholly unacceptable to the United States and its allies.
Do not expect miracles, American officials cautioned today. The talks remain about process, not yet about peace.
"This is very much a work in progress and very much uncertain," a senior Administration official who participated in the talks said. "We're not negotiating a peace in the Balkans with Russia. If we were, we'd be home by now. The problem is Milosevic. The Russians do not have decisive influence with him, nor do they claim a decisive influence. But they are trying to help. They are trying to end this conflict."

HEADLINE: Report Raises Concerns About Bias in Crash Inquiries

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The Government's system for organizing crash investigations is too dependent on work from groups with direct interests in the results, including manufacturers, operators and regulators, a draft report by the Rand Corporation says.
The preliminary report, which Rand has been asked to present on Thursday at a House budget hearing, also found that lengthy investigations like those involving USAir 427, which lasted for more than four years, and Trans World Airlines 800, now two and a half years old, are becoming the norm, as fewer airplanes crash from simple causes like navigation error or parts failure. The USAir flight crashed near Pittsburgh in September 1994, killing 132 people, and the T.W.A. flight went down off Long Island in July 1996, killing 230. 
 The stakes are rising in each investigation, the report said, with higher and higher payments in civil suits brought by survivors, or settlements in suits among airlines, manufacturers and component producers. Market share and public confidence are also at stake.
"Dispassionate fact-finding becomes problematic," Rand said in notes for a briefing to National Transportation Safety Board executives last month. The board requested the study last year out of concern over public criticism of accident investigations, especially air crashes. Beyond concerns over the length of time that investigations take, families of the dead, and especially their lawyers, are seeking a greater role in the investigations.
Those investigations follow what the board calls its "party system," under which it invites those with specific expertise to help it investigate but not analyze or draw conclusions. For example, in the case of USAir 427, it had help from the airline, the pilots' union, Boeing, the company that manufactured a suspect hydraulic valve and the Federal Aviation Administration.
Cynthia C. Lebow, a Rand analyst who is leading the study, said in a interview that "the party process is essential in many respects because the safety board is never going to be an enormous agency, and it will never have the staff and the technical capability to design an aircraft or operate an airline." But of the parties, Ms. Lebow said, "you have to recognize that in this day and age, those guys are coming in with multiple agendas," including limiting their legal liability and maintaining public reputation or market share.
The study recommends that the agency add more experts to its staff, but also practice "knowledge management," knowing where to find outside expertise, from NASA, the Defense Department, national laboratories or academic institutions.
In addition, top board officials say -- and the study confirms -- that the agency lacks the resources to keep training its investigators, as the complexity of airplanes, air traffic control systems and related equipment advances year by year. In a survey, 40 percent of the investigators told Rand that they had got no training at all, the report said, and average annual training expenditure per aviation employee was $2,000, at a time when learning to fly new models of planes could cost up to $40,000.
The study found that the safety board's staff of about 400 people, of whom about half are investigators, had been "operating under continuing excessive workload." Aviation investigators told Rand researchers that they worked an average of 51 1/2 hours a week, not counting periods of intense work immediately after crashes, when they are in the field from sunup until sundown, and meet every evening to compare notes.
Board officials say that no matter the investigators' pay grade, their overtime is at the time-and-a-half rate of junior employees, which is sometimes less than their straight-time pay. Board officials say investigators for other agencies, sometimes working shoulder-to-shoulder with safety board investigators, receive traditional time-and-a-half overtime.
The study said many employees were eligible for retirement, suggesting a looming personnel crisis.
The Administration's budget request for the agency for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 is $57 million, which is about equal to spending in the current fiscal year, including extra money voted by Congress for the T.W.A. 800 inquiry and other special investigations. But the board wants $73 million for overtime and training in the fiscal year 2001.
"We hire smart people, and then we work them hard, and we don't train them," said Peter Goelz, the agency's managing director, in an interview. He said more money would allow the board to again finish major inquiries in 12 to 18 months.

Levitt of S.E.C. Criticizes Ads for On-Line Investing
Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized brokerage industry advertisements focusing on the get-rich aspect of on-line investing, contending they were doing more harm than good for both Wall Street and the public.
Mr. Levitt also admonished individual investors to better educate themselves about on-line trading. But he called on brokerage firms to strengthen their disclosure of the risks of trading stocks over the Internet. Page C5. 

Treasury Bond Prices Drop Sharply
Bond prices dropped sharply, pushing long-term interest rates to their highest level in nine months. The yield of the benchmark 30-year Treasury jumped to 5.71 percent. Investors are losing the conviction that the United States economy will slow this year, with inflation remaining in check; instead, a growing number worry that a rebound in the rest of the world will keep growth strong here and nudge inflation higher.

Stocks Fall; Dow Down 129 Points
Stocks tumbled, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down 128.58 points, or 1.17 percent, to 10,886.11. The Nasdaq composite index fell 50.46 points, or 2 percent, to 2,485.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 22.63 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,332.00. C10.
 
Shares of Goldman Sachs Group, which was Wall Street's last big private partnership, soared on their first day of trading, rising $17.375, or 33 percent, to $70.375. C6.
 
Higher Gasoline Prices Forecast
Approaching the key summer driving season, gasoline prices are up sharply from historically low levels, a result of cuts by major oil producing countries. Now, citing tight American supplies of gasoline, experts foresee still higher prices. Travel. C8.
 
CBS Puts Pressure on Morning TV
CBS's decision to bring Bryant Gumbel back to morning television raises the ante in the competition among network morning programs, an area gaining more attention from network executives because it offers far more potential for increased profits than prime time or any other hour of the day. With Mr. Gumbel, a new program and new studio, to be built in one of the most visible sites in Manhattan, CBS is making a commitment to compete head to head with NBC's "Today" show, by far the dominant show in the morning with Katie Couric and Matt Lauer.

HEADLINE: AT&T Is Seen Forging Link To Microsoft

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SETH SCHIESE

 BODY:
The AT&T Corporation is close to forming a wide-ranging partnership with the Microsoft Corporation as part of an intricate web of deals that also would make AT&T the winner in the battle against the Comcast Corporation for Mediaone Group Inc., the big cable television company, executives close to the negotiations said last night.
Comcast bowed out of a potential bidding war for Mediaone last night by reaching an agreement with AT&T to exchange certain cable systems. The deal would give Comcast an additional two million subscribers and AT&T up to $9.2 billion. 
 But the most intriguing and potentially important element of the numerous deals is the partnership that AT&T is negotiating with Microsoft, the No. 1 maker of personal computer software.
Under the terms of the deal being negotiated last night, Microsoft would invest about $5 billion in AT&T to acquire 2 to 3 percent of AT&T, executives close to the talks said. Microsoft would pay more than the $51.5625 closing price of AT&T shares yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the executives said. They added that the size of the premium to be paid was one of the central sticking points in the negotiations last night.
Microsoft would get what it has long been seeking: a commitment from AT&T to use Microsoft's Windows operating system in the advanced set-top boxes that AT&T will deploy to offer bundles of digital services.
Together, AT&T and Microsoft have a market value of more than half a trillion dollars and, if linked, would form the world's leading force in technology and communications. Any AT&T-Microsoft partnership would be sure to arouse concern among politicians and regulators. Though the two companies are not now competitors, both AT&T and Microsoft are behemoths with long traditions of dominating their industries.
The prospect of an alliance is sure to seem mind-boggling to at least some powerful people in Washington.
William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, declined to comment last night.
While AT&T does not need the money, an investment by Microsoft would buoy AT&T's shares, which may fall as the company continues its headlong deal-making.
With $22 billion in cash and no debt -- and already owning 11 percent of Comcast -- Microsoft found itself in a kingmaker role in the Mediaone bidding.
An investment in AT&T would be partly defensive for Microsoft. The company has scrambled for advantage for Windows CE -- the version of its operating system for small devices -- in the young, fast-changing market for software used in television set-top boxes. And Microsoft also wants to try to insure access to high-speed networks for its other software and Internet commerce businesses.
But Microsoft's move would also be offensive in that it could help the company as the Internet business moves toward the so-called broadband model in which households are continuously connected to high-speed data lines.
As for Comcast, whose initial $53 billion bid for Mediaone was topped by an AT&T offer of $58 billion, it would end up with as many as two million of AT&T's existing cable subscribers, mostly on the East Coast as part of the AT&T deal. It will also assume management control over an additional two million AT&T cable subscribers.
Even after selling up to two million subscribers to Comcast, AT&T, the nation's biggest telephone company, would emerge from the fray as the nation's biggest cable television company. Before agreeing to acquire Tele-Communications Inc. for about $32 billion last summer, AT&T had no presence in cable television. But C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chairman of 18 months, is pursuing a vision of delivering integrated packages of telephone, television and high-speed Internet access to millions of households using cable lines.
Comcast will still end up the No. 3 cable television company. The residential customers it is set to buy from AT&T will serve to solidify Comcast's dominance between Philadelphia and Washington, executives close to the talks said. AT&T and Comcast agreed to form a venture to offer telephone service over Comcast's cables.
Though Comcast has agreed to drop out of the bidding for Mediaone, it will walk away with a rich prize, analysts said yesterday. At a price of up to $9.2 billion in cash and stock for as many as two million cable subscribers, Comcast is paying roughly $4,500 a subscriber, about the industry average.
Comcast, based in Philadelphia, will swap an additional 750,000 subscribers to give it more clustered subscribers in crucial markets. Though only half of the exact locations for cable swaps and purchases had been determined late last night, a person involved in the discussions said Comcast was increasing cable subscribers in some of its main markets, including Philadelphia, Nashville and parts of Michigan, and giving up some in Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Sacramento, Calif.
To pay for the subscribers, Comcast will use the $1.5 billion fee that Mediaone will pay for backing out of the original deal with Comcast. Comcast is also swapping back to AT&T $1.5 billion in AT&T stock and another $1 billion in the stock of At-Home, a provider of Internet services over cable modems. Had Comcast sold that stock on the open market, it would have paid heavy capital gains taxes. Selling it back to AT&T is a tax-free transaction, people close to the company noted last night.
To pay the balance of the purchase price, Comcast will issue additional shares of its own nonvoting stock at a price based on how the stock trades over the next 50 days. A person close to the talks said that Comcast expected to add 75 million new shares to its existing base of 450 million shares.
Comcast clearly wanted Mediaone but was unable to form a bidding alliance with America Online, which was not in a position to issue more stock to pay its share because its stock price has been volatile. Microsoft, another potential ally, decided to cut a deal with AT&T, and Comcast did not have the financial muscle to buy the company on its own.
But several analysts who follow Comcast were pleased by the new deal. For one thing, Comcast will be using its deal-breakup fee of $1.5 billion, which one analyst called found money. It is also using a large slug of Comcast stock, which is trading near record prices. It closed yesterday at $64.125, down $1.8125. And for analysts who believe that size is less important than clustered systems that enable cable companies to sell local advertising and have better management control, Comcast is moving close to that model.
Continued consolidations have reassured investors that cable companies will be well run and will benefit from economies of scale.
In a related transaction, AT&T is buying the half of Lenfest Communications that it does not already own from that company's chairman, Jerry Lenfest. The price for the midsize cable company is $2 billion, or 43 million shares of AT&T stock.
Brian Roberts, Comcast's president and a member of the family that controls the company, will manage those cable systems, which are heavily weighted in New Jersey and Philadelphia, where Comcast already has cable systems.

HEADLINE: ON HOCKEY;
Series a Straight Line In Tangled Tale for Jagr

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

 BODY:
Seven hours before the face-off, Jaromir Jagr kept answering the same questions the same way. What about the pressure of the seventh and deciding game against the Devils in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs?
Does he like pressure? someone asked Jagr. "Everybody does," Jagr said, smiling frequently. "I like the pressure." And he didn't seem too concerned about the injured groin muscle that kept him out of four games in this series and limited his effectiveness in Game 6. In that one, a Pittsburgh victory on Sunday, he scored two goals -- the tying goal late and the game winner in overtime -- and he said he was lucky to get them while skating with pain and limited range of motion. 
 Jagr spoke early, after yesterday's morning skate, a hockey ritual that is a mixture of light practice, interviews, gossip, spin and propaganda. As he walked through the door and down the corridor, he spied a TV crew interviewing Matthew Barnaby, the agitator of Pittsburgh's forward lines. Jagr sneaked behind him and began to jump up and down, hair flopping, arms waving, legs stretching, causing great laughter and a light air that contrasted with the tense Devils' mood down the hall.
Last night, when the first round was decided, Jagr had reason to jump up and down again, but he stood still, exhausted. Although his skating was even more labored than it was in the previous game, Jagr produced some brilliant moments as the Penguins won by 4-2 to win the four-of-seven-game series, four games to three. The Penguins will go on to play Toronto in the second round.
Even while injured, Jagr showed why he won the National Hockey League's scoring title this season and is the consensus favorite to win the Hart trophy as the most valuable player in the N.H.L.
"People judge you by the way you play in the playoffs," he said.
Jagr was credited with two assists, including a beauty in the final minute of the second period. On that play, he drew two Devils defensemen to him, deep in the right-wing side of the New Jersey zone, before flipping a backhanded pass to the uncovered Jan Hrdina, who scored the goal that put the Penguins up by 3-1 and caused the home fans to boo the Devils as they left the ice for intermission.
On the first goal, by German Titov, Jagr did not get credit for an assist, but he created the play by pursuing the puck deep into the Devils' end and occupying the attention of Scott Stevens, the Devils' defenseman. This cleared space and time for Martin Straka to set up Titov. On the fourth Pittsburgh goal, the one that made it 4-2 late in the third period and sealed the decision, Jagr came up with a loose puck in the neutral zone, roared in on goalie Martin Brodeur and fired. Brodeur made a save, but was vulnerable for Straka's scoring shot on the rebound.
"When I came back, it was a big lift for the whole team," Jagr said. "But I told the guys, 'Don't count on me to score three goals.' "
His Penguins were the eighth and final seeded team in the Eastern Conference; the Devils were ranked first, and that wasn't Pittsburgh's only disadvantage. Their success is coming against a backdrop of chaos. The franchise has been in bankruptcy for most of the season. A Federal judge is hearing the case. The major group bidding for the team is fronted by Mario Lemieux, the former Penguins star who is owed more than $30 million in deferred salary. When Lemieux led the team to two Stanley Cups as captain in the early 1990's, Jagr was his understudy. The letters of "Jaromir," the fans noted, could be rearranged to spell "Mario Jr." Now, Jagr is the captain.
The N.H.L. has told the court that it needs to know the fate of the team by June 1, although the judge has said it may take longer. Among the options, according to the N.H.L.: the franchise could be sold and moved or the franchise could be dissolved, with the players redistributed throughout the league via some as-yet unannounced method. Jagr, in reply to a question last night, noted that he stands to lose money because some of his past salary has been deferred.
Amid all this, Jagr is excelling. He took many hard hits from Devils checkers last night, missing one shift for medical attention, but he is a hard man to discourage. "Scary moment," he said of the missed shift. "I started to feel a little pain. I thought it was over. The pain went away."
Stevens, the Devils' captain, had hinted last week that he might not have been sidelined with an injury such as the one to Jagr. Perhaps he should have bitten his tongue. On many of their shifts they were matched against each other and Jagr was at his best.
Jagr is playing with a pair of specially made shorts to protect his injured groin. The pants, shipped from Vancouver, are made of strong stretch material, like a girdle, with a special belt system. A heating patch is sewn on the inside of the shorts to warm the groin area. Removable, figure-eight straps are used to compress and warm the thigh tissue. At times during last night's game, Jagr could be seen wincing on the Penguins' bench and reaching into his waistband to adjust the equipment.
He has his name on the Stanley Cup twice from the Lemieux era, and he won a gold medal last year with the Czech Republic in the Olympics. A nine-year veteran at age 27, he still seems youthful, with the chubby cheeks of a boy. When someone asked why so many great players, including several Penguins, come from the Czech Republic, Jagr turned serious, recalling how he grew up in what was then called Czechoslovakia. "Under Communism," he said, sports were a way out, a way to travel, to see the world. The Government sponsored the team and gave out free sticks, free uniforms, free ice time.
Now, everything is different. He is a world-class athlete, a master of his sport, working in the United States during an economic boom of capitalism for a franchise in financial free fall. And he plays in pain and deals with it, too, surviving and thriving, leading his team to who knows where. What a country, what a team, what a player.

Accounts Moving At Mad Dogs

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Accounts are leaving and arriving at Mad Dogs and Englishmen in New York.
Mad Dogs is losing the trade advertising duties for the American account of The Economist magazine, which it had handled since 1991. The account, with billings estimated at $1 million to $2 million, is being consolidated at Weiss Stagliano Partners in New York, which has handled the corporate or consumer duties since 1997. The Economist is part of Economist Newspaper Ltd., the British company half-owned by Pearson Group P.L.C. that calls itself Economist Group. 
 More than offsetting its loss, Mad Dogs was awarded duties for three branding assignments with total billings estimated at $6 million. The Time Warner Cable Group in New York, part of Time Warner Inc., selected the agency to produce an integrated television, print and outdoor campaign to begin in the fall. Mad Dogs produced a similar campaign last year.
The Daily Deal, a financial newspaper that American Lawyer Media Inc. in New York plans to start publishing in the fall, named Mad Dogs to create a trade campaign. And Vanishing Point in New York, a beauty services retailer, selected the agency to a create a campaign to start this spring.

Disney Presses Ahead With Times Sq. Restaurant

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
This would not seem to be the best time to get into the theme restaurant business.
The best known of the theme operators, Planet Hollywood, is losing money and struggling to avoid bankruptcy. It is trying to sell its Official All Star Cafe chain without success. Others have cut back expansion plans and some themes have died before the first restaurant opened its doors. 
 Nevertheless, the Walt Disney Company is pressing ahead with plans to open a three-level, 42,000-square-foot sports and television theme restaurant in Times Square at the end of the summer. It will be in the new office building being completed on the east side of Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets that will be named after one of its chief tenants, the Conde Nast publishing company.
The restaurant will be called the ESPN Zone, after Disney's all-sports network. The new installation will add to the growing presence of the Disney company in the Times Square area. In addition to a retail store that has operated for several years at the southwestern corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, the Disney-owned ABC network is building a broadcast studio overlooking Broadway at 44th Street.
Two musical shows based on Disney animated movies, "The Lion King" and "Beauty and the Beast," are also playing in the Times Square area, "The Lion King" in the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street, which the company restored and leases from New York State.
Unlike most other theme restaurants, whose economics are based on the sales of food and theme-related merchandise, ESPN Zone is designed with sports and broadcasting themes and has an added source of income: interactive games.
One ESPN Zone restaurant has operated in Baltimore for less than a year and another is scheduled to open in Chicago in July. Disney officials say the New York property will be the chain's flagship.
The restaurant will have three levels, which Disney Regional Entertainment, the division developing the restaurants, calls the Studio Grille, the Screening Room and the Sports Arena. The entrance will be on Broadway, north of 42d Street.
The Studio Grille, on the first floor, will be a dining room decorated with elements of ESPN studios, including replicas of the sets of such programs as "Sportscenter," "Baseball Tonight" and "NBA2Night." Disney officials said that some broadcasting would be done from the site.
"We are going to have a full-time radio station there and television specials," said Art Levitt, president of Disney Regional.
The next floor up is the Screening Room, which is intended for people who want to eat while watching sports. The floor will be dominated by two 16-by-13-foot screens surrounded by a dozen 37-inch monitors. In all, the restaurant will have 220 video monitors.
The dual large screens are unusual in New York, officials said, so that Giants and Jets or Yankees and Mets games can be shown simultaneously. "There are over 200 days a year when two New York sports teams are playing at the same time," said Scott Dickey, director of marketing and sales for ESPN Zone. Those wanting to watch games in other cities can also be accommodated. ESPN Zone officials say they can bring in any game being broadcast in the country.
Full food service will be available on the first two floors, with the 70-item menu devoted to what the company describes as "upscale American grill food." Alcoholic drinks will be available only on the third floor, which will stretch from 42d to 43d Street but which will have part of its glass facade obscured by the large signs expected to be mounted on the building. That floor will feature interactive games at which customers, in theory at least, can test their skills against sports stars'.
At a baseball batting cage, customers will be able to play a video of a favorite pitcher winding up and throwing a baseball. In fact, the ball will be thrown by a standard pitching machine through a hole in the screen. Other games will include simulated football and ice hockey, Mr. Dickey said.
"The concept is that you will watch a game downstairs and say, 'Ewing should have taken that shot,' " Mr. Dickey said, referring to the Knicks center. "Then you can go upstairs and take that shot yourself." Customers will pay for their play using a debit card bought in advance, with a $5 minimum purchase.
The complex will include a retail store, Zone Stuff, with a separate entrance at the corner of 42d and Broadway. The items offered for sale will include caps, T-shirts and jackets emblazoned with the ESPN logo -- what Mr. Dickey described as "high-end golf apparel."
The restaurant will seat 450 to 475 people, but since the third floor can accommodate several hundred people playing games, the total capacity may be 850 or more. About 400 people will work at the ESPN Zone.
Although no mention of the Disney ownership will be made at the ESPN Zone, the restaurant is part of a plan to offer Disney entertainment to people not inclined to make the trek to its parks in Anaheim, Calif., and Orlando, Fla.
The company is also developing Disney Quest, an interactive theme park that will cover 100,000 square feet in each location, Mr. Dickey said, and Club Disney, a suburban playground for small children and their parents.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the Walt Disney Company's plan to open a restaurant, ESPN Zone, in Times Square later this year misstated the provision for food and drink service. Food will be served on the first two floors, and alcoholic drinks will be served on all floors, not just on the third.

When Disaster Strikes, Someone Must Provide the Tents

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
The fax in Joe Addis's makeshift office near Skopje, Macedonia, has been whirring since the Catholic Relief Services official set up shop near a refugee camp last month. Businesses and brokers have besieged him with sales pitches for tents, toothpaste, food, vegetable oil, laundry soap, sanitary napkins and medical supplies.
Several auto dealers that have an exclusive franchise with Toyota, Ford or Nissan to sell to relief groups, have offered him all-terrain vehicles. Generic-drug wholesalers in Britain and the Netherlands that specialize in supplying field clinics with aspirin, antibiotics and antidepressants, have been in touch with him. So has a company in South Carolina that sells plastic sheeting, a Bronx company that offers blankets and one in Massachusetts that sells prefabricated warehouses. 
 In any disaster -- war, hurricane, famine -- government agencies and humanitarian organizations rush to bring aid. Standing behind them is a growing "disaster industry," a loose conglomeration of companies and middlemen for which bad times can mean boom business.
The companies include small manufacturers whose normal business does not include disasters but which are eager to seize a sudden opportunity. But for the bulk of the companies, which are largely based in Europe and employ from 10 to 500 people, sales to relief and development agencies are their main business. Some are specialized procurement brokers that for a commission of 5 to 20 percent will search for items needed by relief groups like surplus field kitchens, bulletproof vests and concertina wire.
Every year, governments and international organizations spend tens of billions of dollars on both long-term relief projects and emergencies. And large buyers like the Federal Government will buy directly from manufacturers, negotiating contracts and storing emergency supplies at warehouses worldwide.
But in a crisis like the war in Kosovo, charities, both large and small, pour hundreds of millions into a region. In these chaotic situations, they often turn to companies and brokers that are disaster specialists, which can ship goods quickly, track down hard-to-find items and even extend credit. In addition, some relief organizations do not have their own procurement offices and rely on outsiders.
Many companies employ former relief workers and say they can do well by doing good. Others see a huge aid effort as an opportunity to profiteer by selling goods at inflated prices to humanitarian groups or to donate drugs close to their expiration date rather than paying to destroy them.
With hundreds of thousands of refugees in the Balkans in need of blankets, some dealers are holding back the 5 to 10 percent discount normally given for bulk purchases, one major procurement agency said. Depending on quality and material, a blanket used in relief operations costs from $1.50 to $5.
"Where we would normally expect a bulk discount, the discount is not coming through," said Tony Urwin, a buyer with Crown Agents Ltd., a nonprofit procurement service that was part of the British Government until a few years ago. Mr. Urwin declined to identify the dealers but said he was able to find a blanket manufacturer in the United States willing to give him the discount.
Officials of International Procurement Agency, a Dutch company, said it was supplying groups in Kosovo, including World Vision International, with items it had bought from around the world. Blankets are coming from an Egyptian producer, plastic sheeting used for ground coverings is coming from a Dutch company and inexpensive pots and pans from a Czech manufacturer.
"It's a madhouse at the moment," said Bob Vliestra, the company's commercial director.
 
Size of Industry Is Hard to Estimate
Reliable estimates for the size of the industry that serves the disaster and long-term relief market do not exist. With rare exceptions, all the companies selling disaster supplies are private and do not disclose their sales. But Kim Ginnerup, the director of Mission Pharma, a Danish drug wholesaler for which relief groups account for about half of sales, estimated that for drugs alone, the relief market amounted to $1 billion a year.
He said that much of the modern industry sprang up in Europe about 25 years ago among companies focused on supplying Africa, where much relief work was then under way.
Some companies have roots in the nonprofit world. Greg Spitzfaden, an official of Tri-Med of Britain, said that company got its start when its three founders began arranging the shipment of relief items bought with the proceeds from charity rock concerts like Live Aid and Band Aid.
Later, the company branched into procurement and now has offices close to troubled regions, said Mr. Spitzfaden, who recently flew to Macedonia to visit refugee camps and work with clients, including Mr. Addis of Catholic Relief Services.
"We have 13 offices in the places in the world that are at the absolute bottom of everyone's tourist list," he said. Mr. Spitzfaden's office is in one of the world's more idyllic spots, Peterborough, N.H., and many of the European-based concerns have offices here so they can work closely with relief groups based in the United States.
While brokers like Tri-Med will seek out anything requested by a relief group, other companies specialize. Toyota Gibraltar, in the British colony, is Toyota Motor's exclusive dealer to agencies working in relief and development worldwide.
A competitor, Kjaer & Kjaer, a Danish company that holds the Nissan Motor relief distributorship, has based a salesman in Sarajevo to deal with charities and government agencies operating in Albania and Macedonia and has posted his cellular telephone number on its Internet site.
"The situation in Kosovo is deteriorating every minute," the company's site states. "We may be able to assist your efforts in the region."
Soeren Laursen, the Kjaer's marketing manager, said it had sold about 100 all-terrain and pickup vehicles in recent years to groups working in the Balkans. He said the vehicles were stripped-down models built to "Africa specifications" to endure rough conditions. Some have been modified as ambulances or fitted with armor and ballistic floor mats to protect occupants if they go over a land mine.
 
Drug Makers Try To Drum Up Sales
Some companies have just started to get a toehold in the business. Three years ago, for instance, Schein Pharmaceutical Inc., a generic-drug producer based in Florham Park, N.J., hired Allison Formal, a former official with International Services for Medical Services for Health, a relief group, to help sell drugs to humanitarian organizations.
Ms. Formal said Schein, in some cases, had given drugs at cost to relief groups to build up relationships. But typically, the company charges from 12 to 30 percent above a drug's production cost, she added. Drugs sold to commercial wholesale buyers typically cost at least twice as much.
Drug companies in the disaster market must sell products to charities at a steep discount because they are competing against United Nations agencies, which buy huge quantities directly from manufacturers and pass the savings along.
Currently, sales to humanitarian groups are about 1 percent of Schein's annual sales, or about $5 million, Ms. Formal said.
Donated medical supplies, which are desperately needed in crises like Kosovo, can cause their own problems for aid groups. A 1997 article in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated that it would cost the World Health Organization about $2,000 a ton to destroy the hundreds of tons of expired drugs and unusable medical supplies sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina during that conflict.
Normally, a pharmaceutical company must destroy expired drugs in a hazardous waste incinerator, an expensive form of disposal.
A W.H.O. guideline now calls for donated medical supplies to be no less than a year away from expiration. But Max Ziv, a pharmacist working at Genpharm Inc., a generic drug maker in Toronto, said in a telephone interview that he had been giving charities drugs with a shelf life of six months. Mr. Ziv collectes the drugs from his employer and other companies and donates them.
Both Mr. Ziv and Bruce W. Simpson, the president of Genpharm, said they were unaware of the W.H.O. guideline but defended the practice, saying the drugs were good. Genpharm is a subsidiary of Merck K.G.a.A., a German company that is not related to Merck & Company, the American drug giant.
"It is a moral issue," Mr. Ziv said. "Would you rather see people in the third world dying because they need medicines?"
Last year, however, the Vietnamese Government burned about 1,000 pounds of expired antibiotics and drugs that Mr. Ziv had collected and donated. He said the drugs were no older than six months from expiration when they reached Vietnam in March. Government officials destroyed the drugs last fall, according to news reports.
 
Trying to Unload Wrong Kind of Tent
As the Kosovo crisis continues, some sellers of tents are apparently seeking to unload products of little use to refugees. Normally, such products are made by specialized factories, said Mr. Urwin, the buyer with Crown Agents. In recent weeks, he said that some tent producers that normally did not serve the relief market tried to sell him expensive tents designed for campers. The problem: the tents are too small for people to stand inside.
"They are fine if you are looking to spend a weekend in the mountains or on the beach," Mr. Urwin said.
And even products designed for refugees are not always right for the situation. Mr. Addis, the Catholic Relief official, said that some of the tents delivered to Stankovic I, a sprawling refugee camp outside Skopje, do not have floors because they were produced for Africa, where it is hot and relatively dry. As a result, the charity has bought plastic sheeting to serve as tent bottoms.
Thus far, Mr. Addis said, his experience with companies in the disaster business had been good. Not long after surveying the needs of the 30,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees at the Stankovic camp, he decided to bring in military-style field kitchens to cook hot meals for thousands of them at a time.
But when he looked into buying that number of new kitchens, Mr. Addis said he quickly found that the cost was steep and that new kitchens would take six to eight weeks to get to Albania.
He alerted Mr. Spitzfaden of Tri-Med of the problem, and the procurement company found a surplus dealer that had 22 used NATO field kitchens. Catholic Relief Service bought the kitchens, utensils included, for $9,000 each and shipped them immediately to Albania.
Whatever Tri-Med's markup was, Mr. Addis figures he got a deal. It would have cost him $1 million, about five times what he paid, to buy 22 new kitchens.
"I feel we got a good price," he said.

HEADLINE: GAME THEORY;
New York City on Screen: Love It or Fix It

BYLINE: By J. C. Herz; E-mail address: Herz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY begs for simulation. It has been simulated in movies, books, paintings and avant-garde classical music, not to mention prime-time television. Inevitably, it has been assembled in digital media.
But just as there are different visions of the Big Apple on celluloid, there are different visions of New York in ones and zeros. 
 One vision is Sim City 3000, the latest installment in the best-selling line of virtual metropolis construction kits. Like its predecessors, Sim City 3000 puts you in the mayor's office of an urban hub, with all the attendant responsibilities: roads, power lines, water usage, zoning, public transportation, environmental policy, education, finance, garbage disposal, traffic, unemployment, law enforcement and public approval ratings. Build wisely, and your citizens will thrive.
It's an urban planning exercise with good production values. There are multiple levels of resolution, so you can zoom into different neighborhoods and see commercial zones filled with Lilliputian business people, industrial zones speckled with hard-hat workers and tiny firefighters loitering outside their stations. Downtown you'll hear traffic. In residential neighborhoods, you may hear birds chirping and children playing.
But where previous Sim City titles simulated a generic urban environment, this one allows you to create the Sim City That Never Sleeps. Not only can you build on a ready-made terrain that mirrors the contours of Manhattan, but there are also little landmarks to plant on the map: Grand Central Terminal, Lincoln Center, the United Nations, Rockefeller Center and the Statue of Liberty.
If you want to include the Chrysler Building and the Guggenheim, you can download them from the Web site (www.simcity.com), which recently posted a "Build Manhattan" contest for Sim City users.
Would-be Donald Trumps took considerable license. There was Trihattan, a fanciful version of the city with three downtowns, and Alotta-Opolis, which incorporates artificial lakes, a wheat field and a moat surrounding the American Museum of Natural History.
One contestant asked the judges to "imagine N.Y. with San Francisco's TransAmerica tower, Houston's 700 Louisiana building, Hong Kong's Bank of China tower and the Arc de Triomphe in a relocated Central Park."
Other players used landmarks from outside New York as place holders for buildings that aren't available. "Trump Tower is represented by Columbia Seafirst Center, and the Citicorp Building is the 700 Louisiana," explained Gergory Jungenberg, a resident of Long Island City, N.Y. "Flatiron Building is the Bank of America. Riker's Island has Alcatraz representing the prison there. Everything in this city is meticulously accurate."
Of course, it isn't. There is no Times Square. The subways are wrong; they are much better than ours. There's a badly needed second line on the East Side and plenty of crosstown trains, for which we all yearn. There are also palm trees and an inexplicable geyser in Central Park.
But when you start to examine these model Manhattans block by block, as a resident, you're looking for another kind of simulation. You're not interested in the city-as-mechanism, with all moving parts in order. You want to see the city as a mirror of your memory, as a simulation of your personal experience.
For that sort of simulation, you would do better to examine City ROM, an annotated digital map of New York published by the Small Blue Planet Atlas Company. Like Sim City, City ROM allows you to zoom into an aerial view of the city. But unlike the computer game, City ROM's images are photographic, taken from satellite data. You are not able to construct and demolish generic buildings. But you are able to learn about real ones.
Map pointers correspond to images from the photo gallery, which are linked to text explanations:
"St. Paul's Chapel. Open 9 A.M.-3 P.M. Mon-Fri, 7 A.M.-3P.M. Sunday. This is where George Washington went immediately after his inauguration as the first President of the United States to kneel and pray for the union."
"Chinatown mushroom market, Grand at Elizabeth."
"Andy Warhol's loft. This loft/studio was owned for many years by Andy Warhol. Jean-Michel Basquiat, a famous 1980's painter/poet/graffiti artist and close fiend of Warhol's, rented the loft before and after Warhol's death. On Aug. 12, 1988, Basquiat was found dead inside from a drug overdose."
All these places have addresses listed. In many cases, the phone numbers are listed as well. You can print maps showing how to get there. You can print the photos. Or you can add your own photos and your own notes, which become another set of color-coded markers on the map.
Within a few months, you'll be able to swap these cartographic scrapbooks on City ROM's Web site (www.cityromatlas.com) and show the world your New York, or see the city through the lens of someone else's experience. In the real city, you can retrace someone's steps. Or know that they might be retracing yours, although there's no way to ascertain whether any route is fact or fiction. And like the eccentric tour guide in Bennett Miller's film "The Cruise," we are at liberty to use both. In the simulated city, any story is worthwhile.
Both City ROM and Sim City use overlays as a graphic device. In Sim City you can view water pipes, population density, land values, crime rates, transportation systems, flora or any combination of these elements. In City ROM, you can choose to display the map markers for museums, theaters, restaurants, libraries or your all-time greatest dates. Both sets of overlays are highly specific. But they reveal different sorts of truth: the mechanical truth of a city versus the narrative truth.
It's the difference between a model and a map. A model tells you that tab A goes into slot B. A map tells you that there be dragons here.
The former is theory. The latter is memory. Both are imperfect and incomplete, and that's why they are compelling. They beg us to tinker, to investigate or to tell stories -- even if they're not true. So that afterward we can say, "This is my city because I built it." Or, "This is my city because I've walked it." Or, "This is my city because I made it up."
When you build something, or discover something or invent something, it belongs to you. And who wouldn't lay claim to a few megabytes of the Big Apple?

HEADLINE: When Collection Software Runs, Debtors Can't Hide

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
WITH Americans taking on more and more debt, high-tech collection tactics are making it easier to find debtors and encourage them to pay up. Or else.
Debt-collection software with names like the Sting, Optimizer and Determinator help collection agencies find elusive debtors, phone them and make a plan for them to pay off what they owe. Programs using artificial intelligence can gauge the likelihood that a debtor will pay up, and they can match debtors with collectors who fit their style. 
 "When you're talking about the customary ways of thinking about how people buy and sell things with credit, the old paradigms are being outstripped by new technology," said Ronald Griffin, a law professor who teaches a debtor-creditor relations course at Washburn University in Kansas.
As of February, American consumers had amassed $1.3 trillion in outstanding installment debt, up 7 percent from the previous year, according to the Federal Reserve. In 1997, the most recent year for which data are available, debt totaling $247.4 billion was sent to collection agencies, which recovered $32.2 billion that year, according to the American Collectors Association, a 3,600-member trade group based in Minneapolis.
Modern debt collectors look back with some nostalgia at the days when they worked from 4-by-6-inch index cards in shoeboxes. Now computers dig through proprietary databases, find and dial numbers, determine when debtors are most likely to be home, improve the efficiency of telephone collection centers, calculate how risky a holder of a credit card or mortgage is and generate letters and scripts for phone calls. With some of these applications running, you can't hide.
Debt collection agencies rely on the sale of bad debt. After a bill is overdue for a certain length of time, credit card companies and other creditors often sell the debt for pennies on the dollar to agencies, which are allowed to keep anything they can extract from the debtor. It's worth it for the creditor, which can at least collect something on debt that would have been a total loss otherwise, and it's worth it for the collection agency, which is more skilled and experienced than Visa and Chase Manhattan in the art of mining deadbeat accounts.
Sometimes the collector's first step is to find where to find the debtors -- or customers, as they are called at one agency, Exterra Private Recovery in Walnut Creek, Calif. ("We don't allow the D word here," said Barbara Price, the company's co-founder and executive vice president.) Banks and other credit providers want to keep customers by having collectors work out a payment plan -- courteously.
Computer terminals from far-flung locations can tap into the system, so some collection agents can work from home. That is a boon to at-home parents, handicapped workers and agencies hungry for skilled workers.
One star account manager, Priscilla Corley, has been with Exterra since it opened in 1997. Using databases and software made by Rothenberg Systems International, Ms. Corley finds people with bad debt by tracing them through other creditors listed in their credit reports, who might know the customers' whereabouts. The agency also uses a variety of other directories and databases.
ON a recent Wednesday, Ms. Corley was on the phone while studying her computer screen, narrowing in on a lead. She got the caretaker of the debtor's mother to give her the phone number of a close relative of the debtor. Ms. Corley, who recently won a lease for a 1999 Cadillac from Exterra for her productivity, handed the number over to her partner, Marla McCown, to follow up. Ms. McCown's wall is covered with 10 overnight mail envelopes, marked with the dollar amounts of the payments that arrived in them.
Then a manager announced the amounts collected during the morning. Everyone stood and waved plastic noisemakers that are shaped like hands, creating a clackety applause. Managers want to keep the job interesting, in a field where annual turnover rates of 40 percent to 80 percent are common. It can be frustrating for callers to find debtors and put up with verbal abuse.
Once debtors have been found, collectors try to get in touch with them by phone or through the mail or through neighbors.
Dialing software places the calls, and if a person answers, the machine passes the person along to an available collector. That saves the collector the trouble of dialing or dealing with busy signals or answering machines. The dialing software that automates this task includes programs like the Optimizer, by Centerforce Technologies.
The dialers' software is called predictive because it has a strategy. "The odds are, if you're not there Monday at 9 A.M., then you won't be on Tuesday or Wednesday at 9 so the machine will try again at noon, in the afternoon and the next day in the evening," said Jon Mazzoli, senior vice president at Outsourcing Solutions, a collection agency in Chesterfield, Mo., that tries to track down 10 million debtors a year.
Outsourcing Solutions' technology can predict when a collector will finish a call, dialing the next call so the collector can go straight to the new debtor without losing any time. (This is the same technological advance that brings you those hang-up calls at supper time from telephone solicitors.)
In half the debt-collection and sales offices with predictive dialers, collectors have been able to triple the time they spend on the phone talking to people, to 45 minutes an hour from 15 minutes, said Tom Buiel, the vice president for domestic sales at Melita International, a telecommunications software company in Norcross, Ga.
Many collectors use a computer scoring system to figure out the likelihood that a bad debt will be paid. Some programs use artificial intelligence, so they "learn" from and incorporate earlier collection results.
"We typically look at several hundred characteristics, 300 or 400 or 500 characteristics, for an individual," said Bernhard Nann, president and co-founder of Narex, in Lakewood, Colo., a company that was set up in 1995 to develop debt collection programs that use artificial intelligence. Based on information about the debtor -- like the size of the person's previous debts and how quickly they were repaid -- the company determines which kinds of letters and calls the person should receive. Or it decides that the debt is "self-curing," something that will be paid without a reminder. The results are plugged back into the system to help the software make future calculations.
The computer screens that collectors see can also help direct their work. In Sweden, one program puts a face with a smile or a frown on the account on the screen, which tells collectors what tone of voice to use with the debtor, said Susan Magrino, vice president of Rothenberg Systems International. And Magellan software provides scripts that tell collectors which questions to ask after gathering each bit of information.
"The machine does the thinking, so the agent doesn't have to," said Diane Katzaman, a senior product marketing manager at Melita, which created Magellan.
Software can also rate consumers' creditworthiness. The Fair, Isaac Company, a credit scoring company in San Rafael, Calif., that was founded in 1956, was one of the first to take many factors into account to come up with a credit score. While many consumers complain about the rigidity of such scores, some in the debt collection industry say the scores are fair because they disregard race, sex, religion and birthplace, focusing more on credit histories.
"Machines are absolutely dead fair," said Ted Crooks, executive director of the scientific staff at HNC Software, which creates debt scoring programs. "They don't know what color you are or anything about you -- they just know the data and the account history, and that people with data like yours had this kind of outcome."
Technology like this will benefit all of society, said Vijay S. Mookerjee, an associate professor of information systems at the University of Washington Business School. For small-scale lending, "it is just not cost-effective for the bank or lending agency to use human capabilities to do that when you can really boil it down and optimize the profile and do it automatically," he said.
So do all of these innovations result in the collection of more money? The results are mixed. Recovery rates at consumer collection companies reached a four-year high in 1997, according to Credit Collections News and the Credit Collections Directory, with an average recovery rate of 24.5 percent among the 300 agencies surveyed. But the American Collectors Association traced a decline in the percentage of debt that was collected by about 300 agencies, to 13 percent in 1997 from 22 percent in 1995.
Collecting debt may be easier now because the careful screening and scoring of people applying for credit means that bill payers are more likely to be reliable. The strong economy also makes it easier to collect debts. And because creditors almost always regard fresher debts as easier to collect, some creditors are placing their overdue accounts with collection agencies sooner than they used to.
But some creditors are waiting longer before turning to collection agencies. Now that more high-tech collection tools are widely available, a creditor will often try to use them first, before selling debts to an agency. Skimming the cream off their debts, many banks and credit card companies are dealing with the fresher, more easily collectible debts themselves, leaving the harder, older ones for the agencies. "They're being asked to do more and more for their clients at less and less of a rate," said Toni Nuernberg, chief operating officer of the American Collectors Association.
They're asked to be more efficient and, yes, nicer than they used to be. As Ms. McCown sifted through the form letters she can send from Exterra -- the Demand letter, the Broken Promise letter, the Broken Promise on Settlement letter -- she explained her philosophy of working with her "customers": "Just be nice, and give them the opposite from what they're giving you."
 
Zeroing In
Digital Strategy for Sorting Through Shifting Identities
ONE high-tech computer aid for tracking people down, often useful for debt collectors, is made by Infoglide, a company that has figured out ways to find some people who regularly change their identities.
"We know what clever criminals do," said Jay Valentine, chief executive of Infoglide, in Austin, Tex. "They don't choose 123-45-6789 if they're making up a Social Security number. We can find similarities with the numbers they use, subtle similarities, and can put together tremendously strong correlations to show that they're the same person, trying to get credit as a new person, even though they're a deadbeat on their other credit files. And we can create a profile, asking, Is this person likely to respond to us calling them? Or to a threat? Or a subpoena?"
Infoglide's Fraud Investigator software, which is powered by the company's Similarity Search Engine, is used by three of the largest credit bureaus in the country, the company said. It can help determine similarities in delinquent accounts under different names.
For example, if you need contact information for a debtor in a large database of accounts receivable, you can enter the person's full name into the search engine and it will present a list of possible matches, ranked according to how likely it is that the entry is for that person. The company gives on-line examples of how this works in two scenarios (www .infoglide.com/pages/thumbdemo.htm).
While the software is often used by debt collectors, it is also used by people investigating things like insurance fraud and other criminal cases. The company gives an example of what might be turned up by such an investigation: "You notice that the names seem similar. Could this be the same individual with his name accidentally mistyped or intentionally altered? You notice that the first and last names in the similar claim are switched while the middle name remains the same. Also, the address is slightly different. The street number has two transposed digits, 2506 versus 2605. There is a different apartment number and the ZIP code has 30 in one listing and 03 in the other. With these similarities in the data, you suspect that this similar claim is for the same individual."
Credit investigators can look through a variety of databases for a debtor's name or a close approximation of it, or information like a Social Security number or address. Thus records for James Stevens, Jim Stephens and JK Stevns can appear together, and if there are matches among their addresses or Social Security numbers, the likelihood that the references are all for the same person is considered high.
Infoglide was founded by David Wheeler, a computer scientist who developed the search techniques for finding criminals after the 1981 murder of his father went unsolved.
The same technology has been used to crack insurance fraud rings and to hunt down criminals on the lam. "Even a slight name change, like W. J. Davis and Billy Dhaves, will make someone invisible to most computer systems," Mr. Valentine said. "The average person who is a skipper will modify his or her name six times." TINA KELLEY

No Frank Capra Here, Or Jonathan Edwards

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

HOME TOWN
By Tracy Kidder
349 pages. Random House. $25.95.
At first you think that Tracy Kidder's new book, "Home Town," is going to present an idyllic profile of Northampton, Mass., one consistent with the author's opening view of it from nearby Mount Holyoke: "From the summit, the cornfields are a dream of perfect order, and the town seems entirely coherent, self-contained, a place where a person might live a whole life and consider it complete, a tiny civilization all its own. Forget the messiness of years and days -- every work of human artifice has a proper viewing distance. The town below fits in the palm of your hand. Shake it and it snows." 
 Moving closer, Mr. Kidder's focus tightens on the life of Tommy O'Connor, whose happy childhood as a Northampton townie suggests Frank Capra's film "It's a Wonderful Life," without the hero's frustration and sense of being stuck.
Tommy has grown up to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a policeman. (On the wall inside the closet of the room he grew up in is written in crayon "Tom O'Connor September 29, 1972 / I want to be a policeman / I am in sixth grade.") The town he works in is not just the site of prestigious Smith College but also a successful experiment in urban restoration whose heart is a mix of Woodstock Nation and Main Street, where some 40 restaurants thrive and kids feel free to display their hair dyed the more unlikely colors of the rainbow.
But as Tommy drives his rounds you begin to sense an atmosphere less like a Capra film and more like something by Stephen King. Tommy knows that in the festive downtown crowds are dealers pushing crack cocaine. Crises in which he frequently has to intervene involve drunken or addicted former high school mates.
Within three chapters, Tommy is approached by a somber Rick Janacek, not only a fellow cop but also Tommy's childhood neighbor and best friend. Rick confides that as well as having a severe problem with alcohol he has been barred by his wife from contacting her or their children. The restraining order has accused Rick of sexually abusing one of his daughters.
"The only way anything could have happened with me is if I was in a blackout," Rick says, an admission that Tommy knows from experience is usually a sign of guilt. Having heard Rick confess as much, Tommy feels he will have to report the conversation to the District Attorney's office.
Rick Janacek is the first of four major close-ups of Northampton citizens that Mr. Kidder presents against the background of the town's daily life and history. The others are an odd assortment. There is Alan Scheinman, an erstwhile real estate entrepreneur who suffers so severely from obsessive-compulsive disorder that he has to keep his hands wrapped in plastic and can't remove the garbage from his apartment. There is Francisco (Frankie) Sandoval, alias Samson Rodriguez, a crack cocaine addict and dealer who works as a snitch for Tommy. Finally there is Laura Baumeister, a mother on welfare who has won a scholarship to Smith but doubts that she can handle the class work.
Even Tommy turns out not to be so pleased with his life. Although he loves his hometown and has won promotions and prizes for his superlative police work, he is frustrated by the lack of a child in his happy marriage and feels too often that his career has come to "a dead halt." What is Mr. Kidder trying to do with this gallery of misfits? For the reader their histories are a mixed experience. Sandoval's is edifying, telling you a lot about life in the underclass. Baumeister's is inspiring; she masters her class work and ends up in love with "Paradise Lost." Scheinman's is fascinating at first but gets to be a bit of a bore; he more or less cures himself of his obsessive-compulsiveness but he spews a fair amount of psychobabble in describing the process. As for Tommy, although he is no misfit, his solution to his discontents is cheering.
But what is Mr. Kidder's point in offering such a lopsided profile of Northampton? Apparently it is to illustrate how the tolerance and cohesiveness of his town embraces all extremes. After all, he reminds you in one excursion into the past, this is the town that eventually threw out Jonathan Edwards, author of the sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" and arbiter of Northampton's morals.
Celebrating the place's diversity, Mr. Kidder writes: "The town has American Legion baseball and contra dancing, a small Buddhist church and a very active Elks club, homes that cost $400,000 and many boardinghouses and halfway houses. Somehow it works. Northampton is the kind of place where a professor, a potter, unemployed musician, former mental patient, a woman with a handsome alimony, can all be found on Sunday mornings sitting near one another at sidewalk tables outside the coffee shops. Somehow -- is it the sum of unconcerted efforts? -- a cohesive property seems to bind the place, as if it were a liquid held by surface tension." In an interview describing his experience in getting to know Northampton, Mr. Kidder has said: "The picture that I'd held in my mind began, not to fall apart, but to fragment, the way a pointillist painting turns into a bunch of small dots if you move too close to it -- except that the dots in this case were in themselves interesting, and sometimes appalling."
What his book succeeds in doing is bring the dots together again. The picture they form is far from pretty, but it certainly coheres. Shake it and it weeps.

HEADLINE: Key to Deal for Mediaone: Keeping the Losing Bidder Happy

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
Last Sunday afternoon, Brian Roberts, the president of Comcast, was resting at his home near Philadelphia after an exhausting week of negotiations. He had reason to be tired. After making a costly $53 billion stock bid for Mediaone Group, the nation's fourth-largest cable operator, a month earlier, Comcast found itself trumped by AT&T, which had muscled in with a $58 billion stock and cash offer.
Comcast had sought help from Microsoft the previous week, hoping the software giant would dig into its $22 billion cash coffer to aid the company in its bid. But even as Microsoft's chief financial officer, Gregory Maffei, met that week with Comcast at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell, Microsoft's law firm, the Comcast team knew that Microsoft representatives were simultaneously meeting with its rival, AT&T, indicating that Microsoft might only be using the talks with Comcast as leverage in the AT&T negotiations. 
 Without support from Microsoft or America Online, another potential ally, Comcast had little chance of winning. But AT&T executives also knew it was wiser to strike a friendly deal with the cable operator with which it hoped to do business with in the future.
That thinking set the stage for what was to be a conciliatory call from an AT&T executive to Mr. Roberts that ultimately led to Tuesday's settlement -- widely hailed as a savvy resolution for both parties. AT&T, which already owns Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's second-largest cable company, gets Mediaone. But Comcast too walks away with a prize: it acquires two million cable subscribers outright and gets to manage franchises serving more than two million more.
Why was AT&T, eager to be the industry's Goliath, willing to give up control of more than four million subscribers? Company executives did not talk publicly yesterday, but one person involved in the talks noted that it would behoove AT&T -- which is trying to offer local telephone service through alliances with cable companies -- not to alienate Comcast. "Having Comcast, which controls six million homes, or 10 percent of the cable industry, as an avowed enemy for life was not smart," said the participant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Certainly, there was still the potential for Comcast to drum up support from other quarters and escalate the bidding war. But the recent settlement puts an end to the specter of another round of bids.
AT&T is planning to offer local telephone service on Tele-Communications' cable lines and is working on a deal with Time Warner. Adding Comcast's subscribers to that overarching plan would be another coup. An agreement to offer Comcast subscribers telephone service was part of the settlement.
Referring to the role played by AT&T's chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, an investment banker involved in the negotiations who requested anonymity said: "Mike was smart enough to rise above the occasion and get the deal done in a way that everybody could go home with dignity. In a fast-changing industry, he managed to keep relationships with Comcast that insured they would work together in the future."
That is not always the case. Viacom's Sumner M. Redstone and QVC's then-chairman, Barry Diller, battled for months in 1993 over Paramount Communications. Each side continued to raise its price far beyond what then appeared economically feasible, forcing the ultimate winner, Viacom, to pay far more than Mr. Redstone had initially intended. Moreover, Mr. Redstone and Mr. Diller remained bitter to one another for at least a year after the battle ended.
And after British Telecommunications lost the battle for MCI to Worldcom, British Telecom immediately entered into a relationship with AT&T that some observers said was aimed at damaging MCI Worldcom.
One reason AT&T and Comcast may have avoided friction is that much of the negotiating was done directly between top level corporate executives who are seasoned deal makers in their own right.
On Sunday, Mr. Roberts got a call from Leo Hindery, the president and chief executive of AT&T Broadband and Internet Services, who had been a chief deal maker for Tele-Communications before it was acquired by AT&T last year. "The question he raised was how to make it a 'win win' for both sides," one person involved in the negotiations recalled. The pair talked in earnest about a plan that had actually been kicking around for a while that would let Comcast buy or gain control of more AT&T cable subscribers.
That concept had been around for weeks and last Friday, as it became clear that Mediaone was poised to accept the AT&T bid, preliminary discussions began, according to two people involved in the talks. Comcast and AT&T executives had been leery of talking directly because AT&T's offer for Mediaone dictated that neither could have discussions with any other potential bidders.
But by Friday night, according to one participant in the negotiations, a decision had been made that because Mediaone had already singed confidentiality agreements with America Online and Microsoft, the standstill provision was no longer in effect, and preliminary talks between AT&T and Comcast had started. (An AT&T representative denied that there were any settlement talks before Sunday.)
In deals, politics count. And no one wants to be rebuffed. So before Mr. Hindery actually picked up the phone to call Mr. Roberts, representatives from AT&T's banker, Goldman, Sachs, called one of Comcast's bankers, Lazard Freres. (Comcast is also represented by Salomon Smith Barney.) Lazard, in turn, called Mr. Roberts to say that Mr. Hindery would be phoning, according to people close to the negotiations.
And so the talks began. By 8 A.M. Monday both Mr. Hindery and Mr. Roberts and their teams were at the New York offices of AT&T's law firm, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, hammering out what was to become the final settlement between the warring sides. Comcast would get two million more subscribers for $9 billion, and management over two million more cable homes, helping it accomplish its initial goal of getting bigger. AT&T would acquire Mediaone. The two sides also agreed to a crucial goal of AT&T: to offer telephone service over Comcast's cable wires.
But even as Comcast was finishing up the terms of its deal with AT&T, reports that MCI Worldcom was interested in joining the battle for Mediaone began making their way on Wall Street. The news did little to sway the parties, but did quicken the pace of the discussions, one person said. Daniel Somers, chief financial officer for AT&T, in particular, did not take the MCI Worldcom threat seriously but still wanted a quick end.
"Time was ticking," said one person involved in the talks.

HEADLINE: Teaching Hospitals Battle Medicare-Money Cuts

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 5

 BODY:
Normally, the great teaching hospitals of this medical Mecca carry an air of white-coated, best-in-the-world arrogance, the kind of arrogance that comes of collecting Nobels, of snaring more Federal money for medical research than hospitals anywhere else, of attracting patients from the four corners of the earth.
But not lately. Lately, their chief executives carry an air of pleading and alarm. They tend to cross the edges of their palms in an X that symbolizes the crossing of rising costs and dropping payments, especially Medicare payments. And to say they simply cannot go on losing money this way and remain the academic cream of American medicine. 
 Dr. Mitchell T. Rabkin, chief executive emeritus of Beth Israel Hospital, says, "Everyone's in deep yogurt."
The teaching hospitals here and elsewhere have never been immune from the turbulent change sweeping American health care -- from the expansion of managed care to spiraling drug prices to the fierce fights for survival and shotgun marriages between hospitals with empty beds and flabby management.
But they are contending that suddenly, in recent weeks, a Federal cutback in Medicare spending has begun putting such a financial squeeze on them that it threatens their ability to fulfill their special missions: to handle the sickest patients, to act as incubators for new cures, to treat poor people and to train budding doctors.
The budget hemorrhaging has hit at scattered teaching hospitals across the country, from San Francisco to Philadelphia. New York's clusters of teaching hospitals are among the biggest and hardest hit, the Greater New York Hospital Association says. It predicts that Medicare cuts will cost the state's hospitals $5 billion through 2002 and force the closing of money-losing departments and whole hospitals.
Dr. Samuel O. Thier, president of the group that owns Massachusetts General Hospital, says, "We've got a problem, and you've got to nip it in the bud, or else you're going to kill off some of the premier institutions in the country."
Here in Boston, with its unusual concentration of academic medicine and its teaching hospitals affiliated with the medical schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston Universities, the cuts are already taking a toll in hundreds of eliminated jobs and pockets of miserable morale.
Five of Boston's top eight private employers are teaching hospitals, Mayor Thomas M. Menino notes. And if five-year Medicare cuts totaling an estimated $1.7 billion for Massachusetts hospitals continue, Mayor Menino says, "We'll have to lay off thousands of people, and that's a big hit on the city of Boston."
Often, analysts say, hospital cutbacks, closings and mergers make good economic sense, and some dislocation and pain are only to be expected. Some critics also say the hospitals are partly at fault.
"A lot of teaching hospitals have engaged in what might be called self-sanctification -- 'We're the greatest hospitals in the world and no one can do it better or for less' -- and that may or may not be true," said Alan Sager, a health-care finance expert at the Boston University School of Public Health.
But the hospital chiefs argue that they have virtually no fat left to cut, and warn that their financial problems may mean that the smartest edge of American medicine will get dumbed down.
With that message, they have been lobbying Congress in recent weeks to reconsider the cuts that they say have turned their financial straits from tough to intolerable.
"Five years from now, the American people will wake up and find their clinical research is second rate because the big teaching hospitals are reeling financially," said Dr. David G. Nathan, president of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute here.
In a half-dozen interviews, around the Boston medical-industrial complex known as the Longwood Medical Center and Academic Area and elsewhere, hospital executives who normally compete and squabble all espoused one central idea: teaching hospitals are special, and that specialness costs money.
Take the example of treating heart-disease patients, said Dr. Michael F. Collins, president and chief executive of Caritas Christi Health Care System, a seven-hospital group affiliated with Tufts.
In 1988, Dr. Collins said, it was still experimental for doctors to open blocked arteries by passing tiny balloons though them; now, they have a bouquet of expensive new options for those patients, including springlike devices called stents that cost $900 to $1,850 each; tiny rotobladers that can cost up to $1,500, and costly drugs to supplement the reaming that cost nearly $1,400 a patient.
"A lot of our scientists are doing research on which are the best catheters and which are the best stents," Dr. Collins said. "And because they're giving the papers on the drug, they're using the drug the day it's approved to be used. Right now it's costing us about $50,000 a month and we're not getting a nickel for it, because our case rates are fixed."
Hospital chiefs and doctors also argue that a teaching hospital and its affiliated university are a delicate ecosystem whose production of critical research is at risk.
"The grand institutions in Boston that are venerated are characterized by a wildflower approach to invention and the generation of new knowledge," said Dr. James Reinertsen, the chief executive of Caregroup, which owns Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. "We don't run our institutions like agribusiness, a massively efficient operation where we direct research and harvest it. It's unplanned to a great extent, and that chaotic fermenting environment is part of what makes the academic health centers what they are."
"There wouldn't have been a plan to do what Judah Folkman has done over the last 20 years," Dr. Reinertsen said of the doctor-scientist at Children's Hospital in Boston who has developed a promising approach to curing cancer.
Federal financing for research is plentiful of late, hospital heads acknowledge. But they point out that the Government expects hospitals to subsidize 10 percent or 15 percent of that research, and that they must provide support for researchers still too junior to win grants.
A similar argument for slack in the system comes in connection with teaching. Teaching hospitals are pressing their faculties to take on more patients to bring in more money, said Dr. Daniel D. Federman, dean for medical education of Harvard Medical School. A doctor under pressure to spend time in a billable way, Dr. Federman said, has less time to spend teaching.
The Boston hospitals' plight may be partly their fault for competing so hard with each other, driving down prices, some analysts say. Though some hospitals have merged in recent years, Boston is still seen as having too many beds, and virtually all hospitals are teaching hospitals .
Whatever the causes, said Dr. Stuart Altman, professor of national health policy at Brandeis University and past chairman for 12 years of the committee that advised the Government on Medicare prices, "the concern is very real."
"What's happened to them is that all of the cards have fallen the wrong way at the same time," Dr. Altman said. "I believe their screams of woe are legitimate."
Among the cards that fell wrong, begin with managed care. Massachusetts has an unusually large quotient of patients in managed-care plans. Managed-care companies, themselves strapped, have gotten tougher about how much they will pay.
Add to the troubles some complaints that affect all hospitals: expenses to prepare their computers for 2000, problems getting insurance companies and the Government to pay up, and new efforts to defend against accusations of billing fraud.
But the back-breaking straw, hospital chiefs say, came with Medicare cuts, enacted under the 1997 balanced-budget law, that will cut more each year through 2002. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that by then the losses for teaching hospitals could reach $14.7 billion, and that major teaching hospitals will lose about about $150 million each. Nearly 100 teaching hospitals are expected to be running in the red by then, the association says.
For years, teaching hospitals have been more dependent than any others on Medicare. Unlike some other payers, Medicare has compensated them for their special missions -- training, sicker patients, indigent care -- by paying them extra.
For reasons yet to be determined, Dr. Altman and others say the Medicare cuts seem to be taking an even greater toll on the teaching hospitals than had been expected. Much has changed since the 1996 numbers on which the cuts are based, hospital chiefs say; and the cuts particularly singled out teaching hospitals, whose profit margins used to look fat.
Frightening the hospitals still further, President Clinton's next budget proposes even more Medicare cuts.
Not everyone sympathizes, though. Complaints from hospitals that financial pinching hurts have become familiar refrains over recent years, gaining them a reputation for crying wolf. Critics say the Boston hospitals are whining for more money when the only real fix is broad health-care reform.
Some propose that the rational solution is to analyze which aspects of the teaching hospitals' work society is willing to pay for, and then abandon the Byzantine Medicare cross-subsidies and pay for them straight out, perhaps through a new tax.
Others question the numbers.
Whenever hospitals face cuts, Alan Sager of Boston University said, "they claim it will be teaching and research and free care of the uninsured that are cut first."
If the hospitals want more money, Mr. Sager argued, they should allow in independent auditors to check their books rather than asking Congress to rely on a "scream test."
For many doctors at the teaching hospitals, however, the screaming is meant to save their institutions from becoming ordinary.
Medical care is an applied science, said Dr. Allan Ropper, chief of neurology at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and strong teaching hospitals, with their cadres of doctors willing to spend often-unreimbursed time on teaching and research, are essential to helping move it forward.
"There's no getting away from a patient and their illness," Dr. Ropper said, "but if all you do is fix the watch, nobody ever builds a better watch. It's a very subtle thing, but precisely because it's so subtle, it's very easy to disrupt."

How Vouchers Can Help Ease Overcrowding

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IN his self-described crusade to "rescue the children," the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson visited a public high school in Brooklyn on Tuesday and was appalled to find its 1,100 students had only 2 computers with Internet access. But he was just as appalled at the idea of letting any students escape to a better school.
"We might save some," he said in decrying Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to give students taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools. "But what about those left behind?" 
 As it happens, this week there is a simple answer to his question: the ones left behind could finally afford computers. That sounds paradoxical, because vouchers are routinely criticized for "diverting resources" from public schools. But vouchers can free more money for the students left behind, and the computer shortage noticed by Mr. Jackson is an example of how all students could benefit from vouchers.
As of last week, New York's school officials planned to install computers and Internet connections in every classroom from fourth grade through high school. But the latest outline of the capital plan, which the Board of Education is expected to approve today, eliminates all those computers, according to Lewis H. Spence, the Deputy Chancellor for Operations.
The overcrowded system is desperate for funds to build new schools, and the elimination of the computers frees $1 billion to pay for 20,000 new seats.
Suppose, though, that the school system used a different technique to relieve overcrowding. Instead of adding 20,000 new seats, it could free up space by providing vouchers for 20,000 low-income students to attend private schools. Instead of spending some $50,000 to build each new seat, it could spend zero, and the savings in the capital budget could be used to put computers in all the existing classrooms.
Besides the savings in the capital budget, the school system would be spared the operating expenses associated with the 20,000 students. Those expenses, like teachers' salaries and building maintenance, average more than $6,000 per student. So the public system could break even by giving each student a voucher of that amount, and turn a profit if the voucher were for less.
"From an accounting standpoint, public school districts should be happy with vouchers," said Caroline Hoxby, a professor of economics at Harvard University.
"Most voucher programs tried so far give the students much less money than the public district was spending on them, so the district comes out ahead when a student leaves. The savings can be very substantial when the vouchers are used to avoid the high marginal costs of adding seats in new schools."
THESE advantages have been appreciated in a few places, including Houston, where the public school district has relieved overcrowding by paying for some students to attend private schools. But Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew is one of the many administrators opposed to even a small experiment with vouchers.
They fear all parents might eventually demand vouchers, including ones who now pay for private schools on their own. The extra burden on taxpayers, the argument goes, would impoverish public schools while subsidizing wealthy students at prep schools. But it would be simple enough to limit vouchers to families below a certain income level, and to fix the value of the vouchers so that plenty of money remained for students in the public schools.
A more challenging long-term problem would be to find enough places in private schools for all the students wanting to use vouchers. But there are already enough vacancies to start experimenting -- the parochial schools in Brooklyn and Queens have perhaps 3,000 empty seats.
Entrepreneurs have already demonstrated in other cities that private schools can be built for less than half the cost of new public schools, and without the billions in special capital subsidies now being sought by the Board of Education. As more and more students use vouchers, some private schools could buy buildings from the shrinking public system, which could use the proceeds to support the students remaining in public schools.
But no matter how much more money was available for each public school student, there would be a major political problem with a shrinking public system: fewer jobs for administrators and members of the teachers' union. Mr. Jackson said he came to rescue the children, but he probably did a lot more to help the adults.

HEADLINE: New York Hospitals Braced for Cuts

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The fiscal knife that has begun to cut into teaching hospitals in Boston and other cities has not yet had the same dire effects -- layoffs or widespread operating deficits -- in hospitals around New York State.
But hospital executives and health-care experts alike say that if the Federal cuts to Medicare are not softened, the state will lose much more than any other -- $5 billion and 23,000 medical jobs -- by 2002. And they warn that those cuts, a result of the Balanced Budget Act, pose a huge economic threat to New York, which has nation's greatest concentration of medical schools and teaching hospitals and trains about 15 percent of the nation's medical residents. 
 "The carnage which is created by the Balanced Budget Act," said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group of 175 hospitals and nursing homes, "will totally disrupt the health care system in New York when it's fully implemented. It goes at the heart of the infrastructure."
The cuts, now in their second year, come at the same time as sharp increases in uninsured patients and the growing dominance of managed care, which have prompted all hospitals in the New York region to brace for what they say will be one of the most difficult fiscal years ever.
But with critics complaining that New York still has too many hospital beds and administrative fat that should be trimmed, those who run the prestigious teaching hospitals in the city find it hard to make their case that the Medicare cuts put them in real peril.
"I know this sounds like wolf, wolf, wolf because of the successes generally in the health care industry," said Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, which lost $24 million in Medicare money in fiscal 1999. "But New York teaching hospitals are in trouble."
His own hospital did $750 million in business in 1993 and ended that year with a $3 million profit margin. This year, it will do $1 billion in business and end with a $6 million margin.
"Those are supermarket margins," Dr. Foreman said, adding that the hospital has "managed to keep a razor-thin margin every year by every year cutting costs and cutting again."
"But you can only cut so far before things begin to happen," he said. "The industry is touching bottom in a lot of areas, and the difference between profit and loss in this atmosphere is an eyelash. This is not the way normal billion-dollar enterprises are conducted."
Because the teaching hospitals have traditionally served a high percentage of poor patients, the threat to their future is even more important, Dr. Foreman and others said.
While he and other teaching hospital administrators avoid talking about it, the only way to keep from going into the red is to cut jobs and either shrink or close money-losing departments.
"The so-called low-hanging fruit has all been picked," said Dr. David B. Skinner, the chief executive of New York Presbyterian Hospital, where every department has been asked to cut spending by 5 percent. The Greater New York Hospital Association projects that New York Presbyterian will lose more money over the course of the Balanced Budget Act than any other American hospital -- about $320 million.
Dr. Skinner said that as the hospital plans its year 2000 budget "we're going to have to look very closely at staffing ratios."
"Something's got to give here," he said. "You then look at where can you downsize departments that are losing money. And we're looking at that now. I don't want to say which ones because I don't want to unnecessarily panic the troops."

HEADLINE: How Suburban Design Is Failing Teen-Agers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AS quickly as the word "alienation" can be attached to the idea of youth, the image of isolation can be attached to a picture of the suburbs. Is there an unexplored relationship between them? It is a question parents and urban planners alike are raising in the aftermath of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colo.
At a time when the renegade sprawl of suburbs themselves is being intensely scrutinized, the troubling vision of a nation re-pioneered in vast tracts of disconnected communities has produced uneasy discussion about the psychological disorientation they might house. 
 Created as safe havens from the sociological ills of cities, suburbs now stand accused of creating their own environmental diseases: lack of character and the grounding principles of identity, lack of diversity or the tolerance it engenders, lack of attachment to shared, civic ideals. Increasingly, the newest, largest suburbs are being criticized as landscapes scorched by unthoughtful, repetitious building, where, it has been suggested, the isolations of larger lots and a car-based culture may lead to disassociation from the reality of contact with other people.
Designers of the newest American suburbs say they have largely ignored or avoided one volatile segment of the population -- teen-agers. In recent conversations, three dozen urban planners, architects, environmental psychologists and sociologists, and experts on adolescent development agreed that specific community planning and places for teen-agers to make their own are missing.
"They're basically an unseen population until they pierce their noses," said William Morrish, a professor of architecture and the director of the Design Center for American Urban Landscape at the University of Minnesota. "They have access to computers and weaponry. The sense of alienation that might come from isolation or neglect will have a much larger impact than it might have before. And there are no questions coming from the design community about what we can be doing about this. We don't invite them in."
Virtually every other special interest has been addressed by enlightened suburban designers -- the elderly, the disabled, families with young children. But, said Andres Duany, a planner who is a leading proponent of the "new urbanism," a model of suburban design based on principles of traditional towns, "it's the teen-agers I always bring up as a question mark." Mr. Duany said that he had only once or twice included teen-agers in the public process of planning a suburban development.
"It's a good point," he said, as though it were an unlikely idea. "I should talk to the kids."
Though teen-agers tend to resist advice and choose their own turf as a territorial issue of establishing self-identity, most experts interviewed say that design could constructively anticipate and accommodate anxieties of adolescence. They agreed that teen-agers need a place to congregate in and to call their own; it is a critical aspect of relieving the awkward loneliness of adolescence. Between home and school -- spheres compromised by the presence of parents or the pressure of performance -- places for teen-agers in the suburbs are as uncommon as sidewalks.
"It's a paradoxical situation," said Ray Suarez, host of "Talk of the Nation" on National Public Radio and author of "The Old Neighborhood" (The Free Press, 1999), a study of suburban migration . "Parents move there for their children; their children are dying to get out."
Like much of the Western United States, Denver is experiencing vertiginous suburban growth. From 1990 to 1996, the metropolitan area expanded by two-thirds, to its current size of 535 square miles.
"Typical of the Denver metro area are the new suburbs, where 'downtown' is a four-way intersection with three shopping centers and a condo development," said Charles Blosten, community services director for Littleton's city planning division. Highlands Ranch, Denver's largest suburban development, has its own ZIP code, "nothing but rooftops and miles and miles of nothing," he said of the numbing vista of houses.. "It's got to affect people."
The idea that place has an impact on adolescent development and socialization is accepted by most experts on the suburbs but is only now beginning to be studied. "A culture of impersonality has developed in the suburbs by the way they're laid out," said Jonathan Barnett, a professor of regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania and author of "The Fractured Metropolis" (HarperCollins, 1996). In the newer suburbs, "the standard of houses is high, but the standard of community isn't," he continued, adding, "It's most people's impression of modern life."
And the people it stands to impress the most are children. "They are the most vulnerable people growing up there," said Dr. Jose Szapocznik, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and director of the Center for Family Studies at the University of Miami. "As a child you're disabled by not being able to walk anywhere. Nothing is nearby."
Mr. Morrish said he thought that public transportation to metropolitan downtowns was crucial for high-school students. He said that the ability to access "the system" -- the world adults create -- was a vital form of empowerment.
"What to do after school, how to get to the city, to see other people and how to negotiate this without parents," he said, posing the issues. "Teen-agers have to have better access to the public realm and public activity." He recalled a conversation with a group of high school students who met with the Design Center, which invites teen-agers to group meetings when it is commissioned to study neighborhoods.
"One girl said, 'All I've got is the Pizza Hut,' " Mr. Morrish said. " 'You go there a lot or you go to somebody's house -- we're tired of both.' "
Between home and school, in a landscape drawn by cars and the adults who drive them, is there even a particular place that teen-agers can call their own? Peter Lang, a professor of architecture at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and an editor of "Suburban Discipline" (Princeton Architectural Press, 1997), a collection of essays, said: "In most suburbs, there's not even a decent park, because everyone has a backyard. But older kids never play in the backyard. They'll find even the crummiest piece of park."
Typically, the students at Columbine High School went to Southwest Plaza, a two-level mall that has video arcades, food courts and stores, supervised by security guards and closed by 9 P.M. "Like any suburban community, there's not a lot of places to go and hang out," Mr. Blosten said of Littleton. "I tell you this because that's where my daughter goes -- the mall."
Mr. Lang said he thought that places like malls were not adequate gathering spaces for teen-agers, calling them, like many public suburban venues, commercially and environmentally "controlled space." He added, "They are not places for free expression or hanging out."
Disagreeing that suburbs create greater alienation is Dr. Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University and director of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice. But he said that he thought recent tragedies like the incident in Littleton do "wake people up to the notion that there is parental disengagement in affluent suburbs." He added: "We did a a study on latchkey kids. The kids most likely to be left unattended for long periods were middle class, in sprawling professional suburbs. Isolated for long periods of time, there's no counterbalancing force to fantasy."
The desire for more and cheaper land that has pushed suburbs to rural exurbia may result in teen-agers who are alone for large parts of the day. Mr. Morrish pointed out that in communities like Modesto, in the San Joaquin Valley in central California, people commute to jobs in the San Francisco area, where they enroll their children in schools.
"Some people in California are taking their kids with them," he said, "making the kids commute."
The planners who have been most vocally and visibly at work on restructuring the suburban model have been "new urbanists" like Mr. Duany. Their solutions to the wheeling nebulae of tract development are based on tighter concentrations of houses, businesses and public spaces connected by townlike elements -- porches, sidewalks and parks -- that have largely disappeared from the new residential landscape.
If teen-agers find their place there, in new towns like Columbia and Kentlands in Maryland or Celebration, the Disney-built town in Florida, it is not because of any bravery on the planners' part. They often foster nostalgic views of families with young children. But like conventional suburbs, they overlook the inevitability of teen-agers in their design.
Peter Katz, who with Vincent Scully wrote "The New Urbanism: Toward an Architecture of Community" (McGraw-Hill, 1993), spoke of the importance to teen-agers of a place that existed only for them, neither hidden and ignored nor exposed and supervised -- in effect, a secret place in full view.
On a visit, Mr. Katz discovered that for Celebration's teen-agers, it was a narrow bridge, "with low railings, that goes from downtown to the health club." He continued: "They find each other. They sit on the railing. It's on the route to daily life -- not a back alley, but not the town square." Mr. Katz suggested that such a structure could become a conscious part of a community design for teen-agers.
For Diane Dorney, a mother with two teen-age children who lives in Kentlands, Md., a 10-year-old "new urban" suburb of some 1,800 people, the hallmarks of town life work well for both parents and children. Ms. Dorney and her husband, Mark, moved their family from a typical town-house development.
"We wanted to raise our kids in a place that provided more than just a house," she said. "It's a diverse community, of age and income," with older people, young couples, families. Ms. Dorneye said that she thought the gaze of the town created a sense of extended family and moral weight that were its most important success.
"Someone sneaking down the street to have a cigarette -- they don't get away with it," she said. "I don't think teen-agers should be left on their own until they're caught at the small things." She continued, "When they go into the big things, they know how big they are." She added: "And we have another way of knowing these kids, other than the bad things. They're your neighbors, too. You're always seeing them. You give them another chance."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Graphic Vision: Art for People, Not Artists

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
THERE are a million stories in the naked city, but if they involve the night workers who clean the toilets and make the subways run on time, who cares?
The little drama of the aspiring comic book artist who works as a topless dancer and loses her wallet with the rent money: so what? 
 The subway worker who works the graveyard shift and finds solace in the company of rats: who wants to read about him?
But no! In a project called "The Invisible City," the stories of some of the night shift workers who make the city run, told in comic book panels, will be on placards throughout the subways until the end of the month.
Using their own computer program -- ZAP! or perhaps we should say, CLICK! -- which transforms photos to comic illustrations, two artists, Christopher J. Sperandio, who lives in Manhattan, and Simon Grennan, who lives in England, have made the workers comic heroes.
How did the artists get the idea?
Frame One: Mr. Sperandio, 35, sitting in the Manhattan office of the Public Art Fund, because he's self-conscious about the studio apartment he shares with his wife. Black T-shirt, black shirt, black sports jacket, buttoned up. (GADZOOKS! The sign of a fellow self-conscious about his weight??!!??) Hair a downtown mix of peroxide blond and brown. Box of Pepperidge Farm cookies, plateless, unadorned, real, furnished by artist, on the table. Artist will eat the most.
"I had been working as a graphic artist at one of those desks in a cubicle farm in a corporate office. I don't want to name them because I don't want to plug them."
Frame Two, noir office, the artist as drone:
"I was working from noon to 8, kind of a bridge person between the day people and the night people, and I realized that they were completely oblivious of one another, though they shared the same space. So in the morning, it would be: 'Why is the mouse pad over here?' The day person would be right-handed but the night person left-handed, and they would not know."
Frame Three, top of the artist's head.
"My hair? I had always wanted to dye it and now I've started losing it, so I've dyed it all these different colors in the last few months. I've been red, black, blond, now crazy, for a while Chromatique -- that's this bright, bright red."
There are artists who feel they must be true to their vision, the public be dashed. This has never been the case of Mr. Sperandio, raised in the town of Kingwood, W.Va., whose father worked as a lineman for the power company and whose mother worked in the unemployment office.
MR. SPERANDIO, who put himself through college with scholarships and construction work, and met Mr. Grennan while they were doing graduate work at the University of Illinois in Chicago, felt art should be relevant.
"Simon and I were very dissatisfied with the role of the artist," says Mr. Sperandio, who, while his heart is with the workers, talks about art theory till you turn bright, bright blue. "I had trouble reconciling my working-class background with the nature of contemporary art. Essentially, they're class issues, issues about the social role of the artist. Like, remember Tilted Arc, the Serra sculpture at Federal Plaza?"
(Comic book cue, Frame One: A 120-foot long, 12-foot high slab of curved steel, in lower Manhattan. Next Frame: Federal Plaza without the steel.)
"There was a lot of controversy," Mr. Sperandio continues, "and eventually it was removed. We found it to be a failure of the artist rather than the public. There was a gulf of understanding between what he was doing and the people who were trying to enjoy their lunch hour. It happened in '81, and had a big influence on Simon and me. It showed us how not to be."
A little smile.
"Some teachers felt we were very reactionary."
The projects of Mr. Sperandio and Mr. Grennan have included collaborating with chocolate workers on the design of a chocolate bar wrapping ("We're kind of known in the art world for that"), as well as a number of comic books, including "Life in Prison," for which Mr. Sperandio interviewed his brother after his brother had become "drunk as a skunk" and landed in the county jail. There are also a limited number of "Invisible City" comic books available, free, from the Public Art Fund, which paid for the project. The artists each got $2,000, which Mr. Sperandio estimates comes to about 25 cents an hour, though he professes not to care.
The people's art thing, again:
"Comics are good because so many people can get to the work." Final frames: The light is fading in the offices of the Public Art Fund. Mr. Sperandio, after saying that he keeps his distance from the New York art scene because it is "a perilous place," is explaining why it is so important to him to do good work.
"My father died the middle of my sophomore year in school. Lung cancer. He smoked all his life. I had the opportunity to visit him at the end, but I was getting my final portfolio together at school."
Next frame:
"I put off seeing him till Friday. He didn't make it to Friday. That's really the motivating factor for me. I owe it to him to work hard with my art work and make it mean something, because I sacrificed seeing him for it."
Last frame:
"You know?"

HEADLINE: The City Life;
Uptown, Across Town, Out of Town

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
On the stage, theatricality means a fullness of effect, a knowing use of all the theater's dimensions, an awareness of how the right staging can ionize the very air an audience breathes. But a city's theatricality -- who conspires to produce that? New York rises above its crowded streets, a consolidated chaos of views, and the power of its scenic accidents is so great that they look purposeful, every last one of them, until you realize that only the eye's intent unites them.
From time to time, as you cut across town on everyday business, New York's inherent theatricality seems to array itself before you with unusual economy, the grandness of the staging almost mocking the plainness of your business. You catch a morning cab to La Guardia, for instance, and instead of stiffing it out in midtown traffic, the driver bears north through Central Park on East Drive, edging upward along Madison Avenue, across 116th Street and finally onto the Triborough Bridge. In spring this is an inspired choice of routes, and the driver, gesturing at trees that will soon form a tunnel of green overhead, knows it. 
 The park, of course, is one of the places where the striving for theatricality is evident, where a single design makes the city cohere around it. After the streets of midtown, so full of ardor and self-absorption, the park feels truly public, even though most people go there to serve private ends, to walk or run or skate or perambulate the children, to lie beside a magnolia dropping its petals, to reinvigorate their sense of where they are. But the same feeling emerges in the vicinity of community gardens built on once-vacant lots in the blocks of Madison Avenue near 112th Street. Those gardens are shrines to green space, and though they organize less territory than Central Park does, they help define the theatricality of the streets that surround them, which contain so much of what is public in that neighborhood's life.
The shop windows clamor in this part of town, windows full of cakes and second-story wedding gowns, windows gilded with neon and crammed with half a store's stock, windows empty except for the relics of a former business. When the cab catches the Triborough on-ramp, the city seems to revolve beneath you until it integrates these low rooftops with the taller buildings that lie beyond them. The river runs slowly downtown past the East Side's long flank. And all this theater lies threaded along the path of a single cab ride -- the blaring chaos of midtown, the almost concupiscent pleasures of Central Park in spring, the vivid promptings and urgings of East Harlem. It seems forgivable, as you cross into Queens, to believe that it was arranged this way just for you. After all, tomorrow you will be an extra in someone else's epiphany. VERLYN KLINKENBORG

HEADLINE: Economy Gained Slightly in March and April

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Vibrant consumer spending helped keep the nation's economy expanding moderately in March and April, with little indication of rising inflation, the Federal Reserve said today.
The Fed's latest "beige book" summary of economic conditions -- which covers the period from March 8 to April 26 and will be used when Fed policy makers consider interest-rate strategy on May 18 -- also said manufacturing was picking up in most districts. 
 Analysts were heartened by the summary's report of well-contained prices, which suggested little reason for the Fed to raise interest rates soon.
"Consumer spending remains healthy, led by strong motor vehicle sales," the Fed summary said.
The Fed's nationwide survey found some manufacturers complaining about weak foreign sales. But most said business was improving, with rising demand for goods like computers, medical and telecommunications equipment and automotive supplies.
The Fed said labor markets remained tight but that a scarcity of workers was not pushing up wage demands. It said some employers were increasing nonwage compensation, even using hiring and retention bonuses to attract and keep skilled workers.
Prices for most products continued to be stable, with the notable exceptions of oil, gas and building materials, especially sheetrock, which is used in building new homes.
"The comment that prices are generally well contained certainly bodes well for the policy meeting on May 18," said Gary Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco in an interview with Reuters Television.
 Construction industries were still running at high levels for both residential and office projects, but the pace was beginning to ease in some districts, the Fed said.
Bankers reported that business was good. "The Dallas, Atlanta and Chicago districts report that lending growth was robust," the Fed summary said, and there was no sign that credit quality -- a measure of borrowers' ability to repay their loans -- was weakening.

HEADLINE: Auto Insurance Rates Declined Last Year

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Auto insurance rates declined by 2.8 percent nationwide last year, the first drop in 25 years, and could fall further in 1999, an industry group said this week. The Insurance Information Institute said that the rate decline reflected competition among insurers, more skilled drivers on the road, safer vehicles and less tolerance for drunken driving.
The institute, based in New York, said it expected a further drop of 4.5 percent this year, adding that "motorists with good driving records may see even bigger savings." 
 Despite the decline in rates, premiums rose slightly in 1998, the institute said. Robert P. Hartwig, its chief economist, said the average amount spent on auto insurance increased five-tenths of 1 percent last year, largely because of higher vehicle prices and their premiums. "New cars are more expensive than old ones and so is the insurance," he said. He added that a larger proportion of new vehicles being sold were expensive sports utility vehicles.
The institute predicted that buyers, on average, would spend $702 in auto insurance this year, down from $709 in 1998 and $706 in 1997.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Brazil's surprising rebound still has a ways to go, though things could get choppy in the near term.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
IT may appear to many investors that the sharp rebound in Brazilian stocks and bonds has passed them by. The stock market, in local terms, is up 71 percent this year and is almost back to its last peak in March 1998. Prices in the bond market have jumped, as the yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plunged. The yield on Brazil's benchmark long-term bond maturing in 2027 is down to 12.6 percent, from 16.9 percent just two months ago.
Analysts and money managers, though, say there is still much more to make on a investment in Brazil. 
 "You are betting on interest rates falling, the currency stabilizing and inflation not being a threat," said Jay Pelosky, the global emerging-markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who recommended a move back into Brazil in mid-March.
He thinks the bet will prove to be a smart one. He even thinks the Brazilian economy will surprise this year by declining much less than expected. In the last few weeks, Brazilian officials have cut their forecasts of the decline to 2 percent.
Though Mr. Pelosky thinks Brazil is a good bet in the longer term, he warns that the stock market is in a pause right now. All the good news about Brazil's unexpected escape from disaster is, as they say on Wall Street, in the market. Since reaching a high for the year of 11,529.92 on April 7, the Bovespa index of 57 Brazilian stocks has settled into a narrow trading range.
"Today you need new confirmation for Brazil to go appreciably higher," he said. With good earnings news not expected for some months and the economy still declining, that confirmation may take some time.
Another problem is Brazil's congressional investigation concerning the central bank's role in the bailout of two small investment banks earlier this year. If it gets more serious, the inquiry could distract Congress from completing important structural changes that are aimed at insuring Brazil's long-term economic health.
Mr. Pelosky also cautions American investors not to bet on a rebound in the Brazilian currency, the real, to profit from an investment there. Such a bet might look attractive. While the Bovespa has surged, in dollar terms the index is still 57 percent below its March 1998 highs.
The real declined by as much as 44 percent in value after the Government abandoned foreign-exchange controls on the currency in mid-January. But since early March it has rallied by 28 percent and is now valued at 1.683 to the dollar.
Mr. Pelosky does not think that it will rally much more in the near term because several more months are needed for foreign investors to be convinced that important benchmarks, such as the size of the Government budget deficit, are moving in the right direction. Data for April, which would give three full months of performance since the devaluation, will not be available until June. Ernest W. Brown, the chief Latin American economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts that the real will only strengthen another 3 percent by the end of the year.
Daniel Beneat, the portfolio manager of the new and tiny Dreyfus Premier Emerging Markets Fund, cut his exposure to Brazil several weeks ago because he thought that the good run since January was going to end.
"Throughout the summer we are going to have some pretty bad numbers," he said, referring to data showing that the economy is still in a decline. "The environment will not be that positive."
While he cut back in Brazil, he increased his holdings in Mexican stocks. "The earnings are very good and the valuations are very cheap there," he said. "Mexico will outperform Brazil in the coming months."
But when the economy turns, Mr. Beneat said, he will return to Brazil, picking up more of the utility and telecommunications stocks he already likes, including Tele Centro Sul Participacoes, the local telecommunications company, which has jumped 58 percent since the devaluation, and Companhia Paranaense de Energia-Copel, a large utility, which is up 32 percent.
"You have to have a view on Brazil," argued Arturo C. Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at ING Barings. But he thinks that the bond market, for now, may be a better bet. "If you are an equity investor you have to wait for earnings to come back" and that means waiting for the economy to recover, he said.
Bonds, he said, are more a bet "on a perception of risk." And with a further decline in interest rates, that risk will be lessening before the economy turns. Last week, the central bank made its fourth interest rate cut in five weeks. The benchmark rate was trimmed to 32 percent from 34 percent.
In addition, he said there was room for bond yields to fall further, when compared with history and the yields in the rest of Latin America.
According to a J. P. Morgan index that tracks the difference between Latin American yields and comparable United States Treasury securities, the spread for Brazilian debt is 8.82 percentage points, 5.98 percentage points for Argentina and 5.48 percentage points for Mexico. In addition, while the Brazilian spread has fallen from a 1999 high of 17.79 percentage points on Jan. 14, it is still more than the 6.08 percent on July 31 last year, just before Russia devalued its ruble and defaulted on its debt.
"We think this is the opportunity to buy," Mr. Porzecanski said. But he made sure to add the qualifier always invoked when discussing emerging markets -- "for the long-term investor."

A wrong turn on the road to Social Security reform.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
BIG plans to overhaul Social Security may or may not be dead in Congress this year. But regardless of what happens, Washington will eventually have to come up with a way to keep the system from running out of money when the baby boomers retire next century.
What each of the plans now on the table has in common, including the bipartisan House bill proposed yesterday, is that they all promise financial salvation through the creation of private accounts. These accounts would provide some of the retirement benefits that now come entirely from a common trust fund. Private accounts have a simple allure. Workers can expect to earn only about a 1 or 2 percent a year above inflation on the money they pay in payroll taxes to the trust fund. But they could expect to earn at least 4 percent on money they put into private accounts and invest in stocks and bonds. The difference is enough to raise retirement benefits by 50 percent. 
 It might seem obvious, then, that private accounts are stunningly better. Not so, economists say. Private accounts provide no financial benefit. Indeed, they are financial losers. There is a defense of privatization. But that defense is political.
A careful analysis by John Geanakoplos of Yale, Olivia S. Mitchell of the University of Pennsylvania and Stephen P. Zeldes of Columbia University shows that private accounts accomplish nothing on average that the trust fund couldn't accomplish more cheaply. It should be noted that Professor Mitchell comes to this result despite her outspoken advocacy of private accounts. Here's why.
Under current law, most of the money that comes into the trust fund through payroll taxes goes right back out to support current retirees. The obligation to pay current retirees continues whether or not the system is privatized. If reform did nothing more than replace a common trust fund with private accounts, there would be little financial benefit because there would be little to invest in stocks, bonds or anything else. Without new money, few dollars would ever go to the new private accounts because they would be committed to current retirees.
To make private accounts work, privatization advocates propose tapping expected Federal surpluses to pump extra money into the system. They envision 150 million workers investing the extra money in stocks and bonds yielding more than 5 percent above inflation.
But the extra money could instead be invested in the existing trust fund. Under current law, the money can only be used to buy special Government bonds that pay interest of only about 3 percent above inflation. The financial advantage of private accounts over the trust fund in the Congressional plans, then, follows from a quirk of current law, a law that could be changed to permit the trust fund to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Invested similarly, private accounts are not better than the trust fund.
Indeed, they are worse. A single trust fund keeps administrative expense at a minimum. But setting up and maintaining 150 million private accounts would rack up substantial fees and commissions for Wall Street. Prof. Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that the administrative costs would reduce retirement payments by at least 25 percent by the time of retirement and would cost another 5 to 10 percent to convert, as most plans require, the savings into a monthly annuity.
So if private accounts cost more to administer than does a trust fund and produce no better investment returns, why bother setting them up? The answer, proponents say, is that Government cannot be trusted to purchase shares in American companies. It would be tempted to meddle, for example by interfering with the management of tobacco companies or selling shares of companies that offer violent computer games to children. The way around that, say those who favor trust fund investments, is to legislatively put stock-picking decisions in the hands of private managers and forbid the Government to exercise voting rights.
So the debate over private accounts rests almost entirely on a political call. To supporters, they create private property that Congress could never reclaim. To opponents they represent needlessly costly and potentially pernicious reform that would undermine the current system's transfers to low-wage workers and scrape away the insulation a single investment pool provides individuals against the risk that their own stock and bond purchases go awry.
"There is a terrific economic argument for pumping more money into Social Security in order to raise national saving and investment," said Laurence S. Seidman, an economist at the University of Delaware and author of a new book on Social Security. "There is a terrific economic argument for investing at least some Social Security money in stocks because that would allow low-wage workers to reap the benefit of high-yield stocks without exposing themselves to much risk. But there is no purely economic reason why either of these reforms need to be done through private accounts."

Dow Makes a U-Turn to Finish Solidly Ahead by 69.30

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded from early losses yesterday to finish solidly ahead, as investors showed renewed affection for the blue-chip growth stocks they had shunned lately.
While none of the major indexes reached new peaks, all reversed course about 1 P.M. and climbed steadily to finish at their best levels. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 69.30 points to regain more than half the ground it lost Tuesday, after closing above 11,000 for the first time on Monday. It ended up 0.64 percent at 10,955.41. 
 The Nasdaq composite index did even better, surging 1.98 percent, or 49.32 points, to 2,534.44.
"The familiar growth names came back," said Timothy E. O'Grady, a portfolio manager at the First Capital Group. "Some of these stocks were in a deeply oversold condition."
Although interest rates were a bit lower throughout the session, stocks did not spring back until midday. Some analysts attributed the recovery to comments by John F. Welch Jr., the General Electric chairman, who told a Florida conference that his company, which has a market capitalization second only to Microsoft, would "at least" match Wall Street's expectations of a 14 percent earnings gain this year.
Others mentioned circulation of a Federal Reserve survey showing the economy growing at a moderate pace with prices generally still "stable." With the quarterly season for corporate earnings reports largely over, much of the attention, analysts said, has returned to the economy. On Friday, the Labor Department is to report on the April job market.
The market will also pay close attention today to a speech on the economy by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, in Chicago.
AT&T, winner of the bidding contest for Mediaone, was a standout performer, jumping 5 3/8, to 56 15/16, on turnover of nearly 32 million shares. The other leading gains among the Dow Jones blue chips were 5 points, to 139, for J. P. Morgan; 4 1/16, to 109, for General Electric; 2 1/4, to 129 3/8, for American Express, and 1 15/16, to 72 13/16, for Merck.
Among the prominent losers were stocks sensitive to the economy that had become suddenly popular last month after long trailing the growth standbys. Alcoa, for example, slipped 7/8, to 60 3/16, after trading as high as 65 5/8 last Thursday, United Technologies 1 7/8, to 145 3/4, and Minnesota Mining 1 9/16, to 92 3/8. General Motorsfell 2 1/16, to 86 15/16, after reporting lower sales.
"Some of the move to cyclicals has been overdone," said Joseph Battipaglia, investment policy chairman at Gruntal.
Internet and other high-technology stocks joined the afternoon revival, with America Online a pivotal issue as it posted a 2 5/8-point gain, to 129 3/4, after trading as low as 115 1/2.
That kind of comeback "tends to set the tone" for the market in general, said Philip Schettewi, a managing partner at Loomis Sayles. "A lot of people get conditioned to buy the dips, which keep getting shallower," he added. Ebay ended 5 9/16 higher at 186 13/16 after trading as low as 168, Amazon.com rose 3 1/2, to 146 1/2, after having been down to 133 7/8, and Microsoft advanced 1 1/16, to 79 1/8, after trading at 76 7/16.
Among financial stocks, Chase Manhattan fell 2 1/16, to 80 3/16, in contrast to Morgan's big gain that seemed related to news of plans to enhance its Internet trading capability. Goldman Sachs, trading for the second day, eased 1 1/4, to 69 1/8; it went public at 53 on Tuesday. Charles Schwab jumped 5 3/4,to 107 1/2.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange edged down to a still-hefty 913.6 million shares, with gaining stocks holding only a slim margin over declining ones, 1,565 to 1,444. But 66 issues made new 52-week highs and only 17 new lows
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 15.31 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,347.31.
Except for Brazil, where the Bovespa climbed 2.75 percent, foreign markets were nearly all lower by about 1.5 percent or more.

Treasury Prices Rise
 By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices rose yesterday as the highest yields in nine months attracted buyers, even as a factory report gave more evidence of a buoyant economy.
Investors are doing a "little bit of nibbling at these levels," after bond yields rose about 20 basis points over the last two weeks, said Mark Hemenetz, who helps manage $18 billion of fixed-income assets at Bank of New York.
Even so, many were reluctant to buy bonds before Mr. Greenspan's speech today, the Government's April employment report tomorrow and forthcoming sales of $30 billion of Government and corporate debt.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 2/32, to 93 17/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.70 percent, from 5.71 percent on Tuesday.

Campaign For Jackson In Full Swing

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
WHEN Phil Jackson was a player with the Knicks in the early 1970's, he would hear the coach, Red Holzman, and the trainer, Danny Whelan, inform the starting small forward, Bill Bradley, that when Bradley became President of the United States they wanted the jobs of checking the height of the water levels of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Holzman would sit at one coast for six months and Whelan at the other, and then they would switch.
"I haven't approached Bill for that job yet," Jackson said yesterday, "although he tells people that if elected I'd be his Secretary of Dee-fense. Which is different from Secretary of De-fense." 
 Jackson, who has been unemployed since last June, has been an unpaid campaigner for Bradley, who, some 25 years after the end of his playing career, has announced that he is, indeed, seeking residence in the White House.
Last night, Jackson, at age 53 and looking fit and rested and shorn of his gray beard, was honored at halftime of the Bulls-Orlando Magic game at the United Center for his masterly contributions as coach of Bulls teams that won six National Basketball Association championships in the previous eight seasons. Among those participating in the ceremony were Senator Bill Bradley; Bill Fitch, Jackson's college coach, and Michael Jordan, who was unable to attend but sent a taped video message that was played for the near-capacity crowd.
"The spiritual aspect of team play of the Bulls spilled over into the community of Chicago, and brought us all together," Jackson said, addressing the crowd. Referring to the record of success he said, "we had a wonderful time, didn't we?"
For a combination of reasons -- the retirement of Jordan to a personality conflict with General Manager Jerry Krause, to a need to simply clear his basketball sinuses -- Jackson quit the Bulls and took a sabbatical.
In that time, he has built a house in Woodstock, N.Y., and has been giving speeches to the tune of $45,000 a talk (outside of politicking), doing some writing. He is, after all, the author of the best seller "Sacred Hoops." And he is still "looking over my shoulder at the world of basketball."
A little more than that surely. While last night was the first time this season that he has entered an N.B.A. arena, Jackson said he has checked out some games on television. But he has also been Penelope to N.B.A. suitors. He has sat and woven his thoughts quietly while his representative, the Chicago lawyer Todd Musburger, has been fielding love notes from teams desirous of Jackson's hand as coach.
"We have four offers on the table," Musburger said, "and at the end of the season we're expecting at least two or three more."
Jackson said, "I'd be interested only if the intrigue is there." And while Jackson has sometimes spoken in cryptic terms, it was clear what "intrigue" meant: money, team, control, city, and not necessarily in that order.
The teams that conceivably have been in touch with Musburger are the Lakers, the Nets and maybe Washington, Denver, Charlotte and Vancouver -- and the Knicks.
Some things Jackson said he would have to look at are the contracts of current players and where the team is in the salary cap and how flexible they would be in dumping aging veterans and getting players who appeal to him. Which conceivably would eliminate the Knicks. Jordan may become a part owner in Charlotte, but Jackson says Paul Silas has done a good job coaching the Hornets and he imagines that Jordan would be very hands-on as an owner.
Which would not be too attractive for Jackson, who would like the kind of control over decisions on players that Pat Riley and Rick Pitino have with Miami and Boston. "I want to decide the players for my coaching style."
One such player is Shaquille O'Neal, who traveled to South America with Jackson three years ago to conduct basketball clinics. Jackson, Musburger said, liked O'Neal and believes he would be great for the triangle offense that Jackson employed with the Bulls. Then there is the cash. Jackson made $6 million in his last year as the Bulls' coach. He would want more. Chuck Daly earns $5 million a year. Riley and Pitino have upper-management deals in which they earn $10 million or more.
One other factor: how Bradley is progressing as the one, "to lead us into the new millennium," as Jackson put it.
If someone who doesn't know Jackson asks what he does for a living, what does he say? "I say I'm a magician," he said with a smile.
A magician now, he was asked, or then? "Both," he said, inscrutably.

Stadium Financing? New Twist for N.F.L.

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Imagine if George Steinbrenner volunteered to help pay for a new downtown Montreal Expos stadium. Better yet, think of the Expos agreeing to chip in for a $1 billion Yankee Stadium for the good of baseball.
That is what the National Football League rivals of Robert K. Kraft, who owns the New England Patriots, will do if a plan to build a $250 million stadium in Foxboro, Mass., comes to fruition. 
 Last week, after the league made public its ardor to keep the Patriots from leaving Foxboro, the team dumped a proposed $374 million taxpayer-paid stadium in Hartford because there was no guarantee it would be ready by 2002.
The Foxboro financing would give the Patriots $125 million up front from the N.F.L., which would repay the loan from club-seat premium revenues the team would not have to pay visiting clubs.
If the club-seat cash falls short of paying the annual debt service, the league would use revenues from personal-seat licenses and network television.
The transaction is booked as an interest-free loan to the Patriots, who need not repay a cent unless Kraft sells or moves the team during the term of the loan. Kraft would then have to finance only $125 million for the stadium.
The Massachusetts Legislature is to vote on a $70 million subsidy for roads, exit ramps and sewers.
Still, it would never match the world-class handout Kraft left behind in Hartford.
"Mr. Kraft turned down a no-risk deal in Connecticut, with $1 billion in club-seat and luxury-suite guarantees and a $120 million capital improvement fund," said Joe Browne, an N.F.L. spokesman. "In Foxboro, he'd be taking on financing risks, and he'd be selling club seats and luxury suites."
Kraft's rivals would be making his life a lot easier by halving the borrowing he would need. But this illustrates the socialistic savvy of the N.F.L. Owners have shared revenues liberally for 40 years, and share more than teams in any other major league. In the N.F.L., the small-market Green Bay Packers can survive and thrive. In baseball, Montreal can barely do either.
Once assured that the business and political establishment in Massachusetts wanted to keep the Patriots from moving, the N.F.L. commandeered the Foxboro plan with a new version of its 12-year-old stadium-financing-aid program.
The original program, which was formalized in 1994, relieved teams from paying visiting teams 34 percent of their club-seat premium revenues if the money went to pay off loans for stadium construction or renovation.
Since 1987, 21 teams have used $400 million in this kind of financing, including the Miami Dolphins, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Washington Redskins.
In March, owners changed the policy: first, they shifted the burden of club-seat financing from the team to the league, allowing teams to get upfront loans without paying interest, rather than get their own loans. Then, the league said the club-seat financing could account for 34 percent to 50 percent of a team's private contribution to a stadium, up from a maximum of 34 percent. Only projects in the largest markets would be eligible for the 50 percent treatment.
"It had a big impact on us," said Paul Kirk Jr., a lawyer who is leading the Massachusetts bid. When his group of business and civic leaders began meeting with Roger Goodell, a senior league executive, he said, "Our challenge was how to bring something new to the economics of the situation."
The league had been studying for over a year how to help finance stadiums to keep teams in large markets like Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia and to bring teams back to cities like Los Angeles.
Once the club-seat financing policy was amended, Kirk added: "It changed the dialogue here. It meant the league stepped up. The average fan senses the league is a very successful enterprise. Right or wrong, they see megabucks."
This part of the financing is a great deal for Kraft. "It's almost like free money for him," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, in western Massachusetts. "It's very significant."
And it is also found money because it comes from the fans and corporations who buy club seats, those fancy perches with waiter service; personal-seat licenses, the upfront payments fans make to guarantee the right to buy season tickets, and the networks, which have agreed to pay the league $18.3 billion through 2005.
Naturally, the league believes its plan addresses some of the criticism that owners have extracted too much taxpayer money to build stadiums for the teams' private benefit. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, introduced a bill on Tuesday that goes further than the N.F.L.'s financing.
"The league plan is an internal one to help owners raise their share of the private contribution to build stadiums," said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the Senator. "But it doesn't address how to relieve the taxpayer burden."
Specter's legislation would condition the continuation of the N.F.L.'s limited antitrust exemption and baseball's full exemption on their setting aside 10 percent of their television revenues to pay for half the cost of building new facilities. The bill would require the team and public to finance the remaining 50 percent, ideally for each party to put up 25 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Young Palestinian Giant;
Holding Company Close to Arafat Casts Widest of Nets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: NABLUS, West Bank

 BODY:
From his hillside offices, Munib R. Masri can look down on the neighborhood where his grandfather's family founded the city's first university and survey the old town center where uncles and cousins served as mayors.
But Mr. Masri, a dapper, Texas-educated billionaire, keeps his eye on new features of the Nablus landscape, all of which he had a hand in building: a Palestinian stock exchange, a modern television assembly plant, the headquarters of Paltel, the Mideast's first privately owned phone company. 
 These are cornerstones of an emerging Palestinian economy, being built with offshore Palestinian money in expectation of statehood. And all are offshoots of the Palestinian Development and Investment Company, or Padico, a Nablus-based holding company run by the iron-willed Mr. Masri. In five years, Padico has become the biggest and most influential company in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with interests ranging from manufacturing and real estate to finance and power generating.
"We will do everything we can to put Palestine on the economic map of the world," said Mr. Masri, who made his fortune in Europe and the Persian Gulf during the quarter-century that Nablus was under Israeli administration.
In government circles, Padico is applauded for bringing urgently needed Palestinian capital and business skills back home. Local critics, though, contend that it rests on a foundation of cronyism, nepotism and protectionism, with troubling implications for a Palestine of the future. Some see Padico's close ties to Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority as a framework for further concentration of wealth in a society already riven by deep inequities.
In project after project, Padico has recruited top Palestinian managerial and engineering talent, most with advanced degrees from abroad, and assembled financial backing for critical new businesses.
"If you want to promote private investment here, one of the engines is Padico," said Mohsen Khalil, Middle East director for the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private investment arm. "They bring in a lot of competence, a lot of expertise and a lot of resources."
Local business rivals, however, portray Padico as an enemy of the free market and a beneficiary of political concessions. And Padico's founding investors are resented by others here for their affluence, their long absence and their Westernized ways. (Mr. Masri's wife and six adult children are American citizens, and most senior Padico employees speak fluent English.)
"During all our struggles here, during the intifada, all these millionaires were living abroad," said Hatem Abdul-Qader, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, referring to the uprising against Israeli military administration from 1987 to 1993. "Then these people came to harvest the fruits of our struggle."
Opposition legislators hint darkly that they have proof of payoff schemes and secret deals to restrict competition. But they have yet to produce any evidence of corruption involving Padico.
Mohammed Nashashibi, the Palestinian Authority's finance chief, dismisses the attacks. "They are pioneers," he said. "Let those who criticize them come and compete with them."
But the authority gave Padico a head start. Its subsidiaries are already busy crisscrossing Palestinian territory with fiber optic cables, erecting beach-front condominiums beside Gaza refugee camps, and spawning an array of start-up companies from plastics makers to poultry farms.
Among Padico's most prominent projects is the Palestinian Authority's showcase tourism enterprise, a $48 million Bethlehem luxury hotel being rushed through construction in hopes of receiving Pope John Paul II and others for millennial celebrations. The authority's biggest manufacturing venture, a Gaza industrial park with its own Israeli customs post, is another subsidiary. And Padico is the only private local shareholder in a new Palestinian home mortgage corporation, a $22 million partnership including the authority and a German development bank. All three projects are being developed with loans and equity from the International Finance Corporation.
"I don't know how they first received these contracts," said Husan Khader, a Nablus legislator. "But once they have the job, they do it professionally," adding that if they were responsible for all the Palestinians' economic affairs, "they would be a civilizing influence."
Mr. Masri is happy to acknowledge that he is an Arafat confidant. Now a member of the Palestinian central council, he was a Jordanian Cabinet minister when the Palestine Liberation Organization rose against King Hussein in 1970. Dispatched to the P.L.O. leader's desert hideout by Hussein, Mr. Masri forged an enduring bond with Mr. Arafat.
"Because I am so close to Arafat, some people think that Padico is part of the government," Mr. Masri said. "But it is not. It is completely private and independent."
Above all, Padico is seen here as an extension of the Masri clan, West Bank patricians who made fortunes abroad but always considered Nablus their home. The family traces its lineage back more than three centuries in this old Jordan Valley city -- which, with Padico's help, aspires to become the business capital of a future Palestinian state.
Munib Masri's second cousin, Sabih Nasri, another recently returned billionaire, runs Paltel. Almost every other Padico subsidiary has a Masri or two on its board. The Palestinian Authority's trade and industry chief is another Nablus cousin, Maher Masri.
Yet even in the family, there is dissent. "What they are really doing," said Muawia al-Masri, a distant relative who represents Nablus on the legislative council, "is imposing monopolies on services, which is hurting the Palestinian people."
Mr. Masri bridles at such comments. "We don't want to monopolize anything," he said. "There is plenty of work to do here. We need 10 Padicos to repair the damage that the Israelis have done to us."
There is no better indicator of Padico's influence, and the ingrown nature of its business ties, than its role in the nascent stock market. Started by Padico in 1997 with a charter from Mr. Arafat, the Nablus exchange is managed by a small Padico subsidiary. Suleiman Abbadi, the recently hired director, reports to the exchange chairman, Sabih Masri, who is also chairman of Paltel, the largest company traded on the exchange.
Paltel, Padico and a Padico real estate subsidiary together account for two-thirds of the market capitalization of the 28 listed companies.
Citing Padico's dual role as market player and manager, and lax local rules on financial disclosure and insider trading, some Palestinian businesses refuse to be listed on the exchange.
"How can I trust it?" asked Mazen Sinokrot, a candy maker in Ramallah, whose family business has diversified into animal feed and real estate. "You are my competitor, and you also control the stock market? You have information about my company, but I don't have information about yours?"
What most irks Mr. Sinokrot is that he and other local entrepreneurs did not have a place at the table when Mr. Arafat and Padico's founders devised their projects, like the plan for a telecommunications monopoly. "We were never given the same opportunity," he said.
Paltel's president, Hatem al-Halawani, who earlier served five years as Padico's chief executive, argues that by limiting itself to a minority holding in Paltel and selling shares to the public -- a Palestinian first -- Padico provided ample openings for local investors. "We could have taken 50 or 60 percent if we wanted to," he said.
And Padico's original mandate, notes Amin Haddad, until recently Padico's vice president and spokesman, was to create investment opportunities for expatriates.
Five years ago, with local political control about to pass to the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Masri returned here from London at Mr. Arafat's invitation, joining his first cabinet and helping to assemble Padico. With the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord just months old, it was a time of heady optimism, but also of few local institutions.
"The concept was to build the Palestinian economy," Mr. Masri said, "and to make a decent profit, but not an exorbitant profit. And what we did was clean; it was over the table."
With Mr. Arafat's endorsement, Mr. Masri and other expatriates courted Palestinian investors from Europe, the Americas and throughout the Middle East. A key recruit was the Amman-based but Palestinian-owned Arab Bank, the Arab world's fourth largest. Others followed.
"We were trying to convince people to put 3 or 4 percent of their wealth into a country where they will be able to raise their children," Mr. Masri said.
The group raised about $150 million initially and backed the new company with $1 billion. Each founding investor was limited to a 2 percent share. Last year, Padico directors made what they said was a one-time exception, accepting $10 million from Prince Walid bin Talal, the Saudi billionaire.
Today, Padico is a holding company of fairly standard design, modest dimensions and meager profits. The core company and its majority-owned subsidiaries have about 100 professional employees scattered across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. On the Palestinian exchange, Padico's market capitalization hovers around $190 million, not all that much more than its reported $84 million in paid-in capital. Until a recent 1,000-for-1 split, Padico shares sold for $1,000 each, discouraging most local interest. Padico's 1998 report, released at its annual meeting in April, includes a summarized audit by Arthur Andersen showing net assets of just $122 million and an after-tax profit last year of $2.7 million.
"We have some unhappy investors," Mr. Haddad acknowledged.
But such figures belie Padico's true importance here. The company says it manages some $500 million in additional assets for its partners, including the Palestinian Authority. And the personal wealth of its board members is "about $20 billion," Mr. Haddad estimated.
Even allowing for exaggeration, the assets of Padico's expatriate founders loom extraordinarily large in a $3 billion economy. And some holdings give Padico significant profit potential, analysts say, pointing to its 10 percent share of a new Gaza electric company and 23 percent of Paltel.
Few foreign investors are ready to wade into the shallow and murky waters of Palestinian finance, but Padico and Paltel are considered the most viable eventual candidates for international stock portfolios.
"If you look at emerging markets, it is almost always the case at the beginning that a few companies will account for most of the capitalization," said Angus Blair, head of equity research for the Middle East at ABN Amro in London. "Invariably, telecoms and holding companies are going to be very important."
The London-based emerging markets department of Nomura, the giant Japanese brokerage house, is now preparing what Padico says will be the first thorough independent assessment of the company, in conjunction with a Jordanian investment banking firm.
But prospective investors may receive the report somewhat skeptically. The owner and managing director of Nomura's Jordanian partner, the Atlas Investment Group, is Omar Masri, Munib Masri's son.

HEADLINE: Studies Cite Lag in Year 2000 Projects

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
The prevailing optimism that Year 2000 computer problems will not seriously affect American business is premature, according to two new studies of Government filings by the nation's largest companies.
The studies focused on quarterly financial reports in which companies disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission how much they had spent through the end of last year to deal with Year 2000 computer malfunctions. The authors of both studies concluded that although the written descriptions of the corporate Year 2000 projects were uniformly rosy, the actual spending figures suggested that many large companies had left themselves just one year to complete more than half their work. 
 The filings also showed that estimates of the total cost of dealing with the Year 2000 problem continued to rise in the last three months of last year, albeit at a slower pace.
"A significant number of companies in every industry sector started late and too much work remains for them to finish in 1999," said Steven Hock, president of Triaxsys Research, summarizing the findings of a report to be issued today on S.E.C. disclosure statements. The statements were filed from January through March by 647 of the 1,000 largest companies as listed by Fortune magazine.
"Some are just not going to make it in time and will be forced to rely heavily on contingency plans and crisis management to avoid serious business disruptions," Mr. Hock said.
Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said his analysis of the disclosure statements of 372 of the 500 companies making up the Standard & Poor's stock index, which he plans to release by the end of this week, is similarly troubling. Just 44 of the companies -- under 12 percent -- had spent as much as 75 percent of their projected budget by the end of last year, he said. "This doesn't mean that the others are not going to get the job done," said Mr. Yardeni, who has been Wall Street's most prominent pessimist on Year 2000 issues. "It does mean that they aren't leaving themselves much time."
Companies rushing to catch up are more likely to make mistakes, cut corners on testing and prepare inadequate contingency plans, Mr. Yardeni and many Year 2000 project managers said.
But Year 2000 experts caution against putting too much weight on the budget data. The Government does not audit them for accuracy. The figures can move sharply for individual companies from quarter to quarter. Sun Microsystems Inc., a company identified as a laggard by Triaxsys with just 14 percent of its Year 2000 budget having been spent through last year, jumped to 48 percent in the first three months of this year. And a conservative company like Sun, which has budgeted money to audit suppliers in the coming months, may take longer to complete its spending than a company setting aside little or nothing for such last-minute precautions.
Moreover, because the world has never experienced anything like the Year 2000 computer problem, no one can be certain whether a company leaving much of its spending for this year is running major risks. Indeed, recent Government and industry reports of tests performed on renovated systems have been so successful that confidence is growing that major disruptions are unlikely, at least in the United States.
The year 2000 problem, often known as Y2K or the millennium bug, stems from the widespread use of just two digits to represent the year in dates, such as 99 for 1999. Some computers, software and electronic machinery read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000 while others do not recognize it as a valid date. Some faulty systems freeze while others continue operating but produce erroneous data or gibberish.
Comparisons of spending figures for individual companies can be tricky because there is no national standard. Most of the figures reported to the Government involve spending to fix the software and equipment a company needs for its daily operations, but the spending at some companies may also include efforts to update computer-based products the company sells to others or help key suppliers prepare.
Conservative budgets may include substantial contingency planning. The 3Com Corporation, a computer networking company in Santa Clara, Calif., has spent just $3 million out of a potential budget of $25 million to $35 million through the first three months of this year. Judy Bruner, the company's controller, said that 3Com was on schedule to complete its major remediation programs but that the company had also included money in its budget for contingency plans if Year 2000 setbacks occurred.
But Mr. Hock and Mr. Yardeni said that while it might be mistaken to come to conclusions about any single company based on its spending reports, the collective figures underscore that so much work remains to be done that the country should guard against complacency.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Set to Break Taboo On Reward for Organ Donations

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
With demand for human organs far outstripping supply and more than 64,000 Americans waiting to receive new hearts, lungs, livers, pancreases and kidneys, Pennsylvania is taking steps to become the first state to break a long-held taboo against providing a financial reward for organ donation.
By early next year, state health officials said this week, they will begin offering a stipend of about $300 to help families of organ donors cover their funeral expenses. The stipend, authorized by a 1994 law, will not be paid directly to relatives, but rather to funeral homes under a pilot project that will be monitored for three years by a panel of medical ethicists to see if it increases organ donations. 
 Final details of the project are being worked out by a panel of advisers to Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican. The panel is expected to issue its recommendations on June 9. A spokesman for the Governor said he knew of "no impediment" to the plan. If Mr. Ridge approves the program, the State Health Department will sign contracts with Pennsylvania's two organ procurement agencies to begin making the payments as quickly as possible.
"We are all ready to move forward," said Emilie Tierney, the state health official supervising the project. "We expect other states to be watching us."
Also watching is the Federal Government, which says the payments may violate the National Organ Transplant Act, a 1984 law that classifies human organs as a national resource and prohibits their sale. And the plan is generating intense debate among transplant surgeons, organ recipients and families of past donors.
"This is absolutely not buying and selling organs," said Howard Nathan, who serves on the Governor's advisory panel and is president of the Gift of Life Donor Program, one of two regional networks that distribute donated organs in Pennsylvania. "This is about having a voluntary death benefit for a family who gave a gift. The intent is to test it and see if it makes a difference to families."
But the Federal Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the nation's transplant programs, is not so certain.
"The Federal statute is fairly clear in prohibiting the exchange of organs for any kind of payment," said Jon Nelson, who directs the agency's office of special programs. "The question is whether this is in violation of the statute or not. Clearly, we have to look at it closely."
Even if the payments are legal, critics say they raise a host of thorny questions: Will the promise of a stipend, however small, induce families to lie about the medical histories of their loved ones, withholding information that could affect the health of the transplant recipient?
Will the money prompt a disproportionate increase in donation among the poor, injecting further economic imbalance into a system that is already skewed in favor of the wealthy? Will the plan backfire, hindering organ donation by offending families who believe their noble gift is tainted by payments?
And, finally, in an era when surgeons are routinely transplanting kidneys from living donors who are not related to the recipients, could the stipends mark the first step on the road toward outright sale of organs?
"I think it is very murky ground to get into when we put a monetary incentive for such an altruistic gift as organ donation," said Antonio Benedi, a liver recipient and past president of Transplant Recipients' International Organization, a nonprofit group in Washington. "Obviously there are some folks that need help as far as funerals go, but to attach it to the actual donation, I think, is very dangerous."
Some transplant surgeons echo his view.
"Society is not prepared to allow for your body to be bought and sold," said Dr. Francis L. Delmonico, director of the kidney transplant program at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Dr. Delmonico is also medical director of the New England Organ Bank, the nation's oldest organ procurement agency, and although that organization has not taken a position on the stipend, he said he felt compelled to offer his personal views.
"I don't have a fundamental objection to compensating families," Dr. Delmonico said. But, noting that organs are sold on the black market in some nations, he said he worried that "this would be a slippery slope toward the buying and selling of organs, which is Federally prohibited."
Still, transplant surgeons and organ procurement directors across the nation are watching Pennsylvania's experiment closely, and some, including those in New York, are laying plans to follow it if it proves successful in increasing donations.
In a report issued last year, the New York Task Force to Increase Organ and Tissue Donation recommended to the State Department of Health a plan for funeral expense reimbursement that "might be modeled after the Pennsylvania approach, after evaluation of Pennsylvania's experience."
The idea of paying donor families is not new; it has been debated in transplant circles for about a decade. In 1991, the National Kidney Foundation staged a series of town hall meetings to discuss the idea; the next year, the foundation paid for a telephone poll that found 48 percent of people favored some form of financial compensation to the families of organ donors, 42 percent opposed it and 10 percent were undecided.
"Our position is that this should be tested to see whether it serves a purpose," said Dolph Chianchiano, the group's director of scientific and public policy. "We are not talking about a situation where the organ goes to the highest bidder, or that there should be a market for organs. We are talking about a limited, specified amount of money paid to a third party."
Increasingly, others are adopting that view, said Dr. Charles Miller, a transplant surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. Dr. Miller, who was the chairman of the New York task force, said the concept of payments had been so controversial that, for years, "people were scared to talk about it."
"I think times have changed," Dr. Miller said. "I think the organ donor shortage has become so public and so critical that people are beginning to rethink."
That there is a shortage at all is testimony to the success of transplant surgery. As recently as 1990, for instance, there were 50 liver transplant centers in the country; today there are 120. As more doctors learn how to transplant organs, more patients demand organ transplants. According to the Department of Health and Human Services , 56,716 people were waiting for hearts, lungs, livers, pancreases and kidneys at the end of 1997; by the end of last year, the list had grown to 64,423.
In 1994, sensing the growing crisis, lawmakers in Pennsylvania adopted Pennsylvania Act 102. It required, among other things, that hospitals notify organ procurement agencies of every death, a provision that has since been put into place nationwide through a regulation adopted by the Clinton Administration.
The Pennsylvania law also mandated public education programs to increase awareness of the organ shortage. It permitted residents to donate a small sum from their tax returns and motor vehicle registration fees to an organ donor trust fund. And it authorized the Governor to create a 15-member advisory panel to make recommendations about how the money should be spent.
Under the law, 10 percent of the fund may be used to reimburse families for medical or funeral expenses, at a maximum of $3,000 to any one family, said Ms. Tierney of the health department. But the Governor's advisory panel has determined that the reimbursements should be much less, about $300 per family, Ms. Tierney said. The trust fund now totaled about $800,000, she said, enough to start making disbursements.
Under the plan being drafted, the procurement agencies would inform families when their relatives died that they were eligible for the benefit if they donated an organ.
Experts have been trying for years to understand why people refuse to donate organs. They say that religious beliefs, the attitudes of doctors and nurses, and the sensitivity of representatives of organ procurement agencies, who put the delicate question to family members after their loved ones have died, all play a part. But nobody knows if a stipend will make a difference, because it has never been tried.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Flies To Europe To Bolster Troop Morale

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany, May 5

 BODY:
Donning a brown bomber jacket in solidarity with the NATO forces in Yugoslavia, President Clinton began a two-day morale-boosting trip to Europe today that included a brief visit with the three American soldiers who were recently released from Serbian captivity.
His trip here was the closest Mr. Clinton has come to the Yugoslav theater of war since NATO began bombing Serbia on March 24. Despite a packed schedule that took him from Brussels to two air bases in Germany and will later tonight take him to Frankfurt, the visit, in a drizzly chill, was a subdued one for the weary-looking President, for whom the war presents an array of nettlesome complications. 
 To accommodate diplomatic needs, Mr. Clinton's schedule was expanded from a 24-hour visit with troops to include talks with NATO commanders in Brussels this morning and a visit with Germany's Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, on Thursday afternoon.
The visit also included plans to meet with relief agencies handling the refugee crisis.
Mr. Clinton addressed the troops at the American air base in Spangdahlem and then here, where he locked into an earnest discussion with nine men during supper in a hangar under the propeller of a hulking C-30 transport plane.
He said later that they talked about the war as well as the military's recruitment problems and low pay and that he assured them of bipartisan support in Congress for a pay raise.
"The United States military, because of people like you, can do things for a troubled world that no one else can do," the President told the troops after supper. "And I'm profoundly grateful."
He arrived in Brussels this morning from Washington to the news that two American pilots had been killed, apparently in training accidents. They are the first American deaths of the Kosovo conflict.
Aides said that the immediate fall-out of the war -- the overwhelming difficulty of helping as many as 1.5 million refugees -- weighed heavily on Mr. Clinton, even as the United States accepted its first plane load of 453 refugees today in New Jersey.
Brian Atwood, head of the Agency for International Development, who traveled here with Mr. Clinton, said that the quandary of the refugees dominated the President's private talks today. "The international community is going to, at times in the next few weeks, appear to be very disorganized," Mr. Atwood said.
All in all, the President's public appearances today were fairly low-key. His speech in Spangdahlem was just 17 minutes, and he seemed to hasten through his stack of events, putting himself uncharacteristically ahead of schedule.
He began his day at NATO headquarters in Brussels by meeting with Secretary General Javier Solana. He was then briefed by General Wesley K. Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander. He later flew here and met privately with the three former captives and their families for about 25 minutes.
Asked why he thought Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, had let them go, Mr. Clinton declined to speculate. "The important thing is he did let them go," he told reporters.

HEADLINE: Air War: Too Costly in Every Way

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "It Costs a Lot More to Kill Fewer People" (Week in Review, May 2): 
 An important consideration is the depreciation costs associated with the aircraft used in the Balkan conflict. These costs are not an immediate cash cost to the United States; however, they are a relevant part of the economic analysis.
In addition, considering that these aircraft are not only burning up fuel in the air but also wearing out and moving closer to needing to be replaced further highlights the question your article raises about the increasing monetary cost of the Balkan air war to the American people versus what appear to be disappointing military returns from the use of such expensive, high-tech weaponry.

Nudity and Energy: Qi Whiz!

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
One hundred fifty peaceful exhibitionists assembled at 6 A.M. in Manhattan's Times Square recently, stripped off all their clothes and together posed in the altogether for the photographer Spencer Tunick.
Before he could get the shot of massed nudes, the lubricious lensman was arrested for "tumultuous and violent conduct." The D.A. has charged Mr. Tunick with "promoting the exposure of a person." (What kind of crime is that? I try to do that in this space twice a week.) We libertarians view this bluenosed suppression of artistic expression as a foolish waste of the police's time. 
 Half a world away, at almost the same moment, a crowd of more than 15,000 middle-aged Chinese of the Fulan Gong sect assembled in front of the compound housing China's leadership. Fully clothed, they sat silently on the sidewalk in yoga's lotus position for 13 hours, in deep concentration.
They thereby threw a scare into the Chinese Communist Government the likes of which has not been felt since the demonstration at Tiananmen Square 10 years ago on June 4.
But this year's demonstration was not political. No signs were raised, no slogans shouted, no replicas of the Statue of Liberty held aloft that triggered a massacre. These are practitioners of qigong (pronounced chee-goong), both a martial art and a method of breathing and meditation that directs energy to improve health and spiritual awareness. Though an offshoot of Buddhism and denounced by the government-run qi establishment, it avoids condemnation as a cult by claiming not to be a religion.
Accordingly, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji rolled out no tanks. He listened to a delegation's complaint about harassment by officialdom, and offered them bus rides home. The crowd dispersed, having made its point. The official newspapers are now warning the Fulan Gong not to try that surprising stunt again.
This can be dismissed as a cult promoted by Li Hongzhi, a Chinese forced out of China and now in New York. Reported to believe in alien beings and levitation -- and selling TV cassettes of his outlook on his Web site -- Mr. Li's 5,000-year-old symbol of yin-yang means "all is well" but looks a lot like a swastika. Tibetan and Chinese friends tell me that by a Buddhist, he's no Buddhist.
But whether he's selling scary superstition or uplifting spirituality -- or the brain-body interaction that Western scientists no longer pooh-pooh -- between 40 and 70 million people are buying. The movement has about as many members in China as the Communist Party and is growing much faster. Beijing has not cracked down because it fears turning the energy of qi on itself by making martyrs.
Zhu has reason to worry. Communism is producing political suppression while its capitalist road requires economic belt-tightening and its social policy limits families to one child. With 200 million unemployed or underemployed making up 25 percent of the work force, China may be yearning for a movement offering a happier, healthier, freer life.
That's what troubles the Forbidden City. "They remember the Boxer Rebellion," says Columbia University Prof. Robert Thurman, "a popular movement to purify the corruption of the Manchus. Any nationwide reawakening of spirituality is seen as a threat to central control. They feel threatened by any organized movement, but how do you handle a nonviolent, transcendental ideology that seems so innocuous?"
In good times, Communism and Confucianism, with their common respect for authority, can easily co-exist. But when a sense of impermanence takes hold, and the mandate of Heaven comes into doubt, all in authority sense the danger of spiritual revival. Most sects die aborning, but a few, strengthened by repression, mushroom into a major challenge.
Advice to Prime Minister Zhu: Ease up. Don't turn a shrewd salesman into a mythic hero. Neither your stolen nuclear secrets nor your boughten supercomputers can smother an internal brush fire begun in spirituality and selflessness and ignited by outrage.
On a different order of magnitude, advice to the N.Y.P.D. and the Manhattan D.A.: Lighten up. If they're not blocking traffic and do nothing more violent than smiling at a camera, let the nudies shape themselves into a message and pose. Good for tourism, better for art, best for liberty.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 12.
 
Now Playing
 
* "ANALYZE THIS," starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Mr. Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal, "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comedy (Janet Maslin). 

* "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
* "COOKIE'S FORTUNE," starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Patricia Neal and Julianne Moore. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Mr. Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Mr. Dutton is rock solid and appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Mr. Altman makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
 
* "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS," starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she views as imminent disaster. In the process, Mr. Zonca shows astonishing acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
 
* "ELECTION," starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically funny director of "Citizen Ruth" comes this caustic satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off of what they actually mean (Maslin).
 
"ENTRAPMENT," starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper film summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the great-looking insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Mr. Connery's glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
 
"EXISTENZ," starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. Directed by David Cronenberg (R, 90 minutes). Not for Mr. Cronenberg the sleek futuristic look of other films that play virtual reality games. This one has the insinuatingly ghoulish hallmarks of other Cronenberg fever dreams (like "The Fly," "Crash" and "Naked Lunch"). And it uses them to weirdly enveloping effect as a renowned game designer (Ms. Leigh) and her wary companion (Mr. Law) try to play the most dangerous game she has yet created. This sci-fi scheme is disturbingly effective as it plays its own mind games with the viewer, complete with a sharp final twist. The title is pronounced "eggs-is-tense" (Maslin).
 
"GO," starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant, Taye Diggs, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by Doug Liman (R, 100 minutes). This three-episode demimondaine comedy borrows truckloads of inspiration from "Pulp Fiction," but still has some flash and personality of its own. Mr. Liman, who shot the film as well as directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends a sullen cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal. He embellishes this situation fully enough to send his film down the rabbit hole into neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys go to Las Vegas, then get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car theft and a brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than others. The ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin).
 
* "HIDEOUS KINKY," starring Kate Winslet. Directed by Gillies MacKinnon (R, 99 minutes). Ms. Winslet knew best when she took on this offbeat, richly atmospheric adventure in the wake of "Titanic." The leading role in Mr. MacKinnon's vividly colorful film offers her a field day. She plays a young hippie mother who brings her reluctant British daughters to Marrakesh, circa 1972. The film, about the mother's willfulness, the girls' reaction and the sheer headiness of their surroundings, belongs to the striking subgenre in which it is baby-boom adults, not their children, who most need to come of age (Maslin).
 
"LIFE," starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence. Directed by Ted Demme (R, 105 minutes). Though it's hard to miss the basic unfunniness of seeing two black men sentenced to life at a Mississippi state prison, this mild-mannered comedy is more likable than it sounds. If it awkwardly straddles the line between period piece (it begins during Prohibition) and comedy, it also keeps the stars kidding their way from youth to curmudgeonhood. Mr. Murphy in particular gives a more substantial performance than might be expected here. Stick around for closing outtakes that show (for instance) a cell phone ringing during a scene set in 1932 (Maslin).
 
* "LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS," starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since "The Usual Suspects" has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials, actually an advantage for a change. There's not much beneath the surface here. What's most entertaining is Mr. Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
 
"THE MATRIX," starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but incomprehensible to nontechnofreaks. And the film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt to "The X-Files" in the paranoia department. But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Mr. Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
 
"PUSHING TIN," starring John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett. Directed by Mike Newell (R, 115 minutes). This story of air traffic controllers betrays its origins as a magazine article because it has more interesting data than built-in drama. But with a cast like this, and with the director of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" at the helm, the tacked-on soapy plot has plenty of sparks. Mr. Cusack and Mr. Thornton, both tersely good as professional rivals, become even more competitive once Ms. Jolie sashays into view as the latter's show-stopping biker-chick wife. Whatever possessed Ms. Blanchett to play Mr. Cusack's wife, a heavily accented Long Island housewife who talks about casseroles in the oven, she brings off the role with good humor and unexpected grace (Maslin).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
* "A WALK ON THE MOON," starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn (R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With a tenderness that is unusual for a contemporary American film, it tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected Woodstock-era music. Mr. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for the movie (Maslin).
 
* "THE WINSLOW BOY," starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110 minutes). Terence Rattigan's play, about the 1910 schoolboy's trial that created a furor in England, has been artfully pared down to its essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge (Maslin).

Lost Treasure To Be Auctioned
A haunting landscape by the Hudson River School master Frederic Edwin Church is being offered for sale at Sotheby's on May 27. The painting, which features a cross in the foreground, comes with an unusual past. 
 For years it was lost and known to Church scholars only from passing references. But in 1980 it was rediscovered hanging in the Des Moines Women's Club, where it had been since the group received it in 1952. Club members knew the painting not as "To the Memory of Cole," as the artist had named it, but as "Sunrise in the Catskills."
Two Church scholars, David C. Huntington, who died in 1990, and J. Gray Sweeney, an art history professor at Arizona State University, had spent years looking for "To the Memory of Cole," which Church painted in memory of his teacher, Thomas Cole, in April 1848, two months after Cole's death.
"I had found two references to the painting from newspaper clippings in the early 1970's," Mr. Sweeney said. "Then one day in 1979 I got a call from David Huntington, who said he had been contacted by the Des Moines Women's Club, which wanted him to look at a Church they owned. He asked me if I'd go instead."
Mr. Sweeney remembers the moment he first saw the painting. "It was like an electric charge, a powerful moment of recognition," he said. "It can only be described as a national treasure. It's an audacious, daring statement by a 22-year-old genius who is saying: 'I am a Cole student. I shall wear his mantle.' "
The painting was originally owned by George W. Austen, a New York auctioneer. The work predates Asher B. Durand's monumental "Kindred Spirits," now in the collection of the New York Public Library, which had long been considered the only painting to commemorate Cole's death.
At the time of his death, Cole was working on a series of allegorical paintings called "The Cross and the World," and they directly influenced "To the Memory of Cole."
"Church saw the cross as a symbol, or perhaps an ideal or proposed tombstone, but one never realized it was for Cole's tomb," Mr. Sweeney said. "The rays of morning light that illuminate the cross symbolize rebirth."
In an economic climate where top American paintings are hard to come by and prices keep rising, Sotheby's estimates that the painting could sell for $5 million to $8 million. The proceeds will go to create an endowment for the upkeep of the Des Moines Women's Club's 1907 building.
"I hate to see it go -- it's like my baby," said Anabelle Wonders, a former executive director of the club. The painting is in a collection of about 60 works, European and American, that the club owns and exhibits.
Ms. Wonders said the club first began talking to Sotheby's in the 1980's. At the time, she said, the members did not really want to part with it. And American paintings were not as highly valued then as they are today.
"It's an iconic painting," said Dara Mitchell, director of American paintings at Sotheby's. "Obviously, great paintings by Church rarely come on the market."
Ms. Mitchell noted that Sotheby's seems to get the chance to sell a work like this about every 10 years. In 1979 the auction house sold Church's "Iceberg," which became the first American painting to sell for more than $1 million. (It made $2.5 million.) In 1989 Sotheby's sold the artist's famous image "Home by the Lake" for $8.25 million.
"This is Church's first great statement," Mr. Sweeney said. "Today there are only about a half-dozen Church's left in private hands, and this is the best of them. It's my greatest hope that a museum will buy it so it can stay in the public eye."
 
Gift of a Rarity
"The Perfect Accord," one of the last Watteau paintings in private hands, has been given to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art by the Ahmanson Foundation, a Los Angeles-based organization that is a longtime supporter of the museum.
The painting, from around 1716, depicts five elegantly dressed people in a wooded park. A man in the center is playing the flute and a young woman beside him is singing. It was painted for the artist's friend Nicholas Henin, who oversaw architectural projects for the French court.
After changing hands several times, the painting was bought in 1892 by the Iveagh family of Britain and remained in the family until recently. One of Lord Iveagh's daughters, Lady Bridget Ness, the wife of Prince Frederic of Prussia, was the family's last owner. "She loved it so much she had a special case made and took it with her wherever she went," said Graham W. J. Beal, director of the Los Angeles County Museum. When Lady Bridget died a year ago, Simon Dickinson, who has galleries in New York and London, sold the painting to the foundation on behalf of the family trustees.
It is the first Watteau to enter the museum's collection and is on view in the Carter Gallery. This is the first time "The Perfect Accord" has been seen publicly in more than 100 years.
"Not having a Watteau has been a notable gap," Mr. Beal said. "The preparatory drawing for the work is also in Los Angeles, at the Getty."
 
To the Rescue
When the United States Pavilion at the 1999 Venice Biennale opens on June 12 with an exhibition of work by the installation and performance artist Ann Hamilton, the pavilion will get corporate sponsorship for the first time, and the sponsor is Gucci.
Gucci and its creative director, Tom Ford, have over the years financed decorative arts, photography and performing arts projects in London, Japan and New York.
The Venice installation is also receiving support from the United States Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions, which is a partnership of the United States Information Agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trust.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Speech To Bankers in Chicago

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the 35th annual conference on Bank Structure and Competition of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago:
Now that there are tentative signs that we may be through the worst of the crisis abroad, an issue to which I shall return shortly, it would be useful to address the benevolent, but bedeviling, question of how the American economy, at least to date, has managed to remain an oasis of prosperity, in sharp contrast to badly sagging economies in the developing world, recession in Japan and tepid growth in much of Europe. And, can we project how long our economy will be able to provide support to the rest of the world? . . . 
 I do not say we are in a new era, because I have experienced too many alleged new eras in my lifetime that have come and gone. We are far more likely, instead, to be experiencing a structural shift similar to those that have visited our economy from time to time in the past. These shifts can have profound effects, often overriding conventional economic patterns for a number of years, before those patterns begin to show through again over the longer term. . . .
In the event, the performance of the American economy over the past seven years has been truly phenomenal. The breadth of technological advance and its application has engendered a major upward revaluation of business assets, both real and intangible. That revaluation has induced a spectacular rise in equity prices that to many has reached well beyond the justifiable.
Of most concern is how long this remarkable period of prosperity can be extended. As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in our expansion that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of strong growth and low inflation to a close.
Although productivity has accelerated in recent years, the impressive strength of domestic demand, in part driven by sharply rising equity prices, has meant that the substitution of capital for labor has been inadequate to prevent us from steadily depleting the pool of available workers. . . .
At some point, labor market conditions can become so tight that the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will then eventually begin to accelerate. . . .
For, if productivity growth should level out or actually falter because additional technology synergies fail to materialize, or because output per hour has been less tied to technology in the first place, inflationary pressures could re-emerge, possibly faster than some currently perceive feasible.
For, obviously if productivity growth slows, unit labor costs would rise, first pressuring profit margins, and then prices. Indeed, we cannot rule out such a process if labor productivity growth simply levels out. Our ability to forecast, when a diminishing pool of potential workers begins to raise costs or when productivity trends change, is limited. We do know, however, that if, and when, either materializes, inflation pressures are likely to again surface.
To return to my opening question: can we project how long the economy of the United States can act as a buffer to weakness elsewhere?
The answer: Not easily. History counsels us that sharp changes in direction are rarely, if ever, anticipated. Indeed, were these changes readily apparent, presumably, businesses would adjust to that anticipation and, hence, significantly damp the cyclical tendencies in the economy.

HEADLINE: Jordan's King Heading West With a Plea on Debt

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, May 6

 BODY:
Since his father's death propelled him to the throne, King Abdullah of Jordan has been a man in motion. He has installed a new Government, moved to shore up his country's troubled economy and scurried around the region to patch up relations with Arab neighbors.
Now the 37-year-old ruler is embarking on another trip, this one to try to persuade Western governments to cancel $3.5 billion in Jordan's obligations, fully half the country's debt. He said today that this was necessary to help Jordan, which has proved pivotal to peace in the Middle East, become "more stable." 
 "You need Jordan to be strong so that we can shoulder our responsibilities and be able to support the countries of the region," King Abdullah said over a long lunch with foreign journalists, his first such interview since taking power.
The King's emphasis on the economy represents a shift in focus from that of his father, King Hussein, who died on Feb. 7 and whose main priority had been Middle East peace. But King Abdullah spoke with both candor and concern today in suggesting that his country needed more outside help. "We're not in a crisis period," he said, but added, "Time is short."
With just four million people and few natural resources, Jordan owes a staggering $7 billion to Western creditors, and its debt payments now consume a quarter of its budget. Unemployment has soared well into the double-digits, average incomes have plunged, and diplomats say they worry that mounting social discontent could make it difficult for Jordan to play its stabilizing role in the region.
The King said he was not worried about domestic unrest. But as he prepared to leave on Saturday on a journey that will take him to Britain, Germany, Canada and the United States, he argued that the combination of Jordan's problems and its strategic significance meant that Western leaders would be prudent to halve its debt burden.
"What I'm saying is we are keeping up our side of the bargain," he said, referring to steps that Jordan has already taken at the advice of the International Monetary Fund. "We are moving forward, we are moving according to the way you've advised to do it. Please meet us halfway and help us to continue."
King Abdullah said he was grateful for steps already taken by the Clinton Administration, which canceled hundreds of millions of Jordanian debt in 1994 after King Hussein made peace with Israel and has tripled its aid to Jordan in the last two years, to $700 million a year.
Forgiving $3.5 billion in debt would be a much bigger step, however. Most of it would have to be borne by the Europeans, who are Jordan's biggest creditors, and some have sent mixed signals. A British emissary, Derek Fatchett, said here this week that European countries were ready to help ease Jordan's debt problems, but Mr. Fatchett mentioned debt rescheduling, not debt forgiveness.
The King was asked what would happen if his request is not met. "No matter what cards are dealt," he answered, "we will persevere. But at what expense?"
Since he inherited the throne, King Abdullah has grown a beard, and he has also grown in confidence, apparently as a result of his rapid immersion in statesmanship. He was named Crown Prince in January, replacing the longtime official heir, Prince Hassan, just days before his father's death from cancer.
But he said that he had recognized that there was "no time to feel sorry for oneself" or for the "great loss of King Hussein," who died after 47 years on the throne. "We had to focus and get things together so that people could feel secure, and move forward," he said, adding, "I was always told by my father, you get knocked down, you get right back up."
Another item in his conversations with Western leaders, King Abdullah said, will be policy toward Iraq, whose citizens' suffering under the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait strikes angry nerves in Jordan.
Jordan was outspoken in calling for a change in the Iraqi Government in the mid-1990's, but it retreated from that stance under King Hussein and, if anything, King Abdullah seemed today to back further away. He said he believed that dialogue with Iraq might be more productive than continued sanctions, and he vowed that Jordan would play no role in any American-led efforts to topple the Iraqi leadership.
In the interview, King Abdullah seemed determined to dispel any impression that he has begun to turn his back on Israel. Jordan's peace with Israel remains deeply unpopular here, but the King said that, like his father, he was "absolutely committed" to it.
Still, it has been widely noticed in the Middle East that the King's first foreign visits were made to Arab countries, including Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have been hostile toward Israel and have often criticized Jordan's separate peace.
"I want relationships with everybody, and I think we can do that," the King insisted. But he also said that, in reaching out to Arabs with whom relations have been cold, one of his motivations had been to "reassure our nationals, many of whom had worried that Jordan might have severed too many Arab bonds."
The King said he held out hope that Israel and the Palestinians could quickly resume negotiations after the Israeli elections on May 17. If there is momentum in those talks, he predicted, it might well produce a "cascade effect that could smooth over other differences, including those between Israel and Syria."
King Abdullah has maintained a studied neutrality on the Israeli elections. All three men seeking to become Israel's next Prime Minister have visited Amman recently, and the King has held a private meeting with each of them. But it is no secret in Amman that King Hussein had come to see Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud Party leader, as an obstacle to a broader peace, and a slip of the tongue by King Abdullah today seemed to suggest that he might prefer one of Mr. Netanyahu's two rivals.
The King said he would be optimistic about peace "if we have a new face in Israel," and then he caught himself. What he had meant to say, he insisted, was "if we have a new phase."

HEADLINE: Insurers Agree to Pay on Victims' Pre-Holocaust Policies

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, May 6

 BODY:
Several large European insurance companies agreed for the first time today to pay claims on prewar policies of Holocaust victims, under a formula that reflects present-day values. The settlement could potentially result in billions of dollars in payments.
The exact terms of the agreement, reached after two days of rancorous negotiations in London, were not released, and the insurers declined to comment on them. But the broad outlines of the agreement were announced by the World Jewish Congress, which participated in the negotiations, and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the former Secretary of State who is chairman of the committee that has been conducting the negotiations. 
 The agreement was seen as a significant breakthrough on an issue haunting Europe more than 50 years after World War II. It is the latest unfolding of an effort that began some three years ago to secure financial reparations from Swiss banks for survivors of the Nazis.
Since then, the effort, led by American Jewish groups, senior United States officials and American lawyers, has mushroomed to encompass claims against European insurance companies and German corporations accused of employing slave labor. Just Wednesday, for example, Volkswagen was sued in the United States on behalf of former Polish and Russian slave laborers who claim their children died in a decrepit nursery run by the German auto maker during World War II.
The agreement with the insurers is significantly different from other settlements of Holocaust claims because it takes into account a half-century of inflation, interest payments and currency depreciation, which could drastically magnify the size of payouts.
The formula for determining the exact amount of payments has not been worked out yet, but estimates of the total cost of the agreement have ranged from $1 billion to $4 billion.
Mr. Eagleburger will lead a separate committee to resolve the value of the policies before negotiations resume in Jerusalem next month.
A statement on the agreement by Mr. Eagleburger did not say how claims would be verified. But it said he had instructed his staff to "establish the claims process and begin work on the outreach process necessary to inform potential insurance claimants that they can file claims."
Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said the insurance companies agreed to make the payments only after Mr. Eagleburger threatened to publicly state that negotiations were a failure due to the insurers' intransigence. The insurance companies at the negotiations are some of the biggest in the industry: Allianz A.G. of Germany, AXA of France, Assicurazioni Generali of Italy, Winterthur of Switzerland and Anglo-Swiss Zurich Financial Services. Many other European insurance companies are not party to the deal.
At issue were thousands of life and other insurance policies -- and possibly many more -- taken out in prewar Europe by Jews who later died or suffered under the Holocaust. For decades after the war, insurance companies avoided paying out on the policies, arguing in some cases that, since their Eastern European subsidiaries had been nationalized by Communist governments in the postwar era, they were not responsible.
But, more recently, regulators in the United States, notably in California, put pressure on the European insurers. California threatened to suspend the business licenses of more than 100 European insurers unless they moved to settle with claimants.
On Wednesday night, after the first day of negotiations, Mr. Steinberg said that the talks were stalled on many issues, including the policy values and the insurance company nationalizations.
Today, after a second day of discussions, Mr. Steinberg said that "the rabbit was pulled from the hat" after Mr. Eagleburger told insurance company negotiators that he would disclose their attitude to the press.
Until all of the details are worked out, Mr. Steinberg said, the insurance companies agreed to make what he called "fast-track" payments to some of the thousands of aging people with direct claims on the policies. In addition, he said, the companies agreed to assume responsibility for policies predating the postwar nationalization of insurance subsidiaries.
Financial analysts said today's agreement was unlikely to eat significantly into the European insurance companies' huge holdings. But, some analysts said, the companies may have feared setting a precedent that would be used by American lawyers who won a $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks and are also pursuing class-action suits against German companies that employed slave labor.
In that case the issue of the value of wartime money translated into 1999 terms would assume significance because the German Government has already paid some claims that Jewish groups now consider to be too low.
Mr. Eagleburger is to meet Chancellor Gerhard Schroder along with Israel Singer of the World Jewish Congress next week to discuss that issue.

HEADLINE: Don't Quarantine Our Scientists

BYLINE: By Bill Richardson; Bill Richardson is the Secretary of Energy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The evidence of Chinese espionage has cast much-needed attention on improving security at our nuclear weapons laboratories after years of security practices that have been insufficiently tough and vigilant.
But in the name of protecting our nuclear secrets, some in Congress are proposing to end scientific collaboration with some of the world's best foreign scientists. That misguided approach would actually harm our national security. 
 Cooperation with foreign scientists can be conducted safely when the classified areas of the weapons laboratories are properly secured. Since becoming Secretary of Energy in September, I have put strong measures in place to better protect nuclear secrets.
Our new policy requires background checks on all foreign visitors from sensitive countries. We have placed seasoned counterintelligence professionals, many with decades of F.B.I. experience, at the three national weapons labs to screen foreign visitors and to advise our people about what to anticipate and defend against when going abroad. We are requiring polygraph tests for employees working in the most sensitive areas. And there has been a 15-fold increase in the counterintelligence budget since 1996.
To improve computer security, I took the unprecedented step of suspending operations on all classified computers in all three weapons laboratories -- Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Sandia -- for two weeks so computer security improvements could be put in place more quickly.
Science underpins all we do in maintaining our nuclear weapons. If we quarantined our scientists, isolating them from others in their fields, we would prevent them from keeping current with international research in unclassified areas like computer modeling, metallurgy and atomic physics that are essential to our ability to maintain nuclear weapons.
For example, the best atomic-physics codes -- unclassified codes about the structure of atoms -- are now written abroad. Hundreds of physicists around the world work to test and improve these codes, which scientists at our laboratories then adapt to support classified weapons work.
Ending international collaboration would make it harder to attract the most promising young scientists to this field. How could we lure talented people if they knew that they would be isolated from their foreign peers? Einstein, Teller and Fermi were all born abroad, and all of them did work that benefited the United States before they became American citizens.
Cutting off our international work would harm American security in other ways as well.
We send our workers to Russia because their expertise is needed to help secure hundreds of tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium from theft by rogue states or terrorists. Energy Department employees are installing detection devices at Russia's airports to prevent nuclear smuggling. We are keeping former Soviet weapons scientists employed in Russia in peaceful enterprises so they aren't forced by economic hardship to accept weapons work in Iraq or other rogue nations. Our laboratory employees are also securing spent nuclear fuel in North Korea to prevent that country from restarting its weapons program.
All of that work would grind to a halt if a moratorium was imposed on contacts with foreign scientists.
Among the foreign visitors to our labs are inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency who are receiving unclassified training so they can monitor adherence to nuclear treaties and prevent the diversion of nuclear materials. These visits to unclassified areas of the weapons labs reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation and conflict.
We can have open science with international collaboration while protecting our national secrets. The right way to accomplish this is through strong security and counterintelligence efforts -- and we are doing that.
The wrong way would be to draw an iron curtain around the laboratories, isolating them from the world. We would pay a huge price for such isolation in a weakened defense. And in the end, we would damage the very security we seek to protect.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
InflationRemains a Danger, Greenspan Warns

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Despite a remarkable run of prosperity that he credited in large part to new technology, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, delivered his bluntest warning in months today that the economy could still be derailed by its old nemesis, inflation.
Delivering a sweeping analysis of the forces reshaping the economy at home and abroad, Mr. Greenspan said the ability of businesses to use rapid advances in computers and communications to hold down costs and produce higher-quality goods and services had helped hold down price increases, bolster the stock market and allow the economy to grow robustly. 
 But he said it would be risky to assume that technology could continue to keep the economy and Wall Street surging forever or that the business cycle and all the old economic rules had been repealed.
"As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in our economy that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of strong growth and low inflation to a close," Mr. Greenspan said in remarks to bankers in Chicago. Excerpts, page C8.
At the top of his list was declining unemployment, which he said would eventually push wages and perhaps prices higher in an inflationary spiral. He added the possibility of a stock market downturn, which he said would cause consumers and businesses to cut their spending. And he said the rapidly growing trade deficit could one day become unsustainable, though it has caused no trouble so far.
Mr. Greenspan's inflation warning and his observation that many people think stocks have risen to levels "well beyond the justifiable" rattled Wall Street, sending bond prices sharply lower and equities down slightly. Page C8.
While it gave no indication that the Fed has any plans to raise interest rates, Mr. Greenspan's speech seemed intended as a cautionary flag to those investors and economists who have concluded that the United States has built a "new economy" in which inflation has been vanquished, corporate earnings will rise forever and the central bank remains on the sidelines.
Mr. Greenspan has helped drive the talk of a new economy by holding back pressure from traditionalists inside and outside the Fed for interest rate increases as steady growth has pushed unemployment down to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent without generating inflation. But Mr. Greenspan is very sensitive to any impression that he has gone soft on price stability, and today he planted one foot firmly in the inflation-hawk camp without quite removing the other from the new age camp.
"I do not say we are in a new era, because I have experienced too many alleged new eras in my lifetime that have come and gone," said Mr. Greenspan, who is 73 and has been running the Fed for almost 12 years.
"We are far more likely, instead, to be experiencing a structural shift similar to those that have visited our economy from time to time in the past," he said. "These shifts can have profound effects, often overriding conventional economic patterns for a number of years, before those patterns begin to show through again over the longer term."
Economists said they still expected the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 18. But they said Mr. Greenspan clearly wanted to guard against complacency within the Fed and in the financial markets, especially if the unemployment rate falls again when the Labor Department releases jobs data for April on Friday morning.
"He may have felt he needed a way to get our feet back on the ground without going overboard in that direction," said L. Douglas Lee, an economist at HSBC Securities.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan was careful to point out the economy's strong points in addition to the potential pitfalls. He noted that the worst of the global financial crisis seemed to have passed. And he devoted much of his speech to the case that technology has greatly improved the growth rate of productivity, or output per worker, the measure considered the most important in determining the economy's long-run potential.
Productivity growth, which has been sluggish for nearly three decades and which slipped below 1 percent in the early 1990's, averaged 3 percent over the most recent four quarters, Mr. Greenspan said.
The Fed chairman said the reason appeared to be the heavy investment in technology made by American business over the last five years. Computers, data bases, and faster and more reliable communication have all enabled companies to operate more efficiently by reducing their need for extra inventories of parts and extra workers, he said, since they have a much better handle on what is happening almost minute by minute in their markets and within their operations.
The consistent increases in analysts' projections for long-term corporate earnings growth, Mr. Greenspan said, suggests that companies are telling Wall Street that they expect productivity increases driven by technology to continue.
The surge in business investment in technology, Mr. Greenspan said, has not only restrained costs but also helped to expand industrial capacity faster than industrial output. The resulting excess in capacity has in turn helped keep prices down, helping offset any pressure from tight labor.
The result, Mr. Greenspan said, has been a "truly phenomenal" economic performance in recent years. But he said it was unclear how long it could continue.
If productivity growth "should level out or actually falter because additional technology synergies fail to materialize, or because output per hour has been less tied to technology in the first place, inflationary pressures could re-emerge, possibly faster than some currently perceive feasible," Mr. Greenspan said.
Beyond a slowdown in productivity, the biggest potential threat to the continuation of expansion, now in its ninth year, is from a tight labor market, the Fed chairman said.
"At some point, labor market conditions can become so tight that the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will then eventually begin to accelerate," Mr. Greenspan said.
Should the stock market tumble, Mr. Greenspan said, "consumer and business investment demands would doubtless weaken considerably."
A more distant concern, Mr. Greenspan said, is the mounting trade deficit.
"There is no evidence at this point that markets are disinclined to readily finance our foreign net imbalance," Mr. Greenspan said. "But the arithmetic of foreign debt accumulation and compounding interest costs does indicate somewhere in the future that, unless reversed, our growing international imbalances are apt to create significant problems for our economy."

HEADLINE: TENNIS;
Dynamic Sisters Roll Along In Rome

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

DATELINE: ROME, May 6

 BODY:
The scene is the same this spring at the Foro Italico the clay just as red, the cypresses just as green -- but the women's roles are changing. The Williams sisters are walking tall and making big strides, and the vast majority of their competitors are not keeping up.
Together, which is the way they still prefer to be, Venus and her younger sibling, Serena, have already combined to win five singles titles this year: three for Venus and two for Serena. 
 And today at the Italian Open, against opponents who once gave them trouble, the sisters took turns underscoring their progress.
Serena was the first Williams to make her point by defeating Irina Spirlea, 6-2, 6-3. Then, with Serena watching from the stands, Venus handled Anna Kournikova, 6-2, 6-2.
In an earlier match, second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, now underpowered and still searching for good form after a hand injury, was upset in straight sets by Sylvia Plischke of Austria.
Spirlea, a tall, straight-talking Romanian, exchanged a chest bump and harsh words with Venus at the 1997 United States Open. The tension between her and America's first tennis family has since dissipated, but at last year's United States Open, Spirlea put an end to Serena's tournament when she defeated her in the third round in three sets.
Since then, Serena won her first tour event in Paris and then won again at Indian Wells in March.
"I think she's not giving you anymore the chance," Spirlea said. "She's not missing as much as she was missing."
Serena, ranked 10th, is also creeping inside the baseline with increasing regularity, hitting her ground strokes and service returns earlier and getting into the net with some frequency on a surface that is not always forgiving of net-rushers. Her body language is different, too; her movement during and between points is more economical and cocksure.
"I guess the thing that has really moved up is my mental," she said. "I know how to work the game more and play points better. It's just something that's grown. At the U.S. Open, I hadn't won a tournament, but now I know what to do playing people like her in her game."
Venus already knew what to do against Kournikova when they first played in the final in Key Biscayne, Fla., last year. She won in three sets, but at the time, it was uncertain which of the teen-agers was heading to the top the fastest.
With Williams at a career-high No. 5 in this week's ranking and Kournikova, who has yet to win a tour event, at No. 13, the sport now has the answer. And though Kournikova has split with the coach Pavel Slozil and stopped double-faulting at an embarrassing clip, she could not find a way to keep Venus from firing service winners and pulling her uncomfortably wide with big ground strokes.
In Friday's quarterfinals, Serena should have the trickier test. While Venus will face 11th-seeded Dominique Van Roost, Serena will face No. 1 Martina Hingis, the only player not named Williams who has won more tournaments than Serena this year.
Asked if that meant Hingis, Venus and Serena were now the world's top three, Serena did not hesitate. "Definitely," she said. "Of course. The statistics show it. It's just a fact for sure."
Though the WTA computer does not yet reflect it, Hingis concurs, and now she wants revenge for her 6-4, 7-6 loss to Serena in the semifinals last month in Key Biscayne.
"The difference is this is on clay, and I'm a more confident player, and I take her more seriously than last time," Hingis said tonight after her straight-set defeat of Corina Morariu. "She was kind of cocky on the court, and that kind of ticked me off in a way. But this time, it's going to be different."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN KOSOVO: MOSCOW;
Russians Satisfied at Return To the Diplomatic Spotlight

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 6

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin's foreign-policy aides greeted the new framework for peace in Kosovo with a hint of pleasure at their return to the diplomatic spotlight and a determination that the country not appear to be merely a tool of the West.
Mr. Yeltsin's domestic advisers could not help but regard it as a small but significant victory for the President, who has struggled to control Russia's policy on Yugoslavia in the face of ever more militant -- and popular -- anti-Western oratory by Communist and nationalist forces. 
 In statements after the agreement was made public, Mr. Yeltsin's envoy to the United Nations, Sergei Lavrov, and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov were quick to emphasize that they believed that Western intransigence remained the major roadblock to peace talks and an end to the crisis.
Mr. Lavrov said the West had only now agreed to terms for peace negotiations that Russia had been proposing for weeks. Mr. Ivanov used the announcement for renewed strenuous criticism of NATO's air war against Serbia.
"It's too early to talk about any sense of satisfaction today because unfortunately, NATO's bombing and missile attacks go on, people go on dying and the flow of refugees goes on," Mr. Ivanov, said. "After a long period, we've managed to get the settlement of this problem back to the United Nations, which alone is capable of solving this."
The statements echoed the increasingly hostile attacks on the West in general, and the United States in particular, that have come from the Kremlin in the last few weeks. Mr. Yeltsin has steadily edged Russia's policy on the Kosovo situation from moderate criticism of the West to threats of a diplomatic breach and war, as many average Russians have come to regard NATO as the agent of a new, anti-Russian Western empire.
Even today, hours before the agreement was announced, Mr. Yeltsin accused NATO of "naked aggression" against Yugoslavia and warned that "the shadow of war is hanging over Europe." His criticism was part of a statement marking the 55th anniversary of Russian liberation of the Ukrainian seaport of Sevastopol from Nazi troops.
The practical effect of the attacks has been to steal some of the thunder of the Communists and nationalists who control Russia's legislature, and who have demanded that Russia give Serbia weapons and even its own forces to battle NATO jets.
The two blocs will vote within days in the lower house of the legislature on whether to impeach Mr. Yeltsin, a move that probably would erase any political power the President has managed to retain after a year of illness and economic collapse.
 But whatever Mr. Yeltsin's oratory, Russia's actual involvement in the Kosovo situation has been directed not by hard-liners, but by former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a Yeltsin ally who is a familiar and moderate face in dealings with the United States and Europe.
Mr. Chernomyrdin's brokering of today's agreement on a framework for peace talks gives Mr. Yeltsin an increasingly rare political and diplomatic victory on the eve of the legislature's impeachment debate.
Mr. Yeltsin's critics have asserted for weeks that Mr. Chernomyrdin was destined to become a stooge for the West, delivering NATO ultimatums to Serbia rather than negotiating a peace.
The daily newspaper Izvestia suggested this week that the United States was merely paying lip service to Mr. Chernomyrdin's efforts as a cost-free way to demonstrate good will toward Moscow. In reality, the newspaper asserted, Washington was using Mr. Chernomyrdin to divide Russia and Serbia.
But parts of today's pact appeared to mirror what Mr. Chernomyrdin and other Russian officials have been publicly proposing in the last two weeks. Mr. Chernomyrdin said on Sunday, for example, that Serbia would agree to the placement of armed peacekeepers in Kosovo.
Mr. Yeltsin's Defense Minister, Igor Sergeyev, said during a visit to Norway this week that the Yugoslavia crisis could not be solved without an international military presence in Kosovo, and proposed using the armed forces of those Scandinavian countries that are not in NATO.

HEADLINE: Retail Boom Isn't Reliant Only on Rich

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Michael Gonzales, a waiter from Los Angeles who earns about $25,000 a year, has been in a buying mood lately. "Things are going well for me these days," he reflected, while shopping at Home Depot in Los Angeles for supplies to refurbish his apartment. "It's not like I'm spending mountains of cash. Just enough for a few comforts."
Mr. Gonzales, 28, adds, "I'm older, so I can't stand living someplace that looks ratty." 
 Whether snapping up bathroom fixtures at Home Depot, shrink-wrapped T-shirts at Old Navy or wide-screen televisions at Circuit City, American consumers are on a rampage, increasing their spending even faster than they did last year. In the first four months of 1999, sales in stores open at least one year rose 6.7 percent from the corresponding period in 1998, one of the biggest jumps in years, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. That increase comes on top of a dizzying 5.1 percent increase last year.
For growth in consumption to accelerate after eight years of economic expansion is a surprise -- the torrid pace had been expected to slow. Retail analysts and economists now point to several factors, including the continued rise of both the stock market and home values, to explain much of the gains. But another change is also helping: While the wealthiest consumers powered the expansion in its early stages, spending by those households in the bottom 40 percent, which is defined as people making up to $28,500 a year, has been picking up. Real growth in wages and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years have spread the shopping spree into every corner of American society.
"Our research shows that for the first time in two and a half decades, workers' broad-based wage gains are generally driving consumption throughout the economy," said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute based in Washington. "It is not just the wealth bubble at the top."
During the first years of the economy's expansion, middle- and low-income Americans increased their spending, but at a much slower pace than those households making more than $47,000. Consumption by those earning less than $28,500 grew 10 percent from 1993 (a nadir in consumer spending for this group) through 1997, whereas spending by the richest fifth of Americans, those earning over $73,000, grew 25 percent, according to Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University who has analyzed the Federal Government's Consumer Expenditure Survey. Mr. Wolff projects that this will change when the Government data are made available for 1998. Spending by the group making less than $47,000 will have grown by 5 percent, he estimates, and spending by the richest by only 3 percent.
Given that the inflation-adjusted pay of the lowest wage earners has grown 5 percent to 10 percent since 1996 while their savings rate has hovered around zero, economists say it is safe to conclude that their additional earnings are going to new purchases. The earned-income tax credit (expanded in 1994) has also given them some additional buying power.
But low earners are taking on additional debt, too, as credit card companies court them and Federal programs encourage them to buy their own homes and assume mortgages.
"When we get the '98 and '99 data, it will become very clear that they are accounting for a very sizable share of the growth in consumer spending," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist for RFA, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
All this is not to discount the spending power of the rich. As the biggest beneficiaries of sharp gains in the stock market, the wealthiest fifth of Americans are consuming as conspicuously as ever. Their intense appetite for luxury items has created a boom market for upscale cars and for homes that rival the gaudiest mansions of the Gilded Age. One sign of the giddy spending is the fierce resurgence of the ultimate income showpiece: fur. Not only are mink stoles in fashion for the fall, but designers are using fancy animal pelts for all manner of clothing from sweaters of royal blue chinchilla to skirts in shearling.
But if the rich are enjoying a sumptuous banquet, the remainder of Americans are not just scooping up table scraps, as many critics of Reaganomics argued was the case in the 1980's expansion. In everything from apparel to electronics to home furnishings, these Americans are making their mark.
Most notably, they are speeding the rise of discount stores and highlighting the growing troubles of retailers that cater to the middle market. In previous economic booms, low-income people tended to trade up to more expensive stores. This time around, they are sticking with those that offer them the best deals, and they are being joined by more affluent Americans, who are increasingly willing to shop both in boutiques and in stores that offer cut-rate prices.
In previous months, the surging buying power of lower-income earners helped move Target Stores, the Kmart Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to the head of the retail pack. In April, sales at discount stores rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs, much slower than in previous months but still impressive considering that Easter sales were recorded in March this year.
This segment is winning big because it has transformed itself from grimly pragmatic to stylish yet affordable. Target, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, is the most obvious practitioner of the strategy, but not its only one. It employs a brigade of trend hunters who bring the hippest clothing designs to the stores in a timely manner and recently unveiled a home design collection by the renowned architect Michael Graves, featuring retro-chic tea kettles and toasters.
"Four years ago there were no major brands in the discounters; then somebody finally woke up," said Adelle Kirk, director of marketing for Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm. "These days discounters very successfully deliver fashion, terrific merchandising, and brands -- all at value prices."
Some market researchers argue that the more polished approach, in the best tradition of retail, is doing more than simply filling a need. It is also creating new desires to fuel the economy. In other words, Martha Stewart, the home-and-hearth avatar whose products are now available at Kmart stores, is making upscale design touches like 200-thread-count cotton bed sheets something that most every American can aspire to.
Jessica Clark, 21, has two jobs, one as a data entry clerk at a bank and another as a cashier at a grocery store. She says she regularly visits Target in her home town of Memphis, even on evenings when she goes out with friends.
"I always spend way too much when I come here, but I always find other things to buy," Ms. Clark laments. "Today I came to buy detergent and fabric softener, and I ended up with two plastic lawn chairs, plants, electronic games, candles, socks and a utility knife. I thought I would spend maybe $25, but I spent $106 instead. Every time I come here, I do that."
The other winners in this environment are also stores that emphasize good value. These includes Home Depot Inc. and the electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc. Old Navy, the stylish low-cost clothing chain started by the Gap in 1994, has also repeatedly registered double-digit sales growth in the last year and reported a 7 percent increase in the latest monthly sales report.
Meanwhile, stores that cater to the middle class, like Sears, Roebuck & Company and the J. C. Penney Company, are finding it hard to get solid footing. Both stores yesterday reported slight sales declines in April from a year ago.
Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc., said, "The companies that are losing market share need to reposition themselves as value leaders, or they are not going to last."

HEADLINE: Panel Allows Senate Vote on Whitman's Pick for Court

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 6

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's nominee to the State Supreme Court cleared an important hurdle today, when the Senate Judiciary Committee moved to allow the full Senate to vote on his confirmation on Monday.
But support among Republicans for the nominee, Attorney General Peter G. Verniero, appeared to erode slightly, and it remained unclear whether the administration would hold together enough votes to win his confirmation. 
 Mr. Verniero, who endured two grueling days of confirmation hearings before the committee, retains the enthusiastic backing of the Governor. The Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, who leads the Republicans' 24-to-16 majority, predicted today that Mr. Verniero would win the necessary 21 votes.
Mrs. Whitman's choice of Mr. Verniero for the court has run into unexpectedly fierce opposition over accusations that state troopers have engaged in racial profiling and over Mr. Verniero's legal experience.
In the day since the state Bar Association announced that it had studied Mr. Verniero's credentials and found him "not qualified" to sit on the high court, two Republican senators, including Robert J. Martin, a law professor at Seton Hall University, have announced that they would vote against him. Moments after the Judiciary Committee's party-line vote, Democrats announced that all 16 of their members would oppose the confirmation.
That means Mr. Verniero's fate, which has become an increasingly personal issue for Governor Whitman, may hinge on the votes of six Republicans who have yet to declare their intentions.
"I am confident that the nomination will be approved by the full Senate," the Governor said in a statement released after the committee vote.
Mr. Verniero told reporters after the vote that the testy questions and critical assessments of his credentials during the televised public hearings had been difficult for his family. Despite the political furor surrounding his nomination, Mr. Verniero said he was not daunted by the prospect that he might be approved with the backing of a single party.
"If the Senate as a whole sees fit to confirm me, I will be an associate justice for everybody," he said.
For more than two months, the nomination has consumed the political agenda in the state capital. During the hearings, Mr. Verniero received support from a procession of Republican political leaders who praised his record.
Democrats countered by saying that Mr. Verniero's resume was dominated by political appointments, and that he lacked the legal experience and intellectual independence to handle the rigors of New Jersey's high court.
Beyond Mr. Verniero's resume and performance as a Whitman appointee, however, the nomination has become intertwined in a variety of fractious issues, from charges of racial discrimination by the New Jersey State Police to the financial collapse of the New Jersey HIP Health Maintenance Organization.
The Legislature's Black and Latino Caucus, made up of 18 assemblymen and 4 senators, said that Mr. Verniero's response to the racial profiling issue was reason enough to oppose his nomination. Assemblyman Joseph Charles Jr., a Jersey City Democrat, told the committee that Mr. Verniero had subjected thousands of black and Latino drivers to discrimination by failing to react aggressively to a Gloucester County judge's 1996 ruling that troopers had illegally singled out black and Hispanic drivers for stops and searches.
Senator Martin said a combination of factors persuaded him to break ranks with Republican leadership and oppose the nomination.
"I think there are limitations in his experience," Mr. Martin said, "and while I don't think he is racially biased in any way, I think there are steps he should have taken earlier, especially given the gravity of the situation."
But Senator William Gormley, a Republican from May's Landing, said the hearings had convinced him that the breadth of Mr. Verniero's administrative experience made him qualified to sit on the court. Mr. Gormley added that the Attorney General was not alone in failing to respond quickly enough to accusations of racial discrimination by the state police.
"Profiling is not just a Peter Verniero issue," said Mr. Gormley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "It's something for all of us to do something about. And you can't just take one person and make him responsible."
Mr. DiFrancesco said he thought much of the opposition to Mr. Verniero was based on his lack of rapport with many lawmakers. When Mr. Verniero was Governor Whitman's chief of staff, some senators from both parties were put off by his stiff personal style and often dismissive attitude toward legislators. Mr. DiFrancesco said he hoped that senators could look beyond those personality traits to evaluate Mr. Verniero's qualifications.
Mr. DiFrancesco said he also thought Democrats were using the issue to attack Governor Whitman, who has announced her intention to run for the United States Senate in 2000.

Every U.S. Income Group Seems to Be Spending More
American consumers are spending faster than they did last year. In the first four months of this year, sales in stores open at least a year rose 6.7 percent, one of the biggest jumps in years. That came on top of a dizzying 5.1 percent increase last year.

Retail Sales Rose 3% in April
Sales at retail stores open at least a year rose 3 percent in April as shoppers snapped up spring fashions at clothing chains such as Ann Taylor and department stores. But sales at some of the biggest retailers may start to slow, analysts and investors said. That could hurt stocks like Gap and Wal-Mart that have surged. Yesterday, shares of Wal-Mart fell $2.1875, to $42.875, even though its sales met expectations. C19.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Drop Barriers Between Nation's Financial Industries

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The Senate approved legislation tonight that would overhaul the nation's financial system, removing barriers largely created during the Depression that have limited the ability of banks, insurance companies and securities firms to expand into one another's businesses.
By a 54-to-44 vote along party lines, the Senate adopted a measure sought by the three industries and written by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas and chairman of the banking committee. It would repeal the core provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and later laws that industry executives say have made it increasingly difficult to compete with foreign conglomerates unhindered by similar laws. 
 President Clinton has threatened to veto the Senate legislation, and his aides have expressed a decided preference for most of the provisions in a competing version that has been moving quickly through the House.
Senators will await the action in the House, where banking legislation with broad bipartisan support has been approved by the banking committee, and could be considered by the full chamber soon. Last year, the House adopted comprehensive banking legislation by the narrowest of margins, only to see it die in the Senate when it was blocked by Mr. Gramm.
Administration officials say the President would veto the Senate version because it would dilute requirements that banks make loans to minorities, farmers and others who have had little access to credit. The legislation also contains provisions that have been criticized by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin because they reduce his department's oversight of banks.
But privately, some Democrats and Administration officials say that Mr. Clinton might agree to legislation if the objectionable provisions in the Senate measure were watered down or eliminated when the House and Senate negotiate a final bill in conference. The only Democrat voting for the bill tonight was Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina.
The legislation approved has been hailed by big banks, insurers and Wall Street investment houses as a monumental step forward because it deregulates the financial services industry for the first time in more than 60 years. Consumer groups and civil rights organizations have called it a giant step backward, rolling back protective measures adopted in the 1970's.
The Senate measure was sharply criticized tonight by the nation's top securities regulator, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who said it would undermine significant protection now afforded to investors. Mr. Levitt said the legislation posed "a real danger to investors" because it violated "the principle of functional -- I call it 'consistent' -- regulation."
"This is a giant turf battle that in my opinion jeopardizes investor protection," he added.
But some Wall Street executives strongly praised the legislation and said it demonstrated how the leadership abilities of Senator Gramm had been underestimated.
"That Chairman Gramm achieved passage of this bill by holding to his ambitious schedule and not giving in on key issues bodes well for ultimate passage of modernization legislation," said Mark C. Brickell, a managing director of J. P. Morgan Securities.
Mr. Gramm called his bill "a major step toward changing the fundamental structure of financial services in America."
"It will greatly increase the kinds of services being offered to Americans," he told reporters during the final vote. "We have assured those services will not only be available, but will also be cheaper."
While the legislation would remove many obstacles now imposed on banks, insurance companies and securities houses, it would also reduce the role of the Treasury over new financial conglomerates and drastically scale back a 22-year-old law, the Community Reinvestment Act, that has encouraged billions of dollars in lending to inner cities, farmers and others.
For the last two decades, legislation to help modernize the banking system has had a perils-of-Pauline sort of story line, occasionally passing one chamber, only to fail in another, often because of the competing lobbying by the three powerful industries and struggles over authority among regulators.
While important policy issues remain to be resolved between Congress and the White House, many lobbyists predict that this will be the session when the lawmakers finally pass a more widely acceptable bill. Industries that have had many differences over the shape of the legislation are now largely in agreement.
"The industry groups have come out either supporting the bill or are neutral," Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, said. "We have been lobbying jointly with the insurance industry and the securities industry, often holding joint strategy sessions. That is really amazing, considering where we were a few years ago."
In part, the agreements have come because of legal loopholes and regulatory decisions that have punched wide gaps in the existing legal restrictions. Momentum for a new law has also grown as more financial conglomerates offer diversified services, from bank accounts to insurance, at separate affiliates.
In addition, the huge amount of money being raised by the interest groups for political campaigns has created a dynamic where no lawmaker wants to look like a spoiler. And the fact that the Senate and the House are moving so early in the legislative session suggests that compromises on the remaining disagreements can be reached in Congress.
Still, with no sign that either Mr. Gramm or Democrats in the House or the Administration will back down, the legislation could stall at any time.
Senate passage came after the White House, which has repeatedly been losing votes on the legislation, lost another vote today that had threatened to derail the bill. The Senate voted 53 to 46 to table an amendment endorsed by the White House and proposed by Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, and by the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, that would have restored greater authority to the Treasury to regulate financial conglomerates.
The Shelby-Daschle amendment, which mirrored a provision in legislation that was passed by the House banking committee, would have permitted the new conglomerates created by the legislation to operate securities underwriting and merchant banking units as subsidiaries within the banks rather than as separate institutions under the umbrella of a bank holding company.
As such, it would have given a greater regulatory role to the Treasury, which now regulates banks with national charters, and would ultimately diminish the authority of the Federal Reserve, which has lobbied fiercely against the provision.
The Shelby-Daschle provision was at the center of a major policy debate and struggle for authority between Mr. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Rubin has testified that the provision is essential because Treasury must have a regulatory role in order to formulate economic policy.
Mr. Greenspan has responded that by putting securities underwriting and merchant banking within a bank, large financial conglomerates would gain an unfair subsidy by having access to deposit insurance and the Federal clearinghouse system.
Seizing Mr. Greenspan's argument today, Mr. Gramm said that the Shelby-Daschle provision would politicize monetary policy.
"Do we really want a President to have the ability to use banking policy as a political tool?" he asked rhetorically. Transferring such authority to the Administration, he asserted, "would be a disaster for America."
To the consternation of many big banks and securities firms, Mr. Greenspan has also said that it would be better to have no bill than to have one that would permit banks to use operating subsidiaries to sell insurance and securities.
The Senate vote also followed the adoption of several other amendments. The Senators voted to create a law making it a crime for private investigators to call banks and pose as customers they are trying to investigate in order to get information about their accounts. They also approved a provision that would require all banks to post a schedule of fees at their automated teller machines.

HEADLINE: West Point Looks for Private Money to Improve Its Campus

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Forced to compete with increasingly wealthy universities while making do on a tight post-cold-war defense budget, the United States Military Academy at West Point today is announcing the first major private fund-raising campaign in the history of the service academies.
West Point, which gets nearly all its money from the Defense Department and gives full scholarships to every one of its 4,100 cadets, hopes to raise $150 million to endow professorships and to pay for amenities like improved athletic buildings and equipment. 
 "We have to make sure that West Point maintains itself as a tier one quality institution," said Lieut. Gen. Daniel W. Christman, who is West Point's Superintendent. He said that while the budget has remained roughly constant after inflation over many years, competition for the most desirable students has intensified.
"The other tier one schools we compete with are in the middle of what I describe to alumni as a war with each other -- for faculty, for modernization, for technology," he said. "We felt we could not go to Congress to ask for all of this. The reality -- and I've been around the Army 34 years -- is that we have rarely seen the fiscal constraints as tight as they have been."
The Army pays basic operating costs of about $175 million a year. But fund-raisers are quick to distinguish between "core needs," like the classes, military training and barracks essential for students working toward a bachelor's degree and military commission, and the extras that new money will pay for, like internships, expanded student recruitment and stadium viewing stands. Those extras are what General Christman and alumni leaders call "the margin of excellence."
In the two years of the quiet phase of the campaign, the period during which an institution approaches its best donors before announcing its campaign, West Point has raised nearly $100 million, including 19 gifts of $1 million or more.
In some ways, the fund-raising effort, formally named the Bicentennial Campaign because of West Point's 200th anniversary in 2002, is like any other university campaign.
It has the requisite wealthy alumni as co-chairmen, in this case Peter M. Dawkins (West Point '59), a Heisman Trophy winner and Rhodes scholar who is vice chairman of Citigroup's Travelers Insurance Company, and Dana G. Mead (West Point '57), a former White House Fellow and West Point professor who is now chairman and chief executive of Tenneco Corporation.
And it has the requisite contribution from an Internet baron: $7 million from Jim Kimsey (West Point '62), who led the first company of the 82d Airborne into the Dominican Republic in 1965 and 20 years later founded America Online.
But in critical ways, the campaign is unlike any other. For one thing, Federal employees are legally barred from asking for money from private donors, so the campaign is being run by West Point's alumni group, the Association of Graduates, with academy officials playing a supporting role.
Fund-raisers must also be cautious about corporate donations. Defense contractors would seem an obvious source of money, but alumni association officials are wary that such contributions could create a conflict of interest.
"We've always been very careful -- and the defense contractors have been very careful -- not to create a real or imagined quid pro quo, though we're not eliminating anyone," Mr. Mead said.
All contributions must be reviewed by Army lawyers at West Point or in Washington, said Lieut. Col. Michael W. Mahan, the alumni association's vice president for development. "It is sometimes an impediment to fund-raising," he added, "but the point is that there could be room for impropriety here and we have to take the time and effort to make sure that there isn't any."
Six companies, including Rockwell International, Lucent Technologies Microelectronics, and CAE Electronics, are on the preliminary list of 71 leadership donors to the campaign. Colonel Mahan said the biggest corporate gift so far is $1 million from MBNA America for a military ethics center.
The college must also be careful about how it attaches donor names to campus facilities, a standard perquisite for large contributors. "As with most public schools, we are trying to come up with tasteful naming opportunities," General Christman said. "But we do not put them in the main cadet areas so we don't modify the military ethos of the place."
The idea that West Point needs private money to supplement its public budget surprised General Christman when he signed on as Superintendent three years ago after serving as assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John M. Shalikashvili.
West Point, like the other service academies, has routinely accepted donations from its 45,000 alumni, but it had not cultivated them in the systematic way that other leading universities do. A good year meant about $5 million in donations, except when the alumni were raising money for a project, like a new alumni hall. Some private universities much larger than West Point take in hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
"We might have sent out a mailing once a year and had a few focused efforts to fund specific projects," Mr. Mead said.
Other service academies are either contemplating or planning similar campaigns. The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., said recently that it intended to begin a campaign but had not announced any specific goal of how much to raise. Richard M. Coppock, president of the alumni association at the Air Force Academy in Colorado, said yesterday that he expected it to do something similar.
West Point officials and alumni spent about a year discussing the possibility of a major fund-raising drive, how the money might be used and how much to seek. But it took time to convince alumni of the need.
"Most guys who have been to Vietnam feel, 'Hey, I gave at the office,' " said Mr. Kimsey, the America Online founder. He said he has been trying to persuade West Point friends to give. "This really is a sea change for them."
William P. McGoldrick, a former college development officer whose firm, Washburn & McGoldrick, was a consultant to West Point as it planned its campaign, said that the alumni are as passionate about their academy as those from colleges with the highest rates of giving, like Dartmouth and Williams, are about their alma maters.
The experience of attending West Point, including the first-year hazing program known as Beast Barracks, appears to have created a loyal alumni corps. In interviews with West Point alumni, Mr. McGoldrick said, many expressed strong affection for the institution. He recalled one who said, "Next to my wife, I love nothing more than West Point."
Mr. McGoldrick was also not expecting so many of the alumni to be wealthy. "In hindsight, we shouldn't have been surprised," he said, noting that although many West Point graduates stay in the military for 20 years or more, many others leave for careers in business. (In exchange for their free education, graduates must spend five years on active duty and three years in reserve.)
"Of the 52 individuals we interviewed, a third were chief executives, chief operating officers or chief financial officers at major U.S. corporations," Mr. McGoldrick said.
As in most college fund-raising, donors are giving money to projects that appeal to them. Mr. Mead, who holds a Ph.D. in political science and economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he was paying for four "Mead scholars" to work each summer in organizations like NATO, the United Nations or the Defense Department.
Mr. Dawkins, who was Captain of Cadets, senior class president and captain of the football team, is contributing $1 million toward a "vastly improved strength development center" for exercising.
"A steel bar and two coffee cans filled with cement is where I began," he said. But in his view, the academy needs the latest equipment, especially if it is to compete against heavily endowed football powerhouses.
"It is much more important for us than for a University of Michigan to have a world-class strength-development program," he said.
He and others contend that such extras are important to lure the strongest students possible.
"Many of us feel in our bones that the world is not going to get any less dangerous, and is not going to be any less in need of good leadership for the Army," Mr. Dawkins said. "So we should literally leave no stone unturned in trying to provide the very best."

Utica, Long in Decline, Welcomes an Influx of Refugees

 BODY:
They have names like Pavel, Xuan and Fikret, and each has come here, to this defeated factory town in the heart of the Mohawk River Valley, for his or her own terrible reasons.
For Pavel Brutsky and his people, Pentecostal Christians from the former Soviet Union, it was to escape religious persecution and the plainclothes policemen who came knocking during prayer sessions in their homes. 
 For Xuan Vu, a 32-year-old Amerasian woman born in Saigon, it was to seek the freedom denied them by a country that treats the offspring of American servicemen with suffocating contempt.
And for Fikret Keserovic, an industrious chain smoker from the Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa, it was to build a life of peace and security in Utica after years of war and fear in the Balkans.
"Who is hard worker, like America," Mr. Keserovic, 47, who makes $10 an hour as a warehouse clerk, said in a rich Slavic accent, proud of the English he has learned in the two and a half years he has been here.
Taking a pull on a cigarette inside Restaurant Sani, still the only place in Utica with a Bosnia Burger, he added: "Everybody here friendly. I have new house, new truck. Why not like?"
Utica, a scrappy burg built on the sweat of Italian, Irish and Polish immigrants, is staking its future on newly arrived refugees from Bosnia, Belarus and Vietnam.
After a decadeslong drain of factory jobs and people -- the city's population, which was 125,000 in 1960, dropped to 92,000 by 1975 and is now down to 64,000 -- city officials and local business leaders believe these refugees, many of whom were skilled professionals in their native lands, are Utica's best chance for prosperity.
"I'm damn happy they're coming in," said Utica's Mayor, Edward A. Hannah, a millionaire businessman who was elected to help reinvent the city's economy. "I don't care where they come from. We've been complaining about people moving to the suburbs. Now we're getting some help."
In other parts of the country, such comments may seem off kilter, even anachronistic, as anti-immigration sentiment in Congress has cut down on the annual number of foreigners legally allowed in and street-level backlashes against immigrants have become more common.
But Utica is not the Texas Gulf Coast, where immigrant Vietnamese shrimpers have endured sabotage by their resentful American-born peers. Nor does Utica have the endemic racial tensions of South Central Los Angeles or Brooklyn, where animosity between Korean grocers and their black customers, for instance, has cost several lives.
Though racial problems exist, as black residents here grow increasingly sensitive to the perception that the refugees get preferential treatment in jobs and housing, Utica, with its 7.1 percent unemployment rate, about three points higher than the national average, could still use more immigrants.
In fact, as the specter of Kosovar Albanian refugees becomes a reality elsewhere, with thousands bound for relocation in New Jersey, Mayor Hannah sounded almost disappointed that Utica would not get a share. "I would encourage other towns in America to open your gates, open your arms," Mr. Hannah said. "We need them as much as they need us."
That notion has proven true for most of the 6,500 refugees who have settled here, giving Utica a 1-in-10 refugee population, one of the highest ratios in the United States. Most are either Bosnians who fled the ethnic Balkans war, deeply religious Belarussian Christians or Vietnamese who had spent years in squalid refugee camps in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia.
More are on the way; about 1,000 refugees a year are expected to resettle here, according to the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees, a nonprofit agency that since 1979 has been the starting point for refugees seeking homes, jobs, language and health care services.
To a city reeling from the loss of 23,000 jobs -- two General Electric plants, a Lockheed-Martin plant and Griffiss Air Force Base have all closed in recent years -- these immigrants, known for being inexpensive but tireless workers, are pillars of a new economy based on small service and manufacturing companies.
"The influx of refugees has helped those businesses grow and expand," said Bob Fowler, president of the Mohawk Valley Chamber of Commerce. "In 15 years, if this continues, this is going to be the melting pot of America."
Such a renaissance, economic and cultural, is still years away, and Utica is still a hurting city of empty storefronts. For now, the refugees remain largely unseen, living quietly on Utica's rougher east side and working mostly in low- or mid-level jobs at dozens of smaller businesses throughout the region.
"Life is better here," said Anton Brutsky, 76, a Belarussian refugee, lounging on the steps outside his two-story brick apartment building, one of several identical row houses where hundreds of Pentecostal Christians from Belarus, Russia, Latvia and other former Soviet republics now live as neighbors.
Mr. Brutsky, his wife, Yelena, and nine children arrived in Utica 10 years ago from Stolin, Belarus, after years of intimidation by the Soviet authorities. "When they caught Christians gathered together in my house, it didn't matter why," Mr. Brutsky said through an interpreter, "they would fine us $100. That's a month's salary."
In Utica, he and his countrymen worship freely and often, attending services four times a week in their own Slavic Pentecostal Church, a Russian-language church built nearby by Soviet refugees.
Utica's refugee communities rarely mix. The Vietnamese live on the outer fringe of Utica's social fabric, while the Slavic Pentecostals stick mostly to their steady diet of church, family and work. The Bosnians have become Utica's newest class of entrepreneurs and home buyers.
"The Bosnians are very Euro," said Judith H. Winfield, the director of community relations for the refugee center. "They've worked in Germany. English is not as difficult for them."
The five newest start-up businesses in Utica -- they have names like Hair Salon Goga, Disco Club Una and Restaurant Sani -- all have Bosnian refugee owners, thanks in no small part to a new microenterprise program, taught by a former Bosnian refugee from Rochester, that fosters entrepreneurial skills.
One of the program's current students, Sulejman Latic, turned an empty nail salon into the Karate Club Dragon in February. "Here in America you have many chances, you can do whatever you want," said Mr. Latic, a tall, affable black belt who spent four years in Rijeka, Croatia, after fleeing Bosnia in 1994. He now has 55 karate students.
"It's a small town," he added with a grin and an eager thumbs-up, "but I like it."
Perhaps to no one is the refugees' impact more obvious than to Joseph Carucci, the president of Prudential Carucci Real Estate, Utica's largest home-sales broker. A few years ago, after the exodus of newly unemployed residents, home values plunged, and he went begging for buyers of two- and three-bedroom Victorian-era homes, many of which sold for less than $30,000.
Then came the refugees, whose frugal ways and tireless work ethic have helped reinvigorate home sales. In February and March, for example, Utica real estate agents sold 109 homes, Mr. Carucci said, compared with 63 in the same period last year. He credits Utica's refugees for the increase, especially the Bosnians.
"These immigrants are so much more grateful to have an opportunity for ownership than our American people who take it for granted," Mr. Carucci said in an interview. "All of the values that the immigrants had 200 years ago are here."
Sanel Grozdanic, 23, the owner of Restaurant Sani, in Utica's all-but-abandoned Little Italy section, is typical of a growing number of young Bosnians here: energetic businessman, fluid in English and confident.
"Every day, another person is buying a house, every day," he said from behind his restaurant's three-stool bar, convinced that his business will take off when his liquor license arrives and his stock of imported Slovenian wine begins to flow.
Simmering most quietly in Utica's melting pot are the more than 1,000 refugees from Vietnam, mostly Amerasians and ethnic Khmers.
"Most people don't want to talk; they just want to work, want to make money," said Ms. Vu, sitting down for tea at the Hoai An cafe, which occupies the front room of the house she shares with her mother, husband and four children. She long ago gave up hope of finding her father, an American serviceman who left Saigon in 1972.
Already, there are indications that Utica's refugee communities are maturing into true ethnic enclaves. Two years ago, for example, after years of renting church space from local Methodists, the Soviet Christians built the Slavic Pentecostal Church on the city's outskirts. The church includes a private K-8 school, and there are plans to add 9th and 10th grades this fall.
The Bosnians, however, more than the other groups, have forged reputations as Utica's newest class of entrepreneurs. Slowly but steadily, Bosnians are repopulating Bleeker and Elizabeth Streets, in Utica's once buzzing Little Italy, where dozens of shuttered storefronts stand, darkened icons of a different era.
There are other, more subtle signs, too. A three-team Bosnian soccer league has sprouted on the fields of the local high school. Last September, Utica's first Miss Bosnia, Enisa Sabanajic, 18, proudly went on to the national competition in Chicago.
And just two weeks ago, three Bosnian men passed their citizenship tests, making them the first in their community to complete the full journey to become Americans.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Two Parties Seek to Exploit a Relentless Boom in the Suburbs" (news article, May 4): The issue of sprawl doesn't concern only the growing numbers of Americans who live and work in suburbs. Sprawl should interest all who care about our country's endangered natural beauty and its shrinking economic and municipal diversity. Vice President Al Gore has the vision to see the logical outcome of today's trends: a devastating loss of open space, the hegemony of national retail franchises and the destruction of our towns and small cities by the cancerous growth of cheap and heedless roadside mall "development." 
 And Mr. Gore has had the courage to give the issue the importance it deserves, despite the self-important and self-interested sniping of those who trivialize the defense of our land.

To the Editor:
Re Bob Herbert's May 6 column criticizing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's support of school vouchers: 
 As a graduate of New York City's schools and college systems, I know full well the benefits of what had been a quality school system. As standards declined, those New Yorkers who were financially able removed their children from public schools, either by moving to the suburbs or by sending their children to private schools. This left the city's public schools to the poor, particularly to disadvantaged minorities.
Why is it so terrible to give the parents of the poor and disadvantaged the option to have the same opportunity for their children that the more economically secure have had? Or is it better to continue to sacrifice children from poorer families to a lower quality of education because of a doctrinaire view of what public education should be -- but is not?

HEADLINE: Thinkers Who Prefer to Be Free;
For Many Uneasy in Universities, Independence Is Worth the Cost

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
When Judith Rich Harris published an article in a scholarly journal a few years back and put the words "Middletown, New Jersey" in the space usually reserved for an author's academic affiliation, she found herself deluged with what she now calls her "who-the-hell-are-you mail."
Not only had she listed no university. She had not thanked any august-sounding grant-making agencies, either. She had simply credited half a dozen individuals, including one Charles S. Harris, who any half-alert reader might have guessed (correctly) is her husband. 
 "I got this E-mail from a professor at Cornell University," Ms. Harris recalled recently. He wanted to know: Are you an academic? A clinician? Or perhaps "an unemployed steelworker who has an interesting hobby of writing seminal scientific articles?"
None of the above.
Ms. Harris, who rocketed out of obscurity last year when she published "The Nurture Assumption" (Free Press, 1998), her joltingly unorthodox book crediting peers with greater influence than parents in a child's development, is a member of a little-known endangered subspecies of American intellectual known as the independent scholar.
In a country in which the academy has been accused of vaccuuming up all of intellectual life and processing it into something less deserving of the name, some scholars have traded the satisfactions and frustrations of colleges and universities for the mixed blessings of independence.
They are outsiders -- without titles, without tenure, without steady income. They have no letterhead, no lavish library privileges. As James Trilling, an independent scholar of Byzantine art studies and the history of ornament, said when asked about the drawbacks: "No colleagues. No students. No paycheck."
Yet they are free to think and write whatever, whenever and however they choose. They operate unencumbered by academic politics, protocol and publish-or-perish pressures. They straddle disciplines, elude specialization, follow their noses. For better or worse, their work is free to be unconventional and new.
"I had no vested interest in the status quo," Ms. Harris said of her book on child development. "Secondly, I had nobody to please. I didn't have to worry about offending the head of my department, about getting put in an office without a window, about being made to teach statistics."
"I see myself as a sort of gadfly," she said. "I think I'm in a much better position to criticize the field because I'm not a member of it."
The independents' reception by academics is not always warm.
The current issue of The New York Review of Books includes a letter signed by 29 academics complaining that the publication used Thomas Powers, best known as an author of books on politics and current affairs, to review several books about Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull and other 19th-century Plains Indians.
The New York Review's editors fire back that Mr. Powers had been studying those subjects for years. "It is hard to take seriously academics who condemn an independent scholar without making a single substantive criticism of his work," the editors retort.
One of the better-known independent scholars is Anne Hollander, an art historian whose subject is dress. She graduated from Barnard College in 1952, well before the advent of cultural studies. It was an era when the image of the clad figure was, she said recently, "not an appropriate art historical subject."
Instead of going to graduate school, she married an academic. She lived for years as an academic "fellow traveler" in places like New Haven and Cambridge, Mass., always thinking about and studying the representation of clothing in paintings and literature and cornering people at parties to talk about it.
Finally a friend persuaded her to write an article on the subject for a new journal. That led to a contract for her first book, "Seeing Through Clothes" (Viking, 1978), then a Guggenheim fellowship, a second book and her third and latest book, "Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress" (Kodansha, 1995).
Dress is now a well-established subject for serious study. Ms. Hollander is about to publish her fourth book on the subject and is working on a fifth. She is in constant demand from journalists, who call asking questions that begin, "What does it mean that we are now wearing . . . ?"
Asked what she had forgone by not becoming an academic, she said, "What I did not have, and still feel nervous about, is an alma mater, an encompassing institution, the whole institution of the academy that supports all these guys and endorses their sorrows and their efforts and produces a network within which they can feel they have a perpetual identity that is theirs.
"I don't have a deep and abiding sense of myself as part of this dynamic organism. It means that every time I do anything I have to start from scratch. I have only my public and I have no idea who they are."
There was a time, not all that long ago, when autonomy was not odd. As Mr. Trilling points out, many of the great texts of the 19th and early 20th centuries were produced by people working outside the academy at the time, like John Ruskin, Charles Darwin and John Stuart Mill.
But as academia grew, autonomy waned. And many scholars who are unaffiliated today did not initially volunteer for the part. Some were in dual-career marriages, unable to move for a job; some came out of graduate school in the mid-1970's, just as the academic job market was crashing.
Yet many of them have one thing in common: they describe themselves as too ornery for academic life. They say their interests are too eclectic. They resist the degree of specialization they say is required of present-day professors. Some say they have no instinct for institutions.
Wendy Lesser, a critic, essayist and founding editor of the literary journal The Threepenny Review, drifted away from universities after getting a Ph.D. in English. While academia gave her her admiration for "impractical thought," she says, she would have made a poor academic.
In her new book, "The Amateur: An Independent Life of Letters" (Pantheon, 1999), she says she gradually discovered she was not much of a teacher, was "hapless" at dealing with departmental politics, made enemies left and right and wanted to kill most of her colleagues.
"Finally, if I had to give a single reason, I would say I wasn't suited to the academy because I wanted to exercise a kind of judgment that was not normal there," she writes. There seemed to be no room for the kind of "relatively untutored omnivorousness" she wanted and needed to practice.
"I didn't want to have arbitrary lines drawn between things: between old masterpieces and contemporary works, between art and the rest of the world, between criticism and conversation," she adds. "I wanted the whole terrain. And in my own tiny way, I got it."
Independence is not easy.
Ms. Lesser, who lives in Berkeley with her husband and son, rarely knows where her next year's income will come from. "The Amateur" is the first of her five books to generate more than $10,000. She has gotten fellowships ranging from $20,000 to $50,000 and does consulting and freelance writing.
Mr. Trilling, who got his Ph.D. in art history from Harvard and is the son of Lionel and Diana Trilling, gave up his job as a curator at the Textile Museum in Washington to live in Providence, R.I., with his wife, a tenured professor at Brown, who currently supports him and their two daughters.
He calls himself "the liberated parasite."
Others have day jobs. Neil Baldwin, who has published biographies of William Carlos Williams, Thomas Edison and Man Ray, spends his weeks as executive director of the National Book Foundation in New York City and his weekends working on his next book in his study at home in Montclair, N.J.
He can be found reading, say, Isaiah Berlin on an exercise bicycle at the Essex Health and Country Club in West Orange, N.J. In Worcester, Mass., Mr. Trilling, who has written books, monographs and articles on topics like the mosaic pavement of the Byzantine imperial palace in Constantinople, can be spotted in the balcony above the pool at the Y.M.C.A., scribbling notes while his daughter practices synchronized swimming.
Isolation can be a problem for many independent scholars. Mr. Trilling can go for months without speaking to a colleague. Except when he attends conferences or lectures, he is cut off from the shop talk and everyday sharing of ideas that are a feature of university life.
But the hardest part, he said, is having no students. He has far more ideas than he will ever have time to develop into articles or books, but he has no students to pass them on to. At the end of his career, he will be unable to survey the landscape and take stock of where his former students have gone.
"Students are a measure of your career," he said recently in his house in Providence, settled in the basement office he shares with a large pet snake. "That's never going to be so for me. Teachers live on through their students, as well as through their published work."
Ms. Harris, who says she was "kicked out of Harvard" as a graduate student in psychology in 1961, having been told she seemed unlikely to do important work, wrote psychology textbooks for many years, then one day hit upon the theory that became the central idea of her paper and book.
Because she suffers from a combination of autoimmune diseases, she rarely leaves her house. She has gone entire months without seeing anyone but her husband and a friend who cleans the house. She is an energetic user of E-mail, maintaining a voluminous correspondence with academics she has never met.
To keep up with developments in her field, she subscribes to journals and fires off printed postcards asking researchers for reprints of their papers. She has relied so heavily on interlibrary loans, she ended up thanking the librarians in Middletown and Red Bank, N.J., in the preface to her book.
Other independent scholars use their alumni borrowing privileges -- or their spouses' -- to get access to university libraries. Some follow a piece of advice once offered in a newsletter published by a group called the National Coalition of Independent Scholars: "Get a nonposition."
Joan Cassell, an anthropologist in St. Louis, acquired the title of "research associate" from Washington University, solving both the library problem and what she calls "the name tag problem" of people's eyes glazing over as they read her name tag at meetings and look past her for someone more important.
So, are they contented?
"Who's contented?" Ms. Lesser recalls having answered when asked about her state of mind while on a book tour recently. "You're dead if you're contented. Nothing is perfect."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Thais Angrily Blaming U.S. For Deadlock on Trade Post

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 7

 BODY:
Protesters shouted at the gates of the United States Embassy today, voicing a growing wave of anger here that was summed up the other day by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai: Something fishy is going on.
Seemingly out of nowhere, a surge of anti-Americanism has gripped some Thais over the opposition by Washington to the candidacy of Supachai Panitchpakdi, a Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister, to lead the World Trade Organization. 
 Public figures have been announcing that they will boycott the Fourth of July reception at the embassy. In addition, a number of leading politicians have called for a reassessment of Thailand's friendly ties with the United States.
Mr. Supachai, 52, has been on the front lines of the struggle for economic revival by Thailand, the birthplace of the Asian financial crisis nearly two years ago. He is a finalist to become the new Director General of the trade organization, the 134-nation group that makes the rules of global trade, and he is widely viewed as a voice for Asia and developing nations.
But an opposing camp, led by the United States, has formed around the candidacy of Mike Moore, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand.
Negotiations to pick one of them have been deadlocked in heated debate at the trade organization's Geneva headquarters since last Saturday, when the four-year term of the incumbent Director General, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, expired.
The absence of a leader at the organization is imperiling a new round of trade talks scheduled to start Nov. 30.
"This institution will stop," said Rita Hayes, the American representative in Geneva. "It will completely stop until we have a new Director General."
An attempt last week by Ali Mchumo, chairman of the organization's General Council, to break the impasse seems only to have inflamed Mr. Supachai's supporters.
Mr. Mchumo said he had determined that Mr. Moore had the support of 62 countries, versus 59 for Mr. Supachai, and that therefore Mr. Supachai should quit the race. Mr. Mchumo's calculation did not take into account 13 countries whose preferences were not determined.
Thai officials were outraged, and said the United States was responsible for what they called a conspiracy against their candidate. Calls for retaliation intensified.
"The lesson of the W.T.O. selection is that it's time we reviewed our foreign policy with all countries, especially the United States, which say that they are our true friends," said the Senate Speaker, Meechai Ruchupan, this week. "We have to see who are our real friends and who are our real enemies. In the present world every country must have claws of its own, and that's not just in terms of arms but also strategy."
Noppadol Pattama, a member of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, went further, saying, "We might need to turn more to the European Union, Japan and China, which will increase our balance of power."
Even Mr. Chuan alluded to a "dirty tricks" campaign against the Thai candidate and said there was "something fishy going on" in the selection process.
This was a reference to a widespread sense here that Washington had been orchestrating an undeclared backstage campaign to undermine Thai interests. Officials here say the United States, despite its denials, has exercised a "secret veto" against Mr. Supachai, whom Washington might regard as insufficiently committed to free trade.
In a front-page editorial, the English-language daily The Nation crystallized the resentment. The editorial accused the United States of "betting on Moore's candidacy to fulfill its hegemonistic aspiration after having flexed its muscles in other world organizations like the United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund."
After the crash of the Thai currency, the baht, in July 1997, the I.M.F. produced a $17 billion rescue package for Thailand that like the packages for other nations has resulted in painful economic austerity. Critics here have complained that these new economic policies have sacrificed the welfare of ordinary people to that of the banks.
The critics have also complained that the United States offered only limited aid to Thailand, particularly in the early days of the crisis.
"It's different strands intertwined together," said Ji Ungpakorn, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. "It's the I.M.F. involvement in the economy and also the move to privatize state industries that have set off a nationalistic response. That's starting to cause a current of anti-Americanism."

Favorable Jobless News Pushes Dow to Another Record

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to yet another record high yesterday after the closely watched employment report for April soothed Wall Street's fears about inflation.
The Dow closed up 84.77 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, at 11,031.59, beating the May 3 high of 11,014.69. For the week, the Dow was up 242.55 points. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.95 points, or 1 percent, to 1,345.00, yesterday, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index jumped 31.34 points, or 1.27 percent, to 2,503.62.
The Labor Department reported that the number of workers on the nation's payrolls outside the farm sector increased by 234,000 in April and the unemployment rate hovered at a 29-year low of 4.3 percent, providing more evidence that the nation's economy is creating jobs at a healthy pace. Wage pressures were also muted.
Analysts had expected 230,000 new jobs and an unchanged jobless rate of 4.2 percent.
The Labor Department also said average hourly earnings, a closely watched gauge of wage levels that could presage inflation pressures, increased by only 3 cents, to $13.11 in April.
Thom Brown, managing director at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood, said the numbers "took big worries off Wall Street's back."
"The 4.3 percent rate is good news for the bond and stock market," Mr. Brown said.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, rattled financial markets after warning of inflationary pressures. Mr. Greenspan did not say the Fed would raise interest rates, but his comments put Wall Street on guard as bond yields marched higher.
"There's been a slight deterioration in psychology," Trude Latimer, an independent stockbroker in Charlottesville, Va., said. "The traders are getting nervous."
Referring to Mr. Greenspan's speech, Ms. Latimer added, "Some of the comments from the reigning geniuses are a little more cautious."
Meanwhile, gold stocks fell after the price of bullion plunged $7 an ounce after Britain announced it had decided to sell more than half its gold reserves.
South African gold companies condemned Britain's decision, calling the move "inept" and warning that it would encourage speculators and hurt producers who have struggled with dismal prices for the last 18 months.
"This is a classic bull and bear fight," Doug Myers, vice president of equity trade at Wachovia Securities, said.
"You've got a good underlying economy, but then you've got conflicting signals about valuations," he said. "You total all these things and you've got question marks and conflicting views."
Analysts said strength in the technology sector reflected relief that the jobs report did not fan inflation fears. High-growth stocks are viewed as particularly vulnerable to inflation.
"If the report had made it clear that the Fed would have to move to a higher interest rate environment, the techs would be reacting differently," Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Company, said.
I.B.M. jumped 8, to 217 1/4. Microsoft rose 1 1/8, to 79 1/16, and Intel was up 1 1/4, to 60 15/16.
Newport News Shipbuilding rose 5 3/4, to 32 3/4, and Avondale Industries gained 4 5/16, to 36 1/16, after Litton Industries announced unsolicited bids totaling $1.8 billion for the two companies. Litton was off 1 5/8, to 63 1/8.
McDermott International gained 2 5/16, to 30 1/4, on news that it was buying all of the shares of its subsidiary, J. Ray McDermott S.A., whose stock jumped 4 3/4, to 35 1/4.

Treasury Issues Decline
 By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell as traders fretted that next week's quarterly Government debt sales will overwhelm demand.
"People don't feel a need to rush to buy," given that the Treasury will sell $27 billion of five-year and 10-year notes in coming days, said John Burgess, who oversees more than $90 billion at Bankers Trust Global Investment Management.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32, to 9 24/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.81 percent, from 5.78 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Britain Plans To Sell 58% Of Its Bullion

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 7

 BODY:
Britain surprised world financial markets today by announcing it would sell more than half the country's bullion reserves, a move that further eroded the value of what was once the safest and strongest measure of wealth.
Gold prices, which have languished for years at roughly a third of their all-time high in 1980, tumbled as much as 4 percent after the British Treasury said it would sell 415 tons of its 715-ton stockpile and put the proceeds into other types of investments. Share prices in some big gold mining companies took the biggest drop in more than decade and contributed to weakness in the stock markets of South Africa and Canada, two leading gold producers. 
 The announcement was viewed as a maneuver by the British to pre-empt other big holders of gold, notably Switzerland and the International Monetary Fund, which have both indicated they will sell part of their huge gold reserves. Industry experts said the British wanted to sell their gold earlier to get the best price.
But the broader significance of Britain's announcement was that it drove a new dagger into gold's lingering status as a precious asset in an era of fast-paced economic globalization. Although gold has important industrial uses, from jewelry to air-bag seams, it is simply no longer regarded as an investment that retains underlying value.
Even the World Gold Council, a trade group that represents big mining companies, called it inevitable that Britain's announcement would be taken as "further evidence of official disenchantment with gold as a reserve asset."
In London, gold ended down $6.70 an ounce, or 2.3 percent, to $282.85, the biggest one-day decline in more than a year. In New York, gold fell $6.80, to $282.90.
For a long time, gold provided the spine of the global financial system, serving as a common measure for countries to value their currencies and the strength of their economies. At its peak, gold was the asset that backed 59 currencies, including the dollar, and the central banks of many nations hoarded stockpiles of gold. But the so-called gold standard was abandoned in the early 1970's, as national economies moved away from basing the value of their currencies on the metal.
"Ever since then, there's been a general tendency for the role of gold to be de-emphasized," said Phillip Klapwijk of Gold Fields Mineral Services, a leading industry analyst.
The end of the gold standard did not immediately hurt gold's glitter. On the contrary, it was still widely viewed as a resilient investment and a hedge against inflation, which helped to drive the price to an all-time high of $873 an ounce in 1980.
But it has basically been eroding in value ever since, and its allure as an inflation protection is now widely considered an anachronism. In some ways the dollar, as the most widely circulated currency in the world, has replaced gold as a measure of value.
Gold has notably failed to keep pace with many types of investments, notably stocks. An ounce of gold invested at its peak in the Dow Jones industrial average, for example, would now be worth $11,031.59, not including dividends. That's nearly 38 times higher than gold's present price.
Gold Fields Mineral Services forecast last month that the price could range between $265 and $305 an ounce for some time, Mr. Klapwijk said.
Britain is not the first central bank to sell gold. Indeed, one of the main pressures on gold in recent years has come from sales by other central banks, which totaled 412 tons last year, compared with 376 tons in 1997. But the timing and size of the British announcement today caught the gold market by surprise.
The British Treasury said through a spokesman that the sale would reduce Britain's stockpile from 715 tons to 300 tons over the next several years in what he termed a "measured and phased program." The proceeds will go into United States, European and Japanese bonds.
Starting July 6, Britain's gold is to be auctioned in 25-ton lots to dispose of 125 tons a year.
Even though gold's allure has diminished, there's still plenty of it around. Above-ground gold stocks total 137,400 tons -- including 31,400 tons in official reserves -- compared with annual demand largely from the jewelry trade of 4,123 tons, according to Gold Fields Mineral Services. Gary Mead, head of research at the World Gold Council, said the annual demand was 1,000 tons more than mining output.
"In terms of volume," he said, the projected British sale was not significant. "But in terms of psychology and sentiment, it's negative if it is interpreted by the market as a further indication that central banks are no longer interested in reserve assets."
The biggest uncertainty has come from Switzerland and the International Monetary Fund. Last month, Swiss voters in a referendum approved plans to end a formal, constitutional link between the Swiss franc and gold reserves, freeing the Swiss National Bank to sell up to half its 2,600-ton holdings. The I.M.F. is considering selling up to 10 percent of its gold reserves -- 322 tons -- to finance debt relief in developing countries, which would be the first gold sale by the lending agency in two decades.
One of the biggest immediate impacts of the British announcement was a plunge in the stocks of gold mining companies. In South Africa, shares of Anglogold Ltd., the world's biggest gold producer, fell 4.5 percent, and the Johannesburg stock exchange's 16-member index of gold companies fell 4.6 percent. Anglogold is a unit of the Anglo American Corporation. Shares in the Newmont Mining Corporation of Denver, the No. 2 mining company, fell 13 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 22-member index of gold companies fell 11 percent, its biggest one-day drop in almost 12 years.
One element in the timing of the British announcement may well have been Britain's independence from the 11 European Union nations that have been bound by their single currency, the euro, and single central bank since January.
The European Central Bank itself has not broached the idea of selling off European gold deposits for fear of weakening the euro, analysts said. "This does give an opportunity for those outside the system to make sales," Mr. Klapwijk said. British officials said the sales would not affect Britain's ability to deposit its required amount of 140 tons at the European Central Bank if it were to decide to join the euro sometime early in the next century.

HEADLINE: Pay the Legislators

 BODY:
Few New Yorkers are shedding tears for the State Legislature, whose members have not been paid in more than a month. The lawmakers have only themselves to blame. In order to get a pay raise from $57,500 to $79,500 last December, they agreed to have their paychecks withheld in each new fiscal year until they finally passed a budget. The pay freeze, demanded by Gov. George Pataki as the price for not vetoing the pay raise, has failed to work any magic. The budget, which is supposed to be passed April 1, is late for the 15th year in a row. But the idea of withholding pay was bad in principle and should be abandoned.
No one would defend the sorry succession of budget impasses and delays that have played havoc with state finances and the finances of local governments dependent on state aid. But withholding the pay of lawmakers, and not of the Governor or any other statewide elected officials, distorts the balance between the legislative and executive branches. In any budgetary standoff the legislators will be under economic pressure to cave, whereas the Governor will not. Even though 14 Assembly Democrats who have challenged the pay freeze in a lawsuit insist they would never vote for an unpalatable budget in order to get paid, the whole purpose of the law was to coerce a budget agreement. It is not acceptable for such pressure to fall unevenly on the legislators, some of whom may face tight economic circumstances. 
 Both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and Republican-controlled Senate have passed their own versions of the budget this year. Democrats favor more spending for education and health programs than either Mr. Pataki or the Republicans in the Legislature. The impasse is as deep as anyone in Albany can remember, with some legislators fearing openly that the state might limp along without a budget for a whole year.
Since the stalemate has as much to do with political advantage as principle, it is not easy to think of incentives to force a meeting of the minds. The poisonous atmosphere in Albany in recent years has aggravated these confrontations, and everyone has been understandably searching for something, anything, that might force a compromise. But freezing the lawmakers' pay is not the answer.
Instead, the Legislature could change the law to require that no state operations can go forward without an overall budget. They could tie passage of the budget to the issuing of new debt obligations, a step that might force legislators to act. They could take some of the acrimony out of the process by opening it up, mandating committee hearings and conference committee meetings, or setting up a nonpartisan panel to make spending and revenue estimates. These steps would go a long way toward instilling a sense of responsibility in Albany. Docking legislators' pay is the wrong way to do it.

HEADLINE: Cuba Cooperating to Combat Drug Trade, U.S. Official Says

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Cuba is not involved in drug trafficking and is cooperating with the United States in fighting the illegal trade in the Caribbean, the top American anti-drug official said today.
The White House's drug policy director, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, said Cuba, located in the middle of the drug route from South to North America, was very interested in discussing the issue with Washington, which has not had diplomatic ties with Havana since 1961. 
 "That dialogue might produce something useful, and we probably ought to be willing to encourage it," the retired general told scholars at the Woodrow Wilson Center, an international affairs institute.
"Poor Cuba. Location puts it in the path of international drug crime," he later told reporters. "But I do not see any serious evidence, current or in the last decade, of Cuban Government overt complicity with drug crime."
General McCaffrey said Cuban authorities had continued to maintain contacts with the Coast Guard and had responded positively to drug-related intelligence provided by the United States.
"I don't think they want Colombian drug criminals inside Cuba," said General McCaffrey, the former chief of the United States Southern Command.
Still, there is a lot of cocaine showing up on the island, the American anti-drug official said. Traffickers moving up the Caribbean from Colombia fly over the island and dump cocaine shipments in the sea off the north coast of Cuba for pickup by boats that smuggle the drug into the United States via the Bahamas, General McCaffrey said.
But Cuba lacks the "radar and intercept capabilities" to stop it, he said. Cuba cannot even effectively police its waters, where smugglers hide after fishing bales of cocaine from the sea, he said.
"It's a big problem and it is growing," he said.
General McCaffrey said Cuba wanted to cooperate with Washington on the drug problem as a way of opening a dialogue -- a sensitive initiative, particularly among Cuban-Americans opposed to relaxing the 37-year-old economic embargo on President Fidel Castro's Government.
But General McCaffrey said the United States must look to the future, when Cuba could become a major drug-trafficking center unless cooperation with Cuban authorities begins now.
"Cuba will not remain a collapsing Communist dictatorship with a goofy economic system much longer," he said. "Eventually it is going to be another economic center in the hemisphere, so we clearly don't want international drug crime dominating Cuba."

HEADLINE: More Groups Are Sharing In Job Growth

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
America's jobs boom is increasingly pulling many of the nation's most vulnerable citizens out of poverty and unemployment.
In April, the national economy added, on a net basis, nearly a quarter of a million new jobs despite continued losses in manufacturing and farming, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Last month's unemployment rate was 4.3 percent -- statistically indistinguishable from its 30-year low of 4.2 percent in March. (All numbers are adjusted to take account of expected seasonal ups and downs.) 
 The unemployment rate has now been at or below 4.5 percent for slightly more than a year and at or below 5 percent for a full two years.
Investors, who were a bit rattled on Thursday by a warning from the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the tight labor market still posed an inflation threat, generally took the strong April job growth in stride. That was mostly because the report showed no signs that wages were accelerating. But after an initial gain in the bond market, prices fell, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.81 percent. Stocks gained, with the Dow industrial average up 84.77, to 11,031.59. Page B3.
The most striking feature of yesterday's report was how broadly the benefits of economic growth are being spread. Joblessness among workers who have long suffered the highest unemployment rates continued to decline.
Unemployment among blacks, already at historic lows, dropped to 7.7 percent. Teen-age unemployment declined to 14.1 percent. But joblessness among Hispanic workers -- a diverse group that spans affluent third-generation Americans as well as impoverished new immigrants -- bumped up from the record low set in March. Still, at 6.9 percent, the Hispanic rate remains lower than at almost any time in the last 25 years.
"We're seeing large gains by the most disadvantaged groups," said Rebecca Blank, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and an expert on poverty.
Today, nearly half of Americans live in cities and towns where the unemployment rate has dropped below 4 percent, according to a new study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. In these "high pressure" local economies, the employment and incomes of the most disadvantaged -- the young, those who have only a high school degree or less, and minorities -- have jumped, said Richard Freeman at Harvard, one of the study's authors.
Growth that is shared by most Americans has not been the norm since the economic Golden Age that followed World War II from the late 1940's to the early 1970's. Back then, rapid economic growth had a powerful effect on the fortunes of America's poorest citizens, prompting Arthur M. Okun, President Lyndon B. Johnson's chief economic adviser, to assert that a rising tide lifts all boats. But that soon changed, when the Arab oil shock and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of stable currency exchange rates ushered in an era of high inflation, widening inequality and stagnant wages.
Even in the long, strong boom of the 1980's, when 20 million new jobs were created, poverty barely fell, and many of America's working poor, particularly less-educated men, wound up becoming poorer.
But today there are a host of signs that the gains from economic growth are once again being spread around. "The 90's are starting to look a lot like the 60's," said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard.
Investment bankers, basketball stars and computer whizzes -- those at the very top of the pay scale -- are still doing great, just as they did in the 80's. What has changed is that they are no longer alone. "Inequality hasn't necessarily diminished, but we seem to be in a world where the bottom and top are rising together," Dr. Blank said. "That's a very different world."
What makes the 90's different from the 80's? Two things, the experts say. First, the current expansion, which began with the unemployment rate slightly above 7 percent, compared with a double-digit jobless rate in the early 1980's, has lasted longer and has pushed the unemployment rate even lower than at the end of the 1980's expansion. Second, for the last three years or so, wages for workers at the bottom of the pay scale have been rising rapidly. In the 1980's, declining pay at the lower rungs of the wage scale offset the positive effects of robust job growth.
"You're not just getting more job opportunities, but rising wages," Dr. Blank said.
According to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a worker whose pay put him one-fifth the way up the wage-distribution ladder earned $7.11 an hour in 1986 but only $6.66 in 1996. By this spring, that figure had climbed to $7.17 an hour. (All the figures are in 1998 dollars and take inflation into account.)
Those gains have helped fuel a spree of consumer spending and borrowing in the last year or so. But in March, Americans reined in a bit, with consumer credit expanding by just $1.6 billion, well below the $8.7 billion jump in February. Credit card debt actually shrank, but borrowing to buy cars rose $3.8 billion.
To be sure, not everything is rosy on the job front. The nation's factories shed another 29,000 jobs last month, bringing the total number of manufacturing jobs lost since the beginning of the global financial crisis to 400,000. But increasingly well-paying service jobs more than made up that loss. Last month, service industries created 261,000 additional jobs. In the last year, they have added 2.8 million jobs while the number of construction jobs has grown by 300,000.
"We're not going back to the days when the economy was creating jobs that called for easily acquired, modest skills," said Kevin Murphy, a labor economist at the University of Chicago.
Still, the old relationship between economic growth and a reduction in poverty seems to have been restored -- at least for now. According to calculations by Professor Katz, between 1983 and 1990, poverty fell by just 1.7 percentage points, less than half what would have been predicted based on the pattern that existed in the 1960's and 1970's. By contrast, between 1993 and 1997 (the last year for which poverty figures are available) the percentage of households in poverty has declined by 2.6 percentage points, more than in the entire 1980's and right in line with the old pattern. (The numbers include income from the earned-income tax credit.)
Low unemployment is good for newcomers to the labor force like women and teen-agers and those at the bottom of the pay scale. When the labor market tightens, people who are out of work or are jumping in for the first time get jobs. Part-time workers get full-time jobs. And those in dead-end jobs find better ones and have a chance to acquire more experience and skills.
Most important, Professor Katz said, "a lot of people in inner cities are developing connections to the job market that had broken down." One reason is that temporary-help companies may be making it easier for the least-experienced, least-skilled workers to get experience and training. And falling unemployment also seems to be reinforcing the trend toward less criminal activity, which has long clouded the job prospects of minority youths, Professor Freeman at Harvard said.
A shift in antipoverty policies, limiting welfare and linking aid, such as the earned-income tax credit, to work, is also a factor. "Policy reinforced what was happening in the marketplace," Dr. Blank said. From 1989 to 1997, the average income of single mothers, with two children, who worked full time jumped 42 percent, to $13,956, which is 8 percent above the official poverty line.
It is too early to predict whether the benefits of the 90's boom will survive the next recession. Until then, however, America's tight labor market is creating opportunities for those who stand to benefit most.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE BLOCKADE;
Among Allies, Doubts and Disagreement on Oil Embargo

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 7

 BODY:
The bark of NATO's planned naval blockade of oil deliveries to Yugoslavia may be worse than its bite, allied diplomats said today.
Leading the legal charge against the blockade that was wanted by NATO's American commander, France has apparently persuaded most allies that there is no basis in international law for allied warships to challenge ships of countries that have not declared war against Yugoslavia. 
 Further, the French argue, there is no United Nations embargo against Yugoslavia barring fuel shipments. They have rejected American arguments that a ban on importing war materials provides justification enough.
As a result, allied political authorities sent instructions today to their military colleagues at NATO headquarters to devise a different kind of "visit and search" system, one that would use psychology rather than force to dissuade merchant ships from trying to run oil, gasoline, and other fuels into Bar, the main Yugoslav port in Montenegro.
Montenegro, which with Serbia is a constituent part of Yugoslavia, has opposed President Slobodan Milosevic's operations against Albanian civilians in Kosovo.
This week, officials in Bar said Mr. Milosevic had ordered the navy to block shipping into the port.
But allied commanders say ships flying flags of opportunity occasionally do make runs into Bar, so the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, wanted a full-fledged blockade. Instead, the French suggest, NATO ships should be empowered to board ships of allied and European countries that have declared a ban on fuel shipments into Yugoslavia, just to check that any vessels heading into Bar are carrying no fuel.
"The Americans argued that this was ridiculous, because we'd only be checking on shipping that had already agreed not to bring in fuel," one European diplomat reported.
But the French contend that a voluntary or cooperative blockade is better than none at all and that getting an allied naval inspection system up and running could scare or shame would-be violators out of trying to run the blockade.
Jamie P. Shea, the NATO spokesman, said today that the 15-nation European Union had proposed that ships flying its flags could agree to be boarded by naval inspectors from fellow European countries. Other countries that had decided to stop oil shipments would be invited to do so as well, he said.
"Our intention is to have an effective, comprehensive visit and search regime," he said. "We're off to a good start."
Greece was insisting, one allied diplomat in Brussels said today, that none of its merchant ships could be boarded by Turkish naval inspectors. Greece and Turkey are united both by membership in NATO and by a cordial dislike of one another.
Allied diplomats said today they expected that the new system, if approved, could go into effect as early as next week.

HEADLINE: Democrats Try to Turn Focus Toward New Jersey Assembly Campaigns

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, May 7

 BODY:
The prevailing message of the New Jersey Democratic Party's annual conference in this fog-blanketed casino town today was conveyed succinctly in the blue-and-red stickers that almost everyone seemed to be wearing: "It's the Assembly, stupid!"
In a year when many of the state's political leaders are already focusing n the United States Senate race in 2000 and the gubernatorial campaign of 2001, a growing number of Democrats are worried that 1999's state Assembly races are getting lost in the shuffle. 
 Many party leaders say that this year may offer Democrats their best opportunity to retake the Assembly since the Republicans gained the majority in 1991. Needing to pick up nine seats to win control of the 80-member lower house, the Democrats assert that issues like racial profiling by the state police as well as high property taxes and automobile insurance rates are severely undermining the Republicans' support.
But intraparty squabbling over picking a Senate candidate and jockeying over the governor's race, combined with news media attention to both, are making it difficult for Democrats to raise money, organize support and attract publicity for Assembly candidates, several party leaders said today.
"From my point of view, I couldn't care about the Senate candidates," said Assemblyman Joseph V. Doria Jr., the Democratic minority leader. "The whole thing is creating a distraction. And by discussing the Senate race all the time, we're not getting the attention for candidates who would not have an easy time getting attention to begin with."
Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., a Democrat from Paterson, said, "Until we can shift back to 1999, and out of this time warp of 2000 and 2001, we won't do well this year."
Thomas P. Giblin, the state party chairman, said it has become difficult to raise money for Assembly candidates because Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley are both raising money aggressively in New Jersey for their presidential campaigns, while Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of Long Branch and former Gov. Jim Florio are appealing to Democratic donors for next year's Senate race.
Amid such concerns, the state party structured much of this two-day conference around spotlighting its Assembly candidates, featuring them on panels, introducing many of them at today's luncheon and festooning the Trump Plaza banquet hall with "Assembly 1999" banners.
But it was still impossible to escape the noise of the Senate race, as three potential candidates to replace Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the three-term Democrat who is retiring next year, used today's event as a coming-out party of sorts.
At the local Planet Hollywood, Mr. Pallone was the host of a party for the conventioneers that cost $15,000. Mr. Florio took a suite in the Trump Plaza, where he met with county leaders, fund-raisers and reporters throughout the day.
And Jon S. Corzine, a Summit resident and the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, contributed $3,000 to the convention and spent much of the evening shaking hands and introducing himself to rank-and-file party members, the vast majority of whom have only the faintest idea of who he is.
Even Mr. Bradley got into the act, joking during his keynote speech, "I'm one of the few speakers here at the conference who is not running for the United States Senate."
Mr. Florio was perhaps the most visible of the Senate candidates, working the crowd vigorously and giving interviews to reporters in which he blasted Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's fiscal policies and handling of the racial profiling issue.
Mrs. Whitman, who unseated Mr. Florio in a close 1993 election, has said she plans to seek the Republican nomination for Senate next year.
Defending his decision as Governor to raise taxes, Mr. Florio attacked Mrs. Whitman for allowing the state debt to increase despite the strong economy, saying: "I did what came naturally -- I went and paid the bills. I contrast that with what has happened over the last five years, in which she has not been paying any bills."
But paradoxically, many Assembly Democrats blame Mr. Florio's tax increase for putting them in the minority in 1991. So while the former Governor enjoys strong support in some Democratic circles, there was also grumbling today that his candidacy could weaken the party's chances of retaking the Assembly this year.
Mr. Florio said such concerns were unfounded, adding that the only thing that would keep him from running in the Senate primary would be a heart attack.
In New Jersey politics, all races seem interconnected, and many Democrats argued today that picking up Assembly seats this year, as well as taking the Senate race next year, are essential to winning the big prize: the governor's seat in 2001.
"We need a sense of immediacy," said Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, who came within 27,000 votes of unseating Mrs. Whitman in 1997 and is considered the party's front-runner for governor in 2001. "Increasing our Assembly seats gives us the structure to get out the party's message on education, auto insurance and property taxes."

HEADLINE: Head of City Development Agency Resigns to Work for Prudential

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Charles Millard, a top adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani who has been president of the city's Economic Development Corporation since 1995, said yesterday that he was resigning to accept a position as a managing director at Prudential Securities.
Mr. Millard, 42, a lawyer who was on the New York City Council from 1991 to 1995, and has been widely considered a contender for higher elective office, is to leave his job at City Hall on June 1. Michael Carey, first executive vice president of the Economic Development Corporation, will then become its acting president. 
 Mr. Millard, who has five children, said his move was motivated in part by the chance to make more money than his $138,000 annual city salary.
"Charlie has been part of this administration's success," said Mr. Giuliani yesterday at a press conference. He credited Mr. Millard, whose job as head of the city's principal development agency entails devising incentives to attract and retain business, with contributing to the city's strong job growth and helping retain large employers like the New York Stock Exchange.
Another of Mr. Millard's efforts at City Hall has been to foster the growth of small high-technology firms as part of Manhattan's burgeoning Silicon Alley complex.
In announcing his appointment, Prudential Securities said Mr. Millard would head a recently formed Internet Economy Group, drawing upon his experience with start-up companies.
Prudential Securities said Mr. Millard would also be responsible for developing business in real estate finance, and would retain a working relationship with City Hall.
"We look forward to adding his unique experiences and legacy of service to the New York business community to the expertise we offer our clients," said Paul V. Scura, Prudential Securities' executive vice president and chief of investment banking.
Mr. Millard, a resident of Forest Hills, Queens, would not say how much he would earn at Prudential Securities.
"It has been a great run with the city, but with five kids to take care, of an opportunity like this one at Prudential is something not to be passed up," he said.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Bronx Roots Still Nurture Career Paths

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
WHEN Louis J. Cappelli graduated from William H. Taft High School in 1949, he ended up doing what most of his buddies in the Bronx did: not much. There was a recession, and jobs were tight. He would walk from his home at Courtlandt Avenue and 160th Street, cross Park Avenue and head to their hangout on Morris Avenue and 165th Street, where the biggest attraction some days was watching the street get paved.
"None of us was working," he said. "We had a nice time hanging out on the corner, shooting pool, listening to music and going to the movies. We made a few dollars delivering orders." 
 Then came another order.
"My father said, 'Louie, get a job,' " Mr. Cappelli said. "My father only had to tell me once. So Louie dressed himself up in his high school graduation suit, bought The New York Times and looked in the classified under 'Office Boy,' because that was what I thought I was capable of doing."
One ad led him to the Standard Factors Corporation.
"I was instantly offered the job," he said. "I started the same day. And I've been here ever since."
Has he ever. Louie, the iceman's son, has gone from the street corner to a corner office as the chairman and chief executive officer of Sterling Bancorp, the successor to Standard Factors. His 50-year journey left him grateful for life's many blessings, starting with his parents' work ethic. So when he goes to his Park Avenue office, he remembers that road's northern reaches in his old neighborhood.
"I never forgot where I come from," he said. "I tell my colleagues, when you look in the mirror, don't kid yourself about who you are. Don't try to be anything else."
There was a time when others told him to forget about being much of anything. He admits to having been an average student, one who sometimes sassed the teachers. Back then, his family lived at Morris Avenue and 162d Street, near Yankee Stadium.
"We were probably the only Italian family in an island of Irish," he said. "The church was Irish. The priests were Irish. The Italians were not people they thought were of quality."
But he saw other qualities in his family. His father, Peter, who came to America as a teen-ager, made his living hauling hunks of ice. Though he was not educated, he kept track of accounts in his mind. He taught his children the value of respecting family and community. Mr. Cappelli's two brothers and sister taught him the value of education, urging him to get an academic diploma at Taft, rather than go to the vocational schools that his friends attended.
He rose through the the bank's hierarchy while earning a degree from City College at night. He studied accounting, a discipline that he speaks of reverently. The numbers on a spreadsheet, he says, tell stories of businesses and the people who work for them, including his bank. He feels a responsibility to them, he said, because at one point or another in his career, he probably had their job.
"I happen to be paternal in the way I deal with the people here, as opposed to some other organization where people are treated like numbers," he said. "I traveled through the ranks, so I know what it's like. I didn't come out of Harvard Business School and start as a vice president."
HE says that his career path is not some relic from a simpler era. He insists that just as the Italians came into their own, today's immigrants will have their shot, too.
"If you're smart enough," he said. "It's not luck. It's timing. You need to be in the station at the right time."
Or the classroom. A few years ago he was Principal for a Day at Taft High School. The place had changed, starting with the metal detector at the door. In one sophomore class, Noemi Cruz listened to his corporate success story.
"How do I get a job at your bank?" she asked, half joking.
He hired her. She began working summers, and continued after graduation. She is now an administrative assistant, working full time while going to New York University at night, courtesy of the bank.
"I want to stay right here," she said. "Hopefully, I'll get his office."
Sound familiar? Mr. Cappelli is proud of her. He knows some people are amazed at Ms. Cruz's initiative and drive. They never thought a young Bronx woman could be so poised and determined. He just smiles.
"I can relate to her," he said. He snapped his fingers. "Like that, I can relate to her."

HEADLINE: Religion Journal;
Among a Religious Electorate, Overlooked Corners

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
When it comes to political activity by religious believers, the nation's evangelical Protestants often seem to get most of the attention from the news media and scholars.
That would be because evangelicals, particularly the many conservatives among them, have clearly emerged as a political force over the last 20 years, aided in part by media-wise organizations like the Moral Majority and, more recently, the Christian Coalition. As a result, they have made an impact on the Republican Party, often pressing causes like efforts to restrict abortion. 
 But this circumstance should not obscure a larger picture about religion and politics or, one expert says, keep reporters and scholars from paying close attention to other Protestants -- the mainline variety, like Methodists and Presbyterians -- who could play an important role in next year's elections.
That suggestion came, in a telephone interview, from John C. Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, who delivered a paper last week analyzing various political data related to religious groups. (The data were drawn from the University of Michigan's National Elections Studies and a poll on "values" by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation.)
Mr. Green's paper, presented at the Center for the Study of Religion and Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford, described the outlooks and complex voting patterns that prevailed among Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jews and unaffiliated "seculars" in the 1994, 1996 and 1998 elections.
He had enough data to divide each of the three largest groups (evangelicals, mainline Protestants and Catholics) into two general categories: the "traditionalists," meaning people who maintain a high level of religious observance and accord the Bible a high authority, and the "nontraditionalists," a varied group including theological liberals, moderates and people who say they are not highly observant.
Mr. Green found that Republican candidates had done much better than Democrats with the religious traditionalists as a whole, while Democrats had drawn most of their support from nontraditionalists, seculars, Jews, Hispanic Catholics and African-American Protestants.
Evangelical Protestants accounted for nearly one-third of Republican voters during 1994-98, Mr. Green said. During that period, Democrats' largest voting blocs were seculars, nontraditionalist Catholics and black Protestants.
As for mainline Protestants as a whole, Mr. Green found that they accounted for 16 percent of the electorate -- somewhat less than the evangelicals, who accounted for about a fifth -- with 11 percent fitting in the nontraditionalist category and 5 percent in the traditionalist.
A slight majority of mainline Protestants identify themselves as Republicans, the historic affiliation of these voters. But the nontraditionalists have lately been ticket-splitters, a majority backing President Clinton in 1996 but voting for Republicans for Congress in each of the elections from 1994 through 1998.
Mr. Green said Mr. Clinton appealed to these people with his talk of a "new covenant," of shared responsibility for society between government and citizens. As President, he renewed his appeal in 1996 by pushing government interest in school uniforms and higher academic standards, Mr. Green said.
"These folks seem to have become comfortable with a large public sector," he said. "But they don't want it to get bigger, and they want it to be efficient."
Why are they important? Mainline Protestants are especially numerous in the Upper Midwest, a broad area rich in Electoral College votes running, Mr. Green said, "from western Pennsylvania through Iowa, and you could probably include Nebraska and Kansas."
Were certain social issues to play a major role in the next election, a candidate might find it hard to appeal to those Protestants and other religious voters, too. For example, most mainline Protestants oppose school vouchers, while most evangelicals and Catholics support them, the data show.
Mr. Green's report also points to common ground: a majority of voters in all religious groups say they favor protecting homosexuals from job discrimination, although most also say they do not support gay marriage. And a majority in all groups say they believe that government should reduce poverty, one of several responses that led Mr. Green to say he saw no evidence of "culture war" among Americans over economic issues.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: RUSSIA;
View From Moscow: Success for Its Diplomacy

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 7

 BODY:
While NATO leaders congratulated themselves on Thursday for nudging Russia over to their side in the search for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo, Russian diplomats took another view, claiming a small but significant victory in their monthlong attempt to mediate a peace.
Seen from Moscow, the document signed in Bonn on Thursday by the foreign ministers of Russia and the Group of Seven industrial countries had the ring of a compromise, a classic example of diplomatic give and take. 
 In the view of some Russian analysts, the give came mostly from the six NATO partners who for the first time opened the door to a settlement brokered by the United Nations Security Council, where Russia holds the power to veto. In Moscow's view, the Council should play the leading role in solving the Kosovo crisis.
"You can speak about quite a substantial success for Russian diplomacy," said Sergei Rogov, director of Moscow's U.S.A. and Canada Institute. "We were alone against seven Western countries."
No one here was touting the Bonn agreement as a breakthrough. Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov called it "a step in the right direction." Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's special Balkans envoy, who is to set off Saturday on his third mission to Belgrade and other capitals, talked only of "progress."
But for Russia, the significance of the agreement lay in the fact that for the first time since NATO began its bombing of Yugoslavia, Moscow's place at the head table of the world's leading powers has been reaffirmed.
"If you look at this whole story as an effort by NATO to establish itself as the dominant player, deciding questions of war and peace, and deciding them without Russia, we can already conclude that this effort has failed," Mr. Rogov said.
When NATO launched its first attack against Yugoslavia on March 24, Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, then en route to Washington, turned his plane around over the Atlantic in a move that signaled the depth of Russian fury at being ignored and shut out.
Pressed by a domestic public opinion that is united against the air raids on a traditional Russian ally, and by a Communist-led opposition that blames the West for Russia's weakness, President Boris N. Yeltsin has had little room for diplomatic maneuver.
But even against a backdrop of saber-rattling by its top military leaders, Russia began revving up its diplomatic efforts in early April, first at a meeting in Oslo between Mr. Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and then with Mr. Chernomydin's shuttle diplomacy.
Today, the leader of the Communist Party, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, criticized the Government's diplomatic overtures in the Balkans. He accused Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin of "silently betraying and selling Yugoslavia the way they sold and betrayed the united country, the Russian economy, friends, history, culture and traditions."
By putting his signature on the Bonn document, Mr. Ivanov -- once one of the loudest voices in the Moscow chorus condemning NATO as a criminal aggressor -- signaled Russia's determination to be part of the solution to a crisis that had thrown its relations with the West into a freeze almost reminiscent of the cold war.
The agreement signed on Thursday will dash any hopes that Belgrade may have had of drawing Russia into its war with NATO, commentators here agreed. But some argued that by drawing the United Nations into any future peace settlement, Moscow has helped give President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia a way out of the conflict, if he chooses to accept it.
"In the final analysis, this is not our war," noted Maksim A. Yusin, a Balkans expert at the newspaper Izvestia, "and the peace will be decided between NATO and the Serbs."
With its broadly stated goals, and flimsily worded proposals, the Bonn document raises more problems than it solves. Its success will lie in details that have yet to be hammered out, probably in a Security Council resolution that promises to be the focus of the next round of intense international diplomacy.
Moscow's chief concession -- first touted by President Clinton -- lay in its agreement to join in an international peacekeeping presence in Kosovo. But as several analysts noted, Russia had already dropped broad hints of its willingness to allow and to take part in such a force under United Nations auspices with Yugoslavia's consent.
"An international presence in Kosovo is out of the question without the consent of Yugoslav leaders," Mr. Chernomyrdin said flatly today.
In the Russian view, the West's concessions came in the agreement's acceptance of a United Nations framework for both the peacekeeping force and for an "interim administration" for Kosovo. "The four-letter word NATO is not even mentioned," Mr. Rogov said.
That NATO will insist on playing a key role in keeping the peace is accepted here as one of many issues still to be negotiated. One option that some here think might be accepted by Belgrade would involve troops from NATO countries that have not taken part in the bombing.
The Russians have already signaled their intention to step up the pace of negotiations, seeking out new partners in the search for a settlement, including perhaps Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovar Albanian leader now in Rome. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who came from Washington last month for talks on Kosovo, is to return here next week.

HEADLINE: Why Bankruptcy Became So Popular

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Regarding your article about legislation passed by the House of Representatives to make bankruptcy rules more stringent for consumers (news article, May 6): 
 A more equitable way to help consumers alleviate their debt would be to bring back the tax deduction for interest paid on credit cards. After all, it's taxpayers who subsidize the tax breaks given to banks. Why not give consumers a tax break and an incentive for their part in growing the economy?

To the Editor:
Klaus Friedrich sheds much-needed light in his May 4 Op-Ed article. Stock market gains can indeed be considered savings, and so can proceeds from many other facets of American life. Most middle-class people put a substantial amount of money into their houses. Thus, they accumulate wealth over the life of the mortgage. This is a major effort at saving for many people but not considered so by economists. 
 The Social Security deduction from one's salary, when combined with the employer's contribution, amounts to about 15 percent for an average income. While economists do not consider this to be savings, workers certainly do.
If all methods of accumulating wealth were accounted for, Americans would have the highest savings rate in the world. The charge that Americans do not save is simply an economic miscalculation, and certainly no one can fault the savers.

HEADLINE: Heir to a Fortune, and to Tragedy;
Suicide Ends the Life of a Wealthy, and Haunted, Man

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
William Woodward 3d was born to a family with few peers in New York society. The Woodwards had old money and blue blood, but they also had a penchant for self-destruction that inspired novels by Truman Capote and Dominick Dunne, and landed them in the headlines of newspapers around the world.
William was only 11 years old in 1955 when his mother shot and killed his father, mistaking him for a prowler at their weekend estate. The crack of the shotgun did not wake young Woody, but the shooting echoed throughout his life: His mother, Ann, was exonerated, but she committed suicide in 1975 after Capote depicted her as a murderous vamp. His younger brother, Jimmy, dabbled in drugs and spent time in mental institutions before he jumped to his death from a hotel window. 
 But William Woodward 3d persevered, eager to become more than another poor little rich boy. He became a journalist in the late 1960's and later ran for public office. He served as New York State's Deputy Superintendent of Banks. Later, he married and had a daughter and lived, for a time, a quiet life. And then last Sunday, at age 54, he jumped through the kitchen window of his East Side apartment, the police said, falling 14 stories to his death.
"It's a terrible tragedy," said Lionel Larner, a friend who attended Mr. Woodward's funeral on Thursday. "His desire was to give something back, to try to do good. But there was always a shadow of sadness. It seemed to emanate from him. He wanted very much to be happy."
The shadows in Mr. Woodward's life had become darker in recent years. Friends say he suffered periods of severe depression and had been under psychiatric care. He and his wife, Lisa, had been waging a divorce and custody fight since 1996. In his eulogy at the funeral, Parkman Shaw, a longtime friend, said Mr. Woodward called him two weeks ago, fearful that he had fallen into a depression without bottom.
Another friend who gave a eulogy, Jonathan Morse, said Mr. Woodward suffered from manic depression. "The guy had a tragic life," Mr. Morse said in a telephone interview last night. "He came from a difficult family background, and he just tragically got off the track."
His closest friends, a few of whom regularly telephoned him in recent years to "check up," gathered at a small, private reception after the funeral. In later interviews, several friends described a man of vivid contrasts: He was charming and bright, a patrician with liberal politics, a doting father, someone determined to make his mark. He was also very private, sometimes guarded and subject to increasingly unpredictable behavior.
His death, a close friend said, was "on one level shocking, but on another level it was not."
He added, "I think mental illness is so terrible and insidious."
The skyline of wealth in New York City is ever changing, with new families rising and old ones falling, but the Woodwards ranked at the summit for much of the century.
William Woodward was a chairman of Central-Hanover Bank and a sportsman who purchased the famous Belair Stud, the Maryland thoroughbred farm that produced three Kentucky Derby winners. His wife, Elsie, became a grande dame of high society and a leading philanthropist. Their son, William Woodward Jr., known as Billy, was an international sportsman, most famous for his thoroughbred, Nashua, winner of two-thirds of racing's triple crown. He married Ann Crowell, a woman of ordinary lineage but of extraordinary beauty. She was a Powers model, and became a radio personality known, somewhat oddly, as "the most beautiful girl in radio."
They had two sons, William 3d and James, and if they were born as princes of the realm, they ultimately became victims in a chain of family destruction that seems almost Gothic.
On the night of Oct. 30, 1955, Billy and Ann Woodward had returned to their weekend estate in Oyster Bay on Long Island, after attending a dinner party honoring the Duchess of Windsor. There had been reports of a prowler, and the couple retired to separate bedrooms armed with loaded weapons. Awakened by what she later described as the sound of an intruder, Mrs. Woodward grabbed her gun and fired at a shadow in her doorway. It was her husband. The two boys, asleep elsewhere in the house, did not wake up.
The shooting became front-page news. Life magazine dubbed it "The Shooting of the Century." Distraught and visibly anguished, Mrs. Woodward eventually appeared before a Nassau County grand jury, which deemed the shooting an accident. But the family would never recover.
Mrs. Woodward was ostracized socially and hounded by whispers. The whispers eventually reached Truman Capote, whose unfinished, but published, novel, "Answered Prayers," included a thinly veiled fictional account of the Woodward shooting. He depicted Mrs. Woodward as Ann Cutler, a harlot and a gold digger who killed her husband because he had discovered she was a bigamist.
In 1975, Esquire published an excerpt from the novel, and Ann Woodward was soon found dead in her Fifth Avenue apartment from suicide. Susan Braudy, whose 1992 book, "This Crazy Thing Called Love," documented the shooting, said New York society quickly accepted Capote's fictional account as fact.
"Well, that's that," Elsie Woodward, then in her 90's, said six weeks after Ann's death, according to Ms. Braudy's book. "She shot my son, and Truman just murdered her, and so now I suppose we don't have to worry about that anymore."
But after eight years of research, Ms. Braudy concluded that the shooting, in fact, had been an accident. The police had arrested a prowler who admitted to being at the Woodward estate. Ms. Braudy also discovered that Capote's story about her background was pure fabrication, despite the whispers to the contrary.
"There was an awful lot of gossip about it among their friends taking sides and wondering if it was an accident," said Anne Slater, a friend of the Woodward family. "The boys were at an age where they couldn't miss it."
The youngest, Jimmy, died first. A handsome Vietnam veteran, he quickly fell into the drug culture of the early 1970's, according to Ms. Braudy. He bent heirloom silver spoons to heat heroin, and one night in 1972, high on drugs, he jumped out of a fourth floor window but survived.
Released from a mental institution, Jimmy befriended Xaviera Hollander, the self-proclaimed madam and author of "The Happy Hooker." In one of her later books, she had a chapter, "Jimmy, Don't Jump Again."
He did. Less than a year after his mother's suicide, Jimmy jumped out of a window of a hotel on Central Park South and died.
Woody Woodward was the last of his family, and for years he struggled to make a name for himself. He had attended an exclusive Swiss boarding school and graduated from Harvard College. In 1968, he became a reporter at The New York Post, and if newspapering seemed an unlikely career for a multimillionaire, he embraced it. He paid his own way to cover the Vietnam War, riding around the war on a motorcycle. In New York, he represented the Newspaper Guild in contract negotiations with management, another unlikely role for the heir to a banking fortune.
In 1971, two journalists, Richard Pollak and J. Anthony Lukas, were searching for investors to underwrite a new magazine of media criticism called More. Mr. Woodward signed on, becoming the publisher, and More became acclaimed as an influential, liberal critical voice.
Mr. Woodward eventually left the magazine to attend Harvard Business School and ultimately he turned to politics. He served Gov. Hugh L. Carey in the banking job and worked for Mayor Edward I. Koch in economic development. In 1978, he lost a State Senate race on the East Side.
In 1981, he ran for an at-large seat in the City Council, but the courts abolished those seats before the election. And then Mr. Woodward essentially dropped out of the public eye.
The family saga resurfaced when another fictional account of the shooting, "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" by Mr. Dunne, was published in 1985 and later was produced as a television movie. Mr. Dunne said this week that Mr. Woodward had called him before publication to ask that he not mention the Woodward name while publicizing the book. Mr. Dunne said he obliged him.
As "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" reached the best-seller lists, Mr. Woodward and his wife, Lisa, married Sept. 28, 1985, in Paris. They had each attended the same Swiss private school, Le Rosey, then reconnected later in life. Friends and Mrs. Woodward's lawyer, Jerome Tarnoff, say that for several years the couple lived a life of comfort, sailing their boat in the Mediterranean and spending time in apartments in London, Paris and New York.
But Mr. Tarnoff said the marriage began to unravel in 1994. He said Mr. Woodward spent much of the year traveling the world, calling from train stations in Europe. In 1996, Mrs. Woodward filed for divorce, and the couple began a custody battle over their daughter, now 7 years old.
Mr. Woodward's lawyer, Steven E. Lewis, did not return telephone calls left at his office, but Mr. Tarnoff said Mrs. Woodward had temporary custody during the divorce proceedings. He said Mr. Woodward was allowed to see their daughter "40 percent of the time," and that he took her on trips to Colorado and Rhode Island.
"He was a very good father," Mr. Tarnoff said. "He loved that child more than life."
But friends said Mr. Woodward slid into another depression late last year. Mr. Pollak, who had not spoken to Mr. Woodward since they worked together at More, said they exchanged letters last year.
"It was a very unhappy letter," Mr. Pollak said of the note from Mr. Woodward. "He talked about how his marriage was breaking up, and how he was not getting to see his child as much as he liked."
For Mr. Woodward's friends, this final image of a despondent man is not how they wish to remember him. Instead, friends recalled his sensitive nature and his unique style.
"He wore clothes differently," said Ms. Braudy, who became friends with Mr. Woodward during the 70's, before she wrote her book. "He had the manners of a European prince. He was a very attractive personality, but he was vulnerability transcended in a way."
Another friend said simply, almost wishfully, upon receiving a call from a reporter, "Everybody is tired of this story, right? It's tragic and awful and it's over, I hope."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: DIPLOMACY;
Chinese Embassy Bombing May Hurt Bid to Win Support for Peacekeepers

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is expected to complicate, and could even undermine, efforts by the United States and other NATO members to win United Nations endorsement of an international peacekeeping force for Kosovo, Administration officials acknowledged tonight.
China, which has a veto in the United Nations Security Council, has steadfastly opposed the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia and has made clear its suspicion about the motives of the Western alliance. 
 Still, Administration officials said they believed that if NATO was able to come up with a Russian-endorsed peace plan that ends the bombing, China would be unlikely to veto a Security Council resolution sanctioning a peacekeeping force, despite the attack.
Operating on little beyond television news accounts of the bombing, White House and State Department officials said they immediately telephoned senior diplomats at the Chinese Embassy in Washington tonight to express their concern.
In Beijing, the American Ambassador, James Sasser, was alerted by the White House by phone to the developments in Belgrade and asked to meet with senior Chinese officials to offer condolences.
News of the bombing was immediately relayed to President Clinton and to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright shortly after she met with the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, officials said.
Mr. Annan said in a statement issued after the meeting that he was "shocked and distressed to learn that NATO air strikes" apparently hit the embassy and a civilian hospital in the city of Nis. "He reiterates his conviction that an urgent political solution must be found to the present crisis in the region," said his spokesman, Fred Eckhard.
While consultations with the Chinese have seemed almost a second thought to the Clinton Administration during the air war, China has the power through its Security Council veto to defeat any United Nations resolution endorsing an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
Under a peace plan approved this week by the Group of Seven most industrialized nations and Russia, any peacekeeping force in Kosovo must be "endorsed and adopted by the United Nations." That wording was apparently intended to satisfy Russia and to make it possible for it to take part on a peacekeeping force.
In recent days, American and European leaders had begun to court China more aggressively for its support for -- or more likely, its lack of opposition to -- a Security Council resolution. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany had been expected to travel to Beijing next month for talks.
China has opposed the air campaign against Yugoslavia from the start, consistent with its fiercely held position that a group of countries cannot interfere in the internal affairs of others. The Chinese may well see a parallel between Kosovo and Tibet or Taiwan.
"We are firmly opposed to any attempt to impose a solution on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," Ambassador Qin Huasun of China said earlier this week at the United Nations. "NATO must cease its military action immediately."
In February, the Chinese vetoed a separate Security Council resolution to extend the mandate for a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Macedonia, across the border from Yugoslavia. The veto was apparently a demonstration of China's fury over Macedonia's diplomatic recognition of Taiwan this year.
Administration officials insisted tonight that they had no confirmation that NATO was responsible for the bombing of the Chinese Embassy. "One of the things we've learned during the last 45 days is to be careful of what what we say before we know anything," a senior official said.
Another senior official said he believed that whether or not NATO proved to be responsible for the attack, the Chinese were not likely to veto an international peacekeeping force. "If we did indeed hit the Chinese Embassy by accident, we would express our regret to them," the official said. "There would be discussions and regret.
"But China has made very clear that it is opposed to the use of force. And if every other member of the Security Council believed that a peaceful solution was possible, China does not have a history of standing in the way. It would be hard to envision them justifying that."
During the cold war, China had close relations with Yugoslavia, largely because the the Government in Belgrade, while Communist, held to a policy of fierce nonalignment and was seen as a foil in Europe to the power of the Soviet Union. The relationship has remained close.
The Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, visited China after the 1995 peace agreement in Bosnia and received all the trappings of a formal state visit. His wife, Mirjana Markovic, has been to China on several occasions. and has praised the Chinese Government for its ability to adapt Communism to the post-Cold War era.
Two years ago, Ms. Markovic unveiled plans to build a Chinatown in Belgrade, but a shortage of funds apparently killed the project. Her only complaint about the Beijing Government is that it has adopted an economy that is too capitalistic. China was delivering oil to Serbia until several days ago, but stopped deliveries for reasons that appeared to be entirely capitalistic: Beijing was not being paid for the fuel.

IN PRAISE OF ANTIHEROES
 Figures and Themes in Modern
 European Literature, 1830-1980.
 By Victor Brombert.
 168 pp. Chicago:
 The University of Chicago Press. $29. 
 Ask literary scholars old enough to have received a proper education (I'm being deliberately provocative) what they think is the most heroic work of criticism ever and, chances are, they will reply Erich Auerbach's "Mimesis." That panoramic survey of "the representation of reality in Western literature" (3,000 years of it, from Homer to Virginia Woolf) was written during World War II in Istanbul, where the author, a German exile, had found refuge, and where he wrote it without the aid of libraries or research materials. Like the outcasts in Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451," he could cite from Petronius, Chretien de Troyes, Dante, Boccaccio, Rabelais, Montaigne, Stendhal, because he had, in a sense, become their books. Auerbach was high European culture, at a time when the Nazis were devoting their hideous energies to destroying it.
"Mimesis" is also, for such a humblingly learned enterprise, engagingly accessible ("Readers of the 'Odyssey' will remember the well-prepared and touching scene in Book 19," it opens; would that I did). In the largest sense Auerbach vindicates comparative literature, that most demanding of academic disciplines. To do it well, the scholar needs many languages and must master libraries of complex literary works. Expertise comes late in life, if, by good luck, life lasts long enough ("Had we but world enough, and time . . ." is Auerbach's epigraph).
Victor Brombert's latest book, though slim, recalls Auerbach's polyglot omnicompetence. It follows the antihero topos over 150 years, across five languages (excluding English) and through works by Bchner, Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, Svevo, Hasek, Max Frisch, Camus and Primo Levi. "The writers discussed in this study belong to several distinct cultural and linguistic traditions," Brombert notes; "in all cases, I have based my analyses on close readings in the original language." Brombert's head must buzz like a translating room at the United Nations. With an eye to his readers, however, he restricts his discussions to translated and well-known works. The 10 chapters look like a well-planned semester-length course for a class of handpicked graduates (Brombert is a professor of Romance and comparative literatures at Princeton).
In a brisk opening chapter he states the thesis: Although Dostoyevsky gave the term currency in his "Notes From Underground" ("A novel needs a hero, and all the traits of an antihero are expressly gathered together here"), Brombert locates the seed of antiheroism 30 years earlier, in Bchner's "Woyzeck" (a "loser"). The antihero emerges as "a perturber and a disturber," a "subverter" of things as they are. The type evolves into "heroes of inaction such as Proust's Swann and Joyce's Leopold Bloom." Above all, the antihero, as formulated by the seditious genius of literature, forces readers to question the ideology that drives their society ("Unhappy the country that needs heroes," as Brecht, a mass-producer of antiheroism, declared). The extreme of the subversive type is Hasek's good (i.e., bad) soldier Schweik, "an unheroic yet rebellious survival artist in a jingoistic world gone mad."
The chapters of "In Praise of Antiheroes" are self-contained and arranged chronologically. Each offers a lucid and economical explication de texte. There is little "theory" and much good sense. Some chapters work better than others. Particularly effective is the analysis of "The Overcoat." Gogol's story has as its antihero the St. Petersburg clerk Akaky Akakyevich (Brombert courteously explains the hilarious implications of the name, for those of us who do not have Russian). By dint of enormous sacrifice, Akaky acquires a new overcoat, only to have it stolen by street thugs the next day. Gogol's narrative, Brombert notes, has been subjected to "orgies of interpretations." His own interpretation, pointing to the story's "conflicting and enigmatic signals," is subtle and convincing.
The most effective chapter in the book is on Primo Levi. The text in question is "If This Is a Man" ("Se Questo un Uomo," in America banally entitled "Survival in Auschwitz"). Unlike Brombert's other texts, this is not a work of fiction. Levi describes how he was approached by a fellow camp inmate, a young Alsatian called "Pikkolo" (later identified as Jean Samuel), who asked to be taught Italian. Levi, "without first understanding why," conjured up lines from Dante, the 26th canto of the "Inferno," the "Canto of Ulysses," as the starting point of their lessons.
Levi admired Homer. Not the war-loving poet of the "Iliad," whose "orgy of battles, wounds and corpses" he found "almost intolerable." He preferred the "Odyssey," with its cunning, ingeniously antiheroic hero, Ulysses -- scheming, cheating and miraculously surviving. In Dante's "Inferno," Ulysses instructs his men as they suffer together in the circles of hell. So too does Levi instruct Pikkolo. In the squalor and degradation of Auschwitz the lessons create cultural resistance. Levi recalls that, starving as he was, he would gladly have "given today's soup" to have known how to connect two isolated lines of Dante's poem. But, like Auerbach in Istanbul (at almost the same time), he did not have access to the necessary libraries. Brombert points out that the thrust of Levi's Ulysses chapter "is of a spiritual nature. . . . The recourse to Dante's poetry, in order to teach Italian to an Alsatian fellow inmate in a German camp deep inside Poland, where Yiddish is the common tongue, becomes a symbol of universality and of the possible survival of meaning."
As Brombert glosses it, the Homer-Dante-Levi episode forms something more than an act of literary explication. One can read it as an apologia for comparative literature. Auerbach, writing his chapter on the 10th canto of the "Inferno," found in it a new "image of man" -- an image so glorious that it "eclipses the image of God." In that way Dante (partly, at least) redeems the inhumanity of the Holocaust for Levi.
Brombert's praise for antiheroes offers an oblique riposte to George Steiner -- a scholar and critic as polymathic, brilliant and effortlessly polyglot as Auerbach, but much more pessimistic. Steiner observes, "We do not know -- and surely there is something rather terrible in our doubt -- whether the study and delight a man takes in Shakespeare make him any less capable of organizing a concentration camp." Touching lightly on great issues, Brombert's elegant study ventures a tentatively affirmative answer.

Sydney Sets the Stage For 2000 Olympic Games

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
EVEN as the scent of scandal pervades the Olympic Winter Games scheduled for Salt Lake City in 2002, Sydney, Australia, host of the 2000 Summer Games, is well along with its multibillion-dollar program to build and renovate athletic fields, stadiums, parks and infrastructure. In fact, some stadiums and fields are already holding events, in part to test the people-moving machinery, and tourists traveling to Sydney anytime soon might want to check them out.
The Sydney railroad station and international airport will be decked out in their latest finery to welcome the approximately 300,000 foreign visitors (and 350,000 visitors from elsewhere in Australia) expected for the Games, which will run from Sept. 15 through Oct. 1. And hotels throughout the nation are sprucing up,not only for visitors who come for the Games but also because Olympic publicity is expected to generate an additional 1.6 million foreign visitors through 2004. 
 The accuracy of those projections, by Australia's Tourism Forecasting Council, is likely to depend on several events, especially the economic health of Australia's Asian neighbors and the fallout from the Olympic bribery scandal.
Sydney did not emerge with clean hands from the recent investigations. On the contrary, an independent Australian auditor found that officials for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games frequently violated International Olympic Committee guidelines in outbidding Beijing for the Games (which were awarded to Sydney in 1993). And Phil Coles, a member of the Sydney organizing committee and one of two Australian members of the International Olympic Committee, was reprimanded by the I.O.C. for accepting thousands of dollars in hospitality from cities bidding for the Olympics, a charge he admitted. But the auditor's report concluded that Sydney's red carpet treatment for visiting Olympic officials did not approach Salt Lake City's transgressions, which included cash, free medical treatment, tuition and air fare for Olympic committee members and relatives.
Sandy Hollway, the chief executive of the Sydney Games, said recently, "I don't think the ongoing publicity has been helpful to our efforts." There has already been a backlash among possible sponsors, forcing the Sydney committee to cut $32 million from the Games' $1.6 billion budget in late April.
But for now tourism officials are sticking with their original projections.
The 25,000 American tourists expected for the Games will be the biggest foreign contingent, despite the cost of the six-night packages from Los Angeles that start at about $5,000 including air fare. Australian officials said they expect that Americans will spend an average of $7,000 each, including air fare, hotels, food and Olympic tickets, which range from $8 for certain preliminary events to $1,054 for the highest-price seats at the opening and closing ceremonies (time trials are free for sailing, the marathon, the triathlon and cycling).
Sydney has already benefited from the publicity. The city climbed from the world's 26th most popular convention destination in 1995 to No. 1 in 1997, according to the International Congress and Convention Association.
Meanwhile, the pre-Olympics building boom continues. In March, Sydney completed its 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium, which after the Olympics will be used for Australian football games, cricket and concerts; its tennis center, with 16 courts and 10,000 permanent seats, is only a few months from completion. Seating capacity in the aquatic center is being increased to 15,000 from 4,400, hockey and archery centers are being upgraded, and an arena for basketball and gymnastics is being built. The new Athletes' Village will house about 15,300, eventually becoming part of the new suburb of Newington.
With so much at stake, Australia is leaving little to chance. Australian officials met in February with Louis Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to discuss security arrangements. Among other things, video surveillance cameras will be deployed at railroad stations, airports, hotels and other sites. And Australian delegations traveled to Atlanta three times: in 1995, to assess the impact of the Games on tourism; in 1996, to focus on working with the news organizations; and in 1997, to talk with industry leaders about what they would have done differently, or not at all.
Those visits appear to have been productive, because Mr. Hollway of the Sydney Olympic committee recently said that the organizers had developed so much information that they are considering selling it to other cities thinking about bidding for the Games. And in a moneymaking tradition dating back at least as far as Waldi, the dachshund mascot of the 1972 Munich Games, sales of mascot merchandise are expected to reach $500 million.
The Sydney mascots are Syd the platypus, Olly the kookaburra and Millie the echidna (a spiny anteater). It is not likely to hurt sales that there are three mascots instead of the usual one, nor will it hurt that the the array of souvenirs bearing their likenesses have been on sale since 1997.

HEADLINE: The Great Ape Massacre

BYLINE: By Donald G. McNeil Jr.; Donald G. McNeil Jr. is a correspondent for The Times based in Johannesburg.

 BODY:
Dieu-Donne Bima Bima is a nice young man with a gentle manner. With becoming modesty, he describes how the chopped-up bodies of three gorillas have come to be smoking over a fire outside his hut.
"I shot the big male as it charged me. The baby was on the mother's back, and when she turned around to look at me the baby did, too." He does an imitation of a tiny scrunched face peering at him. 
 "I shot her in the face, and the bullet went through it, too -- bouf! One bullet, two gorillas!" he concludes triumphantly.
As a horrified listener clutches his chest, he laughs. "Why do you want to protect gorillas? They're just animals."
Deep in Central Africa, the great humanlike apes -- gorillas and chimpanzees -- are rapidly being wiped out by hunters. Bima Bima will make about $60 for each adult gorilla, and would get nearly as much for a full-grown chimpanzee. Chimps with their heads and hands removed are sold as gorilla meat.
Much as that distresses conservationists, the need to stop the hunting has suddenly taken on more urgency in the West. In January, scientists announced that H.I.V.-1, the most common AIDS virus, came from the subspecies of chimpanzee found here, Pan troglodytes troglodytes. They believe it passed into humans when hunters nicked themselves butchering their kill or ate raw meat. Since the chimps don't seem to get sick from it, they may be the key to a cure. It's crucial that they be kept alive and are studied -- but that's not the fate they're headed for now.
Until recently, the great rain forest stretching from Nigeria to Rwanda belonged largely to Pygmies hunting with poisoned arrows. Nibbling at the forest's edges, they posed no more threat to the species within than the plains Indians did to the vast American bison herds.
But logging roads, shotguns and trucks are doing what the horse, Winchester and railroad did to the buffalo. As loggers extend a spider web of roads into the rain forest, hunters are moving down them, snaring or shooting anything that moves. There may be fewer than 120,000 troglodytes chimpanzees left, and thousands are killed each year. They reproduce more slowly than humans, one baby every four years.
Dr. Beatrice H. Hahn led a team from the University of Alabama at Birmingham that proved the link between AIDS and chimps.
Research has established that the pandemic form of H.I.V.-1 probably began to spread in humans in the early 1940's. Hahn showed that it came from the simian immunode-ficiency virus in troglodytes chimps.
What researchers most want to know is why the simian virus doesn't kill the host apes. To that end, they need to know how widespread infection is in the wild, which they might be able to determine from stool samples gathered from the forest floor. And they need blood samples drawn from wild animals. "These chimps are information we need," says Hahn, who has become an antihunting campaigner. "Killing them for the pot is like burning a library full of books you haven't read yet."
Environmentalists once thought most apes were killed in attempts to steal their babies for the illegal pet trade. But that's wrong -- surviving babies are just extra cash for hunters supplying the growing fad for "bush meat" on the tables of the elite in Cameroon, Gabon, the Congo, the Central African Republic and other countries.
Hunting endangered species is illegal, of course, but the law is rarely enforced here. The bush-meat market in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital, is no secret. It's a 500-foot stretch of sidewalk only a few blocks from the presidential offices and the $200-a-night Hilton Hotel. Vendors desultorily wave whisks over tables piled high with smoked and fresh monkeys, duikers (tiny antelopes), bush pigs and skinned snakes. Just behind them, watched over by rough-looking men, are piles from which long arm bones protrude, obviously those of chimpanzees and gorillas. At the fetish stalls, you can buy chimpanzee hands, gorilla skulls, round slices of elephant trunk or the bright red tails of endangered gray parrots.
"If your child is weak and you want to make him big and strong, you feed him gorilla meat," says Elie Bayoi, a vendor. "Or you can scrape the shoulder bone into water and bathe him in that. If you have a broken bone, you heat a chimpanzee skull and press it against the break." Chimpanzee hands cure stomach pains, he adds. Elephant skin repels garden pests.
The market isn't hidden, but the vendors are touchy. Even the chatty Bayoi refuses to let his stall be photographed; other vendors have mobbed photographers.
Karl Ammann is a Swiss hotelier who fell in love with the apes he photographed while running luxury camps in Africa. He has since become the chief nemesis of the bush- meat trade, and persona non grata to Governments whose indifference he exposes. He has spent years photographing the trade, sometimes with concealed cameras.
"The big conservation groups say only poor Pygmies eat bush meat, but look at these customers," he says on a walk through the market. "Look how they're dressed -- they're middle class. People don't want beef or chicken anymore -- they call it 'white man's meat.' I know a woman who has to take chimpanzee meat to her family whenever she goes home. You can order a gorilla for Christmas the same way I'd order a turkey."
To prove the point to a German television crew, he recently bought two heads: a chimp's and a pig's. The chimp was $8, the bigger, meatier pig only $5. Two gorilla arms cost $10, an equal weight of beef less than $4.
Ammann has a teen-age chimp at his Kenya home, and even on a visit to the tiny Yaounde zoo, it's clear that he is drawn to apes. He makes ooh-ooh noises and puts his head in the hands they stretch through the bars to groom him. "They have feelings and emotions," he says afterward, turning angry. "A wounded chimp will beg for its life. They're like retarded children, and we don't eat them. Where do we draw the line?"
The DNA of chimpanzees is 98.5 percent the same as that of humans, and Ammann calls eating them "98.5 percent cannibalism."
More mainstream conservationists have asked him to temper his language, saying it smacks of "cultural imperialism." One is Steve Gartlan, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature's Cameroon office. Vivid photographs of dead apes and reminders of their human qualities are "emotionally understandable but biologically unsound" since whole ecosystems need protection, he argued in a long critique of one of Ammann's articles. He also expressed sympathy for the hunters, saying, "We share an even larger percentage of our genes -- 100 percent -- with the rural poor."
At the urging of the fund, Cameroon has designated three new parks, though Ammann dismisses them as mere "lines on paper." According to a report provided on condition of anonymity by a scientist working in the 3,300-square-mile Dja Reserve in southwest Cameroon, about 100 hunters are camped inside. "Despite the European conservation money poured into the region," it says, "unique species are being wiped out at an alarming rate."
The explosion in bush-meat hunting is being propelled by two converging forces: logging and corruption. As prices for coffee, cocoa and oil have fallen, timber exports have soared. The roads bulldozed to reach the 800-year-old hardwoods are wider and smoother than the dirt national highways.
Rather than pay to ship beef or pork to the jungle dormitory towns where their workers live, the logging companies encourage hunting. The hundreds of log trucks headed for the coast become a bush-meat caravan. Bleeding bags of meat can be spotted behind the cabs; the drivers get a cut.
The political will to stop the hunting simply does not exist. Hunters rent their guns from army and police officers; there are roadblocks everywhere where police could seize the meat, but they let anyone through for a $2 bribe; Government officials serve bush meat at banquets. Transparency International, a not-for-profit corruption-fighting group, recently rated Cameroon the most corrupt country of the 85 it surveyed. Next-door, Nigeria, famous for corruption, was only No. 81.
Cameroonians say the problem is just getting worse. "When I came here in 1988, it was forbidden to kill animals," says Ndzana Ndzana, an environmental official whose territory includes the Gabon camp. "But we had guns then. We had vehicles. We had bullets. Now, with the economic crisis, the central Government gives us nothing. We can't do our jobs."
Bima Bima, the hunter, has agreed to join a project that Ammann wants to start. They hope to find a group of gorillas they can protect and habituate to humans, so they can prove that "gorilla tourism," like that which existed in Uganda until recently, is profitable.
Joseph Melloh, the first hunter Ammann converted to his cause, will be in charge. For him, it's business. "A gorilla is still meat -- it has no soul," he says. "But now I know that if you kill a gorilla, you use it once. But if you keep it for 30 years, and bring people to see it, you get more money. And you don't have to carry the firewood to smoke it."
Changing Africans' feelings about eating apes will be hard, Hahn says. "But it can be done," she says confidently. "The Japanese like to eat whales, but whales were being exterminated, so their behavior is changing. And conserving chimpanzees might turn out to be even more important than conserving whales or elephants or rhinos."
There's no guarantee that simian studies will reveal a cure or vaccine for AIDS. But the extinction of vital chimpanzee species surely guarantees that they won't.

HEADLINE: Al Gore's Money Problem

BYLINE: By Jill Abramson; Jill Abramson is Washington editor of The Times.

 BODY:
The Vice President stood before 40 wealthy Democrats in the Fifth Avenue palazzo of the Lazard Fr<heart>res executive Steven Rattner, a stunning place with marble columns and a view over the Metropolitan Museum. The guests, bathed in candlelight, nibbled at apple crisp and whipped cream. To be here, each had promised to raise at least $35,000 for Al Gore's Presidential quest.
Gore began by recognizing some of the more luminous luminaries in the room -- Eugene Ludwig, the former Comptroller of the Currency; Richard Gardner, former Ambassador to Spain and Italy; and a raft of Wall Street heavyweights. Then it was time for a joke: the one Gore tells at every fund-raiser, about an 8-year-old boy in Minnesota who wrote Gore a sort of fan letter that called him "the greatest Vice President of my time." There was a polite titter. As Gore moved on to his studiously rehearsed vision for the 21st century, the overwhelming impression was of a marble candidate in a marble setting. 
 So far in this young campaign, the issues that Gore loves -- from his "practical idealism" to his "electronic-privacy bill of rights" -- have lacked a certain electricity. But that is not to say that the Gore 2000 effort is a listless one. To the contrary, the candidate may still seem like the robot caricature of a thousand late-night monologues, but his campaign's fund-raising calls to mind a dizzyingly effective machine. In the first three months of 1999 alone, Gore fund-raisers piled up $8.9million in contributions -- easily a record, and a sum that has scared off all challengers for the Democratic nomination except Bill Bradley.
Between now and the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in August 2000, Gore intends to raise a staggering $55 million. The soul of this fund-raising machine is the candidate himself, with his vast and assiduously built network of supporters stretching from his native Tennessee to Wall Street and west to Silicon Valley and Hollywood, his reputation as an outstanding bottom-line salesman and his plain old tirelessness. Gore will spend countless hours on the free-range-chicken-and-Chardonnay circuit in the months ahead, rolling out a green carpet leading (he hopes) straight to the Democratic nomination. A massive early war chest is more important in this election than ever before, because New York and California, both key, expensive states, now have early primaries. Gore's facility with total-immersion fund-raising, then, may be his greatest strength.
Yet it may also prove to be his greatest vulnerability. There is the danger that Gore will ultimately focus too much on fund-raising, because he's simply so good at it, instead of solving his campaign's weaknesses -- like finding the issues and the message that broad swaths of voters can really get excited about. If he does not do this, and thus move the story of his campaign away from fund-raising, the defining impression left in the minds of the electorate could simply be his ability to charm the deep-pockets crowd; that could be disastrous at a moment when his standing in the polls is anemic and campaign-finance reform is popular.
Gore's opponents are no doubt aware of this potential weakness. Before it's all over, there will almost certainly be attack ads from foes recalling his role in the 1996 election as the Democratic Party's "solicitor in chief," cold-calling donors for cash, not to mention his star turn with a chorus line of Buddhist nuns in saffron robes. "Political money is the wrong game to monopolize in the year 2000," says Fred Wertheimer, a campaign-finance-reform advocate. "That's particularly true for Gore," Wertheimer adds, because of the 1996 scandals. "By raising so much money, Gore has become emblematic of the Washington money culture that the American people find repugnant," Wertheimer continues. "It's a high-risk strategy."
Even so, for Gore or any other candidate these days, fund-raising remains a necessity, not an option. Gore declined to speak with me on the record about fund-raising, but did allow me, as his campaign kicked into high gear, to tag along and get a firsthand look at events that are generally off-limits to the press. The day that ended chez Rattner was a typical jumble of official appearances sandwiched between unofficial schmooze sessions with fat cats. It began in the Bronx at the Helen Keller Elementary School in the heart of the Co-op City housing development, where Gore read aloud to a second-grader dressed in a neat uniform, who confided that she wants his job someday.
Then the motorcade rushed him to a private dining room at the Four Seasons, where he joined rich Manhattan executives for a feast of black bass with squid-ink risotto. In the afternoon, there were private chats with other prominent New York Democrats. For cocktails, Gore met with a group of African-American business leaders who have each pledged to raise $5,000 for the campaign, at an apartment on upper Park Avenue. Dinner, with a $10,000-a-head bounty, was with a group of executives from the communications industry at the trendy East Side restaurant Daniel. And finally, dessert at Rattner's.
The day's take: an impressive $1.5 million.
David Geffen, sitting in a large leather chair in one of the immense rooms in his $47.5million, nine-acre Beverly Hills estate, tells me that he finds fund-raising "time-consuming and irritating." But he intends to spend a lot of time doing it for Al Gore. "I view this as an important election," says the Hollywood mogul, clad in a white polo shirt, jeans and white sneakers. "We're going to work very hard to elect Gore and replace the most radical House and Senate in history."
Seated next to Geffen, in another sumptuous leather chair, is Andy Spahn, formerly Gary Hart's national finance director and now a fund-raising and political adviser to Geffen and his Dreamworks partners, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. Geffen and Spahn say they will very likely hold a dinner for Gore later in the campaign, much like the intimate 1996 meals Clinton shared with Geffen and 15 or so Hollywood execs, where $2 million was raised.
"My biggest worry about the Vice President between now and the election is that he become the best communicator he can be," Geffen says. He worries that Gore does not have the sparkle that his boss transmits so effortlessly. "Clinton recalls the meal you ate together and what you left on the plate." Some of Gore's other Hollywood supporters voice the same concern. Famous directors like Spielberg and Rob Reiner are eager to race to Washington to give their man some emergency speech coaching. "He's really funny, but he has a hard time letting his natural personality emerge," frets Reiner, whose film "An American President," about a picture-perfect commander in chief, was made with research help from Gore's staff.
The key to fund-raising is one-to-one networking, and Gore has proven extremely effective at tapping connections from every phase of his life. In Hollywood, for example, his longtime ambassador is John Cooke, a Disney executive, who expects Gore's California effort to raise millions. While Bill Bradley has longstanding friendships in Hollywood and is close to the Disney chairman, Michael Eisner, as well as to Barry Diller, Gore has sewn up the team from Dreamworks.
Farther up the coast are the executives in the high-tech industry who have dubbed themselves the Gore Techs. During the second Clinton-Gore inauguration, the Vice President set aside two hours to meet with a dozen executives from Silicon Valley. The group, which included the high-tech venture capitalist John Doerr, the Intuit chairman Scott Cook and the Marimba software founder Kim Polese, were wowed by Gore's fluency with the New Economy. "He really gets it," says Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite, who has attended several Gore Tech meetings and has kicked in $1,000 to Gore.
The candidate has since met with the Gore Techs, who now number more than two dozen, 17 more times. At a Gore fund-raiser last month at the Woodside, Calif., mansion of Janina Pawlowski, co-founder of E-Loan, his Silicon Valley supporters raised $400,000 for their candidate. Besides the nice turnout and breathtaking view, Gore had a rare loose public moment. He and Tipper bopped with a band that included two former members of the Grateful Dead; Tipper even played the bongos. Then they repaired to dinner at Doerr's house with 30 Democratic donors, who raised $10,000 apiece.
John Tyson, an international business investor, is even raising money from Gore's class at Harvard, where he was one of the future Vice President's roommates. He recalls long discussions with Gore about Vietnam and civil rights as they lay in their bunk beds. "I always knew he'd be President," Tyson says. "He does well in an environment where there is a lot of pressure." At a recent gala in Washington, Tyson solicited $20,000 from the class of '69, and is now expanding his efforts to other classes.
Gore's prowess at the money game is one of the things that attracted Bill Clinton in 1992. As magnetic as Clinton was on the fund-raising circuit, he always hated actually asking for money. Gore, in contrast, is known as the best "closer" in the business, someone who can get contributors to commit to a specific amount and write their checks on the spot. When he was a Senator, his family kept an apartment on Capitol Hill that he used as a fund-raising safe house, where he could make calls between votes. And he did not disappoint Clinton, helping raise millions after he joined the ticket in 1992 and a staggering $40 million for the party in 1996.
Add to the Gore network, then, some of Clinton's cash constituencies. One is Wall Street, although there is some lingering doubt over the Vice President's environmentalism, which some deem as antibusiness. Gore has strategically set his sights on some of the party's younger financial powers -- like his recent host, Steve Rattner. During the 1996 campaign, he orchestrated a seat next to Rattner at a fund-raising reception and subseqently called him to seek his counsel on economic issues. When it came time to gear up the 2000 fund-raising effort, Rattner signed on to play his part in a process that even he concedes "could not possibly be what Jefferson had in mind."
The engine of the Gore fund-raising machine is just up K Street from the White House, in a spartan campaign headquarters that hasn't been painted and lacks enough desks for the burgeoning staff. Here Johnny Hayes, a portly 58-year-old with glasses, presides as the campaign's finance chairman, watching over the responses to the 1.5 million direct-mail solicitations the campaign has already sent out. Until January, when he resigned to raise money full time for Gore, Hayes was a director of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a cushy job that he landed with Gore's help.
Their relationship goes back to 1976, when Gore, then a 29-year-old running for Congress for the first time, dropped by Hayes's insurance office in Hendersonville, Tenn., to ask for his support. Hayes knew Gore's father, the Tennessee Senator, and decided to help. The pair traveled the state raising money and asking for votes in a '62 Ford pickup with no air-conditioning. When Gore ran for the Presidency in 1988, Hayes raised $3 million from Tennessee and has tended the green turf of their home state ever since.
A few blocks down K Street is the law firm Wunder, Knight, Levine, Thelen & Forscey. Peter Knight worked on Gore's Congressional staff for 13 years and helped run his Presidential campaign in 1988, then managed the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. These days the boyish-looking Knight spends much of his time talking to members of Gore's national fund-raising committee -- The Solicitors," as they're known within the campaign. Each promised to raise $50,000 during the first three months of 1999, and almost all reached their quotas. Knight likens raising so much money in such a short time to "jump-starting a small cap company." But it's more than that, he insists: "Fund-raising is a real reflection of your political support. The Vice President enjoys a great deal of political support."
Another key member of the team is Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raising Wunderkind who between April and November 1995 raised $27 million for Clinton-Gore -- a record that stands to this day," he notes. In the winter of 1997, Gore flew through the snow to make it to McAuliffe's 40th-birthday bash at the Mayflower Hotel.
Like their candidate, McAuliffe and Knight pay lip service to the need for Congress to pass campaign-finance reform. But the bottom line is that in the absence of such reforms, they will play by the rules of the game as they exist, and play with a vengeance. Skyrocketing campaign costs have sparked the fund-raising equivalent of a nuclear arms race, and the 2000 election will be the most money-infused in history. George W. Bush raised $7.6 million in the first three months of 1999, while Bradley managed to pull in a respectable $4.3 million.
Post-Watergate election-law reforms aside, the campaign-finance system has become shot through with loopholes. Laws limiting individuals to giving $1,000 during the primaries simply mean an emphasis on rounding up donors who have lots of friends who can also write $1,000 checks. Candidates who accept Federal matching funds must limit their spending to $33.5 million in the primaries, but there are legal ways to skirt the rules. Money spent on fund-raising and on legal and accounting costs does not count toward the limit, and candidates are allowed to establish separate funds for complying with the arcane and complex Federal election laws.
In the general election, there is a much bigger loophole to exploit. Although the nominees don't raise any more private money and receive $70 million in public funds for the general election, parties can raise "soft money" -- unrestricted donations from unions, wealthy individuals and corporations -- to help elect their candidates. The two parties combined raised more than $250 million in such contributions in 1996 -- and it was in the soft-money arena that most of the campaign fund-raising abuses occurred.
The ghosts of past scandals loom over Gore's current efforts more than anyone else's. "There will be heightened scrutiny after 1996," says Lyn Utrecht, outside counsel to the Gore campaign. So the Vice President's finance and legal advisers have created an unusually onerous set of fund-raising rules. First and foremost, Gore will not personally solicit donors with telephone calls, a practice he stopped in 1997. He has also vowed not to use his official residence for ticketed fund-raising events. Campaign lawyers have held more than 300 briefings on election law for volunteer solicitors, and the campaign is scrutinizing the backgrounds of all solicitors and any checks drawn on foreign bank accounts. Campaign workers are told to follow even the smallest rules, right down to making sure all solicitation letters go out on campaign stationery.
Still, concedes Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, "No system is going to be perfect." In fact, there have already been a few glitches. Some suspicious donations that came in money orders may be returned. And the 850,000 pieces of direct mail sent out by the campaign in February went to some donors whose checks the campaign would not want. Among the receipients: Johnny Chung, the California donor who recently told Federal investigators that some of the $400,000 he had contributed to Democrats (since returned) came from the Chinese military.
Some of Gore's longtime fund-raisers are clearly irritated with the "by the book" mentality. A Miami solicitor complained that he had to get the text of his thank-you notes to donors approved by Washington. A solicitor in Los Angeles griped about being inactive while a background check was run: "I could have raised $100,000 in those two weeks."
Just forty-five minutes away from Geffen's estate, Maria Hsia sits in her cramped, smoke-filled office in a tiny strip mall in San Merino, a small Valley town with a large Asian population. These days Hsia still ekes out a living as an immigration consultant, but in light of last year's indictment, her career as a Democratic Party activist is over. Hsia first met Al Gore back in 1988 at the home of Pamela Harriman, the late doyenne of Democratic Party fund-raising. When Hsia and John Huang were seeking influential lawmakers to join them on a trip to Taiwan the next year, Gore was their only taker. Later, she helped raise $30,000 for Gore's 1990 Senate re-election and was there with financial and political help again in 1996. "I've met dozens of politicians," Hsia says. "The others came saying, 'Money, money.' By comparison, he is very genuine and caring."
Hsia's indictment stems from her involvement in the now infamous 1996 luncheon for Gore at the Hsi Lai Temple in nearby Hacienda Heights, where monks and nuns who had taken a vow of poverty donated $65,000 to the Democratic Party. It was illegal for the temple, a tax-exempt religious institution, to play host to a political fund-raiser, and some of the funds were allegedly "conduit contributions" -- money given through the donating worshipers, who were later reimbursed. Eventually, the Democratic Party returned the funds, and Hsia insists the case against her was baseless. (All but one of the six charges against Hsia have been thrown out; the Justice Department is appealing.)
Nevertheless, the incident was a major embarrassment. When he was first questioned, Gore insisted that it was just a "community outreach" event. Later, he conceded that his staff knew in advance that it was "finance related." Moreover, Hsia is one of a half-dozen Gore fund-raisers and supporters who have been investigated by the Congress and Justice Department and one of three who were indicted because of alleged 1996 fund-raising abuses. Another is Howard Glicken, a Miami businessman who raised $2million for the D.N.C. in 1996, visited the White House 70 times, festooned his two Jaguars with vanity license plates that read "Gore 1" and "Gore 2" -- and pleaded guilty last year to election-law violations.
So while the Gore loyalists McAuliffe and Knight are the reigning kings of Democratic fund-raising, that is something of a dubious distinction these days, and both men know it. Last year, Republicans on the House Commerce Committee questioned the legality of large lobbying fees Knight's firm has received from Democratic donors close to Gore. Ultimately, Knight and Gore were spared an independent-counsel investigation, and Knight (who says he will sever ties to his firm when he joins the campaign full time later this year) dismisses the Republican grumbling as both partisan and wrong.
But along with Gore's tortured defense of his fund-raising phone calls -- there was "no controlling legal authority" outlawing them -- this stream of allegations makes great fodder for his opponents. Already, the Republican Presidential aspirant John McCain has sniped: "The American people deserve a controlling ethical authority, as well as a controlling legal authority."
While Gore's fat war chest succeeded in driving off all Democrats but Bradley, that leaves only one credible alternative if Gore stumbles early in the primaries. Donors now have only two candidates competing for their money, and Bradley has recently been poaching on Gore territory, raising millions in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. "Our strategy of raising so much money so early may have succeeded too well," says one Gore adviser.
Finally, and perhaps most critically, there is the danger that Gore, to maintain his front-runner status, will concentrate too much on fund-raising. That's what Gary Koops thinks is happening, and his opinion is worth a listen: Now a Washington public relations consultant, Koops was an adviser to Senator Phil Gramm in 1996 -- when Gramm raised $8 million in the first three months of 1995, setting a record that Gore has just beaten. Gramm, too, was a powerful fund-raiser, and he didn't even make it to the primaries. As Koops puts it: "We've got the money' isn't a good campaign message."
Air Force II is on its way to sunny Palm Beach, and Al Gore is in an upbeat mood. He comes back to chat with the three reporters in his entourage. We all have copies of George Stephanopoulos's book, hot off the presses. Gore grabs one, looks in the index for his citations and glances at a few. As Gore well knows, almost everyone in the Clinton White House is furious over the book and the former adviser's disloyalty. But it seems the book has mainly nice things to say about the Vice President. "Looks O.K. to me," Gore jokes.
There is no question that the Vice President connects well in this sort of setting. But this setting is not what campaigns, in the end, are made of. Perhaps Gore's Hollywood friends are right to worry whether their candidate is a strong enough communicator -- a communicator of ideas, of charisma, of confidence, all the things that must be in place to deliver votes on a massive scale. Yet there won't be much time for such grandiose issues when Gore hits the ground in Florida today.
Gore's entourage races to a $1,000-a-head fund-raising luncheon at the Four Seasons. Then the Vice President dashes off to a lumber yard in an economically distressed section of Miami called Allapattah, where he gulps a Cuban coffee, gives a short speech and announces $25 million in Federal aid for the state's citrus industry. After that it's back-to-back fund-raisers at the Sheraton Bal Harbour.
Along the way, there is chicken breast and Chardonnay. There is the candidate at the podium, recognizing local officials. There is the joke about the 8-year-old boy in Minnesota. And when it's all over, there is another day's final tally: another $700,000 for Gore 2000.

HEADLINE: What's Doing In;
Los Angeles

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM; TODD S. PURDUM is chief of the Los Angeles bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
The early 1990's were the plague years in Los Angeles, as wildfires, riots, a devastating earthquake and the worst recession since the Great Depression left Southern California badly shaken and tourists scared away. Many of the problems underlying that social unrest remain, but the decade is nevertheless ending on a triumphant note, with the local economy booming, good news abounding and civic boosterism in full flower.
The city recently won the right to put its new face forward to the world at the Democratic National Convention, which will be held in August 2000 at the soon-to-be-finished Staples Arena downtown. It may also be on the verge of winning a National Football League expansion team that would play nearby at a newly refurbished Coliseum. 
 The new California Science Center in Exposition Park adjoining the Coliseum is drawing thousands of visitors to its interactive exhibits and IMAX movie screen, and several new restaurants have sprung up downtown as part of a fledgling effort to revitalize a neighborhood that has long tended to be deserted after dark. And fund-raising has been completed for the new Frank Gehry-designed Disney Concert Hall, to be built across from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion downtown.
At the same time, Los Angeles is enjoying an unusually concentrated burst of high-profile theater productions, featuring big-name movie and television stars, while the streets of old Hollywood, the long-declining neighborhood where the movie industry began, are struggling toward a major revival. And the enduring pleasures of the broad strip of public beach in Santa Monica remain undiminished.
 
Events
The city's leading nonprofit theater, the Mark Taper Forum, on Grand Street between First and Temple, will stage two star attractions this spring and summer. First is "Enigma Variations," the American premiere of a work by the French playwright Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt. It stars Donald Sutherland as a reclusive Nobel Prize-winning novelist and Jamey Sheridan as a journalist sent to interview him, through June 13. On June 20, previews begin for a production of Eugene O'Neill's "Hughie," starring and directed by Al Pacino in a repeat of his 1996 run in New York. This character study of a Broadway gambler and a hotel night clerk also stars Paul Benedict. June 27 to July 25; $25 for previews, $29 to $40 for regular performances. Call (213) 628-2772.
Next door at the Los Angeles Music Center, the Ahmanson Theater will play host to a Shakespeare double bill directed by Sir Peter Hall. "Measure for Measure" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will be in repertory from June 6 through Aug. 1. Kelly McGillis will star in "A Midsummer Night's Dream"; Richard Thomas, in both plays. Tickets: $15 to $52.50; (213) 628-2772.
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Boulevard, (323) 857-6000, whose blockbuster van Gogh exhibit closes May 16, follows that up with "Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution," which it bills as the first major retrospective of the master Mexican muralist in the United States in 13 years, from May 30 to Aug. 16. The exhibition features about 100 paintings, prints and drawings from Rivera's student years through his late Surrealist-influenced landscapes and portraits. Hours: Monday, Tuesday and Thursday noon to 8 P.M., Friday to 9 P.M., weekends 11 A.M. to 8 P.M. $7.
The Hollywood Bowl, the outdoor summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, begins its season with "Brazil Nights" June 26 and 27, featuring Carlinhos Brown, Sergio Santos and Viver Brasil, a 20-member dance troupe. There is no better place for a picnic, especially with fireworks at the three-night Fourth of July spectacular featuring Peter, Paul and Mary on July 2, 3 and 4. Most performances at 7:30 P.M. Tickets $5 to $70; (323) 850-2000.
 
Sightseeing
One of the most popular new attractions in town is the California Science Center in Exposition Park, 700 State Drive, near the University of Southern California campus. This sprawling collection of interactive exhibits is a wonderful place for children of all ages. Even the escalators have see-through panels so you can watch the innards work. The Digestion Diner lets you roll a 20-foot digestive tract out of a cut-out waitress, and the High Wire Bicycle suspended 42 feet above the lobby lets the bold experience the pull of gravity (with a safety net just in case). The museum is overrun with schoolchildren on weekday mornings, but quieter after 1 P.M. Open daily, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Free admission but $5 parking, and $3 to ride the High Wire Bicycle; (323) 724-3623. Adjoining the museum is the IMAX Theater, currently featuring, among its four films, "Everest," about an expedition to the world's highest mountaintop. Tickets $6.50; $3.75 for children, plus $1 more for movies in 3-D. Show times vary; call (213) 744-2014.
Hollywood Boulevard is the hoariest cliche of Tinseltown, with its Walk of Fame pink-terrazzo stars embedded in the sidewalk. This once sadly scarred strip has managed something of a rebound, with a new subway stop scheduled to open this summer and the corner of Hollywood and Highland now a giant construction site for the theater that will house the Academy Awards ceremony beginning in 2001. One of the most interesting new developments is the restored Egyptian Theater, a 1920's movie palace at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard, now the home of the American Cinematheque, a film and video exhibition organization that sponsors screenings of classic, revival and new films. For prices and program, call (323) 466-3456.
For another kind of movie palace experience, try the Million Dollar Theater at 307 South Broadway downtown. One of the grandest of the city's old silent-movie stalwarts, built in 1918, it is reminiscent of a Spanish cathedral, with carved wooden motifs and towering corinthian columns. The theater began a second life in the 1950's as a venue for Mexican movies featuring the comedian Cantinflas and live stage shows of Latin music. It has recently reopened on a limited basis after several dark years, and again promises weekend bills of Latin music.Information: (213) 473-0720; best to call weekends or check local listings.
 
Where to Stay
Its renovation was not scheduled to be finished until this week, but already, the Avalon, 9400 West Olympic Boulevard, has been drawing would-be hipsters. With 87 rooms in three motel-style buildings on the southern fringe of Beverly Hills, the former Beverly Carlton has been reimagined as a retro-chic retreat in soft green shades. It features modern conveniences, like CD stereos, laptop hookups and fax machines, and funky offerings, like Tarot readings, and has positioned itself as a low-cost alternative for those who can't yet afford the Mondrian. Rates from $150, to $250 for the penthouse; (800) 535-4715 or (310) 277-5221, fax (310) 277-4928.
The Beverly Plaza, 8384 West Third Street, near the Beverly Center mall on the edge of West Hollywood, is a reliable spot in a neighborhood where walking is possible, even a pleasure. This hotel houses a day spa, small outdoor pool and two saunas. Cava, a lively tapas restaurant, is just off the lobby. The 98 rooms are done in a Spanish Mediterranean style. Rates: $179 to $228, often lower depending on availability; (800) 624-6835, fax (323) 653-3464.
Budget: The Hotel del Capri, 10587 Wilshire Boulevard, is a simple motel-style spot along a strip of high-rise luxury apartment buildings in Westwood, near U.C.L.A. This is a good value, near many attractions, from shopping in Century City and Beverly Hills to the Getty Museum a couple of miles west. Some of the 78 rooms are efficiencies, and back rooms are quieter. Rates from $105 to $150. Heated outdoor pool, free parking and a free shuttle that, if available, can take guests to destinations within three miles of the hotel; (800) 444-6835, fax (310) 470-9999.
Luxury: On a hill less than a block from the beach, the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, 1700 Ocean Avenue, Santa Monica, is a grand redoubt and also family friendly. Its airy, galleria-style lobby opens out to the ocean, and a pool deck has wonderful views. A first-class gym and an excellent new Provencal restaurant, Lavande, make this one of the most relaxing hotels in Los Angeles, and though nearby construction makes beach access less convenient at the moment, nothing can really spoil this spot. There are 345 rooms and 25 suites, all with contemporary decor; rates from $235 for nonocean view rooms to $325 for full ocean view, with partial views at $275; (800) 223-0888, fax (310) 458-6761.
L'Ermitage, at 9291 Burton Way, a broad boulevard in a residential part of Beverly Hills, has recently been renovated, and its contemporary-style rooms in soft tones attract the likes of Isabella Rossellini and Whitney Houston. Gardenlike atmosphere with rooftop pool and 124 rooms, 8 of them suites. Doubles: $295 to $448, depending on availability; (800) 800-2113, fax (310) 278-8247.
 
Where to Eat
If any cuisine is hot in Los Angeles these days, it is the broad family of country French, and no place is hotter than Lucques (pronounced Luke), a cozy spot within the bare brick walls of the onetime carriage house of Harold Lloyd at 8474 Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood. Homey specialties like beef short ribs with mashed potatoes and horseradish cream share space with lamb, fish and game in grilled, baked and roasted Mediterranean preparations. A bar menu is served until midnight. Delicious desserts and a fairly priced wine list with many French and Italian selections. Dinner for two with wine, $150. Reservations (essential): (323) 655-6277.
For a parade of Pan-American dishes in a sleek, humming setting, head for Ciudad, in the newly happening downtown at 445 South Figueroa Street, the latest venture of the Two Hot Tamales team of Mary Milliken and Susan Feniger. The ingredients, not to mention the exotic house cocktails, may be unfamiliar, but plunge into the mixed Spanish antipasto plate of aged manchego cheese, marinated olives and peppers, tomato croutons, chorizo and spiced almonds and you'll never look back. Entrees like tamarind-glazed salmon go beautifully with first courses like plaintain gnocchi in tomatillo cream. Try the coconut cream cake with pineapple granita for dessert. Dinner for two with tropical cocktails and a modest Spanish wine, $100; there is a $36 pretheater menu; (213) 486-5171.
For after-theater chow, no place is more venerable than the Pacific Dining Car, an old-fashioned red-leather institution at 1310 West Sixth Street near downtown, open 24 hours a day. It serves not only giant steaks, but such late-night reliables as smoked salmon and homemade roast beef hash, plus a perfect martini in an elegant trumpet-shaped glass. Not cheap, a bit musty, but the real thing. Dinner for two with drinks, $85; less for eggs and such; (213) 483-6000.
Scores of barbecue restaurants coexist in the city's thriving Koreatown. One of the best is Chung KiWa, 3545 West Olympic Boulevard, a tidy, crowded place where gas braziers are built into wood tables; you can grill your own marinated short ribs, pork, shrimp, rib eye and so on, to be wrapped in a leaf of romaine like a taco. A platter of accompaniments, including the fiery kim-chi, rounds out the meal. Dinner for two: $60 with beer and sake; (323) 737-0809.
For a true cross-cultural immersion, try another Koreatown spot, Guelaguetza, 3337 1/2 West Eighth Street, this one offering Mexican specialties from Oaxaca. Try the black mole tamales in banana leaf, and the tlayudas, pizza-like giant flour tortillas smeared with mashed beans, dried meats, tomatoes and cheese. Dinner for two, $25 (bring your own wine or beer); (213) 427-0601.

Monuments of Stone, Testaments to an Island

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK 

 BODY:
TODAY the residents of Vinalhaven Island, Me., nestled in Penobscot Bay some 15 miles off Rockland, boast of their lobstering industry and an aversion to tourists. But nearly a century ago, the tiny island, roughly nine miles long and five miles wide, had another source of pride: its cliffs and knolls provided the granite for some of the nation's most imposing structures, among them the Brooklyn Bridge, the United States Custom House and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York.
The history of the island's quarries, and specifically the erection of eight monumental columns in the cathedral's sanctuary, are the subject of an exhibition lining the cathedral's photography wall. "The Eight Columns of Worship: A Tribute to Human Ingenuity and Faith" tells the story behind the buildings that stand as a testament to the majesty and endurance of Vinalhaven granite. And though the photographs and artifacts are on view only through next Sunday, the structures themselves will live on as a kind of three-dimensional exhibit -- one that is being documented anew by Chester Higgins Jr., a photographer for The New York Times and an occasional visitor to the island. 
 "My love for stone comes from my love for ancient Egyptian architecture," Mr. Higgins said. "While visiting the island I heard that they had these quarries, and through my research I discovered that so much of the stuff that came from the island landed in New York. I was fascinated."
He set out to photograph the stone monuments whose impact on society transcended time but whose architectural style fell out of favor after only a few decades.
"The use of steel and reinforced concrete replaced the massive granite buildings," said Roy Heisler of the Vinalhaven Historical Society, where the exhibition originated. "The importance is the legacy of the stones, and the great buildings that were produced with them."
Settled by fishermen in the late 18th century, Vinalhaven reached its population peak (2,855) in 1880, when the quarries employed some 1,500 men from New England, Canada and Britain.
What made Vinalhaven granite unique was not only its superb quality and color -- a warm pinkish-gray -- but the ease with which it could be transported off the island. By the 1850's, the Bodwell & Webster quarry (later the Bodwell Granite Company) had received a number of Federal contracts for reinforcements at forts along the Atlantic and gulf coasts. But the demand for granite escalated enormously after the Civil War, when a trend toward European grandeur in American architecture sent the Government scurrying for an economical but beautiful stone to use in custom houses, post offices, dams, bridges and banks as far west as St. Louis. The stones used in the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in Philadelphia, the Chicago Board of Trade Building, the Executive Office Building and part of the Washington Monument were culled from the Vinalhaven quarries.
At the same time, the architect George Heins had set out in search of the stone for the cathedral's eight columns. He ultimately chose Bodwell's Wharff Quarry. With its 100-foot-tall ridge of nearly flawless virgin granite, the quarry could easily accommodate the columns' dimensions: 54 feet long and 6 feet in diameter.
The first block of granite, extracted in August 1899, was some 64 feet long and 8 1/2 feet wide and weighed about 300 tons. After being cut from the bed, each block was hewn with hand tools to within 3 inches of a column's finished dimension. In order to turn and polish the columns, the quarry commissioned the world's largest lathe, a behemoth weighing 135 tons that became an overnight media sensation.
But disaster struck. As it neared completion, the first column suddenly snapped in the lathe. The second and third columns soon followed suit. By August 1901, the architects had determined that a single block of such proportions could not withstand the pressure of the turning on the lathe. They decided to build the columns in two pieces: a 90-ton, 36-foot-long lower monolith and a 40-ton, 18-foot-long upper portion that could be reattached so as not to be noticeable.
On July 2, 1903, the first two columns and their bases were loaded for the trip to New York aboard a specially designed barge. After being pulled through the Atlantic, into Long Island Sound and up the Hudson River, the barge arrived at the West 134th Street pier eight days later.
The moving and erecting of the columns is widely considered among the world's most remarkable engineering feats. When the tide was right, the columns were rolled off the barge using its huge derrick, a timber hitch and an inclined plane. A truck with wooden wheels, pulled ahead by a powerful winch some 300 feet at a time, then carried the column pieces through the streets of New York to 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, a journey of about two miles. It took 19 days.
Finally, a derrick made of two 96-foot lengths of Oregon pine and powered by three steam engines was constructed to swing the columns into place atop the bases. By Nov. 25, 1904, all eight columns were in position, waiting for the walls to be built around them.
The onset of modern construction techniques put an end to major quarrying in 1918, but paving blocks continued to be exported until 1939. Aside from a smattering of rusty pieces of machinery, the only existing evidence of Vinalhaven's legacy is a single column.
"It's a flawed column, remaining right on the shore," Mr. Heisler said. "It's overgrown, but its meaning is fairly evident."

Unshackled to Capture Their Country Again

BYLINE: By LYLE REXER; Lyle Rexer, an art critic, is writing a book on old-process photography.

 BODY:
AT the turn of the century, Hungary was the most photo-obsessed country in the world. Princes and princesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequented photo exhibitions and proudly displayed their own prints. From a nation the size of Indiana emerged many of the leading names of modern photography, including Andre Kertesz, Brassai, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Robert Capa. But four decades of Communist rule isolated Hungarian photography from this artistic heritage, from the outside world and from many of its subjects.
Now, at the turn of a new century, Hungarian photographers are struggling to rebuild that tradition. Free at last to point the camera where they please, they are creating an idiosyncratic amalgam of imagination and international styles dimly glimpsed. This combination may be the perfect vehicle to express their ambivalence about the world after Communism. 
 "We have been forced to make up our history as we go along," said Sandor Szilagyi, who has organized a series of exhibitions of Hungarian photography at the Hungarian Consulate on East 52d Street in New York. "There are masters but no movements, personalities but no trends." Two current exhibitions of contemporary Hungarian photography display the diversity of this improvised avant-garde: "Kind of Blue: Six Documentary Photographers" (organized by Mr. Szilagyi at the Consulate) and "Hungary Today: Five Contemporary Photographers" (at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in Chelsea). A self-taught quality pervades this work. Wheels are reinvented and continents discovered. But if this made-up modernism sometimes looks almost familiar, it is just as often unpredictable and daring.
It is ironic that this generation of photographers should have to reinvent photography, because Hungarian photography once ruled the world. In the 1920's, Moholy-Nagy defined the Bauhaus photographic style with compositions that featured bold, abstract geometries. Kertesz melded a sense of visual form and an instinctive feel for the meaningful instant.
Brassai, whose Paris years are now the subject of a major exhibition at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, helped forge the myth of modern Paris as a place of hedonism and creativity. Capa, the prototype of the photojournalist, provided the 20th century some of its most dramatic images of war. His brother, Cornell, went on to found the International Center for Photography in New York. In documentary and art photography, these expatriates bequeathed a many-dimensioned visual idiom we think of not as Hungarian but as modern.
The current generation of Hungarians never had a chance to claim that inheritance. The upheavals of right-wing authoritarian rule, World War II and 40 years of Communism narrowed the scope of photography. The door to the West slammed shut, and official policy transformed pictorial realism into soft-focus folk cliches. Photographers could not view original prints by the great expatriate Hungarians, who remained largely just names. Other native experimental work was almost as inaccessible. One of Hungary's largest photo collections -- nearly 400,000 images -- was tucked away in a private apartment. Artists worked alone and met informally, sharing unsanctioned innovations.
Photography deemed "conceptual" or "formalist" was taken off gallery walls, pulled from exhibitions and confiscated from private homes. The knowledge of basic photographic processes eroded.
In this climate, today's photographers used whatever inspiration they could find to reinvent photographic tradition. In their work, opportunism constantly triumphs over orthodoxy. Jozsef Hajdu, represented in last year's Consulate group, taught himself about the history of the medium by working as an archivist of the photographs collected by the old Imperial Post Office in Budapest. Mr. Hadju's roots are grittily documentary, influenced by the routines of factory life near his home. But he has read other lessons in the images he studies, and his black-and-white photos of his own grimy teacup transform a proletarian realism into a lyrical play of abstract forms and liquid textures.
Gabor Kerekes has taken the most extreme steps to reclaim photography as a medium of individual expression. Mr. Kerekes, now in his late 50's, had been the premier Hungarian photojournalist of the 70's. His dispassionate, even icy style enabled him to convey in the image of an empty factory, for example, a guarded pessimism that was difficult for the Communists to censor and impossible to conscript into any campaign for a brighter future. His was a highly influential vocabulary of constraint. In 1982, he abandoned his career. "I had grown tired of making images ordered by someone else," he said during a visit to New York last year. He could have been speaking for his entire generation. He destroyed all but 20 or so of his images, which he donated to the Hungarian Museum, and turned inward. "I couldn't see in the real world what I sought emotionally and spiritually," he added.
For eight years, Mr. Kerekes immersed himself in the study of, among other subjects, philosophy, natural history and alchemy. Just as Hungary emerged from Communism, he emerged from artistic hibernation with a repertory of disturbing visions and an intense interest in old photographic techniques.
His pictures, often salt or albumen prints, are richly toned nightmares: a truncated elephant's foot, antique and sinister scientific equipment, a murky, apocalyptic sunset, body parts. His closest counterpart in the West is probably Joel Peter Witkin. His work has inspired an old-process movement in Hungary. In part, the movement tries to make a virtue of necessity, compensating for a lack of money to invest in exotic digital technology. For Mr. Kerekes, however, repossessing the past and reinventing the present go hand in hand.
Yet the work of Zsolt Peter Barta, a protege of Mr. Kerekes, suggests that in the country of "masters but no movements," a movement may be taking shape. Unlike earlier avant-gardes, its members share no style but rather an attitude. They face the world after Communism with deep ambivalence. Mr. Barta's series of close-up black-and-white photos of preserved human cadavers, for example, can be seen, once the shock wears off, as an attempt to come to terms with the continuing impact of the political past. Free to depict any subject, he is drawn to those that suggest a perpetual inhumanity, preserved in the formaldehyde of memory.
The ambivalence is most obvious in the work of the documentary photographers, who, perhaps even more than art photographers, feel compelled to make up a new tradition. So Imre Benko has developed a monumental style to counter the heroic nationalism that was Hungary's cold war staple. His new Hungary is a series of incongruities. In one image, an impromptu barbecue takes place outside an enormous housing project. In another, a worker in a steel town looks up at the towering remnants of a dead industry that has just barely failed to squeeze the life out of him. Like so many Hungarians, Mr. Benko seems suspicious of every political gesture, refraining from criticism and celebration.
MORE partisan are Judit M. Horvath and Gyorgy Stalter, who are doing for Hungary's Gypsy minority what the Farm Services Administration photographers did for the rural poor in the United States: asserting their dignity and calling attention to their economic condition. Renouncing official folk images of Gypsy life, Ms. Horvath and Mr. Stalter have forged a documentary style that imports the grandeur and drama of the Magnum photojournalists, typified by Robert Capa.
The desperate search for a method has left its mark on all the photographers who came of age under Communism, but a younger generation doesn't feel the need to shoulder the burden of starting from scratch. To artists like Lenke Szilagyi, the past and the world are available. Although farthest removed from the legacy of Kertesz and least concerned about recovering it, she may be closest to it in spirit. In her black-and-white images of difficult rural lives lived in an unlovely Hungary, she orients herself toward a living presence, however minimized or despairing. She seems to say there will always be a need for the eye that can divine the essential moments of our humanity.
In March, Hungary dedicated the House of Culture for Photography, in the renovated Budapest mansion and studio of the former Austro-Hungarian court photographer Mano Mai. It is modeled on New York's International Center for Photography. With a new museum and an international outlook, with the Internet and travel to Paris and New York, some Hungarian artists are beginning to wonder what will sustain their work when it leaves the shadows for the global glare, when idiosyncrasy gives way to international influence and the masters join movements. After his initial enthusiasm at visiting the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Barta wondered if he had lost his innocence. "We need a context for our work, yes," he said, "but we also need to think we are inventing something new."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
In New Orleans, Developers Rush to Add Hotels

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
THE enduring allure of the French Quarter coupled with the city's role as host to such spirited street parties as Mardi Gras and the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival have secured its place as a top vacation spot. But increasingly travelers are in town on business -- at least for part of their stay.
The result has been a strong demand for hotel rooms by travelers to conventions and trade shows. To meet that demand, 13 hotel projects are in various stages of construction, 10 of them new hotels and the rest expansions of existing hotels. Half a dozen additional projects are in the preconstruction development phase. All this activity follows the opening of a dozen new hotels over the last three years. 
 The New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau puts the annual average occupancy rate at 75 percent, compared with 73 percent five years ago. In that time, 7,000 hotel rooms have been added for a total of 28,000.
"People think of New Orleans as a tourist town," said John Keeling, a hotel specialist in the Houston office of PKF Consulting, a real estate consulting company. "But now, first and foremost, it is a convention town."
The new hotels include the independently owned and operated International House and the St. James Hotel and franchise operations -- Holiday Inn, Sheraton, Marriott, and Promus Hotel Corporation, whose brands in New Orleans are Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.
A major catalyst for the sustained growth, hotel operators and developers say, has been the 360,000-square-foot expansion of the city's riverfront convention center. The third phase of the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, completed earlier this year, brought its space to 1.1 million square feet. Built on the riverfront more than 15 years ago as the Lousiana State Pavilion for the 1984 World's Fair, which rose in what is now the Warehouse District, the center has been host to more than one million out-of-town people each year.
As an event the World's Fair did not draw as many visitors as the city had hoped, said William Langkopp, executive vice president of the Louisiana Hotel and Motel Association. But it did open up the riverfront and drew people into the warehouse area, which had never been considered for hotels, restaurants and shops.
The recent hotel development trend here has been different from development in other prominent convention destinations, such as Las Vegas, Nev., or Orlando, Fla. With few exceptions, the new hotels are opening in the central business district or in the warehouse area. Both neighborhoods are within walking distance of the French Quarter and the riverfront.
MOREOVER, a majority of the new hotels are small to mid-sized projects -- 150 to 350 rooms. Statistics gathered by the New Orleans Metropolitan Visitors and Convention Bureau show that over the next two years about 2,350 rooms will be added to the present inventory.
The lodgings are usually five to 15 stories high, a modest scale dictated almost entirely by city policies that have simultaneously limited the number of available sites for new construction and spurred the redevelopment of underutilized properties that the city has deemed worth saving.
"The city realized that there were many neighborhoods and buildings worth preserving beyond those in our traditional historic areas like the French Quarter and the Garden District," said John Williams, an architect who has been involved in the designs of several gut-renovation projects, including the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. "So you have projects like the Queen & Crescent hotel, which preserves the city's first high rise and gives the business district a new hotel."
The City Council reviews every demolition petition in historic districts, which now include most of the warehouse and central business districts. Most buildings 50 years or older qualify for protection. But to encourage development in these areas, the city provides a restoration tax abatement that freezes the assessment to the predevelopment level for at least five years.
Potentially of even more value to developers taking on gut renovations of these properties is the Federal historic rehabilitation tax credit, which allows developers of qualified properties to recover up to 20 percent of the redevelopment costs.
Marriott International's recent expansion in New Orleans illustrates some aspects of the current hotel development trend. Until 1997 the only hotel in the central part of the city operated by Marriott was the 54-story, 1,290-room Marriott New Orleans, a convention hotel on Canal Street. But changes in the city's guest profile encouraged Marriott to expand its presence here.
WITH New Orleans-based TVG Group, whose partners are Steve Manshel and Henry O'Connor, serving as the builder and owner, Marriott has opened two Courtyards in the last two years. A Residence Inn by Marriott, an extended-stay hotel, opened in 1997 and a Marriott Renaissance, a moderate-rate hotel, is scheduled to open in the middle of 2001.
"Our Courtyard product has been a successful suburban hotel concept," said Craig E. Lambert, senior vice president for moderate and economy brands for the Marriott Corporation, based in Bethesda, Md. "But we discovered that in New Orleans people wanted the Courtyard brand in the urban area where there are exciting and fun things going on."
The Marriott Courtyard that opened last December went into a building that included the gut renovation of a molasses factory and a newly built section. The new 202-room Courtyard is on Julia Street in the heart of the Warehouse District.
Mr. Lambert said that it was usually difficult to justify the cost of a newly built Courtyard in urban areas. The tax incentives offer a way of doing it in New Orleans at the price point people will pay, he said.
In New Orleans Marriott Courtyard nightly room rates range from $100 to $150 depending on the season, which is well below the rate range for the company's full-service hotel on Canal Street where rooms range between $180 and $225.
By far the largest and most ambitious of the gut-renovation projects is on Canal Street, where the landmarked Maison Blanche department store is being transformed into a Ritz-Carlton hotel. The $200-million project, which will include the renovation of the adjacent Kress building and Maison Blanche annex, is being developed by White House L.L.C., based in Baton Rouge, which owns the buildings. The development partnership includes Bernard Mason, William Hindman and Stewart Juneau, who is the managing partner.
In recent years the 530,000-square-foot building has been less and less profitable as a department store. But Mr. Juneau was convinced of its potential as a luxury hotel because of its location on the western boundary of the French Quarter and because of the city's strong hotel market.
"Occupancy is improving and room rates are rising," said Mr. Juneau. But historic rehabilitation tax credits were an essential component of this project.
The hotel, scheduled to open next fall, will have 452 rooms, 25,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 10,000-square-foot column free ballroom; a mezzanine level spa and street level shopping arcade. Room rates will range from $305 to $335, said Mr. Mason, one of the developers.
The project will also include an all-suite hotel, to be known as the Quarter Suites, also managed by the Ritz-Carlton. Room rates have yet to be set.
Despite the pace of hotel development, industry analysts do not see a potential glut of rooms in the foreseeable future. The main reason is a shortage of available sites or redevelopable buildings in the areas where hotel operators need to be.
While the national chains have entered the New Orleans market, there are limits, Mr. Keeling believes, to their willingness to expand. "This will help bring about an equilibrium," he said. "And the shortage of rooms may continue for an extended period."

As Available Sites Dwindle, Housing Prices Rise

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WHEN Alexandra M. Sirio sold her two-bedroom town-house unit in Mahwah last month, it fetched more than $10,000 above the $176,000 she paid for it two years ago. But she did not realize that trading up to a single-family detached house elsewhere in Bergen County would be fraught with frustration.
Ms. Sirio, a legal secretary who is in her 30's, lost three houses because other buyers snapped them up before she made an offer or made higher bids than she was willing to pay. Even the three-bedroom colonial in Westwood she will close on next month drew multiple offers over the list price price of $299,900 -- including her successful bid in "the low $300,000 range." 
 "I'm not overjoyed," she said, "and a little discouraged by the state of the market and that I had to fight for the house."
Nunzio and Theresa Guarnieri, empty-nesters in their 50's, knew they were ready to trade the ranch they have lived in for 20 years in Hillsdale for a maintenance-free condominium town house when they found an enclave of 43 such homes going up in nearby Westwood. The couple, who have two grown children, have contracted to buy one of the three-bedroom houses, priced in the $300,000 range, and will put their three-bedroom ranch on the market this week.
"We really only looked at this house and think we're getting our money's worth," said Mr. Guarnieri, who manages technology for call centers for a national bank. Mrs. Guarnieri is a homemaker. "We also feel our house will sell in the hot market," he added. Buying one house and selling the other "will be a net-net for us," Mr. Guarnieri said, noting that the monthly cost of carrying the new home -- in the $1,000 range -- will be equal to what they pay on their existing house.
Both experiences suggest the myriad sides of the state's housing market, which has steadily strengthened over the last two and a half years and now is reaching what some industry professionals call a frenzied pace. The frenzy comes from too many buyers chasing too few houses, which is pushing up prices, they add.
All segments of the market, from the entry level to luxury housing and from town houses to one-family detached houses are moving, said Hal Maxwell, senior vice president of New York operations for Coldwell Banker, a residential brokerage in Short Hills. Mr. Maxwell, who covers Bergen and Hudson Counties, added: "Jersey City and Saddle River are feeling the same pressures."
The pressures extend, in varying degrees, across the state. Buyers, confident of a vibrant economy, are eager to make down payments, said Gloria Woodward, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, adding that "the issue is the lack of inventory."
While it's a seller's market, added Jacelyn Botti, regional vice president at Weichert Realtors in Morris Plains, potential sellers "are not listing their properties, because they are afraid when it comes to their purchase there will be nowhere to go."
As for new homes, 30,000 housing permits were issued in the state last year, lifting the production level out of the recessionary doldrums of the early 90's, said Patrick O'Keefe, chief executive of the New Jersey Builders Association in Plainsboro. But, he added, that is "the end of the good news" because with "the inventory of approved land dwindling rapidly and little land in the approval process" there will be a logjam in production.
The Otteau Appraisal Group, based in East Brunswick, reported that while statewide sales activity in the first quarter of this year rose 5 to 10 percent from last year, the inventory of homes was down 30 percent. The activity in Monmouth County reflects the trend, data from the group showed.
IN that time contracts were signed for 2,541 homes in the county, up from 1,977, or 29 percent, from 1998. Meanwhile, there were 3,430 homes available for sale, downfrom 4,382, or 22 percent, from a year earlier.
Jeffrey G. Otteau, the firm's president, said that homes were often selling within days, rather than months, which was the case last year. Residential brokers say buyers are now anxious to get pre-approved for mortgages and even, in some cases, forgoing home inspections.
The average statewide sale price for existing homes in the fourth quarter of 1998, the latest figures available, was $190,400, up about 3 percent from the same time the year before, according to the realtors association. For new homes the average price was $254,296, up an average of about 12 percent from a year earlier, data from the New Jersey Builders Association show.
David J. Schoner vice president of the new homes division at Coldwell Banker, likened the home-buying activity in the state to "a gold rush of sorts." He said his company had closed 1,892 homes in 1998, 400 more than the year before.
Industry professionals agreed that along with the supply-demand imbalance factors stoking the activity include low mortgage interest rates -- which have inched up, but are still more than reasonable by historic standards -- and the state's economy and job market.
The economy is now in its 84th month of recovery, surpassing by one month the boom of the 1980's, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, noting that since 1992 the state had gained 400,000 new jobs. "The economy and jobs define the locomotive engine of housing demand," Dr. Hughes said, adding that the state should be "recession free until the next millennium."
Concerns remain, particularly about further price jumps and bidding wars, which do not happen in all sales, but are on the rise, brokers said. "It's not a pleasant market for buyers," said Ms. Woodward of the Realtors Association. "I just hope prices don't become so inflated that potential buyers will leave the market."
Added Mr. O'Keefe of the New Jersey Builders Association: "First-time buyers looking for new homes in New Jersey are an endangered species."
Mr. Otteau of the appraisal firm said though the average price increase of 10 percent since the last quarter of 1998 will grow to 15 percent by mid-summer, the price jumps are "not anywhere near the 30 percent increases" of the mid-80's.
By July higher prices and mortgage rates will lead "to a temporary pause and a slackening in demand," he projected, and the market, because of the healthy economy, will rebound by mid-September. He added that prices would continue their rise, but at a slower pace. "Buyers today will not aggressively chase prices as they did in the 80's," he added.
The challenges to builders, said John G. Udell, president of Weichert New Homes and Land Company, are rising land and construction costs, a lengthy approval process and competition from conservationists -- and the state -- for land. It takes much longer to build a home and "it's only getting worse," making a weak production level even weaker, he said.
Mr. O'Keefe predicted that "construction will slow later this year and into 2000" as the inventory of land for which construction approvals have been received dwindles.
Though there may be a production gap, Mr. Otteau said, some developers have been building inventories of unapproved land to counter the situation.
Westminster Communities, a division of the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, for example, has about 9,000 units in the pipeline it will build on land it purchased or is under contract to purchase and will take through the approval process. "You can buy land, but the prices are high, and sometimes so prohibitive that a project doesn't economically work," said Charles Kushner, president of Kushner Companies.
Meanwhile, the developer expects to produce 400 one-family attached and detached houses this year, up from 340 last year and 300 in 1997. Among them is the Enclave at Westwood, where the Guarnieris intend to live. It is rising on a site on Third Avenue, once occupied by a school, that the town rezoned for its current use and auctioned off. Mr. Kushner said his company was willing to pay $3 million for the site because it was in Bergen County where available land is scarce and it had been approved for housing, removing the risk.
The 43 houses, with 2,000 to 2,200 square feet of space, are selling for $320,000 on average, up from $265,000 since sales began last October. So far contracts have been signed or are pending on 23 homes. "It's a stable investment," Mr. Guarnieri said "We're not looking for phenomenal appreciation, we're looking for it to be steady."

HEADLINE: There Is No Joy, But Wait a Year

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP

 BODY:
THERE will be no professional baseball on Long Island again this season, no pop-ups rising impossibly high into the night sky, no diving catches in center or close plays at the plate, no rhubarbs or homers or scoreboard pyrotechnics. But wait until next year.
In April 2000, a Wall Street investment banker and former high school catcher, Frank Boulton of Brightwaters, together with a former New York Mets shortstop and manager, Bud Harrelson of Hauppauge, plans to field a new minor league team called the Long Island Ducks. 
 When the Ducks take the home field for the first time, trotting from the dugout of a brand-new 6,000-seat, $18.9 million ball park now in the early stages of construction here, all the goose eggs posted in previous efforts to bring pro baseball to sports-minded Long Island will fall away, its promoters say.
Years and even decades after minor league baseball arrived in Connecticut, New Jersey and cities up and down the Eastern Seaboard, the 2.6 million people on Long Island will at last have a club of their own.
Politicians and promoters who attended groundbreaking ceremonies here last month said this would be a game with no losers.
Long Island, they said, will get professional-caliber baseball featuring players who were once in the major leagues or came close. Suffolk County hopes to recover a $4.5 million investment in the ball park, which it will own, at a rate of $460,755 a year in rent, ticket surcharges and other revenue. The Ducks will lease the park and remain there by contract until at least 2010.
Most important, Long Island fans will pay $4 to $9 for seats that are all close to the field -- there will be no bleachers -- in a state-of-the-art park where a hot dog and a soda won't cost an arm and a leg. There will be 42 concession and souvenir windows, and 20 sky boxes. About 3,000 season tickets are now being sold, but at each game, another 3,000 will be available at the gate.
"The whole mission here is affordable family sports entertainment," Mr. Boulton said.
The ball park has too few seats to be called a stadium, Mr. Boulton said, but the field will have major league dimensions: the fence in dead center will be 400 feet from home plate, and the right and left field lines will be 325 feet. The field will be grass, and bats will be wood, not aluminum. "Aluminum bats are dangerous," said Mr. Harrelson, who is co-owner and manager of the Ducks.
Suffolk County paid the state slightly more than $2 million last year to acquire 11.3 acres of what used to be the grounds of the Central Islip Psychiatric Center. State Senator Owen H. Johnson, a Republican of Babylon, obtained a $14.4 million grant from the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, for the bulk of the financing, officials said. Mr. Boulton said that together, he and Mr. Harrelson invested "north of a million," but declined to be more specific.
George Gatta, the deputy Suffolk County executive for economic development and planning, said the county would get additional revenue by charging a fee for a sponsor to name the park. He said the county was soliciting proposals.
Mr. Gatta said the park would also benefit from $10 million in road improvements made in recent years to ease access and add parking for adjacent buildings, including the county's Cohalan Court Complex and a Federal courthouse now under construction. He said a 2,000-car parking lot for the courts would be available to ball park patrons at night, when all weekday games will be played. The park will also have a new 223-space lot closer to the field.
The Ducks will play a 140-game season as one of eight teams in the Atlantic League, an independent minor league -- not affiliated with Major League Baseball -- founded by Mr. Boulton three years ago.
Other Atlantic League teams, most of which are also playing in new parks, include the Bridgeport Bluefish in Connecticut, the Newark Bears and the Somerset Patriots in New Jersey, the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds in Pennsylvania and the Nashua Pride in New Hampshire. Two more teams will be added by next year, Mr. Boulton said.
He said Ducks players would range from veterans with major league experience to younger prospects moving up through the minors. Players, he said, will be able to showcase their talents for all major league clubs simultaneously, giving them greater flexibility than those in major league farm systems, who are tied to one big-league club.
But some Ducks, Mr. Harrelson said, will play for the love of the game, with little hope of making the majors. "No one ever wants to quit," said Mr. Harrelson, whose big-league playing career spanned more than a decade. "It's just such a great game, and you feel so good about yourself when you're playing."
The Ducks certainly won't be playing just for the money. Mr. Boulton said the average salary would be about $2,500 a month, more than the $800 some minor leaguers earn but a long way from the $200,000-a-season minimum paid in the majors.
Mr. Harrelson said players would come from the more than 300 cut from spring training each year by major league teams and their farm clubs. "We are really looking for people with previous experience in professional baseball," he said.
Mr. Harrelson, who came up through the minors to join the Mets in 1965, was a member of the Miracle Mets, the world champions in 1969. He is remembered for a bench-clearing brawl that broke out during the 1973 playoff series between the Mets and the Cincinnati Reds, when Pete Rose barreled into him as he covered second during a double play.
For the last 30 years, Mr. Harrelson said, he has been one of only a handful of big leaguers -- and the only Met -- living in Suffolk County. Mr. Harrelson said his Hauppauge home is less than 10 miles from the new ball park. "Utmost for me," he said, "is that I will be doing something for the county and really for all of Long Island."
The Ducks' principal owner, Mr. Boulton, who was born and raised in the Brightwaters area, has operated minor league franchises in Albany, Wilmington, Del., and Prince William, Va.
In 1992, the Mets opposed his plan to move the Albany Yankees, a farm team for the New York Yankees, to a 6,000-seat stadium to be built with $7.5 million from Suffolk County at the county's community college in Brentwood. The Mets objected that a Long Island team would infringe on territorial rights they shared with the New York Yankees, hurting ticket sales. The objection was upheld by a panel of major and minor league representatives.
David C. Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business and legal affairs, said last week that because the Ducks were not affiliated with Major League Baseball, the team and the Atlantic League were exempt from the territorial rule.
Mr. Howard said the Mets didn't believe the Ducks would draw away fans. "The quality of play is so very different," he said. "By definition, they are players who for whatever reason haven't attracted the interest of the major league programs."
The Ducks got off to a shaky start. In November, the Suffolk County Legislature rejected a $4.5 million bond issue to help pay for the ball park, despite strong support from County Executive Robert J. Gaffney and other top county officials.
Opponents of the bond said backers of the park had concealed the true cost of the project two weeks earlier, when the legislature had accepted the $14.4 million state grant they said was supposed to cover project costs. "I just thought it was bait and switch," said Steve Levy, a Democratic legislator from Holbrook.
The legislators approved the county bond in December.
Mr. Levy, a former Little League shortstop and an avid Mets fan since childhood, said he expected that Long Island would embrace the Ducks.
"It's inexpensive to go to a game, and you can have your kids back in bed by 11," he said. "The players are accessible and don't have attitudes like a lot of those millionaires you'll find in the big leagues. Little kids can go right up and touch them."

HEADLINE: In New London, Creating Jobs, Building a Buzz For Revival

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE stately homes along the Thames River in New London testify to an era of extravagance, a time when waterborne commerce and whaling brought wealth to the city.
Many decades have passed since its economic peak. Most of the city's factories began to head South in the 1960's, employment declined as the submarine maker Electric Boat scaled back, and large sections of downtown were ripped up for redevelopment projects that never happened. But over the past year there has been a revitalization buzz in the city, most notably because of the announcement a year ago that the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer would build a $250 million research complex employing 2,100. In addition, the long-dormant New London Development Corporation, a private economic development group working closely with state and local government agencies, has targeted six downtown sites for development. It has also prepared a plan for the reuse of the former Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which left 30 acres of waterfront commercial property vacant when it pulled out of town two years ago. 
 The corporation is considering how to make the best use of a rebuilt deep-water pier, an unused foreign trade zone that offers benefits to importers, and a little-used downtown enterprise zone that offers tax breaks and other incentives to employers. There are also public improvements planned, the most ambitious a $15 million waterfront park that the city hopes to have in place for the arrival of Opsail 2000, a visit by a group of tall ships next year.
"There are a whole lot of different, remarkable ideas out there for New London," said John C. Markowicz, executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region, a regional economic development group. "There's a lot of energy in the New London Development Corporation, and now some of the other towns in the area are talking about setting up their own programs. There's a sense of excitement that's been building ever since the Pfizer announcement."
David M. Goebel, a retired Navy rear admiral who is the chief operating officer of the corporation, said the city would also benefit from a decision to make New London one of a few stops on a high-speed rail corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. New London, he said, "has an obligation to make itself the kind of place where people might want to stop for the day."
People could wander up from the train station, stop in the shops, see museums like the Hempsted Houses and Shaw Mansion, and watch a play at the Garde Theater. Also, with the rail service, New London could become a commuter city for Boston or New York, which would be only an hour away. "All of a sudden, New York and Boston are very close," Mr. Goebel said. "You've just got to start taking a different view of what all this can mean to the community."
Dr. Claire L. Gaudiani, the president of Connecticut College in New London, who last year revived the development group at the request of state officials, has long written about how social justice requires opportunity for all. New London has become a sort of laboratory for her theories.
"It's hard for anybody to believe this is going to be good for everybody," Dr. Gaudiani said, "because we're all so used to situations where somebody gets hurt, but there are such a diverse group of projects and we're thinking of everybody: Will this build the tax base? Will this create jobs? Will this help people in the lower income brackets?"
She added that it has been "a great chance to see a diverse group of citizens work together to make social justice and economic development two sides of the same coin."
Susan Howard, a real estate broker with U.S. Properties in New London, said the Pfizer announcement last year, followed by the development corporation's efforts, have already started to have an impact. A vacant warehouse on Washington Street that was listed for three years, for example, garnered three offers in one week late last year, then sold for $350,000.
In the last year, office space prices have risen by more than 20 percent. "And even at the increased prices, there's very little left," Ms. Howard said.
A large office complex called Shaw's Cove is almost 100 percent full, "and that had a vacancy rate of almost 50 percent for a long time," Ms. Howard said. She went on: "Last year I closed 50 commercial deals, almost one a week, about half of them sales. That's a lot. The year before I did probably 30, and of the 30, most of them were leases rather than sales.
"It used to be you couldn't get people to even look at property in New London. Now buildings on Bank Street, people are bidding for them. If something becomes available, at least three people are looking at it."
The New London City Manager, Richard M. Brown, said that while it seems the activity has developed very quickly, it has been building since as early as 1971, when an urban development plan was created. For instance, the city prepared the New London Mills site, a former linoleum factory. for a new developer -- so when Pfizer needed land for expansion, it was available.
"I don't think you can ever look at anything as an overnight success," Mr. Brown said. "There may be individuals or organizations that can serve as catalysts, but the basic structure has got to be there. We've been devoting a lot of attention to downtown, we have a program to eliminate housing blight, we're bringing properties back on tax rolls and encouraging home ownership. All of the things happening now are taking place within a much larger context that has been taking form over many years."
One criticism of the plan has been that the corporation is trying to accomplish too much, too fast. Mr. Goebel dismisses those concerns. "Our goal, really, is to bring it all up at once," he said. "If you don't do that, what you do is you put a Band-Aid on a serious problem, and the city has had experience with that approach in the past."
Clearly, the catalyst for the current interest in New London was the plan by Pfizer, long one of the dominant employers in the region with a large research operation in Groton, right across the Thames River, to build a new campus in New London.
George M. Milne Jr., a Pfizer vice president, said the contractors would start driving piles for the buildings soon, start erecting steel in June, and have it ready for occupancy by late next year. Why New London?
"Part of it is the area got lucky," Dr. Milne acknowledged. "We started in Groton after the war because the plant was here, and it was the investment in the land that was around the plant in the late 1940's and early 1950's that gave us a place to start our research division, and since then it has just continued to grow. So we got here sort of as a consequence of decisions that were made a long time ago." "But this area is on the threshold of becoming a much more attractive area," Dr. Milne continued. "There's a unique opportunity we enjoy here in southeastern Connecticut to really lead the world in biotechnology and medicine. With four major companies already in the state, and the beginnings of a biotechnology industry, we'd like to work very hard to attract more of that business into southeastern Connecticut."
The New London Development Corporation quickly moved in to take advantage of the attention that the Pfizer announcement brought to New London, creating a plan for several key but deteriorated downtown properties.
* At the Crocker House, an old building at State and Union streets, ground-floor retail space and 40 apartments on the top floor will be developed.
* At Union and Pearl streets, an enclave of residential units will be created.
* The Parade, an area on State Street not far from Union Station, will be restored with mixed-use retail and entertainment businesses that will capitalize on the estimated one million commuters and tourists who pass through annually.
* A new residential building of 62 units on Eugene O'Neill Drive is to be built where there is now a parking lot.
* The Bacon and Cronin buildings on State Street are to be rehabilitated to create 25 units of housing and 15,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space.
At the same time, at the former Navy research laboratory at the south end of the city, where the state already plans a park around the Civil War-era Fort Trumbull, the group has proposed a mixed-use development that would include a 200- to 250-room hotel, health club, office space, marina and retail shops, as well as 80 townhouse units, at a cost of $50 million to $84 million.
"This brings the opportunity to repopulate portions of New London and restore the middle-class balance," Mr. Goebel said. "The philosophy is to create anchors in the community and spread out from there, creating more housing, improving transportation. It all becomes possible after the base is established."
The corporation is working to reduce negative impact on existing businesses and residences. At the Crocker House, for example, residents qualified for almost $2,800 in relocation benefits.
And commercial tenants in the area have few complaints. "It allowed me to move into a larger facility at a time when I was ready to expand my business anyway," said Joshua A. Friedman, who owned a custom furniture and cabinetry business in New London on Pequot Avenue, on land needed by the Pfizer development. The development corporation helped him find new, larger quarters on Jay Street, helped him get a loan for the expansion, and paid his moving expenses.
The corporation has had to deal with a setback for one of its earliest efforts, a proposal to bring in a private company to run the city-owned Ocean Beach and invest $7 million for a water park. Residents rejected the plan in January because it would have brought an estimated 2,500 cars a day into one of the most heavily-populated residential areas of the city.
"If we're going to be able to do good planning, we have to be able to hear 'yes' from citizens, but we also have to be able to hear 'no'," Dr. Gaudiani said. "There was no ugliness at the meeting. People were grateful to the work N.L.D.C. had done, but they looked at the number of cars that would be coming in and said 'no.' I don't want a city where people are going to roll over and let just anything happen."
Mr. Goebel said city residents have been discouraged by the number of false starts in revitalization over the years, but the ideas are still generating excitement.
"There are more and more people saying it really could happen this time, it's got the right team, the right state interest and support, the right leadership, and the right City Council to drive it all through," Mr. Goebel said. "New London recognizes that this is its chance, this is its opportunity. And I think there's a realization that this could be the last opportunity to pull it off."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Linda C. Fentiman;
Call to Monitor Long-Distance Health Care

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
TELE-MEDICINE is a field where law and ethics are lagging far behind what is going on, said Linda C. Fentiman, director of the Health Law and Policy Program at Pace University School of Law in White Plains. It is a trend that not only has the potential to expand access dramatically to quality health care, she said, but also to make it more impersonal, to reduce health-care costs -- or even increase them -- and to destroy a patient's right to privacy. And, she asks, Who should be regulating such practitioners?
Tele-medicine is medicine at a distance. It may mean a local doctor consults a colleague at a teaching hospital by means of a teleconference, and perhaps the patient's X-rays are shared by modem and other high-tech equipment. It also encompasses tele-pharmacy, where medicines are sold on the Internet, and tele-health, where health information, not all of it reliable, is shared on Internet home pages. 
 Ms. Fentiman, who lives in Manhattan, was a criminal defense lawyer in California in the 1970's. She was drawn to health law after representing clients who used mental-state defenses, and that interest spilled over to the bio-ethics law field and then the business aspects of health care law. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with her:
Q. What is the negative side of tele-medicine?
A. There are several negatives and a lot of uncertainty. The real potential negative is that it may change the physician-patient relationship. Now, even in the managed-care era, we are accustomed to having a physician whom we consult on a regular basis, who knows us. With tele-medicine we're more likely to have a more complicated relationship with both our local physician and another physician at a distant location. There are questions about what are the ethical obligations the tele-physician owes a distant patient.
There may be concern about patient privacy and confidentiality. When a patient is in a physician's office, she knows that the physician is examining her, but there is no one else there to see her. If it's a tele-mediated consultation, then not only will a physician and other health-care professionals at a distance "see" her but so also may technical people, video support people. So she may not be aware how much her personal privacy might be compromised. And there is the possibility that lots of her data may be sent over the Internet in order to do an effective tele-diagnosis.
Q. What are the issues involved in the purchase of prescription drugs on the Internet?
A. People have long been able to mail away a prescription to sort of a wholesaler and get their drugs in that way, and no one saw any problems. Now, there is no reason your local doctor couldn't order a prescription and you could order it over the Internet. The interesting new thing is how many of these Internet pharmacies have pharmacists who are answering questions as well as filling orders that are placed over the Internet. Virtually every state, including New York, requires that a pharmacist be licensed in the state in which he is prescribing medication. There seems to be a potential problem if a pharmacist in, say, Chicago is answering questions for a patient in New York and if that pharmacist is not licensed to practice pharmacy in New York. So there are questions about whether the New York oversight board can effectively limit or regulate or scrutinize what the tele-pharmacist is doing and is he or she practicing pharmacy in New York without a license?
Q. The answer is unclear at this time?
A. Right. It hasn't been litigated. The on-line pharmacist has only been on line for under six months.
Q. What do you think of reports of doctors on the Internet prescribing without face-to-face consultation?
A. That seems very scary. Clearly, that physician doesn't have any personal observation of the patient, and the heart of the physician-patient relationship is face-to-face contact -- looking and touching. And also being able to pick up nuances in how a patient is telling about his symptoms. All that is missed when practicing via the Internet.
There is a trade-off, perhaps, in the traditional tele-medicine setting between intimate contact and observation with a more accurate diagnosis. What you're getting through tele-medicine is often a high-tech second opinion. Often that is worthwhile for a patient who can't come to a major academic setting -- either it's too far or too expensive or the patient can't take time off from work. That patient can save a great deal of resources by having a tele-medicine consultation, but then the patient is relying on his local physician to fill in the gaps, to consult with the tele-doctor.
Q. For decades there have been people who looked to other countries for certain drugs they could not obtain here. Doesn't the Internet pull those barriers down further?
A. Yes, and that can be the plus of tele-medicine -- that it helps pull down barriers to access and quality of health care. And it puts the patient potentially more in charge of his own medicine treatment. But at the same time we don't have the paternalistic state medical board or paternalistic Food and Drug Administration protecting the patient from his own folly.
The Food and Drug Administration has erred on the side of patient protection, generally speaking, screening out drugs if it's not absolutely certain that they're safe and effective. Now sometimes that is bad because patients sometimes don't get access to drugs that other countries think are effective. But sometimes it is good. The F.D.A. prevented the use of thalidomide in this country precisely because there was a very zealous F.D.A. scientist who said, "I see this causes birth defects in armadillos, and I'm not going to let it in this country." It was available in other countries. So the Internet makes medicine much harder to control. One of the issues is: if a person, say, in New York was practicing tele-medicine on a patient in California, whose laws would govern?
Q. Where do you see this going in the way of regulation?
A. Different states, through their legislatures, have adopted varying approaches. California is very liberal in allowing it as long as the patient signs an informed consent form that says, I know I'm being diagnosed via tele-medicine. Georgia and Oklahoma, for example, have taken very protective stances. In Georgia you cannot practice tele-medicine in most cases unless you're doing it for free or you're doing it through the University of Georgia. New York's position is that you can't practice tele-medicine on a patient in New York unless you're licensed to practice medicine in New York. And a lot of it is kind of turf protection.
Now the interesting thing about this is: generally, medicine in the United States has become much more national, so every physician in the United States goes to a medical school approved by the A.M.A. Data about malpractice and other negative information about a physician goes to the national health care practitioner data bank. It is kind of ironic that at a time that we're recognizing that medicine is national in scope, states are digging in their heels and saying, Only our doctors within our borders can treat our patients. It's really an economic issue rather than a patient-protection issue.
Q. How is the Federal Government supposed to deal with the confidentiality issues?
A. Congress is required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which it passed, to act by this August to issue national confidentiality regulations. So far, there has been no action. But what has also happened is that New York did a big study of patient confidentiality issues and decided that it would wait until after the Federal Government acted. So right now the law is very outdated because it assumes that all these medical records are on paper. The ongoing debate is: how protective should we be?
Q. This is quite an emerging field, isn't it, where law and ethics are not resolved at all?
A. Right. It has the promise to improve the quality of care, but if private insurers and Medicare and Medicaid won't pay for these services, then that becomes an issue. And if it becomes the norm that you always have to have a high-tech second opinion, that will drive up the cost of health care. And there is another area, the question of tele-health -- people who get information over the Internet. This affects the whole patient-physician relationship. It used to be patients relied on physicians to give them information -- now you have patients who can surf the net. But there is no control on the Internet in terms of the accuracy of information.

HEADLINE: Town Houses May Rise Where Indians Once Made Their Homes;
Adult Bookstores, Condos And Traffic Congestion Find Fierce Resistance

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade, no issue in this village of 1.5 square miles has generated so much passion as the future of a lazy creek and picturesque ravine leading to the banks of the Hudson River.
Debate over the creek and related land-use issues has forged an unlikely and diverse ad hoc alliance. It includes those who wear suits to work and those who do not own one, bankers and blue-collar workers, entrepreneurs and educators. 
 And while the 50 members of the group rarely mix at the same cocktail parties in this leafy suburban community, they meld when it comes to keeping development from one of the village's last open-space areas, a former Indian gathering site.
"In this respect, we share a common goal," said Shiraz Shakarchy, a 30-year-old adjunct college professor and a member of the Friends of Wickers Creek Archeological Site, or Fowcas.
Like Fowcas, other ad hoc citizen groups throughout the county have united against perceived common foes. Last year, in Mount Vernon, for example, a citizens' effort limited adult bookstores and topless bars to a small section of the city. In the last decade in Hastings-on-Hudson, citizens have successfully fought off a variety of projects, including a proposed widening of the Saw Mill River Parkway where it runs through the village. In Port Chester, an ad hoc organization continues to oppose a Home Depot, saying unmanageable traffic congestion would result. In Peekskill, a group is opposing the installation of video surveillance cameras in public areas. In Dobbs Ferry, where the Village Trustees see tax dollars, the members of the citizens group envision a verdant expanse of open space, Ms. Shakarchy said. And where the developer, Louis R. Cappelli, pictures 104 high-priced town houses, the members imagine a meeting place of the Lenape Indians restored to its former glory.
In the last 11 years, two separate proposals to build town houses just above the ravine have met with fierce resistance from the ad hoc organization, whose members have attended local government meetings and filed lawsuits against the developer.
But two weeks ago, the group suffered a serious setback. Judge Peter M. Leavitt of State Supreme Court in White Plains brushed aside its lawsuit, saying that the developer should not be prevented from moving ahead. Although the organization claimed the village failed to conduct an adequate environmental review of the project, Judge Leavitt thought otherwise.
Now members are making plans to appeal. Those with young children, like Mrs. Shakarchy, will persist because they want them to have something other than concrete playgrounds. Others like 65-year-old John Culhane, a journalist who lives in an apartment overlooking Wicker's Creek and the Hudson River, said an appeal was important to him because he fears the developer will "turn a Garden of Eden into a noisy hell" of tractors and construction equipment.
Mr. Culhane, who considers Rachel Carson a heroine, said members were also troubled by the potential effect of contaminants buried under a capped landfill on the site, although an environmental study of the property completed for the village concluded that it posed no serious danger to humans.
For Thomas Morrison, president of the group n for the last six years, saving Wickers Creek has become almost a religious calling. Mr. Morrison, 57, has a master's of divinity degree and cut his teeth as a fighter for civil rights in Charlotte, N.C.
"Now Wickers Creek," he said, "has tapped a deep passion in me."
This most recent cause has disrupted his household and "not quite threatened my marriage," he said. "It's one of those things that I thought would last a couple of months, and then one thing led to another. The issue has taken on a life of its own." Mr. Morrison said he spends at least three hours a day for the past 11 years working on Wickers Creek projects.
Still, Mr. Morrison said he was hardly ready to give up.
Although Cappelli Enterprises has granted a conservation easement on the property to the village, that has not satisfied Mr. Morrison and the other members of Fowcas. The easement allows the public to view the property only from outside its borders, and does not provide access to it.
Peggy Blizard, a painter who owns an art gallery in the village, said, "We want the property for a park, for everyone, not just for the people who can afford the town houses."
Another member of the organization, Donna LoPinto, who owns a T-shirt printing business in the village, said that although environmental concerns were the most obvious aspect of the group's focus, it was not the only issue for members.
"We're not just tree huggers or sandal wearers or all of one kind," Ms. LoPinto, 35, who grew up in Dobbs Ferry, said.
Her frustration is also political, she said, explaining that the Village Board of Trustees had approved the project despite the wishes of many Dobbs Ferry residents. "They are not listening to us," she said.
Another member, Kenneth Barton, a retired headmaster of a private school, worried that the project would bring in too many cars and people to a village that was straining at the seams. "We're already too crowded," he said.
The members said the group was also concerned with civil rights and cultural issues, including the preservation of a Native American site.
Prehistoric archeological artifacts dating from the fourth and third millenniums B.C. and belonging to hunter and gatherer societies of coastal New York have been found at the site. Members of the Weckquaesgeck tribe, ancestors of the Lenape Indians, were the first settlers of Westchester, and shells from oysters and other mollusks, which once abounded in the river and were a key source of food for the Indians, can still be found in the soil. Until 1644, when the Indians were massacred by Dutch settlers, members of the tribe spent the warmer months along Wickers Creek.
There are, however, conflicting opinions about the site's archeological value. The land has been given legal and environmental clearance as a building site from the village, and three years ago the State Historic Preservation Office gave Cappelli Enterprises permission to build, asserting that years of looting by amateur archeologists had destroyed the site's historic value.
Members of the citizens group believe otherwise, and their lawyer, Samara Swanston, said that even if the site did not have strict archeological value, what remains of it should be preserved.
"We've already left many attached town houses for future generations to see, but there are not too many like this Indian site," she said.
Ms. Swanston works for Minority Environmental Lawyers, which provides pro bono legal services for what they call righteous causes, she said. "We're a bunch of activist lawyers of color working for environmental justice issues."
Fowcas also tried to save the property for open space by nominating it in 1992 for the National Register of Historic Sites. The state and National Park Service deemed the site eligible, Mr. Morrison said, but it has not been placed on the list because the property owners do not want it listed.
As Marge Schneider, a partner in Summit Landing, the proposed development, explained then: "I could come in and nominate a neighbor's home for the National Register. That doesn't mean my neighbor needs to agree to it."
Ms. Schneider said the two- and three-bedroom town houses would sell for about $375,000 to $500,500 and would appeal to people without children, like young adults and couples whose children have grown.
The land was once owned by Mount Mercy Associates of Castleton, N.Y., which paid $9 million for the property in 1995 and proposed to build four-level town houses, some overlooking the 50-foot ravine, with elevators and up to 4,000 square feet of space. The project would have included a private park, a beach, a pool and tennis courts, but the developer walked away from the project during the economic difficulties of the late 1980's.
Cappelli Enterprises acquired the property in 1995 from the Resolution Trust Company, the Federal agency handling properties in default during the savings-and-loan crisis.
Mr. Morrison, frustrated by the inability of his small group to succeed in fighting for preservation of a section of the Hudson River, said, "There are a lot of stinking things to this."
He said he wondered, for example, why Gov. George E. Pataki, who promoted preservation of the Hudson River waterfront during his most recent campaign, has largely ignored his group's efforts. The Friends of Wickers Creek Archeological Site sent a series of letters to the Governor from 1996 to 1998, requesting his assistance in the matter, he said.
Mr. Morrison questioned whether Mr. Pataki was influenced by the fact that Mr. Cappelli, who is one of the leading builders in Westchester County, is also a large contributor to Republican politicians, most prominently the Governor.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Governor, called Mr. Morrison's remarks "offensive and completely political" and added, "What can the Governor do?" He also said that at the Governor's request the State Department of Environmental Conservation approached the property owners last year to see if they were willing to sell, and Cappelli Enterprises said no.
Meanwhile, the Village Board of Trustees would like to realize more tax ratables in a municipality where about one-third of the property (schools, a college, a children's rehabilitation center, for example) is not on the tax rolls. The board approved the development proposal last year.
But Mayor Brian Monahan, who as a Trustee 10 years ago supported more development for Dobbs Ferry, now claims that the cost to the village in terms of new schools and services to support the town houses would outweigh any gains.
"I've been persuaded that it would be good if the property were not developed," he said.
The developer, however, would sue if the Trustees reneged on their approval, he added.
Ms. Schneider confirmed the Mayor's statement.
Meanwhile, the Friends of Wickers Creek Archeological Site said it hopes someone or something will allow the property to be saved from development. "A miracle from God could help," Ms. Blizard said. "Governor Pataki could intervene. We're just normal everyday people who have come together to save the land because we want to be able to walk there, too. Hopefully, a way will be found."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Cynthia Winer;
Homeless Children Find an Advocate

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
MORE than 600 students in the Hartford Public School system are homeless. "These are the ones I know about," said Cynthia Winer, coordinator of Homeless Education in the Hartford Public School system.
Ms. Winer gets referrals from city shelters, other school social workers, the Department of Social Services and the Fire Department. She then contacts the students' former schools for records, including special education records and she then places the students in school. 
 She is an advocate for these children. "It's not the fault of theirs that they were burned out or their mother was arrested for the umpteenth time for prostitution. They shouldn't have to pay the price," Ms. Winer said, "We have to be more understanding."
Recently Ms. Winer, in her office at Hartford High School, discussed the issues that homeless children face. Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Q. Where do homeless students live?
A. They live with friends, on the street, with relatives and at shelters.
Q. Why are these children homeless?
A. It could be because of a fire. It could be their parents have been evicted because the housing was not suitable or because of nonpayment of rent. Earlier this year a whole building was closed down. It had 10 families with many kids. It was shut down because of drugs and unsuitable conditions.
No one helps to meet the continued needs these people. The Red Cross only deals with emergencies. If it's a fire, I call the Fire Department to find out who they are and what schools they attend so that when they return to school on Monday they will have transportation to get there. D.S.S. (Department of Social Services) gives them a certificate that directs them to bad hotels and bad housing. If they are not on state assistance they are on their own.
Mainly they are directed to shelters. Hartford has 11 shelters. The biggest shortage of beds in the city is for men with children. There is only one shelter in the City of Hartford for men with children. There are only about 10 beds for them and they are always full.
Q. How old are these homeless children?
A. They range from preschool to age 21. (The state is required to provide services for special education students up to age 21.) There are lots of preschoolers.
I had a lady come in who was frightened. She knew she didn't have a lot and she was afraid that D.C.F. (Department of Children and Families) could take her child away. But she needed housing so she came here as a leap of faith. I referred her child to a preschool. I thought the little girl looked like she had lead poisoning so I sent her for testing. Her lead level was too low to qualify for help with housing so I tried to get housing for them. I tried to get her food, clothing.
Q. Are these children are on their own or with families?
A. Both. Children can live alone in a shelter under the guardianship of D.C.F. Children can live alone in a shelter for years. Kids as young as age 12 are living on their own in shelters. They must follow very stringent rules and regulations of the shelter. If they don't, they can be evicted to another shelter. Then I get another referral.
Q. Are all these Hartford children?
A. We've had kids from Terryville, Avon, Simsbury, Bristol, Farmington, New Britain, Glastonbury. That's why Hartford has so many, because we get other districts' kids. This is not just a Hartford problem. This is society's problem.
Q. How do you protect abuse victims confidential location?
A. I would guess about 20 percent of the children are homeless because of domestic violence. They could come from anywhere throughout the U.S. They come through the underground network of domestic violence shelters. I would never give up their confidentiality. Say I have a child from California. I'll call and request the records if the mother didn't bring them with her. I will ask them not to record my call because if a man is the father of that child, he has the right to those phone records.
Many change their identities. They are able to change their names and social security records.
Q. Are some of the teens you work with mothers themselves?
A. I went to a shelter to give a presentation on AIDS. There were 10 girls there and all 10 had babies. One was only 14. I've had a 12-year-old mother. She lived sometimes with the father and sometimes with the grandmother.
Q. Can homeless students stay in school to do their homework?
A. Sometimes. The structure of the shelter is very strict. Some of them go for therapy after school. I try to get them into summer camp. Some of them try to get jobs. They only get $200 twice a year for clothes.
They do homework at the shelters. They also have programs for them. For teen-age girls, it's how not to get pregnant again. They have programs on self esteem, getting along with others, conflict resolution.
Q. Do their classmates know they are homeless?
A. Sometimes they don't. Some of the kids in Hartford High, you would never know. They are so neat.
Q. With all these problems it must be difficult to stay in school.
A. Some are determined to stay in school. We have a 14-day rule. After 14 absent days, you get no credit for the grade. They shouldn't have to pay the price of not going on to the next grade.
I don't know how many graduate but I do know they all come with dreams. We have had some of these kids go on to college. D.C.F. pays tuition for these kids to go to college. I think that's the best way my tax dollars can be spent.
Q. Do you focus on other areas besides schooling?
A. You can't just do school because they have to have clothes to go to school. They have to have a home to go to school. They have to have food to go to school. I have kids in school who have no food. They get free breakfast if the school bus is on time. They are entitled to free lunch.
One thing I do is offer some kids hope, at least listen to them, show that someone cares about them, give them a pair of jeans when they need them, listen to their pain when they have to share it and hug them when they need it.
Q. How do you keep from getting discouraged?
A. My dream is to have a Covenant House-type shelter. Some place that would be good, a safe place. There's a building right on the corner of Farmington and Marshall, it's abandoned. It would be great. It would be great to have that kind of facility for the kids. I wish Hartford would put up matching funds so we could accept corporate gifts.
I wish we could have education on the needs of homeless children for D.C.F., the police, the Fire Department. I would like to do outreach work with other agencies.
I think the Federal government and the State of Connecticut truly need to invest in programs that follow the letter of the law. There needs to be more compliance review. We need to be doing networking with everyone in the business of working with homeless families and streamline policies.
Q. In this booming economy do you anticipate the numbers of homeless children will decline?
A. No. I think the problem will grow larger. I think the richest state, Connecticut, has put a cramp in welfare reform. I think that many people, because they haven't been compliant with the rules of the welfare system, are going to be off welfare and their children pay the price. They have to pay the price and fend for themselves because Mom can't support them. It's going to lead homelessness and it's going to lead to crime. I used to run the work fare program in Middletown so I certainly understand the need of welfare and welfare reform but I can't see that innocent children should have to pay the price of adults' mistakes. They have scars for a lifetime.

HEADLINE: Is This Wash Brushless? Yes, and Topless, Too

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL 

DATELINE: GREENSBORO, N.C.

 BODY:
IN an economy as polymorphously diverse as America's, it seems unlikely that Harper's II Exotic Car Wash is the only one of its kind. But it could be. "It's the only one I'm aware of," said Eddie Collins, who owns both the car wash and a nearby strip club.
Seven years ago, Mr. Collins, who drives a blue Corvette convertible and is partial to gold jewelry, was "looking to make money during the day" at his club. He considered selling used cars or getting a U-Haul franchise. Then the detailer who had worked on his own cars quit. A neon light bulb came on over his head: Why not open a topless car wash? 
 City officals resisted at first, but Mr. Collins took steps to preserve public decorum. A privacy fence eight feet high surrounds the entrance to the metal building behind the club, where women in G-strings wash the cars.
Business has been brisk, he said, averaging 25 cars a day -- more during the Greater Greensboro Open golf tournament or the A.C.C. basketball championships. The wash is open year-round; there are heaters in the building for the comfort of workers, who do not dress warmly.
Washes are $15 a car, competitive with other hand washes in the area. The workers receive only tips, plus what they make from table and couch dances in the car wash area -- $10 and $20, respectively. In a corner of the shed, "V.I.P. areas" are set aside for private dancing.
"I like the hours," said Tammy, 24, who declined to give her last name. "It's more laid back, and you get tan." In the summer, cars are often washed outdoors.
Usually, the car washers do not work after hours at the club, and vice versa. "It's hard to find enough pretty girls who want to do the work," Mr. Collins said. Sometimes, however, he will punish a club dancer by sending her to the car wash -- "especially those prima donnas who think they are too good to wash cars."
And the cars do come clean, to the surprise of a first-time customer. After he parked his green Saturn and took a seat nearby, two attendants, Ariel and Tiara, untrussed themselves and began hosing the car with warm water. They used lamb's-wool mitts to lather up the car, raising the windshield wipers and paying close attention to the wheels. After rinsing, they dried the car with a hand chamois. Given that Ariel managed these feats in thigh-high, patent leather, stiletto-heeled boots, a $5 tip did not seem extravagant. DAN NEIL

HEADLINE: The Very Model Of a Modern Major Museum;
The Old Masters Still Have Their Place, But Today's Curators and Educators Promote New Ways of Seeing and Doing

BYLINE: By DIANE NOTTLE 

 BODY:
NOT so long ago, museums were like temples -- temples dedicated to Art. Big, imposing and often neo-classical outside, they were quiet, often darkened places inside, where people went to look reverently at inanimate paintings and sculptures by dead white males, familiar mainly from textbooks. Sometimes they would take their children, who would be hushed into a similar state of intimidation under the eye of uniformed guards. Hardly anyone went to a museum for fun.
The facades may not have changed much, but the museums certainly have. Flashing lights and funhouse mirrors entice visitors away from the greatest visual hits of the 1690's and into multimedia celebrations of the 1960's at the Newark Museum. Brightly colored balls bounce around miniature golf courses that bear no resemblance to the ones at the shore, thanks to artist-designed holes like the nine in last year's "Strokes of Genius" at the Montclair Art Museum. This summer, the Morris Museum in Morristown will be "Talkin' Baseball" with an exhibition on New Jersey's minor-league heritage, inviting visitors to call the play-by-play on a videotaped game or even play a game of wiffle ball. Suddenly, going to a museum is fun. 
 Every other sentence coming out of the mouths of museum directors or curators these days seems to include at least one word starting with "inter-" -- Latin for between. Their mission, to establish relationships between themselves and the public, now extends far beyond preserving and displaying works of art or collections of natural history. Increasingly, they use words like interactive, interdisciplinary and intergenerational.
"Museums are not built for eternity," said Karen Cummins, curator of education at the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton. They change, she said, with "the pace of science, the pace of everything."
Interaction may be high-tech or low. At the National Gallery of Art in Washington, visitors who had just left the acclaimed exhibition of Japanese Edo-period art last winter clustered around computer stations related to the show, gazing into the screens with rapt concentration that quite possibly surpassed the attention they had given any of the actual objects in the galleries. New Jersey's museums may not have the resources of the National Gallery, but the same principles apply.
But interaction means more than a click on an icon. It may mean touching a fossil, or turning a plastic owl's head to see how far it will go. It may mean a field trip from an elementary school, with an impromptu art class inside the galleries, or from a retirement home. It may mean contributing a piece to an installation in progress, or taking home a book of artists' instructions meant to nudge you toward your own art projects, as in the recent "Do It" series at five museums throughout the state. It may mean a social encounter, or even a children's birthday party, in the museum cafe.
As museums' missions have changed, so have their operations and strategies, with education and marketing departments receiving attention and deference once reserved for curators. Yet the core remains the art and the ways it can, and does, touch lives. Museumgoing, said Mary Sue Sweeney Price, the director of the Newark Museum, is "not just immersion in a fantasy experience, but being put in touch with real objects of value."
 
NEWARK MUSEUM
A City's Diversity Reflected in Galleries
Pop and populism mingle comfortably at the Newark Museum, now celebrating its 90th anniversary. The Pop has been especially visible since February as a labyrinth of galleries covering 5,000 square feet of the normally rather staid museum have been given over to "Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-Garde 1957-1963," which closes next Sunday. The show, tracing the birth of Pop art and the era of happenings, has a high interactivity quotient: visitors are invited to listen through earphones to John Cage's late-1950's composition class at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan; have their pictures taken in photo booths and post them outside, or "create your own event" at a drawing board.
Lest anyone think art was (or is) divorced from real life, the displays are accompanied by pages from popular magazines like Life, particularly advertising that pointed the way toward the American Dream the artists were rebelling against. "Putting the art in context is a very broad concept," said Mrs. Price, the museum's director. "What was happening then? Why was the artist making this art?"
Long before multiculturalism became a buzzword, the museum was practicing it, to the extent that one side of the contribution box in the entrance foyer says "Donate today" in the Portuguese of the city's Ironbound section. "From the founding, we've welcomed those groups," Mrs. Price said, "from the German-American focus of the jewelry show, to the Jews before and after the war, to the African-Americans who came largely from the South." So the museum has mounted shows like "The Glitter and the Gold: Fashioning America's Jewelry" in 1997, "Ancient Land, New Style: Jewish Arts and Crafts From Jerusalem" in 1998, and last year's "Wrapped in Pride," an exhibition of kente cloth from Ghana, as well as prominently displaying pieces by black American folk artists.
The museum has permanent galleries of African and American Indian art, as well as the largest collection of Tibetan art in the Western Hemisphere, with a major exhibition "From the Sacred Realm," opening in October.
Last year, "Crowning Glory: Images of the Virgin in the Arts of Portugal" drew 3,000 visitors from the Ironbound on one Sunday alone, Mrs. Price said. "There were grandmothers who spoke only Portuguese, the kids who spoke English, and the mother in between, interpreting," she said. "One woman said, 'I never thought I'd see my hometown on a museum wall.' "
Like many regional museums, the Newark Museum covers both art and science. The state's first planetarium opened there in 1952, and its collection of 70,000 natural history specimens includes snakes, tamarin monkeys and other inhabitants of a mini-zoo in the Junior Gallery.
The museum ranks 11th in the country in education spending and second in proportion of education dollars to the total budget, according to the Association of Art Museum Directors. The education department has two primary functions: instructional services, working directly with educators on incorporating the arts into the core curriculum -- "teaching teachers how to use art objects," Mrs. Price said -- and youth and family services, offering classes and workshops, and programs for school vacation periods.
On weekends, the museum offers family time with an emphasis on intergenerational activities. "In the past, parents would deposit their kids at an activity and go sit and read," she said. "Now, they'll do the activity together." Older generations add an extra dimension. "So many of the grandparents in the region have historical ties to Newark," she said. "When the grandchildren come to visit, this is one of the first places they come." Last weekend, when the museum celebrated its 90th anniversary with a ball on Saturday night, Family Day followed on Sunday, drawing 3,000 visitors to the same tent on the museum grounds.
If all the bells and whistles of modern-day museumgoing prove too stimulating, you can always duck into the galleries of 18th- and 19th-century American art designed by the Princeton architect Michael Graves. But even there, watch out. "A Closer Look," a prototype gallery for a permanent reinstallation designed to tell American history through the decorative and fine arts, asks visitors admiring "Portrait of the Children of William Rankin Sr." (1838), by Oliver Tarbell Eddy, Yes, even a two-dimensional painting hanging unobtrusively on the wall can provide an interactive experience.
 
STATE MUSEUM
You Can Look, And Sometimes Touch
It's definitely field-trip season in the state capital. Big yellow buses from Toms River and Freehold lined State Street and snaked around the corner the other week. A dozen or so children climbed "Hineni," a large sculpture in white oak by Harry Gordon, on the plaza outside the State Museum; others examined a brightly painted welded-steel sculpture by Alexander Calder nearby while their schoolmates, all fully clothed, enacted their own brown-bag version of Manet's "Luncheon on the Grass."
As New Jersey's official repository and showcase, the State Museum has a strongly educational mission ranging far beyond fine art. The floor-by-floor directory testifies to the museum's scope, listing not only the current retrospective of paintings by Alma W. Thomas and the women's art show, but also "Baskets and Brooms: Delaware Adaptations to European Contact"; "Paul Weingarten," paintings by the Montclair artist; "New Jersey Amber," and "Ceramics and Glass." Stuffed bears and jaguars inhabit dioramas of North American wildlife. In halls containing exhibitions on New Jersey's Native American archeological record, some of the print on the text panels have been rubbed faint by the arms of children leaning on them.
Clearly, this museum is not venerated, but used. "This has never been a temple in the park," said its director, Leah Phyfer Sloshberg. "I came in 1964, and I can't remember its ever being that way. We were founded in 1895, and from the very beginning we've had a strong educational mission." In fact, she said, she has met people in their 60's who remember vivid details of their own class trips to the museum when it was still in the State House Annex.
For every exhibition, "we try to come up with an educational component to go with it," said Karen Cummins, curator of education. And for every exhibition, the staff makes a point of defining its potential audience. "There are the hard-core museum people who go and look at every show we do," Ms. Sloshberg said. "But for every exhibition, there's a special audience."
Those audiences come from "truly the region -- Bucks County, Montgomery County and Delaware -- and literally from all of New Jersey," Ms. Sloshberg said. How does she know? For one thing, "when our calendars are wrong, we hear from the people who've driven here," she said with a laugh.
And what do audiences want? "More blockbusters," Ms. Sloshberg said.
So the museum is planning its first official blockbuster, "Unseen Treasure: Imperial Russia and the New World," to open in September. "It's a story of exploration," Ms. Sloshberg said, from a meeting between William Penn (one of 12 partners who purchased East Jersey in 1681) and Czar Peter the Great in England in 1698, to the Alaska Purchase two centuries later. Organized by the American-Russian Cultural Cooperation Foundation in Washington, the exhibition comes to Trenton from the Russian State Historical Museum on Red Square.
After the blockbuster brings people through the door, the museum will do its best to expose them to other forms of art. "We want the people who come to 'Unseen Treasures' to see what wonderful collections we have," Ms. Sloshberg said.
As for interactive exhibits, "we've had high-tech and low-tech, and the low-tech works best, in my opinion," Ms. Sloshberg said, noting that "there's nothing more frustrating" than confronting a computer that doesn't work.
When the museum had its popular "Dinamation" show of animated dinosaur models in 1996 and 1997, one of the activities was "Design a Dinosaur," which invited visitors to mix and match foam models of heads, tails and bodies from various species. Also popular are the working scientists in a glassed-in mini-lab in the natural history galleries. "Rather than have the researchers working in an office, they do it in public," Ms. Cummins said.
Most effective of all, she said, is giving visitors contact with the objects themselves whenever possible -- what she calls "hands-on experiences in a hands-off institution." School groups may pass around fossils or rocks. "We have a category designated as the educational collection," Ms. Cummins said. "They might be fossils with an iffy provenance, of marginal value for research, but they're real things that a child can experience."
"The world is so full of simulations," she added. "Our strength is the real."
 
ZIMMERLI
Turning Abroad For a Home Advantage
The Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum has all the "inters" of the other museums, plus a fourth: international. At the moment, most of the gallery space is given over to Russian art, the museum's specialty even when it is not mounting a show like "Defining Russian Graphic Arts: From Diaghilev to Stalin, 1898-1934." Since 1995, the Zimmerli, on the Rutgers University campus in New Brunswick, has been the repository of the Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Nonconformist Art From the Soviet Union, and it also houses the George Riabov Collection of Russian Art. On the lower level is the Kusakabe-Griffis Gallery, honoring a connection between New Brunswick and Japan dating back more than 100 years and currently devoted to Japonisme. And the children's corner is presenting "Maples in the Mist," watercolors illustrating 16 Chinese poems from the Tang Dynasty.
The international emphasis arrived at the Zimmerli 29 years ago with its director, Philip Dennis Cate. "I was given a charge: 'Do what you want to make a museum,' " Mr. Cate recalled. "It was very exciting because it's not often that a museum director is given an opportunity to start from scratch and build up a collection. The metropolitan area is so congested with art and culture. I wanted to do something that didn't compete, but complemented. I tried not to build a comprehensive collection, like the Princeton Art Museum or the Metropolitan; it was too late for that. So I began concentrating on specific areas that I felt we could handle economically."
When he took charge, the University Art Gallery, the oldest space in the present-day museum, now the David LLoyd Kreeger Gallery, had just over 3,000 square feet for a collection of 2,500 art objects. When its current expansion is finished a year from now, the museum is expected to have 45,000 square feet of exhibition space, and the collection has grown to more than 60,000 works.
The Russian emphasis is a happy accident. In 1989, Mr. Cate was approached for advice by George Riabov, a Rutgers alumnus who is a Russian-American consultant on languages and art, who had been asked to lend some of his Russian art collection for exhibition in the Soviet Union. "I advised him not to send it to over there," Mr. Cate said, and he began negotiating a gift to the Zimmerli. Mr. Riabov introduced him to the Dodges, whose collection had been smuggled out of the Soviet Union, piece by piece, in dozens of trips over 30 years. By spring 1991, Mr. Cate had won the two collections.
The Zimmerli recently lost its education director and is in the process of hiring another, but its public education and outreach programs programs go on, from an all-day symposium on the Russian graphics last month to calligraphy classes to concerts of chamber music and jazz.
Interactive elements are present in forms both low-tech ("Make Your Own Mark" clipboards at "Maples in the Mist," encouraging children to design their version of traditional Chinese seals) and high- (menu-driven interactive video programs, in your choice of English or Japanese, accompanying the Japonisme show). There are also tried-and-true devices like time lines with the Russian and Japanese exhibitions that help put the art in social and historical context.
"That effort is much more deliberate than it used to be," Mr. Cate said, "because a university museum feels a need to be didactic and because we're dealing with a culture that is not that well known. For people to start to understand why this art was created, you have to put it in context. There's an intellectual part to enjoying art, as much as the visual enjoyment."
The blending of those components will no doubt continue to put the Zimmerli on the map, at home and abroad. "If you have an all-encompassing collection, it's automatically international," Mr. Cate said. "I decided when I first came in that I didn't want us to be just a regional museum. I've always worked toward things that took us out beyond the state of New Jersey, and brought in something it didn't have."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Florio's (Land Use) Plan For Taking On Whitman

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson writes from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY

 BODY:
It has been called sustainable development and balanced growth and now smart growth. But the concept of controlling suburban growth has never yet been called a political winning hand. Until now.
Vice President Al Gore is leading the Clinton Administration's $10 billion "livability program" of subsidies for mass transit and farmland preservation, and both political parties are talking about the suburbanization of American voters, with their concerns about disappearing open space and traffic congestion. 
 So maybe it is no surprise that one of the people sitting unobtrusively through seminars like "The Regional Y2K Initiative" and "The MTA Capital Program: A Year of Decision" at the recent Regional Plan Association meeting in Manhattan was none other than James J. Florio, past governor and current Senate hopeful.
To be fair, Mr. Florio is on the board of the Plan Association, the tri-state clearinghouse for development and transportation issues in the New York Metropolitan area. But is it not also fair to believe that that the successful lawyer, who is said to be much more interested in policy matters than in mere wealth, was also there because growth issues might soon stop being abstractions and start comprising ideas that voters listen to?
It is.
"I've been talking about development issues for a long time," Mr. Florio said in an interview last week. "I signed the state plan into law, and some of the folks from New Jersey at the meeting were lamenting the fact that the executive order I signed while I was in office is being ignored." Ignored, that is, by Governor Whitman, the likely Republican nominee for next year's Senate race.
"The order said that state officers in charge of infrastructure funding and allocation were charged with not approving any such money for water and sewers and transportation that were not in accordance with the plan," Mr. Florio went on. "That means that if you wanted to put a sewer in the middle of nowhere, you would be precluded from that."
That means that the Whitman Administration would not be trying to extend a sewer from Trenton to the particular middle of nowhere along Scotch Road in Hopewell Township, outside Trenton, where Merrill Lynch wants to build an enormous office park on what was once open farmland. The project has already produced enough of a grass-roots revolt in Hopewell to oust the old Republican majority on the town board and to elect a new Democratic leadership. But that was a very specific example of outrage, where residents could come face to face with the destruction of open space.
However, Mr. Florio acknowledged that it will considerably more difficult to go from a specific situation like that to linking the aggravation of rush-hour traffic in one county to unplanned sprawl and development two counties away.
"We are still in the early stages of starting to understand the nature of the problem and I'm not overly troubled by that because it takes a while to these ideas across to people," the former governor said. "But people are now starting to understand that there are problems associated with their long commutes. They are spending two hours a day going to and from work, and one alternative to that is building a better transportation system."
Of course, talking about building anything in a time when voters are used to being told that government should spend less may not be an easy sell. Not surprisingly, then, Mr. Florio is locked and loaded when he is asked to speak in more general terms about a campaign he would run against Mrs. Whitman.
"A contest between Governor Whitman and myself, if it comes down to that, will be between two different personalities, two different governing styles, two different backgrounds and two different sets of values," he said. "It will be two clear choices, which is different from what people have been getting in recent years, which have been all about blurring the differences between points of view."
Yes, he said "different backgrounds," with its whiff of populist fervor: the country club girl against the boy from the Brooklyn shipyards, translated into a modern morality play about fiscal policy.
Mr. Florio got the boot for raising taxes to pay state expenses, and now he will try to defeat Mrs. Whitman by accusing her of running up the state debt instead of using the budget surplus to pay it off.
"My value system comes from a family that said, 'You pay your bills,' " Mr. Florio said. "My father came home on Friday night with his pay from the shipyard and the first thing my mother did was take the money for the rent and put it in the Chase & Sanborn coffee can we kept on the shelf. Because first, you take care of your expenses, and then you think about spending your money."

HEADLINE: At a Carwash Convention, Soft Soap Meets the Hard Sell

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
A HYPNOTIC fugue has fallen over the crowd watching the Mac Neil RW-102's. The powerful water sprayers gyrate frantically inside a stainless-steel cuff. Nearby, attached to an overhead arch like you might see at a carwash, the nozzles stop and turn, flip and churn, like choreographed stage lights at a Broadway musical. People wobble their heads unconsciously as they watch the water cannons dance.
No running water has been supplied to the floor of the 1999 International Carwash Association's convention at the Opryland Hotel here, but there is plenty of soft soap. 
 Tearing his gaze from the Mac Neil device, Andy Malecha, a representative of the Broadway Equipment Company in Minneapolis, said: "These things don't work any better than some guy with a hose. But let's face it, car washing is subtle. We have to use a little showmanship so people feel like they are getting their money's worth."
"Subtle" was definitely not on the list of adjectives describing the convention floor here late last month, crowded with more than 300 exhibitors hawking everything from hand-cranked coin sorters to barn-size bus-washing robots. Because of a chronic shortage of labor in the $3 billion-a-year carwash business, the industry relies heavily on automation. Dozens of automatic carwash devices -- those familiar, antenna-eating machines with the spinning brushes -- are deployed on the floor.
Some are simple, bare-metal machines moving with the clumsy kinetics of the elves in Saks's Christmas window displays, their felt curtain "mitters" sloshing to and fro. Others look like escaped set pieces from "Starlight Express": huge chrome and glass naves with blinking neon signs and scrolling L.E.D. readouts above the bill changers that take customers' money.
Some machines are specialized, glumly slaving away at their appointed tasks: dressing tires, for instance. Others roam from bumper to bumper, their thick drum brushes whirling like Champions on Ice.
Econocraft Worldwide Manufacturing Inc. of the Bronx has brought its "Pizazz" floor model, a 100-foot-long, $135,000 apparatus whose mirrored chrome and candy-colored lights seem inspired by somebody's favorite pachinko game.
"The idea is to spice it up, make it glitzy and glamorous," said Tim Hiller, the company's well-dressed representative. "The customer deserves it. He's paying $12 to $14 for a carwash. He wants to see more than a little soap and water."
Why not charge less and offer a simpler machine? He acts as if he has seen a gazelle run down the aisle. "Why would we want to do that?" he asked. "A wise old man told me never to leave any money on the table."
A good carwash machine offers evidence of things unseen. Many of the contraptions use flashing neon signs to indicate, for instance, when the liquid called "rust inhibitor" -- its specific ingredients are carefully guarded -- is applied. "Otherwise, who would know what it was?" asked Steve Chase of Aurora, Colo., an inventor whose tri-color washing and waxing agents are staples at many automated washes.
At the Turtle Wax booth, Mr. Chase watches as a Saab 9-3 is enveloped in rainbow ribbons of goopy spray. The stuff melts together like the walls in a particularly lurid passage by William Burroughs. In a touch of synesthesia, the area around the booth is suffused with an intense berry fragrance. "It's nice," he said, "and it will keep customers in the carwash longer."
That's the idea. Carwashes are expensive operations -- a top-of-the-line machine can cost $165,000; the average investment per bay in a conveyor carwash is about $1 million. Also, the industry's effluent is federally regulated, requiring either a separate sewer system for new carwashes, or water reclamation equipment.
To increase revenue, the industry has made an art form of "extra services," code for any frill that adds to the cost of a visit. These can range from the reasonable (Armor-All tire treatment makes the rubber look nice and shiny) to the ridiculous (a lemon-scented sealer wax that would be worthwhile only if passengers rode outside your car). In truth, consumers could probably skip the premium-priced car vacuum, its festively colored "fragrance enhancers" bubbling up inside.
Another source of money is what falls under the rubric of "profit centers." These can include everything from quick oil changes and gasoline sales to car detailing and gift shops. Dozens of vendors at the convention represent these peripheral retail services.
"The more convenience we can give to the customer, the better he likes it," said Guy W. Goddard, of Park City, Utah, the president of the International Carwash Association. "What we are looking at is a transition from 'carwash' to 'car care.' "
In fact, next year's convention in Las Vegas will be grandly called the Car Care World Expo 2000.
Mr. Goddard, who with his cowboy boots and long hair looks right at home in Opryland, says the business will inevitably reach into other services that busy people crave: dry cleaning, gourmet food and coffee, insurance services, shoe repair, even massage therapists -- "duly licensed and registered," he said.
As promising as the future looks -- the industry is growing 7 percent annually -- the business does have its problems: the rift between "friction" and "touch-free" washes, for instance. Friction washes put brushes or pads on cars. These can be worrisome because the new clear-coat compounds applied over new cars' paint can be easily marred by brushes, leaving telltale whorls.
Touch-free carwashes use high-pressure sprays, but they are less effective. To be competitive, some touch-free operators use pre-soak solutions of hydrofluoric acid, a highly toxic material, to loosen clay, brake dust and asphaltic hydrocarbons, otherwise known as road tar.
"We want the industry to take the moral high ground," Mr. Goddard said. "We hope our membership avoids the stuff."
As in all things, the moral high ground is slippery. Mr. Goddard said the industry's single greatest problem was that more than half of all drivers still washed their own cars. These driveway washers -- perhaps a million of them on a summer weekend day, by some estimates -- send their waste water into the gutter, where it makes its way into lakes and rivers. "They can do with their waste water what we can't," he said.
But the association's opposition to driveway washing -- which is both green and self-serving -- means that it opposes charity washes for churches and schools. "We have been developing a voucher system that charities can sell, rather than wash cars in parking lots," Mr. Goddard said.
Such controversies notwithstanding, the entrepreneurs of the carwash industry seem an untroubled and gregarious lot. As they trundled away from Nashville, they seemed to want nothing more than to love the next big, noisy, soap-spitting machine.

HEADLINE: Choosing the House Over the Address

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST 

 BODY:
BRENTLY L. FREY made the usual Westchester and Connecticut stop-offs when he began looking for a home with a feeling of history two years ago. He toured houses in Danbury, Ridgefield, Yorktown Heights and Bronxville, but nothing fit his criteria.
Mr. Frey, a marketing consultant who works at home, wanted a property that was truly distinct. And while he could have spent well over $400,000, the house had to be priced low enough to give him the option of renovating the interior in his own style. 
 Flipping through real estate magazines, he noticed a number of interesting homes for sale in a place he hadn't previously considered -- Mount Vernon, the city separating the Bronx from Bronxville. More urban melting pot than sheltered suburbia, what Mount Vernon lacked in exclusivity it made up for in proximity to the city (25 minutes by train) and competitive housing prices.
It was in the city's Fleetwood section, a neighborhood of closely spaced houses and tree-lined streets butting up against the border of high-priced Bronxville, that Mr. Frey found his home -- a 1920's brick colonial with a grand center hall, French doors, Palladian windows and a tiled solarium with the original wall fountain. He closed on the house last May at a price that he said was "between $350,000 and $400,000."
"Like many old gems, this one needed to be dusted off," said the 35-year-old Mr. Frey. "It's like a diamond in the rough. For me, where I live is not an issue of prestige. It's an issue of my house, and I want my house to be what I want."
While so many home buyers studiously heed the cardinal rule of real estate and elevate location above all other considerations, Mr. Frey represents a different breed of buyer, one for whom house matters much more than address.
These are the people who are either unwilling or unable to pay the price for their ideal house in the most sought-after ZIP codes, and so happily drift across the borders of prime neighborhoods to lay claim to similar properties in less lofty surroundings. Some purposely seek out these border communities because they tend to offer more diversity.
As home prices have soared in the last few years, these buyers have become all the more evident as they fuel demand in less prestigious neighborhoods bordering communities where similar homes carry significantly higher price tags. Some examples of such communities in Westchester are Fleetwood and the Armour Villa, Lawrence Park West, Beech Hill, Cedar Knolls and Park Hill neighborhoods of Yonkers.
In Connecticut, the Black Rock and Brooklawn neighborhoods of Bridgeport, bordering Fairfield, offer good value for prime properties. In Norwalk, price differentials still exist in the Cranbury and Wolfpit neighborhoods of the city along the Westport border, but the price gap between Norwalk and surrounding towns has closed considerably, brokers say.
The same is also true on the North Shore of Long Island, where one-time factory towns like Glen Cove used to offer waterfront properties at prices much lower than the more exclusive areas, said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Center for Regional Policy Studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The tight real estate market has narrowed price differentials in Nassau County considerably as "the areas that would have served as a contrast have been gentrified," he said.
In New Jersey, South Orange, adjacent to Short Hills, offers some "wonderful old housing stock," as does the Sleepy Hollow section of Plainfield, bordering Edison Township, according to James Hughes, dean of the Rutgers University School of Planning and Public Policy. In addition, the Montclair Heights neighborhood of Clifton is an increasingly popular alternative for buyers attracted to higher-priced Montclair, said Ken Hauser, a sales associate with Weichert Realtors in Clifton.
In many of these areas, historic or architecturally detailed homes can cost hundreds of thousands less than their counterparts just blocks away across community borders. And property taxes, too, can be thousands of dollars lower. The trade-off for a smaller mortgage and lower property taxes, however, is often a school district that compares unfavorably with adjoining towns and perhaps a higher crime rate.
One factor motivating some of the more venturesome buyers in these areas, said Dr. Hughes, may be that thanks to the stock market runup of recent years, the role of the house as the dominant investment has diminished for more families. "Their stock holdings could potentially dwarf their house," he said. "These areas may appeal to people who aren't so housing-dependent for their nest egg."
And it's possible that once the real-estate market slows again, some who invested heavily in improving homes in secondaryareas may find it difficult to get their money out, noted Julie Garton-Good, a real estate lecturer and author of "The Frugal Homeowner's Guide to Buying, Selling and Improving Your Home" (Dearborn, 1999). "There's nothing wrong with people going in and losing money on a house," she said. "But they need to be aware of it ahead of time."
Then again, observed John Clapp, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut's Center for Real Estate in Storrs, a less predictable degree of risk can also lead to a higher return. Over the last five years in Norwalk, for example, condominium prices appreciated an average of 9.2 percent annually, while condominium prices in Stamford, a lower-risk market than Norwalk by Professor Clapp's measurements, appreciated an average 3.5 percent annually, he said.
 Even if buyers consider their house less of an investment than simply a home, they should still sit down and weigh other considerations before they begin looking, advises Martin Shenkman, a New York City real estate lawyer.
"Private or public schools, commute time -- whatever the most important amenities -- all those things have to be thought through," Mr. Shenkman said. "People have to sit down and rank their priorities before they fall all over a house. Then whatever they decide is fine, once they've made that personal choice."
MR. Frey has long since stopped worrying about how much money he's spending on his house. He is having his prominent corner lot landscaped, a project that includes adding a garden off the solarium. He has also paid for installation of a central air-conditioning system, restoration of some of the French doors, interior repainting and refinishing of the oak floors.
"I have a lot of friends who are real estate agents and, in the beginning when I was making renovations, I was always asking them, 'Am I spending too much?'," he said. "And they would say, 'You can't put a dollar value on it. It's not a dollar value, it's a love value.' "
The average sale price of a house in the Fleetwood area last year was about one-third of that in Bronxville, said Elizabeth Lindsey, owner of Lindsey Real Estate in Mount Vernon. For many buyers who wind up in Fleetwood the cost of renovating a house there still puts them ahead of what their neighbors in Bronxville are paying.
"But you can stand in one of our houses and it looks the same, the air smells the same," she said. "And the termites don't stop at the Bronxville border."
Sabina Grochowski, 39, and her husband Peter Wyrwinski, 37, both physicians, scouted out Bronxville, Mamaroneck, Scarsdale, Larchmont and New Rochelle before friends convinced them to look in Mount Vernon. Ready to move out of their co-op in Woodmere on Long Island, they wanted an impressive historic home in good repair with high ceilings and at least four bedrooms.
They came close to buying a $699,000 Tudor on a tiny lot in Larchmont. But last December, they found a 1913 Mediterranean-style home on an acre on Gramatan Avenue in Fleetwood with such lavish details as stained-glass windows, relief ceilings, mahogany paneling and an elaborately carved central staircase. They snatched it up for $648,000.
"We think Mount Vernon is one of the few underrated spots in Westchester," Dr. Grochowski said.
At about $18,000 a year, the taxes on the property are about the same as those on other houses they considered, Dr. Grochowski said. But the price is considerably better, she added, even after figuring in the $40,000 they spent on renovations before moving in last month. And since the couple have no children, schools were not a consideration, she said.
As a rule, lower housing prices are partly a reflection of the perceived quality of the community's schools. Several economic studies have tried to measure just how much a good school is worth on the real estate market.
In a summary of those studies published last fall in a report titled, "House Prices and the Quality of Public Schools," in Business Review, a Federal Reserve publication, Theodore Crone, head of the regional economics section of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, noted that because housing prices were affected by so many other neighborhood characteristics, it's difficult to separate out the absolute value of a school district. But such a "school premium" clearly exists, Mr. Crone said, and is often linked to districts with higher per-pupil expenditures and higher test scores.
In a 1997 study titled "Do Better Schools Matter?", Sandra E. Black, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, found that even when parents were already paying for a better school district in the Boston suburbs, they would pay an additional 2.5 percent for a house linked to an elementary school that had test scores just 5 percent above the others in that district.
Parents who can afford to pay this housing premium, but choose not to do so, generally make the choice quite consciously. "A number of people don't even ask about schools anymore because they've done the research and they know what they're doing with their kids," said Jane McAfee, a Yonkers sales agent for Prudential Ragette.
In Yonkers, residents may choose from a variety of magnet schools in the public school system, or send their children to one of the many nearby parochial and private schools. Some even pay to have their children attend public schools in Pelham or Ardsley. The Beech Hill neighborhood near Scarsdale and the Armour Villa and Lawrence Park neighborhoods bordering Bronxville have long been popular with buyers wanting large homes at lower prices. And they both offer the added bonus of a Scarsdale or Bronxville ZIP code.
"The people I deal with certainly have looked around and they know the prices of houses in Scarsdale," said Kathleen Kuhnel, an associate broker at Cardinal Realty in Ardsley. "Some of them have kids in private schools anyway, so they figure, 'Why pay those taxes?' "
The differences can be dramatic: A five-bedroom colonial in the Beech Hill neighborhood with a Scarsdale ZIP code was recently listed at $385,000 with taxes of $7,700 while in Scarsdale a colonial of the same size and age was priced at $675,000 with taxes of almost $14,000.
Prices are even higher in Bronxville, where a 50-year-old, four-bedroom colonial was recently listed at $699,000 with taxes of more than $17,000. Just over the border in the Cedar Knolls neighborhood of Yonkers a similar colonial was listed at $399,000 with taxes of $6,100.
The Yonkers neighborhood of Park Hill, though not on the border of Bronxville or Scarsdale, has also caught on in the last few years. One of the first planned residential suburbs around New York, Park Hill is a mix of about 200 19th- and early 20th-century homes on a 300-foot plateau overlooking the Hudson River.
Though the neighborhood has long been popular with artists and entertainers, its proximity to blighted areas had previously made it a hard sell with less venturesome spirits. Now, Ms. McAfee has a list of 25 buyers waiting for houses in Park Hill, where homeowners say they are united in their determination to restore the neighborhood to its former glory.
"I was invited to a party by a neighbor before I even moved in," said Mary Jerome, 54, chairwoman of the English as a second language program for international students at Columbia University. "People have asked me over to dinner. I've been asked to join the Park Hill Conservancy. It's really a nice mix of people -- kind people."
IN January, Ms. Jerome moved into a 100-year-old, 7,000-square-foot Georgian with a view of the Hudson and space for a garden, exactly the kind of magnificent home she had long dreamed of owning. Having lived in Manhattan for 27 years, she knew little about Westchester and nothing of Park Hill when she began looking at houses. She estimates that the $780,000 sale price on the house would undoubtedly have been double in Hastings-on-Hudson or Bronxville, the other communities she had looked into.
"I never even considered whether I'd be able to get my money out because I knew this was it," she said. "My daughter's grown, and this is where I'll stay. Just this morning I went outside and looked at all the stupid little things I planted, which are just pathetic. But I love having the green space."
Empty-nesters are, of course, among the buyers most likely to trade off a prime address for lower taxes and a better deal. In Connecticut, for example, Wendy Tremaglio and her husband, Ralph, a golf pro, opted for Norwalk about two years ago as a money-wise alternative to Westport, where they raised their daughter. As they shopped around for a house, their biggest priority was one-level living to make it easier for their two aging bichon frises to get around.
By crossing the Westport border into Norwalk's quiet Cranbury neighborhood the couple were able to get a large two-bedroom ranch with an attached garage on a third of an acre for just under $190,000. Taxes are $3,400 a year. They spent about $30,000 on renovations, including redoing the kitchen.
"But this house in Westport would have probably been about $400,000 or $500,000," said Mrs. Tremaglio, 44. And it's still only minutes away from her two places of employment -- her family's store, Dining In, in Norwalk and Riverside-Shavell Realty in Westport.
More up-and-coming is the Black Rock neighborhood of Bridgeport, a waterfront community along Black Rock Harbor. "I've heard of three or four instances now where people have sold their homes in Westport and moved to Black Rock," said Ken Scala, owner of Century 21 Scala and Clark in Bridgeport. "This is a trend now, it's really happening."
While Black Rock has most of Bridgeport's highest-priced homes, prices are still significantly less than the beach neighborhoods of Fairfield and Westport. For example, a four-bedroom, 1920's Cape Cod with a view of Long Island Sound recently sold in Black Rock for $211,500, with estimated taxes of $3,478. A similar-sized 1920's colonial on a slightly smaller lot in the beach area of Fairfield recently sold for $400,000, with estimated taxes of $3,500.
LAST summer, Nikita and Maiko Cheremeteff moved to Black Rock after 23 years in Westport. Mr. Cheremeteff, 66, had just retired as vice president for manufacturing at Loctite Corporation in Hartford, a chemical company, and the couple's four children were all living on their own. So the Cheremeteffs settled into a five-bedroom 1920's colonial in Black Rock on a hill overlooking the Sound. They paid $370,000.
"We wanted to move to a cheaper house, but a better house, a nicer house," Mr. Cheremeteff said. "And we wanted to be on the Metro-North line, so the children could come visit easily. We still do all of our shopping in Westport -- it's only seven minutes away. There are a lot of people around us who have moved here from Westport, basically for the same reason.
"Twenty years ago, we would have stayed in Westport because the school system is much better. But now, school is no longer a problem."
Buyer interest in Black Rock is such that prices have appreciated more there in the last 12 months than in any other area of Bridgeport, said Mr. Scala, the brokerage owner. "There's a real sense of community there," he said. "Neighbors gather at the Harbor View Market -- it's kind of the local meeting place."
To a great extent, the empty-nesters moving downmarket are encouraged to to so by a strong market and a seemingly endless supply of another breed of buyers, those willing to pay top dollar for the most desirable addresses. Indeed, it was a developer who bought the Cheremeteffs' 1970's split-level on two acres in Westport. He promptly razed the house to make way for a $2.6 million mansion.

HEADLINE: One Museum That's Happy Just to Be Its Tranquil Self

BYLINE: By BILL KENT

 BODY:
THE sign for the Noyes Museum of Art points east off Route 9 in Oceanville, but the entrance to Lily Lake Road is easy to miss. You'll know you've gone too far north if you pass the cluster of restored 19th-century buildings called the Historic Towne of Smithville. And if you hit Atlantic City, you will have gone far too south.
Both Atlantic City and Smithville are the reason New Jersey's most beautifully situated museum exists. Fred and Ethel Noyes made their fortune with the Ram's Head Inn in Absecon, a dress-up surf-and-turf house catering to Atlantic City's visitors before the casino era, and the Smithville Inn, a Colonial-era stagecoach stop. The Noyeses became avid collectors of regional folk art, amassing one of the world's largest collections of antique waterfowl decoys, made by Atlantic City hotel workers unemployed during the winter, and sold to hunters for little more than $1. 
 In 1983, the couple spent $9 million to build a museum for their collections. They wanted the museum to link the Jersey Shore Pinelands environment with the art it inspired. Mrs. Noyes died shortly after the museum opened; Mr. Noyes left a foundation to perpetuate the museum when he died in 1987.
A central gallery displays some of Mr. Noyes's waterfowl decoys. A decoy carver is usually on site once a week to explain how they are made and why they have become so highly prized.
Two other galleries, as well as portions of the foyer, house 10 to 12 exhibitions of regional fine and folk art each year. At the moment, you can see family photographs by Rita Bernstein and "Brushes With Spirituality: Ethereal Paintings," a group show.
But the museum's most dramatic feature, one that easily attracts more attention than the art, is the view of Lily Lake from the lowest terrace. No matter what the season, the lush vista of the Forsythe Wildlife Refuge view evokes contemplation.
"A peaceful haven is not quite the image we want to project," said Jane Epstein, the museum's executive director. "Yes, it can get pretty quiet on the weekdays, and some people do visit for just that reason, but we've been taking great pains to establish the museum as a meeting ground between fine art and folk art, especially outsider art, the objects produced by artists who have not been professionally trained." A show of work by the reclusive self-taught painter Justin McCarthy opens on June 20.
Not counting the decoys, the museum has 300 artworks in its permanent collection. It shows work mostly from artists who live or have worked in the Northeast. The Noyes has benefited from state and private grants, some of them from casino companies, although the only exhibition that directly referred to Atlantic City was a somewhat satirical assembly of paintings and sculpture relating to the Miss America Pageant in 1997.

HEADLINE: IN PERSON: A Cloud Over the G.O.P.'s Silver Lining in Essex County;
After a Troubled Murder Investigation in Orange, James W. Treffinger Tangles With a Protege

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
JAMES W. TREFFINGER'S wife, Janet, has a name for it. She calls the decision five years ago -- when her husband chucked his lucrative partnership at a Wall Street law firm to become the first Republican county executive in Essex County in 35 years -- his "midlife crisis."
It wasn't the textbook case, a time of searching, redefinition and renewal, Mr. Treffinger said one day last week. But his wife's label was, he conceded, an accurate one nonetheless. 
 "I was Mayor of Verona and looking at the corrupt bloated county government," he said, noting that the county executive at the time, Thomas J. D'Alessio, a Democrat, was about to be convicted for money laundering, fraud and extortion. "It was my Moby Dick and I was Ahab. I jumped into the race and I enjoyed it and I redefined myself as a political reformer."
Today, as the 49-year-old official heads into his fifth year and his second term in office, he can boast of five consecutive county budgets in which he did not propose a tax increase. And in all but one of those years, his no-tax budgets survived. In 1998, under what he consider election-year pressure to tarnish his record, the eight-to-one Democratic majority on the Board of Freeholders overrode his budget proposal and increased taxes by $10 million.
Over that time he managed to mix cutbacks to a score of favored programs and sacred cows, passed along several county functions to the state, auctioned off some county assets to private industry, corralled support for these steps among leading Democrats -- all while cadging considerable assistance from Governor Whitman. In all, despite inflation and normal growth pressures, he cut county budgets from $530 million in 1994 to $506 million with his latest proposal that includes no tax increases.
With the completion of some important negotiations in recent weeks and an infusion of state money, Mr. Treffinger seems poised for yet another victory as the Freeholders begin their consideration of his budget.
But there is a cloud hovering as well.
He is engaged in a very public dispute with the Essex County Prosecutor, Patricia A. Hurt, his former deputy county executive and the woman whom he vigorously backed in 1997 to become the first black female prosecutor in the county and only the second in the state.
Ms. Hurt's office was already reeling from widespread criticism of its handling of the investigation into the shooting of a police officer in Orange and facing several state and Federal investigations of her office's actions. On April 8, a police woman was killed, and for six days she held a man who had a strong alibi, who passed a polygraph test and who later was cleared.
She suffered another blow when when Mr. Treffinger publicly charged her with extravagant spending that added to her troubles by leading to an audit by the State Attorney General's office.
The two have been locked in a dispute in which Ms. Hurt has seeking a budget increase for her office -- the busiest in the state -- to $29 million from $23.4 million last year. But Mr. Treffinger, alleging misuse of funds, has tried to hold her to last year's initial proposal of $22 million.
Ms. Hurt has fought back, charging that Mr. Treffinger's much-touted budget magic over the last five years has essentially been accomplished with smoke and mirrors. Contrary to cutting the budget and deficits of the past, she said, pointing to her role as advisor and confidant during the time, he left the county with a real deficit of $30 million. As the charges have gone back and forth over the last week, the words have grown angry and vituperative.
In his office last week, Mr. Treffinger said that the whole dispute had saddened him and made him wonder about what has happened to the idea of political loyalty.
"Like honor, it is a virtue, and I'm saddened that our friendship is damaged," he said. "This was someone I was fond of, my running mate when she ran for county registrar in 1994. But I deserve to take some of the responsibility for her because I was unabashed in my support for her to the Governor when she was appointed prosecutor. She was my idea."
Some suggest that Mr. Treffinger is being disingenuous in so lamenting the current dispute. They contend that he has abandoned Ms. Hurt at a time when she is besieged and weakened and has shown himself to have his own problem with loyalty. His support of her appointment reportedly aided his ability to attract black support during his re-election bid last year in a county where Democratic registration outstrips Republican by three to one and where the black population is more than 40 percent. That support could be jeopardized, some suggested, should Mr. Treffinger's attacks on Ms. Hurt further weaken her standing with Governor Whitman.
The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the influential Black Ministers Conference of New Jersey, said there was such concern about the split between the two officials that individual ministers had sought to meet with them separately to try to heal the rift. He said that there would be other efforts in the coming week to "try to bring them together".
"The ministers pushed for Ms. Hurt's appointment and some of them supported Mr. Treffinger's re-election last year," Mr. Jackson said. "It's important for us to not have the prosecutor under attack, but also important to have as prosecutor someone we can defend."
Mr. Treffinger insists that he did not set out to see that a black was appointed county prosecutor, but that he was, nevertheless, proud of that fact.
"I happen to believe in making the Republican Party as inclusive as possible and here was this person who was my friend and who I felt was qualified and I was glad that she was an African-American," he said. "Yes, I was proud of it and I talked about it."
Born James Padalino in Newark, Mr. Treffinger was adopted when he was 4 years old. He was raised in Maplewood and graduated from St. Benedict Prep School in Newark. He graduated from Seton Hall University magna cum laude and as a Fulbright scholar studied in Germany. He went on to receive a law degree at Rutgers University.
Practicing corporate law, he eventually became a partner in the firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed. He began his political career as a member of the township council in Verona, where he eventually served a total of 13 years, rising to deputy mayor and then mayor and county freeholder simultaneously. A Democrat when he entered politics, Mr. Treffinger switched in midstream to the Republican Party in 1986 when he was mayor of Verona out of disappointment with soaring taxes and increasing burdens on local governments when the county was controlled by Democrats.
In 1994, when Democrats were split racially over the county executive race and reeling from the corruption convictions of many of its leaders, Mr. Treffinger squeaked into office by 2,400 votes. What he found were drawers still crammed with unpaid bills, a previously hidden budget deficit of $161 million and the imminent downgrading of the county's bonds to something just below junk bonds. He set out to improve things and won re-election by 7,000 votes last November on the strength of his fiscal stewardship and his political canniness in leveraging state help and cultivating Democratic allies.
While still mayor and well before moving into the county executive's office, Mr. Treffinger, by his own admission, became "obsessed" with the county machinations surrounding the future of 365 acres of densely wooded land, bordered by abandoned county medical buildings and straddling the communities of Verona, Cedar Grove and North Caldwell. He vigorously fought early proposals to sell it to private developers for construction of offices and a hotel and supported creating a park on the property called Hilltop.
In 1991, the county's Democratric administration was implicated in the illegal dumping of construction debris and hazardous waste on the property. Mr. Treffinger, who had helped uncover what was happening by making late-night visits to the county reservation to witness and document the illegal dumping, said that he became the administration's "implacable foe" and set out to come up with a plan to protect the area from further misuse and locally unwanted development.
"We wanted to make it idiot-proof by getting it out of county hands so they couldn't do anything worse with it, while at the same time creating some green space," he said.
Initially he had won approval to sell the land to the Essex County Improvement Authority, which issued bonds backed by the county, for a net gain of $32 million. That money was used to help reduce the deficit that Mr. Treffinger faced upon entering office and the plan was to sell off some of the land to developers to get the money to repay the bonds.
Last week, the county freeholders unanimously approved the final piece of Mr. Treffinger's plan. Several acres will be sold to private interests to be developed as single-family housing while privately developed senior citizen housing will be built on another portion of land surrounding the wooded Hilltop area. In addition, private developers will be sought out to construct a 350-bed center and a 1,000-bed nursing home and assisted-care facility.
And with the help of a grant from the state, 227 acres at the very top will be preserved as a county-state passive park where the most intensive activity will be hiking on a few trails. It is the combination of the money from the state purchase of the land and the proposed sale of other parcels to private developers that will wipe out the debt and prevent any new costs that could increased county spending and taxes.
"It was the dumping on Hilltop that really got me angry at a time when my only political ambition was to perhaps run for State Assembly," he said. "It got me back involved with the county and I started tilting at windmills and suddenly they were toppling over. The Hilltop plan is something that I will be very proud of when one day I take my grandchildren there."

Not Doing What the Romans Do

BYLINE: By CAROL STEINBERG 

 BODY:
WHEN Kay Ainsley of Detroit traveled to Saudi Arabia several years ago to sell the rights to open Domino's Pizza shops there, she felt the full force of being a woman in a man's land.
Her business visa was rejected twice before the intervention of the Saudi businessman with whom she planned to negotiate. Then she arrived at their meeting room in Jidda to find that employees nearby had been cleared away because of her presence. 
 Dressed in a business suit, she was later asked to cover herself with an abaya, or traditional long black robe, for lunch at the businessman's home. In scouting the competition, Ms. Ainsley, then Domino's director of international development, found that a local sandwich shop didn't allow women, so she had to peer into a window and have male colleagues fetch take-out.
In a global economy, American business people are learning how to grin and bear overseas cultural challenges. Women, however, often face added obstacles.
Recent research suggests that only about one of every 8 or 10 managers assigned abroad by American corporations is a woman. But as more companies and more female executives see other women succeeding overseas and recognize that such jobs can speed advancement, more women are likely to go.
"Businesses in the U.S. have wrestled with their desire, honestly, to assign women who are otherwise qualified to work overseas," said Bill Carmell of Winston & Strawn in New York, a labor lawyer for management. "Part of the problem, though, for them has been the acceptance of that in some countries."
Darlene Orlov, a work-force consultant in New York specializing in sexual harassment, said some employers were quietly allowing potential cultural clashes to influence their choices for foreign jobs. "We all know it's illegal to allow your customer's preference for gender or race to determine who will be assigned to that business," she said of United States companies. "However, people still consider, 'Can we send a person into an environment where the customer might not be responsive?' "
RELOCATION experts say France, Italy, Spain and Eastern Europe are among the places where women are recognized first as business people and then as women. But they regard Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia and much of Latin America as among the toughest places for an American woman to do business.
Ms. Ainsley, now a franchise consultant with Michael H. Seid & Associates of West Hartford, Conn., said she would go back to Saudi Arabia. But even she would advise clients otherwise. All things being equal, she said, "I'd probably assign a project to a male -- it would be easier for them to get business done."
The biggest challenge is to be sensitive to a culture, but not mimic it, said Nancy Adler, a professor of international management at McGill University in Montreal: " 'When in Rome do as the Romans do' is not particularly good advice, and it's horrible advice for women in many cultures."
When abroad, American businesswomen can circumvent some local customs by making it clear they are different from local women. A Japanese-American in Japan should clarify up front that she was born, say, in Kansas.
Women often must strive to be taken seriously. Sue Roll of Gaston, Ore., a human resources manager at the Intel Corporation, was ignored for 45 minutes while meeting with an employee training agency in Shanghai. Only after her male peers repeatedly turned to her and said, "Sue, you're in charge," was her authority acknowledged.
Women coach female colleagues to signal their importance by displaying their knowledge and having top executives send introductory letters, make calls and accompany them to meet clients. For small companies, an American consulate or industry group can open doors. Women are sometimes advised to travel in business class and stay in good hotels as symbols of their status.
As for building relationships, "the biggest mistake made by women is assuming they have to act identically to males," Ms. Adler said. Referring to foreign habits of heavy after-hours drinking, she said, "We have a quiet joke that it's possible to be highly successful as a woman in Asia without losing your liver."
That wasn't immediately apparent to Edith Parham Melton, who, as a customer-service executive for Lucent Technologies, covered Asia from Hong Kong until recently. She was included in dinners in Japan, but then male colleagues, Japanese and American, would drop her off at her hotel and go drinking. Rather than protest such exclusion, she continued to develop rapport through lunches and dinners. "It didn't impede the business relationship, but it took longer," she said.
Women have also found that even a casual comment can be misinterpreted. At a dinner in Japan, a male client told Jane Echols, who has a public relations firm in San Francisco, that her children must miss her when she travels. When she replied that her husband stayed home with them, "he was dumbfounded," she said, adding, "His image of me became someone who could overpower men."
There are ways to cope with, but still respect, foreign customs. In Pakistan, it is possible to evade the taboo against meeting with a man behind closed doors by keeping the door open or meeting as a group.
Although Ms. Ainsley completed her Saudi deal, she kept silent when she was banned from the contract signing at a palace in Riyadh; her boss, a man, signed instead. "I wasn't there to revolutionize their culture," she said.

Insurers and Uninsured Put Hospitals in a Squeeze

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
AFTER a run of profitable years, hospitals across the country face cash-flow problems -- squeezed, officials say, by slow-paying managed-care companies, cutbacks in government programs and rapidly growing numbers of uninsured patients. Pressured by rising costs, hospitals are aggressively trying to collect mountains of overdue bills for patient care.
According to the hospitals, managed-care companies are routinely delaying payments by three or four months, even in states where delays that long are illegal, often by reporting that they have lost track of bills, including those transmitted electronically. 
 Adding to their problems, hospitals are feeling the effects of changes enacted in 1997 to the Medicare program, which covers elderly and disabled Americans and supplies more than half the revenue at many hospitals. The changes have reduced the hospitals' share of growth in program payments by billions of dollars.
Across the board, payments for patients plummeted 20 percent last year at the nation's most efficiently managed hospitals, according to preliminary findings by HCIA Inc., a Baltimore company that studies health care trends. By another widely used industry measure, HCIA said that the 100 best-managed hospitals had to wait 64 days last year, on average, to be paid, or five more days than in 1997.
The payment delays, along with rising costs for employees and prescription drugs, are pushing hospitals to seek new price increases, which would add to medical inflation, said John F. Hindelong, a health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
But before raising rates, hospitals are trying new ways to collect money. They are hiring drivers to take uninsured low-income patients to Medicaid offices to sign up for benefits, combing through Medicare documents seeking overlooked payments, prodding managed-care insurers to pay more promptly and experimenting with ways to collect from patients more efficiently.
"We look under every rock to find money," said John Lavan, executive vice president and chief financial officer of New York Presbyterian Hospital, where almost one-third of the unpaid bills are more than four months old.
It is illegal in 21 states for insurers to delay payments to hospitals by more than 30 to 60 days, but it is not uncommon for such laws to be routinely flouted. The pain is especially sharp in New York, where the legal limit is 45 days but managed-care companies typically take three to four months to pay, according to Patricia Wang, a senior vice president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
Enforcement is spotty and the penalties for late filing have so far been minor; state regulators fined 14 insurers for late payments last month. The biggest penalty so far this year was $91,900 in two fines assessed against Oxford Health Plans, hardly a heavy burden for a company with $4 billion in annual revenue. But Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health Plans Association, said the fines were based on a "miniscule" number of claims among millions handled each month. She said most delays were caused by hospital billing errors.
Whatever their cause, the late payments are tying up working capital and will push more hospitals into operating losses if the money is not collected, Ms. Wang said.
The outlook is almost as dreary elsewhere. The Massachusetts Hospital Association said recently that its members were owed $163 million by health maintenance organizations, of which $122 million was for bills that were 90 or more days old. In Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has more than $270 million in unpaid bills, and it takes 68 or 69 days, on average, to collect, said Bernadette Lodge-Lemon, the director of patient financial services.
Some hospitals have looked for ways to get faster payment on the portion of hospital bills that patients pay themselves. In some cases, they are urging patients to use major credit cards. Visa reported 14.5 percent growth in hospital-bill charges to its cards last year, which accounted for $665 million of its $12.1 billion in health care charges; Mastercard said its hospital charges were up 10 percent.
But hospital officials say many patients are reluctant to use their credit cards this way. Patients shy away from adding a big, open-ended charge -- the total owed may not be known until weeks after the patient goes home -- to cards that may already be near their credit limits.
Patients are in no big hurry to pay, either. "The consumer doesn't feel guilty about not paying the hospital, feeling it has gotten paid sufficiently by the insurer," said Dan Cain, a health care investment banker based in New York. And until recently, hospitals, especially nonprofits, have been timid about collecting from patients. "They are very concerned about their public relations," said Ted Smith, a vice president of the American Collectors Association, a Minneapolis-based trade group of credit officers, banks and card companies.
When all else fails, hospitals turn to collection agencies and sometimes sell receivables at discounts to financial firms that are more willing to pursue debtors.
To keep matters from reaching that point, several dozen medical centers have introduced credit cards just for hospital bills. Last fall, the Atlantic Health System in New Jersey started offering such a card, managed by Health Charge, a privately held finance company in Chevy Chase, Md.
With the card, patients of the system's four hospitals get 60 days to pay without owing interest; thereafter, they are charged the prime rate plus six percentage points, or 13.75 percent as of Friday, a moderate rate by credit card standards. The management company advances the hospital 50 percent of the total bill up front and keeps 5 percent of patients' principal and all interest paid. If the patient does not begin paying in 90 or 120 days, the hospital must return the advance. "It works pretty smoothly, especially for patients that don't have any insurance," said Diane Robinson, who tracks payments for Atlantic Health.
So far, only a small minority of patients are using the cards. Atlantic Health has issued cards to just 150 patients; nationwide, Health Charge has 8,000 card holders at 40 hospitals, according to Paul Devereaux, the company's general manager.
Still, health care is "a huge market that needs capital," said Robert Napoli, a financial services analyst in Chicago with ABN Amro, a Dutch bank. Banks, he added, are "not very good at understanding" health care, creating opportunities for niche players like Health Charge.

3 Ways a Frail Global Rally Could Come Again to Tears

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEW. Glad that crisis is over.
From Bangkok to Berlin, people are celebrating the end of the global turmoil that started in Asia nearly two years ago -- investors, that is, not the unemployed of Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, who are wondering what all the excitement is about. 
 While real economies languish, stock markets are surging. Thailand was up 10 percent on Wednesday. The South Koreans fret that their currency may be getting too strong. Hong Kong just witnessed its own Internet frenzy. Even Russia's market is rising, now that the International Monetary Fund has agreed to make believe the country can pay its debts.
Nonetheless, this is a pretty nervous group of partygoers. Catch a finance minister or central banker in a moment of candor, and you discover someone surveying the land for signs of imminent eruptions.
Here are a few of the favorite worst-case scenarios kicking around:
The fate of the world economy rests on the performance of Yahoo and a handful of other American stocks. If they buckle, kiss the rest of the world's markets goodbye.
Overly simplistic it may be, but this thinking has a certain gut appeal. American consumers are on a spending spree, egged on by a wealth effect based on how much a rising market has added to their net worth. Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo Economics notes that housing and traditional consumer spending equaled 119 percent of the amount by which the economy grew in the first quarter, meaning consumers more than compensated for a sharp fall in exports.
The stock market's rise, in turn, is built on a strikingly small galaxy of star stocks, though the galaxy has grown a bit lately.
So the theory goes that if those stocks crack, consumer spending cracks, too, ravaging the rest of the market. And as America stops sucking in the world's exports, countries and regions that depend on American demand -- Japan, Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia -- also go over a cliff.
This theory is widely discussed in the upper reaches of the Clinton Adminstration, but never in public. "Too radioactive," one of the President's economic advisers says. "Too ugly to think about."
The fate of the world economy has less to do with Yahoo than with a bunch of yahoos in the Japanese parliament.
Washington politicians like this one more because it places the blame on the world's second-largest economy. All hands nodded politely as Japan's Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, explained last week that the country's worst troubles were behind it, that the recovery was in sight, that after seven years of fumbling the Government had figured out what to do. And as soon as Mr. Obuchi was out of earshot, most of Mr. Clinton's advisers had the same reaction: Yeah, right.
Here's the fear: The Japanese Government is spending roughly 8 percent of gross national product on a stimulus package to reflate the economy andis predicting a growth rate of 0.5 percent this year. Everyone else thinks the economy will go on shrinking. Even the International Monetary Fund, which hates to offend its members, downgraded its 1999 projection to a 1.4 percent decline in G.N.P.
Despite the Government's huge spending spree, Japanese companies say they are still cutting back on capital investment in new plants and technology. And that's where the disaster scenarios start.
The Government can't keep spending like that. "They are pretty much out at the limit now," says Edward Lincoln, a Brookings Institution economist who once worked as special adviser to Walter F. Mondale when he was Ambassador to Japan. And if the tap runs dry, Japan's slow retreat could turn to a rout -- a highly contagious one.
Yet Japanese legislators visiting Washington in recent weeks acknowledged that they had no plan for speeding the restructuring of Japanese industry, because that would mean more unemployment. Instead, they talk about "job preservation" and steer the conversation away from the Internet and toward the travails of rice farming.
Shades of 10 years ago, or 20. It suggests that Japan's political system is still unable to come to terms with how its economy must be transformed.
Forget Yahoo and the Japanese yahoos. The real trouble is a counterattack on a fellow named Zhu.
That would be Zhu Rongji, China's Prime Minister. No sooner did he arrive back from his trip to the United States than Chinese businesses began assailing him for the concessions he made in trying to gain membership for China in the World Trade Organzation.
The telecommunications minister reportedly threatened to quit. The Government began hinting that some of the offers were coming off the table and then ordered the removal of some foreign-origin programs from satellite television systems -- not exactly an embrace of the global economy.
China, of course, is still an economy unto itself. So even if Mr. Zhu were to lose his war to modernize the economy, or China's insolvent banks were to acknowledge their insolvency and go over the edge, it might not matter much in the rest of the world.
On the other hand, it's a bigger country than Thailand. And look what happened after a little problem there.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BOERUM HILL;
Magazine Revises Its Span

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
Brooklyn Bridge may not be falling down, but the magazine can no longer afford to be published monthly, its owner and editor in chief, Melissa Ennen, said last week.
Three of the five news staff members were laid off on April 30, and the magazine will now be put together by freelance editors and writers and published every other month, Ms. Ennen said. The production and sales staff will remain, she said. 
In August 1995, Ms. Ennen, a North Carolina native with no journalism experience, used family money to start Brooklyn Bridge, whose offices are in an old machine factory on Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill.
Ms. Ennen, 46, who also lives in the neighborhood, said she had invested $5.3 million into the magazine, which has not made a profit. "I could have retired on the French Riviera five years ago," she said. "Instead I started the magazine, not to make a killing, but so Brooklyn would have something to read."
She blamed herself for mistakes in hiring and said the magazine had problems deciding what kinds of articles and covers would attract readers. There were also difficulties in getting the magazine to Manhattan newsstands, she said.
Circulation, which Ms. Ennen said is not audited, has remained steady around 35,000, she said, 31,000 by subscription. She said the annual subscription price for new subscribers will be $12 a year for six copies. (Current subscribers paid $18.) And the $2.75 newsstand price will go up 25 cents, to $3.
Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a magazine consulting firm, said the decision to publish less frequently "sounds like a last gasp."
"What they're saying is, 'We can get the same number of ads in 6 months as we did in 12, and only pay half the printing and distribution costs,' " Mr. Walker said. Brooklyn's diverse ethnic communities and its neighborhoods with disparate economic conditions make it hard to gain a readership base and attract national advertisers, he said.
Ms. Ennen called this her "fundamental challenge," but said that her magazine has a diverse readership. "Most people think we're a Slopey, Heightsy magazine, but half our readers don't even live in brownstone Brooklyn," she said. The goal, she said, is to publish "something for everyone."
"It feels drastic, but Brooklyn Bridge will be fine," she said. COREY KILGANNON

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: BERNICE S. BEHAR;
John Hancock Emerging Growth Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
PORTFOLIO managers who limit themselves to small-capitalization stocks face a recurring quandary: Their best performers grow into mid- and large-cap stocks, forcing them to sell.
Bernice S. Behar, lead portfolio manager of the $650 million John Hancock Emerging Growth fund, understands the problem -- and welcomes it. "Our goal is to buy companies that graduate out of the fund, like Starbucks and E*Trade," she said, referring to two previous stock picks. (Actually, the fund still holds a small amount of Starbucks shares.) 
 Ms. Behar succeeds by identifying stocks that benefit from economic, demographic or industry trends like outsourcing and Internet growth. "The linchpin for us is finding companies that are exploiting a change," she said from her Boston office, overlooking the Charles River.
In a period when many small-company stock funds have struggled, Emerging Growth has turned in a solid performance. It returned 12.8 percent, annualized, for the three years ended April 30, versus 5.6 percent for the average small growth fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. And for the 12 months ended April 30, the fund returned 5.9 percent, versus a loss of 4.9 percent for the peer group.
Ms. Behar, 38, came to money management via Tokyo, where she studied at International Christian University. Her fluency in Japanese helped lead to a job at Sanyo Securities America in New York, as an analyst focusing on Japanese stocks. She moved to Boston in 1990 to work as an analyst on John Hancock's Pacific Basin fund, and soon began focusing on small-cap United States stocks in a variety of positions.
She looks for companies with revenue and earnings growth of at least 20 percent a year. But she said she shuns using computer screens to find them: "We take a bottom-up, analytic approach," she said.
Ms. Behar personally covers retail, consumer-product and business-services stocks. One other portfolio manager who works with her focuses on technology, another on health care, while an assistant portfolio manager covers media, entertainment and education. Their industry expertise helps pinpoint companies that offer both outstanding growth potential and top-flight executives. "Management takes on a heightened importance in small companies," she said, "because they need not only a vision of where their market is but how the company will grow to serve the market."
Ms. Behar considers unloading stocks that lag behind the Russell 2000 Growth index or their industry groups for a year from the time they are bought.
Small-cap growth stocks, of course, are an especially risky lot. "These stocks can be quite volatile, because of the lack of liquidity," she said, "and the companies themselves are volatile because they're in their early stages of development."
Diversification helps to lower the fund's risks. The fund owns 180 companies, each accounting for just 0.4 percent to 1.4 percent of assets.
But Ms. Behar doesn't buy the tiniest companies -- or stocks with little liquidity. She looks for those with market capitalizations of at least $100 million and a 10-day average daily trading volume of at least 100,000 shares.
IN February, she bought shares of Pacific Sunwear of California, a retailer with 350 stores nationwide, for $27.54 a share. The company sells casual clothing for teen-age boys, a fast-growing group, Ms. Behar said. She said the company's management is adept in a fickle business, shifting rapidly as fashion trends change. The company, based in Anaheim, Calif., is introducing a line of clothes geared toward older customers -- in their early 20's.
She expects Pacific Sunwear to earn $1.50 a share this year, and she sees annualized earnings growth of 30 percent over the next three years. The stock closed on Friday at $34.125.
Another favorite is Getty Images of Seattle, which provides images to advertising companies, magazines and newspapers and which last week agreed to buy Art.com, a Chicago-based seller of art images, for up to $202 million in cash and stock. Getty has a library of 30 million images; customers use them in lieu of hiring photographers. The company recently signed an agreement with Amazon.com to supply photographs for its on-line greeting cards.
Ms. Behar first bought Getty Images shares in January 1998 at $19.29. She expects the company, which lost $36.4 million last year, to post a 28 percent increase in after-tax cash flow in 1999 and to become profitable in 2001. The stock closed on Friday at $27.875.
A third holding is Exodus Communications of Santa Clara, Calif., a company that develops and maintains Web sites. Clients include Yahoo, Ebay and Lycos. One positive for the stock, of course, is the growth of the Internet, she said, "but it's also an outsourcing play, because it costs companies six times as much to develop and run their Web site themselves than to have Exodus do it."
The fund first bought Exodus stock in March 1998, at $15. The company lost $66.4 million in 1998, but she figures that its gross revenues will grow 70 percent a year, on average, over the next two years, and that it will be profitable by the fourth quarter of 2000. The stock closed on Friday at $80.50.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS;
How Much Protection For Bank Customers?

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
YOUR bank can collect details about your spending habits, like how much you charged last year at lingerie, liquor and lawn-and-garden stores, and then sell that information to companies that market bras, booze and bug killers.
And your bank is not required to tell you if it does. Nor can you do anything about it, except maybe pay for everything with cash (in which case your bank can collect and sell data on your A.T.M. use patterns). 
 Last week, President Clinton pressed for tougher laws to curb or at least improve disclosure of what he called banking industry abuses like these. Consumer advocates say, however, that with the Government unlikely to afford adequate protections, bank customers must be wary.
The President wants to have banks improve disclosure of fees, charges and interest rates. Consumer groups say that bank customers shouldn't have to be corporate lawyers or accountants to comprehend what their banks are offering.
"Many people in this country are essentially math-illiterate, and they need information disclosed in terms that they can understand but that Congress is not requiring," said Gary Klein of the Consumer Law Center in Boston.
Mr. Clinton wants credit card issuers who lure customers with low teaser rates to state prominently how much they charge after the introductory periods -- in some cases, more than 2 percent a month. For now, customers should concentrate not on the initial rates, often promoted even on the envelopes containing these offers, but on the regular rates, sometimes disclosed in small print and sometimes not at all.
Automated teller machines present special challenges. People who use A.T.M.'s operated by banks where they do not have accounts often have to go through several steps to learn whether and what they will be charged. Last week, the Senate approved a requirement that banks post charges on the machines.
Several of the President's proposals are meant to protect customers' privacy. Mary Griffin, a lawyer for Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, wants Congress, at a minimum, to require full disclosure in plain English when banks sell information about their customers and their spending habits. Better yet, she said, customers should be able to block the sharing or sale of this information, as President Clinton has proposed.
But in the Senate, which last week passed a bill to repeal the core laws that have governed the banking industry since the Depression, the focus was much less on protecting consumers than on letting banks, insurers and securities firms enter one another's businesses.
The President says that as banks expand their domains, there is greater need for new restrictions and privacy protections. When one company can own a bank, an insurance company and a brokerage firm, he said last week, "you should not have to worry that the results of your latest physical will be used to deny your application for a mortgage or a credit card."
Consumer advocates also want Congress to prohibit banks from pitching insurance and investment products to people with pending loan applications, a practice they regard as coercive. Banks aren't allowed to turn down loan applicants for refusing to buy other products, but those seeking loans often have the opposite impression. Consumer advocates advise applicants to get their loans first, then choose insurance and investments separately and free from untoward pressure.
THE consumer groups say the President should have tried to give customers who buy securities from banks at least as many rights as those who buy from brokers. Most important, they say, are protections against being steered into unsuitable investments, like an especially volatile mutual fund or Internet stocks for an elderly widower with only modest savings.
Also missing from the President's proposals are limits on the rates banks can charge on loans or credit cards, consumer groups say. States used to set limits, but Congress, with the backing of the Supreme Court, has asserted its dominance.
Banks say the loosening of restrictions benefits many customers, because interest rates can be set according to each borrower's credit risk. While some people pay higher rates because of poor credit histories, the banks say, others now borrow at lower rates.
But with credit card lenders having to write off only 1 percent of the money owed them, Mr. Klein said, punitive rates are not justified.
While the President is threatening to veto the Senate bill for weakening regulations aimed at making sure banks lend in the inner cities, he has not listed the other consumer issues as veto bait.
Banking trade groups say that issues as complex as privacy and disclosure should be dealt with separately, rather than having them jeopardize legislation needed now. "These consumer protection issues," said Ed Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, "are not germaine to the bill."
But Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, said that the longer the delays, the greater the need to police bank practices. "Banks are pushing the envelope in every direction, testing consumers and regulators," he said. "And why? Because their consumer business is far and away their most profitable business."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
Industrial Metals: The Tea Leaf Commodities

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE price of copper has jumped 15.4 percent since its low this year, to 70.78 cents a pound. The price of tin is up 12 percent from its 1999 low; nickel, 41.3 percent; lead, 11.8 percent, and aluminum, 17.1 percent.
So what? 
 The price of spot copper is still 17.3 percent below its 1998 high. Aluminum is down 13 percent; tin, 10.4 percent; lead, 10.2 percent, and nickel, 6 percent. The prices of these metals, all traded on the London Metal Exchange, are even further below their highs of the last big commodity rally, which reached its peaks in 1995 and 1996. (And at the same time, agricultural commodities, except for hogs, are still declining.)
For for all kinds of investors, there are reasons to be concerned. But there is one issue -- inflation -- that is not worth worrying about yet.
The recent rise in industrial commodity prices is important because it could help lead to rising wages and, therefore, more inflationary pressures.
One of the recent surprises for economists has been the slowdown in the rate of wage increases, despite a drop in unemployment. The April employment data released on Friday showed that the increase in average hourly earnings had slowed to 3.4 percent in the last year, below the 3.8 percent for the 12 months ended in December.
One theory to explain it is that the sharp decline in the inflation rate in 1998 tempered wage demands. The Consumer Price Index rose just 1.6 percent last year.
Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., thinks the C.P.I. will end the year up about 2 percent. That is not a major increase. But he thinks that the jump in oil and gasoline prices will temporarily push the annual rate of increase in the C.P.I. to 2.5 percent. And that headline, he said, "will not play well in Peoria, and it could well affect pay negotiations later this year."
The price increases in metals could also signal that the global economy is turning around, a fact that would make a slowdown here less likely and a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, to put a drag on growth, more likely.
What is happening globally is one of the most important questions for investors over the next several months. The selloff last week in the bond market, which pushed the yield on the 30-year bond up to 5.81 percent, the highest in almost a year, was prompted in part by the fear that a rebound in Asia and Europe would make a slowdown here almost impossible.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, compounded that concern by saying on Thursday that the global financial crisis appears to have passed. He said the threat was now that low employment would drive wages -- and inflation -- higher.
If commodity prices are accelerating, Mr. Shepherdson said, "it is more likely that the world economy is turning around."
Mr. Shepherdson and other economists caution that, as of now, this is the likely, but not the certain, outcome. There are not enough data yet to prove that the global economy has turned around. While South Korea and some other Asian countries are showing signs of revival, Japan is still a big question mark. And Europe is sluggish despite the surprising interest-rate cut last month by the European Central Bank.
William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch, said: "It is premature to say that commodities are telling us that we are heading to a new global economic boom. But the worst may be over."
What is not to worry about is that inflation is going to shoot dangerously higher. "We're not set for a big commodity or inflation boom," Mr. O'Neill said.
A main reason is that commodities constitute such a small part of American products, making up less than 10 percent of the total cost, according to Mr. Shepherdson. And companies can offset the higher costs. So outside of oil and gasoline, it is very difficult to predict what portion of commodity price increases will reach the consumer.

HEADLINE: A Capitalist Hero Keeps On Pitching;
The Corny Charm of Buffettpalooza

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
IF there's one thing that the thousands of pilgrims who made their way here last weekend would be loath to say about Warren E. Buffett, it's that he's shameless.
But it's true. No other American chief executive may be so plain-spoken or so masterful an investor. Nor does any other American chief executive do so many hokey things. 
 In the course of the annual, three-day gathering of investors in his company, Berkshire Hathaway -- a get-together that he has called the capitalists' Woodstock -- Mr. Buffett could be seen all over town. He donned an old-time baseball uniform to throw out the first pitch at a minor league game, to Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. (Mr. Buffett's number: 1/16, in homage to Wall Street and its stock fractions.) He also signed autographs outside Gorat's, his favorite steakhouse. He played bridge, "the official game of Berkshire Hathaway," at a local mall -- against a former world champion.
And during Berkshire's six-hour annual meeting here in Berkshire Hathaway's hometown last Monday, a session generally regarded as one of the best financial seminars conducted anywhere each year, Mr. Buffett ritualistically swigged Cherry Cokes and nibbled at See's candies and Dairy Queen ice cream bars -- all products of Berkshire holdings, all demonstrations of his penchant for concrete investments in things you can use every day.
Hucksterism? Of course. Mr. Buffett, 68, a kind of Will Rogers character with John D. Rockefeller's bank account, has mastered the art. But Berkshire Hathaway shareholders don't care. Like teen-agers at a marathon rock concert -- or, perhaps, religious devotees at a revival meeting -- some 15,000 of them came here to soak up his every word and gesture.
They waited in long lines wherever he went, simply to get their hero's signature on old photographs, annual reports he had written, ticket stubs, baseball caps, dollar bills or books. They shopped at Borsheim's jewelry store and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, Omaha businesses he bought for Berkshire because he thought their owners were brilliant merchants; they drove by the modest house that Mr. Buffett bought for $32,000 in 1958 and still calls home.
One visitor said he'd rather be in Omaha than at the Super Bowl. Another shareholder, Laurence Day of St. Louis, said he told his wife he preferred Omaha to Paris this time of year. And Richard Dejonckheere, a sports trainer from Belgium, remarked: "Like every good Moslem goes to Mecca, I come here. Every shareholder or capitalist should go one time to Omaha."
It is like this here every spring around the first Monday in May -- even in years, including this one, when Berkshire Hathaway stock is lagging behind the broader market and the investing world has been agog over technology companies instead of Mr. Buffett's favored consumer brands. After more than 30 years of whipping the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, his followers happily make allowances for Mr. Buffett's minor miscues.
"I'm not worried," said Frank Booker, an investor who came from St. Simons Island, Ga. "We've been through this before. And I don't know anyone else I'd rather have as the captain of my capital."
Partly, maybe mostly, such affection is fueled by the love of money. The faithful know that Mr. Buffett's investing catechism has generated astonishing returns. They can cite the figures by heart: a $10,000 investment in Berkshire in 1965 would be worth about $65 million today. Though the class A shares are up less than 10 percent this year, about half as much as the Dow Jones industrials, this follows a 50 percent increase for the shares in 1998.
But more is at work here. The pilgrims flock to Omaha because the huckster seems so sincere.
With his focus on the long term and his antipathy for the trendy, Mr. Buffett may be out of step with Wall Street and much of corporate America, they say. But he represents something they find wholesome, true and uniquely American. By all accounts he lives simply, well below his means and with few of the trappings of wealth. And in a marketplace crowded with whispering insiders, accountants' obfuscations and boosters happy to promote stocks at almost any price, he speaks directly to his shareholders, in language they can understand and with the kind of wit and wisdom they can appreciate.
In short, shareholders say they come each year because Mr. Buffett and Berkshire embody not just value investing but values. Study hard, he says. Search out sound advice. Know your limitations. And ask the right questions.
"It's a philosophy of investing and a philosophy of life," said Jeffrey Crohn, who came here from Mount Kisco, N.Y., for the Berkshire meeting with his wife, Kathleen, and left with a new bedroom set, television cabinet and patio furniture from the Nebraska Furniture Mart.
The Crohns, who say they have seven shares of Berkshire's class B stock -- the version that now sells for about $2,500 a share, versus the $77,000 price tag that keeps the original class A shares beyond the reach of most investors -- are now passing on those lessons to their children. "Buffett takes a very common-sense approach to life," Mr. Crohn said. "You achieve what you achieve through hard work and sound management."
 
Getting With the Program
There are moments during the Berkshire weekend when the Warren worship seems to get out of hand.
When Mr. Buffett stopped at Borsheim's, which was opened on Sunday just for shareholders, the store was mobbed, with shoppers spilling into the common area of the Regency Mall. Eager to record the moment, one woman yelled, "Honey, hurry up and take the picture!" as Mr. Buffett passed through. Later that evening, when he downed his trademark T-bone steak with a double order of hash browns at a shareholders' dinner at Gorat's, 200 others, lemming-like, ordered the identical meal, the manager said.
Even the news media grew idolatrous. During a two-hour news conference in which Mr. Buffett and Berkshire's vice chairman, Charles T. Munger, waxed poetic about investing, one reporter interrupted to say: "Mr. Buffett, I want to go to a warm and fuzzy place. I'm very taken with the fact that your shareholders are very taken with you." As the session ended, the gathered reporters broke, uncharacteristically, into applause.
Not long after, Marc Norton of The Louisville Courier-Journal, who had posed a serious question during the news conference, nabbed Mr. Buffett in the parking lot and asked him to pose for a picture.
"Here, I'll whisper a stock tip in your ear," Mr. Buffett said, and he jokingly pretended to do so just as the picture was snapped. "What did he say?" another reporter begged to know as Mr. Buffett disappeared.
Mr. Buffett has taken note of the frenzied rise of his profile. "There's no question the celebrity aspect has gotten played up," he told the reporters. "But Berkshire shareholders know what they own."
Besides the little companies he hawks so unabashedly, they own a huge insurance business, made up largely of Geico, which sells auto and other insurance directly to consumers, and General Re, a reinsurer that Mr. Buffett bought last year. And they share in Berkshire's storied portfolio of stocks: By investing in companies with rich consumer franchises like Coca-Cola, Gillette, Walt Disney, Washington Post and American Express, Mr. Buffett has made Berkshire -- a small company of which he gained control in 1965 -- into a company now worth $116 billion.
"This is a unique person in the history of capitalism," said Stevin R. Hoover, a money manager from Boston who has been a Berkshire shareholder since 1982 and was on his 10th trip to Omaha. "He's made most of us a lot of money."
Mr. Buffett's style of value investing, however, is largely out of fashion these days. And that has made Omaha -- and the figurative Omaha that exists wherever Berkshire shareholders reside -- a peculiar outpost in a financial world enamored of momentum trading, the latest hot new offering and Internet stocks valued at multiples of their losses, not their earnings.
But Mr. Buffett remains the world's second-richest man -- after only his friend William H. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft -- and is the architect of countless Berkshire fortunes. In fact, many people travel to Omaha simply to thank him for setting them on the road to riches -- riches that they also tend not to flaunt.
"We're millionaires, but who would know?" said Ernest Arvesen, 61, a retired banker from Atlanta. "Not our neighbors."
Not, that is, unless they looked in the closets and medicine cabinets of Mr. Buffett's devotees.
Mr. Day, the St. Louis investor, had his epiphany in 1982, when he was sitting on a beach in northern Michigan with a pile of Berkshire Hathaway annual reports. "I read them and I was totally absorbed," he recalled. "I said, My God, this is it." Now Mr. Day, 65, arranges his everyday life around Mr. Buffett's favorite stocks, living by the theory that the investor's sidekick, Mr. Munger, likes to call "eating your own cooking."
"I buy every one of Berkshire's products," Mr. Day said. "Gillette razors. Coke. And now I have Geico insurance." He recently was married -- and naturally, his wedding ring was bought at Borsheim's.
 
The Oracle Speaks
Most shareholders, however, say they come to Omaha not to buy Berkshire goods but to listen to Mr. Buffett's lengthy question-and-answer session at the annual meeting -- the formal raison d'etre for the weekend hoopla.
This year, they lined up as early as 4:30 A.M. outside the Aksarben (that's Nebraska, spelled backwards) Auditorium, which seats 14,000. And when the doors opened two and a half hours later, Mr. Buffett was there to greet those who rushed through the turnstiles.
The billionaire then hopped into his Lincoln Town Car and drove out through the parking lot, waving to a long line of shareholders waiting to enter the arena.
When everyone was in place, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger entered the packed auditorium to a standing ovation, in what shareholders describe as a kind of parting of the waters as the two made their way toward the stage.
The two men quickly ran through the official business of the company. And then -- when most annual meetings would abruptly be adjourned -- they opened the floor to questions, which they answered patiently, often with a good deal of wit, until 3:30 P.M.
(Actually, Mr. Buffett answered most of the questions, with occasional philosophical musings from the generally silent, seemingly lifeless Mr. Munger, whom Mr. Buffett introduced this way: "If you haven't figured it out, this hyperkinetic bundle of energy on my left is Charlie Munger.")
The shareholders asked about everything -- Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy, of course, and what the company would look like after his death. (He has already named successors, he said -- without naming names -- and "they'd be ready to take over tomorrow.")
They asked the personal, too. Was he interested in a career in music? (No, though he sang "Tomorrow" at a benefit performance of the musical "Annie" last year.)
What books would he recommend? "Personal History" (Knopf, 1997), the autobiography of Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post, and "Common Sense on Mutual Funds" (Wiley, 1999), by John C. Bogle, senior chairman and founder of the Vanguard Group.
Shareholders also posed pointed queries about specific investing decisions, including why Mr. Buffett chose to sell a large number of shares in McDonald's last year -- shares that later skyrocketed.
"It was a mistake," he said, repeating what he told shareholders in this year's annual report: "Over all, you would have been better off last year if I had regularly snuck off to the movies during market hours."
And they asked about the prospects for core Berkshire holdings like Coca-Cola, Gillette and Disney, whose chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, took a break on Monday from the ugly trial over his feud with a former company executive to visit the Main Street U.S.A. of Mr. Buffett's annual meeting.
All those stocks have badly trailed the market lately, but Mr. Buffett gave no hint of souring on any of them. About Coca-Cola, in which Berkshire had an 8 percent stake at the end of last year, he said, "Through the next 20 years, preference for Coke will do nothing but grow."
He steered away from stock recommendations or predications, however, though shareholders repeatedly encouraged a leak. Despite his occasional big bet on macroeconomic trends -- he bought 111 million ounces of silver in 1997, for example, expecting the price to soar with growing demand -- he declined to forecast interest rates or discuss the big economic picture. Mr. Buffett may sometimes seem like a hayseed, but he is not about to show other market players his hand.
Again and again, Mr. Buffett said that he doesn't pay attention to the everyday swings in the market: "We don't worry about the performance of the stock; we worry about the performance of the company." True to his habit of talking down Berkshire's prospects, he acknowledged difficulty in finding good values in a highly valued market, and the near impossibility of keeping a $100 billion company's value growing at 20 percent or more a year, as his investors have come to expect.
Some shareholders, nervously challenging their guru, asked why he didn't embrace the technology stocks that so many other investors look to for growth. Mr. Buffett said that while the technology revolution has changed the economic landscape, he doesn't know how to evaluate the long-term prospects of such stocks -- and that the values assigned many of them by the market indicate that other investors don't, either.
Taking bites from a Dairy Queen ice cream bar, Mr. Buffett said he simply buys what he knows, then offered a judgment he has no doubt debated over many bridge games with his friend Mr. Gates. "The Dilly Bar," he said with a smile, "is more certain to be around in 10 years than any single software application."

Long Shots and Shadows

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
I keep running into people who tell me that Al Gore can't or won't win the Presidency. These are ordinary voters, not politicians or people in the media. Most are right in step with Mr. Gore philosophically. But they are saying the same things everybody seems to be saying about the Vice President. He's a cardboard figure. Doesn't connect with people. Gives lousy speeches. Al Bore.
So I ask who they think will be the next President, and they say Bush. I ask why and I get silence. I ask if they know Bush's full name and most say George Bush Jr. I ask if they know what he's done as Governor of Texas and they haven't a clue. I ask if they know what his position is on guns, or abortion, or the war in the Balkans, and the reply is usually something like: "Hey, I'm not saying I'm for him or anything. I'm just saying Gore can't win and Bush probably can." 
 A number have also said Bill Bradley is looking pretty good.
Listen up. We know that anything can happen between now and November of next year. The economy could fall into a sinkhole. We could find out that George W. Bush, in his first crack at national office, has campaign skills that a Ronald Reagan or a John Kennedy would envy. Bill Bradley, somewhat vague to date, may turn his big themes into specific policies so irresistible he steals the Democratic nomination from Mr. Gore, demolishes whatever candidate the Republicans run against him, and becomes our tallest President.
Any of those things could happen. But don't bet a lot of money on it. Mr. Bush, for example, has already stumbled a couple of times in his early attempts to master the finer points of foreign policy. He recently referred to the Greeks as Grecians and the Kosovars as Kosovoians.
Al Gore may be a little stiff in front of the cameras, but he's smart, he's got tons of campaign cash and, most significantly, he's got an incredibly strong economy going for him.
The early polls? Return with us for a moment to that thrilling year, 1987. Vice President George Bush was gearing up for his run for the Presidency. E. J. Dionne Jr., then a reporter for The New York Times (he's now a columnist for The Washington Post), did a story about a Times poll and interviews with Republican Party leaders. He wrote:
"The poll and the party leaders suggested that Mr. Bush was seen by many Americans, even Republicans who like him, as somewhat boring, too loyal to President Reagan to be true to himself. He is respected for honesty but not for strength. He is viewed as a man who stirs feelings of trust but not passion."
That summer Mr. Bush trailed Michael Dukakis by some 18 points. That fall, John Harwood of The St. Petersburg Times wrote: "Bush's much-discussed image problem had gotten around. Several participants observed that Bush is 'weak' or 'doesn't have the charisma' that Reagan had displayed.' "
It's the price you pay for standing in the shadow of the Presidency. The price is even higher if the President is particularly popular or possesses extraordinary political skills. Emerging from the shadow can be tough.
Al Gore is not a charismatic or entertaining figure, and he has been hurt by Bill Clinton's reckless behavior.
"He seems tarnished somehow, I guess because he's been so loyal to Clinton," a woman told me last week. "It may not be fair, but that's the way I feel."
That same woman added, however, "I think he would be a good President."
The voters who are ambivalent about Al Gore are concerned largely with superficial matters, about whether he is stiff or boring or comforting or entertaining. Working in the Vice President's favor is the fact that most of those voters already believe he is capable of being a decent President, of leading the country in an era of breathtaking economic and technological change. And very few of those voters will be anxious to tinker with the economic escalator the country has been riding the last few years.
Al Gore is hardly a sure thing. But he's a sitting Vice President in exceptionally good economic times. Whatever the early polls are saying, the Presidency is his to lose. Bill Bradley, George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and all the rest are long shots by comparison.

HEADLINE: The World: Culture War;
What It Would Take To Cleanse Serbia

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
ALONG the blood-spattered timeline of Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia, Kosovo is merely the hideous Now. There was a Before -- in Croatia and Bosnia. Assuming that Mr. Milosevic retreats from Kosovo with his dictatorship intact, as now seems likely, Balkans experts foresee an unspeakable After.
It may feature: Fratricidal civil war in Montenegro. Ethnic cleansing of Hungarians in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. Mass murder of Muslims in the Sandzak region of Serbia. No need, for the moment, to bother about the location or correct pronunciation of these obscure places. The world will likely learn. Just as it learned where Kosovo is -- or was -- before more than 700,000 human beings were chased from their homes in a systematic military campaign of burning and intimidation, theft and murder. 
 If the pattern holds, Mr. Milosevic will soldier on, using Big Lie manipulation of television to tap into a collective soft spot in the Serbian psyche. Even as legions of non-Serbs are dispossessed or killed, he will continue to inflame the Serbs and preserve his power by reassuring them that, yes, they are the victims.
Given the character of Mr. Milosevic's regime and knowing that there is almost certainly more horror to come, a bold, if impractical, question is just now beginning to be formulated. Is it finally time for outside powers to make the effort necessary to cure a national psychosis inside Serbia that has been destabilizing a corner of Europe for a decade? Put another way, has the time come for NATO to do in Serbia what the Allies did in Germany and Japan after World II?
To follow that model, Serbia's military would have to be destroyed, and Mr. Milosevic crushed, by an invasion that almost certainly would cost the lives of hundreds of American soldiers. After unconditional surrender, the political, social and economic fabric of Serbia would be remade under outside supervision so that the Serbs could take their place in a prosperous and democratic world.
The question cuts three ways. Will it happen? Should it happen? Could it possibly work?
The answer to the first part of this question, at least for the foreseeable future, is a resounding No Way. The other answers, however, are provocative enough to make it worthwhile to suspend disbelief and indulge the fantasy of a post-Milosevic Balkans.
Let's start, though, with the real world. Policy makers and long-time students of the West's slow-motion intervention in Yugoslavia during the 1990's see no possibility of Mr. Milosevic's military defeat or of Serbia's occupation.
An agreement last week between the West and Russia outlined the kind of solution the outside powers would seek instead -- a withdrawal from Kosovo of the Yugoslav Army, police and paramilitary fighters, with an international security force to replace them. Details of the deal are still being argued over, but one thing was clear: If the outside powers can get him to sign on, Mr. Milosevic would remain in power in his shrinking Yugoslavia. Thus, he would have the opportunity to "cleanse" another day. The West's calculation seems to be that avoiding a land war, keeping NATO together and cementing relations with Russia outweigh the long-term costs of letting Mr. Milosevic off the hook.
That, then, is the real world.
Such a course does nothing, of course, to eradicate extreme Serb nationalism.
The only way to stamp out the disease, protect Serbia's minorities and bring lasting peace to the Balkans is a Japan- or Germany-style occupation of Serbia, according to Daniel Serwer, who until two years ago was the director of European intelligence and research for the State Department. Mr. Serwer concedes that occupation has never been on the West's list of serious options, but he echoes many experts on the Balkans when he argues that it should be.
"It is very hard to see how Serbia undergoes this process all on its own," said Mr. Serwer, now a fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a research group in Washington. "This regime is deeply rooted. It is not like some dictatorship that you take off its head and it will die. It is so corrupt and the corruption is not superficial."
Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, a Harvard historian who wrote "Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust," published a kind of manifesto last week that demands Serbia "be placed in receivership."
"Serbia's deeds are, in their essence, different from those of Nazi Germany only in scale," Mr. Goldhagen wrote in The New Republic. "Milosevic is not Hitler, but he is a genocidal killer who has caused the murders of many tens of thousands of people."
It is worth remembering, though, that Mr. Milosevic is an elected leader, having won three elections that were more or less fair. That, along with the Serb leader's soaring popularity in the wake of NATO bombing, support an argument that what ails Serbia goes far deeper than one man.
No one makes this argument more powerfully than Sonja Biserko, director of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia and a former senior advisor in the European department of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry. Ms. Biserko, who fled Belgrade a week after the NATO bombings began, said in New York last week that Serbia's fundamental problem is not Mr. Milosevic, but a "moral devastation" that has infected her nation.
"People in Serbia are undergoing a mass denial of the barbarity of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo," Ms. Biserko said. "This denial is itself commensurate to the crime taking place before the eyes of the world."
Ms. Biserko, who met 10 days ago with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and urged her to consider occupation, believes that Serbia's opposition politicians are incapable now of coming to grips with a culture of victimhood. "Serbs have managed now with the NATO bombing to convince themselves they are victims and as victims they cannot be responsible for what happened in Kosovo," she said.
ASURREAL sense of victimhood in Serbia is nothing new. During the siege of Sarajevo, when Serb forces ringed that city with artillery and routinely killed its civilians, Belgrade television reported that Bosnian Muslims were laying siege to themselves. "The Serbs continue to defend their centuries-old hills around Sarajevo," said Radio-Television Serbia.
To shatter this Looking Glass victimhood, Ms. Biserko offers a prescription: Indictment of Mr. Milosevic by the War Crimes Tribunal. A military defeat of Serbia and demilitarization of the country. Highly publicized trials that will force Serbs to confront the savagery committed in their name. A Western takeover of the mass media, with strict prohibitions against the dissemination of extreme Serb nationalism. A Marshall Plan for the Balkans.
Asked why the West should be willing to undertake an occupation that would risk many lives, cost billions and take years, Ms. Biserko shrugged: "What other choice is there?"
"The Western world has lost its political instinct," she said. "To bring substance to the ideals of human rights, at some point you must be willing to commit troops."
But could the occupation of Serbia work? Could it break the cycle of violence? Two prominent historians believe it could, if done properly.
"The key in Japan was unconditional surrender," said John W. Dower, a professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of "Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II." "The Americans went in and they did everything. They had a major land reform. They abolished the military, simply got rid of it. They drafted a new constitution. This is what you can do when you have unconditional surrender."
Mr. Dower was struck by the eagerness with which a defeated people welcomed reform. "In Japan the average person was really sick of war and I think that would be the case in Yugoslavia," he said. "The Americans cracked open a repressive military system and the people filled the space."
The occupation of Germany also suggests ways of dealing with Yugoslavia, according to Thomas Alan Schwartz, a historian at Vanderbilt and author of "America's Germany."
"When Germany was totally defeated, it provided opportunity," he said. "You could be physically there, controlling the flow of information and using war-crime trials to show the Germans that atrocities were done in their name."
Without something similar in Serbia, Mr. Schwartz said, "We can look forward to more trouble in Serbia.
"What reminds me of Germany is the comparison to the end of World War I," he added. "Then, the Germans had this powerful sense of being victims. There was a deep resentment that Hitler was able to exploit. It will be the same in Serbia when NATO bombing stops."
THE Japan and Germany analogies, of course, are flawed. Those major-league powers ravaged a part of the world that America cared about. Occupation was nothing less than emergency triage for the worst violence in history.
Mr. Milosevic, by comparison, is small potatoes. He leads a minor-league country that periodically lays waste to poor, unpronounceable, strategically irrelevant places. Pristina is not Paris.
There is, though, an inkling that the West has begun to try for a solution. In Bosnia, 32,000 NATO-led troops and High Commissioner Carlos Westendorp are even now doing the hard, slow, complex work of healing that country.
Mr. Westendorp has not attempted a Japan-style remake of the Serb-populated half of Bosnia (just as nobody has tried to do that in neighboring Croatia, with its own accomplishments in ethnic cleansing). The indicted war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have not been hunted down. Radical Serb parties have not been banned. But tough action is being taken. Mr. Westendorp ordered radical Serb nationalists out of state television. He has fired the nationalist zealot who was elected the Bosnian Serbs' president. If Serbs violently object to what the peacekeepers do, NATO-led forces shoot to kill.
In a recent interview in Sarajevo, Mr. Westendorp said most Bosnian Serbs are cooperating because they are sick of war. It will take time, he said, but the West has enough money and muscle in Bosnia to extinguish the will to war. The one insoluble problem, he said, was the leader in Belgrade.
"If getting rid of Milosevic fails," he said, "then everything fails."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Where Joblessness Is a Way of Making a Living

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
WHEN Olivier Blanchard, a liberal economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is asked why unemployment rates are higher in Europe than in the United States, he likes to tell audiences about a pamphlet he saw in a British library: "Leaving School: What You Need to Know About Social Security."
His point: Europe's cradle-to-grave safety net means not only that being out of work has become a viable way of making a living, but that there is no longer much stigma attached to joblessness. That goes a long way in explaining the contrast between America's current jobs boom and the contrasting jobs bust in Europe. 
 Not that long ago, the best and brightest young American economists were churning out papers with titles like, "Why Is U.S. Unemployment So High at Full Employment?" As recently as five years ago, slow job growth, downsizing and shrinking paychecks loomed large in America's psyche, and in 1992 Lester C. Thurow's book "Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, America and Europe," hailing the superiority of the European and Japanese economic models, was atop the best-seller lists.
Not any more. Today, American blacks, long afflicted by double-digit unemployment rates, are less likely to be out of work than Europeans. For the first time in memory, the United States jobless rate has dipped below that of Japan, where until recently lifetime employment was taken for granted. What's more, American pay and productivity are rising handily.
What's behind Americas jobs miracle? And why have long-time world beaters suddenly turned into apparent deadbeats?
Part of the answer is that America's economy is booming. A surprisingly tame inflation rate has allowed the Federal Reserve, which controls the amount of money in circulation and thus the spending power of companies that create jobs, to avoid raising interest rates -- even as joblessness has dropped to the lowest level in 30 years. The rate for April, released last week, barely inched up, from 4.2 percent to 4.3 percent.
Meanwhile, the economies of Japan and Europe are stagnating. Japan has been mired in a recession that's lasted about as long as America's eight-year expansion. While the stagnation was initially caused by a financial meltdown, says the economist Paul Krugman in his new book, "The Return of Depression Economics," the main problem now is that Japan's central bank, fearing inflation, is unwilling to pump enough money into the economy to lift spending -- and create jobs.
Tight monetary policy is also holding back job growth in Europe. "Alan Greenspan is willing to push the economy along until he sees inflation actually picking up," says Mr. Krugman, referring to the Federal Reserve chairman, "but the European Central Bank isn't giving unemployment a chance to get down."
But tight monetary policy isn't the main culprit in Europe. Rather, it's that various safety-net programs over the years have made not working a viable way of life, especially for young workers and those who are approaching retirement. Professor Blanchard and Justin Wolfers at Harvard University, co-authors of several studies of European labor markets, point to two especially pernicious institutions. One is the web of restrictions on layoffs. Even though these rules and regulations are no longer as numerous or effective as they were a decade ago -- Europe, like America, has discovered temps -- they are still powerful enough to have a chilling effect on companies' willingness to hire. As a result, workers who lose jobs find it very difficult to get new ones, and rising unemployment doesn't have the normal, healthy effect of reining in labor costs.
A bigger problem is the nature of unemployment benefits. Partly, it's their generosity. In Sweden, where the unemployment rate has jumped from a minuscule 1.4 percent to 5.6 percent in the last decade, unemployed workers can collect nearly 80 percent as much as if they were working, compared with about 50 percent in the United States and Japan. In Spain, it's 70 percent (until recently it was 90 percent) and in France it's nearly 60 percent.
The extent to which generous unemployment benefits inhibit job growth depends partly on the proportion of workers who are eligible: Only about one-third of workers who are out of work qualify for benefits in the United States and Japan, where newer members of the labor force and temporary workers are ineligible. Compare that with 89 percent of unemployed workers in Germany and 98 percent in France.
What matters even more is how long benefits can be collected. Unemployment benefits in Germany are equal to only 36 percent of a prior paycheck but an ex-worker can collect for at least five years. In Britain, unemployed people can collect practically forever. In the United States and Japan, by contrast, the limit is 26 weeks.
BUT if Europe's generous safety net is the key problem, how come it has taken so long for the chickens to come home to roost? After all, the welfare state has been in place since the 1950's and 60's, when full employment was the norm. One explanation, say Professor Blanchard and Mr. Wolfers, is that until the 70's there were few economic jolts like oil shocks that buffeted rich countries in 1973, 1979 and 1990. "Shocks displace people, but institutions like unemployment-benefit programs determine how many people get displaced and for how long," Mr. Wolfers said.
In Europe, many displaced workers stay out of work longer, and bad things happen when a large group of people stay out of the work force for a long time. Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard, says that reducing the stigma attached to joblessness has profound effects on the labor market. In Sweden, which combined extremely low joblessness with extremely generous welfare programs, someone who got laid off used to be ashamed to admit it to his or her neighbors. Now, with a new generation of workers less imbued with that work ethic, much of that shame has evaporated. There are other negative effects as well. Workers who don't get rehired fast also lose skills and, more importantly, connections. Since most hiring is by word of mouth, people who don't know others with jobs find it hard to get one themselves.
The flaws of the welfare state are compounded by other forms of government intervention, says Alan B. Krueger, an economist at Princeton University. One important reason American workers get hired at such surprising rates is that it's much easier to start new businesses in the United States. In Austria, Professor Krueger says, someone who wants to open a pharmacy must get permission from the other drugstores in town.
At the end of the day, it boils down to social choices. "One can say the Europeans have made a political decision that they are unwilling to tolerate as much income inequality as in the United States," Professor Katz said. "But equity comes at the cost of job creation."
Even today, men in their prime working years are not faring much worse in Europe or Japan than in the United States. But in America, which excels at absorbing new workers, other groups like the young, immigrants and women are faring much better. Now the American economy is absorbing workers with the least education and the fewest skills, including ones who have been out of the work force for years and written off as lost causes.
In Europe, choices made decades ago are preventing a similar expansion in the work force.

HEADLINE: The World;
A Land Of Tribes, Again

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
IN the nightly avalanche of television ads punctuating the Israeli election campaign, a commercial by a small Russian immigrant party stands out.
It is only in Russian. No Hebrew narration, no Hebrew subtitles; a message solely for the ears of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. 
 The unabashedly narrow appeal was a startling example of divisions that increasingly define Israeli society. Candidates tailor their messages to specific groups, fighting for the sympathies of ethnic voting blocs by promising to promote their particular agendas.
Ehud Barak, the Labor Party candidate for prime minister, features unemployed working-class Sephardic Jews in television ads that lambaste Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic performance. Mr. Netanyahu accuses Labor of elitism, charging that the party "doesn't represent the people: not the Sephardic Jews, not the Russian immigrants, not the ultra-Orthodox, not the Jewish settlers."
Such depictions of Israeli society as an aggregation of groups, not individuals, reflect a hardening of social divisions in recent years. More than ever, Israelis view each other as members of ideological, religious or ethnic sub-units, rather than as one society with shared values.
The vanishing of the notion of an Israeli melting pot, once expected to forge a new secular Zionist man and woman, has paralleled the growing ethnic assertivness of various groups in the United States, where many now focus on maintaining group identity rather than on integration into the American mainstream.
The social gaps in Israel have geographical expression. Many religious Zionists, following the pattern of ultra-Orthodox Jews, are increasingly living in separate neighborhoods and communities. Newcomers from Russia settle in what have become immigrant quarters of some Israeli cities, shopping in their own stores and reading their own Russian-language press; many Sephardic Jews remain in depressed "development towns" and in low-income housing projects.
The tribal trend is graphically evident among those Jews who are religious enough to wear a yarmulke (kippah in Hebrew) at all times. For these men, the size and color of the kippah can be an indicator of their religious and political bent. A black velvet kippah is typical of the followers of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party Shas. A knitted kippa often means the wearer is a religious nationalist, perhaps a Jewish settler. And the larger the kippah, the more religious or nationalist the wearer is likely to be.
Ethnic, religious and political differences increasingly overlap, reinforcing the divisions.
Most religious Israelis, especially the ultra-Orthodox, have aligned themselves firmly with the political right in recent years, putting them at odds with liberal, secular Israelis not only over questions of religion and state but also over ceding land for peace with the Arabs.
For decades, one of the most prominent social and political splits in Israel has been between Ashkenazic Jews -- those whose origins are in Central and Eastern Europe -- and Sephardic Jews, who are of Middle Eastern and North African origin. Now ethnic and religious tension appears to be building between the new Russian immigrants and the Sephardim.
Culturally apart, the two groups are also divided along religious lines, with the Russians avowedly secular and the Sephardim more traditionally observant.
The fissure has opened wide in the current campaign. Yisrael B'Aliyah, a party of Russian immigrants headed by Natan Sharansky, is publicly wrangling with Shas over control of the powerful Interior Ministry, which has long been a preserve of Shas. The ministry registers immigrants as Jews and grants them Israeli citizenship, and it has questioned the Jewish credentials of many arrivals from the former Soviet Union, blocking their marriage or burial as Jews, and even deporting some.
With the May 17 elections rapidly approaching, the splintering of Israeli society has produced a cacophony of campaign messages by 32 different parties competing for seats in the parliament. A multiplicity of voices is sometimes a sign of a healthy democracy, but that is not the way the babble is being interpreted here. Rather, commentators and analysts are struck by the tensions that they hear expressed.
"Not only are there many groups, but there are fewer points of connection between them and there is less of a chance for dialogue," said Dr. Asher Cohen of Bar-Ilan University. "In past decades there were areas of agreement that moderated the debate. Now the divisions overlap.""
Hannah Kim, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said recently: "In recent years we have been straddling the seam between multi-cultural pluralism and factionalism. Pluralism is enlightened, positive, democratic. Factionalism means the absence of a common bond uniting the whole society."
ISRAEL'S founders envisioned a state that would unify immigrants from far-flung Jewish communities in a liberal Western-style democracy. Instead, the proliferation of entrenched ideological, ethnic and religious factions seems to be closing many Israelis to the kind of open discourse in which their groups could integrate, and this reinforces their sense of isolation.
A stark example is the cocoonlike environment created by Shas, which is a broad social movement as well as a party, and whose followers include many traditional working-class Sephardic Jews who are not Orthodox. Guided by an ideology that scorns Western culture, the movement has its own newspaper and television broadcasts, and runs schools and youth programs that teach only religious subjects.
"Shas is against broad education and sees it as an enemy, so it is entrenching the poor in their poverty, not advancing them," said Ms. Kim.
Although it seeks to promote the ethnic pride of Jews from the Middle East and North Africa and has become a powerful political force, Shas has done little to break barriers to social mobility that have left many Sephardic Jews living in economically depressed communities with poor schools. And while Sephardic Israelis have reached the highest levels of government and the army, they are still under-represented in universities and the halls of economic power.
Their resentment, along with the restiveness of the Russian immigrants, are persistent themes of the Israeli election campaign, which has at times descended to name-calling and ethnic slurs. When the dust settles after May 17, Israelis will have to confront the scars left by the campaign and it will be a challenge to show that they can still talk to each other.
